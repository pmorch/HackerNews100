<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">In May 2021, a nurse at UnitedHealthcare called a colleague to share some welcome news about a problem the two had been grappling with for weeks.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">United provided the health insurance plan for students at Penn State University. It was a large and potentially lucrative account: lots of young, healthy students paying premiums in, not too many huge medical reimbursements going out.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">But one student was costing United a lot of money. Christopher McNaughton suffered from a crippling case of ulcerative colitis — an&nbsp;ailment that caused him to develop severe arthritis, debilitating diarrhea, numbing fatigue and life-threatening blood clots. His medical bills were running nearly $2 million a year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">United had flagged McNaughton’s case as a “high dollar account,” and the company was reviewing whether it needed to keep paying for the expensive cocktail of drugs crafted by a Mayo Clinic specialist that had brought McNaughton’s disease under control after he’d been through years of misery.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">On the 2021 phone call, which was recorded by the company, nurse Victoria Kavanaugh told her colleague that a doctor contracted by United to review the case had concluded that McNaughton’s treatment was “not medically necessary.” Her colleague, Dave Opperman, reacted to the news with a long laugh.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">“I knew that was coming,” said Opperman, who heads up a United subsidiary that brokered the health insurance contract between United and Penn State. “I did too,” Kavanaugh replied.</p>
        
    
                        <figure data-pp-id="9" data-pp-blocktype="audio">

            <p id="unitedhealthcare-employees-discuss-the-denial-of-christopher-mcnaughtons-claim">UnitedHealthcare Employees Discuss the Denial of Christopher McNaughton’s Claim</p>
                <p>David Opperman is an insurance broker who works for UnitedHealthcare. Victoria Kavanaugh is a nurse for United. In this recorded phone call from 2021, the two express relief that a doctor has turned down Penn State student Christopher McNaughton’s claim as “not medically necessary.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">Opperman then complained about McNaughton’s mother, whom he referred to as “this woman,” for “screaming and yelling” and “throwing tantrums” during calls with United. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.1">The pair agreed that any appeal of the United doctor’s denial of the treatment would be a waste of the family’s time and money. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.2">“We’re still gonna say no,” Opperman said.</p>
        
    
                    
            
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">More than 200 million Americans are covered by private health insurance. But data from state and federal regulators shows that insurers reject about 1 in 7 claims for treatment. Many people, faced with fighting insurance companies, simply give up: <a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/">One study</a> found that <a href="https://www.kff.org/private-insurance/issue-brief/claims-denials-and-appeals-in-aca-marketplace-plans/">Americans file formal appeals on only 0.1% of claims</a> denied by insurers under the Affordable Care Act.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Insurers have wide discretion in crafting what is covered by their policies, beyond some basic services mandated by federal and state law. They often deny claims for services that they deem not “medically necessary.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">When United refused to pay for McNaughton's treatment for that reason, his family did something unusual. They fought back with a lawsuit, which uncovered a trove of materials, including internal emails and tape-recorded exchanges among company employees. Those records offer an extraordinary behind-the-scenes look at how one of America's leading health care insurers relentlessly fought to reduce spending on care, even as its profits rose to record levels.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">As United reviewed McNaughton’s treatment, he and his family were often in the dark about what was happening or their rights. Meanwhile, United employees misrepresented critical findings and ignored warnings from doctors about the risks of altering McNaughton’s drug plan.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">At one point, court records show, United inaccurately reported to Penn State and the family that McNaughton’s doctor had agreed to lower the doses of his medication. Another time, a doctor paid by United concluded that denying payments for McNaughton’s treatment could put his health at risk, but the company buried his report and did not consider its findings. The insurer did, however, consider a report submitted by a company doctor who rubber-stamped the recommendation of a United nurse to reject paying for the treatment.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">United declined to answer specific questions about the case, even after McNaughton signed a release provided by the insurer to allow it to discuss details of his interactions with the company. United noted that it ultimately paid for all of McNaughton’s treatments. In a written response, United spokesperson Maria Gordon Shydlo wrote that the company’s guiding concern was McNaughton’s well-being.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">“Mr. McNaughton’s treatment involves medication dosages that far exceed FDA guidelines,” the statement said. “In cases like this, we review treatment plans based on current clinical guidelines to help ensure patient safety.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">But the records reviewed by ProPublica show that United had another, equally urgent goal in dealing with McNaughton. In emails, officials calculated what McNaughton was costing them to keep his crippling disease at bay and how much they would save if they forced him to undergo a cheaper treatment that had already failed him. As the family pressed the company to back down, first through Penn State and then through a lawsuit, the United officials handling the case bristled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">“This is just unbelievable,” Kavanaugh said of McNaughton’s family in one call to discuss his case. ”They’re just really pushing the envelope, and I’m surprised, like I don’t even know what to say.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="24.0">Now 31, McNaughton grew up in State College, Pennsylvania, just blocks from the Penn State campus. Both of his parents are faculty members at the university.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In the winter of 2014, McNaughton was halfway through his junior year at Bard College in New York. At 6 feet, 4 inches tall, he was a guard on the basketball team and had started most of the team’s games since the start of his sophomore year. He was majoring in psychology.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">When McNaughton returned to school after the winter holiday break, he started to experience frequent bouts of bloody diarrhea. After just a few days on campus, he went home to State College, where doctors diagnosed him with a severe case of ulcerative colitis.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">A chronic inflammatory bowel disease that causes swelling and ulcers in the digestive tract, ulcerative colitis has no cure, and ongoing treatment is needed to alleviate symptoms and prevent serious health complications. The majority of cases produce mild to moderate symptoms. McNaughton’s case was severe.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Treatments for ulcerative colitis include steroids and special drugs known as biologics that work to reduce inflammation in the large intestine.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">McNaughton, however, failed to get meaningful relief from the drugs his doctors initially prescribed. He was experiencing bloody diarrhea up to 20 times a day, with such severe stomach pain that he spent much of his day curled up on a couch. He had little appetite and lost 50 pounds. Severe anemia left him fatigued. He suffered from other conditions related to his colitis, including crippling arthritis. He was hospitalized several times to treat dangerous blood clots.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">For two years, in an effort to help alleviate his symptoms, he ate the same meals every day: Rice Chex cereal and scrambled eggs for breakfast, a cup of white rice with plain chicken breast for lunch and a similar meal for dinner, occasionally swapping in tilapia.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">His hometown doctors referred him to a specialist at the University of Pittsburgh, who tried unsuccessfully to bring his disease under control. That doctor ended up referring McNaughton to Dr. Edward Loftus Jr. at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which has been ranked as the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20348266">best gastroenterology hospital</a> in the country every year since 1990 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">For his first visit with Loftus in May 2015, McNaughton and his mother, Janice Light, charted hospitals along the 900-mile drive from Pennsylvania to Minnesota in case they needed medical help along the way.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Mornings were the hardest. McNaughton often spent several hours in the bathroom at the start of the day. To prepare for his meeting with Loftus, he set his alarm for 3:30 a.m. so he could be ready for the 7:30 a.m. appointment. Even with that preparation, he had to stop twice to use a bathroom on the five-minute walk from the hotel to the clinic. When they met, Loftus looked at McNaughton and told him that he appeared incapacitated. It was, he told the student, as if McNaughton were chained to the bathroom, with no outside life. He had not been able to return to school and spent most days indoors, managing his symptoms as best he could.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">McNaughton had tried a number of medications by this point, none of which worked. This pattern would repeat itself during the first couple of years that Loftus treated him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">In addition to trying to find a treatment that would bring McNaughton’s colitis into remission, Loftus wanted to wean him off the steroid prednisone, which he had been taking since his initial diagnosis in 2014. The drug is commonly prescribed to colitis patients to control inflammation, but prolonged use can lead to severe side effects including cataracts, osteoporosis, increased risk of infection and fatigue. McNaughton also experienced “moon face,” a side effect caused by the shifting of fat deposits that results in the face becoming puffy and rounder.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">In 2018, Loftus and McNaughton decided to try an unusual regimen. Many patients with inflammatory bowel diseases like colitis take a single biologic drug as treatment. Whereas traditional drugs are chemically synthesized, biologics are manufactured in living systems, such as plant or animal cells. A year’s supply of an individual biologic drug can cost up to $500,000. They are often given through infusions in a medical facility, which adds to the cost.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">McNaughton had tried individual biologics, and then two in combination, without much success. He and Loftus then agreed to try two biologic drugs together at doses well above those recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Prescribing drugs for purposes other than what they are approved for or at higher doses than those approved by the FDA is a common practice in medicine referred to as off-label prescribing. The federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality estimates <a href="https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/patient-involvement/off-label-drug-usage.html">1 in 5 prescriptions</a> written today are for off-label uses.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">There are drawbacks to the practice. Since some uses and doses of particular drugs have not been extensively studied, the risks and efficacy of using them off-label are not well known. Also, some drug manufacturers have improperly pushed off-label usage of their products to boost sales despite little or no evidence to support their use in those situations. Like many leading experts and researchers in his field, Loftus has been <a href="https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/physician/348">paid to do consulting</a> related to the biologic drugs taken by McNaughton. The payments related to those drugs have ranged from a total of $1,440 in 2020 to $51,235 in 2018. Loftus said much of his work with pharmaceutical companies was related to conducting clinical trials on new drugs.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">In cases of off-label prescribing, patients are depending upon their doctor’s expertise and experience with the drug.“In this case, I was comfortable that the potential benefits to Chris outweighed the risks,” Loftus said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">There was evidence that the treatment plan for McNaughton might work, including studies that had found dual biologic therapy to be efficacious and safe. The two drugs he takes, Entyvio and Remicade, have the same purpose — to reduce inflammation in the large intestine — but each works differently in the body. Remicade, marketed by Janssen Biotech, targets a protein that causes inflammation. Entyvio, made by Takeda Pharmaceuticals, works by preventing an excess of white blood cells from entering into the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">As for any suggestion by United doctors that his treatment plan for McNaughton was out of bounds or dangerous, Loftus said “my treatment of Chris was not clinically inappropriate — as was shown by Chris’ positive outcome.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">The unusual high-dose combination of two biologic drugs produced a remarkable change in McNaughton. He no longer had blood in his stool, and his trips to the bathroom were cut from 20 times a day to three or four. He was able to eat different foods and put on weight. He had more energy. He tapered off prednisone.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">“If you told me in 2015 that I would be living like this, I would have asked where do I sign up,” McNaughton said of the change he experienced with the new drug regimen.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">When he first started the new treatment, McNaughton was covered under his family’s plan, and all his bills were paid. McNaughton enrolled at the university in 2020. Before switching to United’s plan for students, McNaughton and his parents consulted with a health advocacy service offered to faculty members. A benefits specialist assured them the drugs taken by McNaughton would be covered by United.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">McNaughton joined the student plan in July 2020, and his infusions that month and the following month were paid for by United. In September, the insurer indicated payment on his claims was “pending,” something it did for his other claims that came in during the rest of the year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">McNaughton and his family were worried. They called United to make sure there wasn’t a problem; the insurer told them, they said, that it only needed to check his medical records. When the family called again, United told them it had the documentation needed, they said. United, in a court filing last year, said it received two calls from the family and each time indicated that all of the necessary medical records had not yet been received.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">In January 2021, McNaughton received a new explanation of benefits for the prior months. All of the claims for his care, beginning in September, were no longer “pending.” They were stamped “DENIED.” The total outstanding bill for his treatment was $807,086.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">When McNaughton’s mother reached a United customer service representative the next day to ask why bills that had been paid in the summer were being denied for the fall, the representative told her the account was being reviewed because of “a high dollar amount on the claims,” according to a recording of the call.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">With United refusing to pay, the family was terrified of being stuck with medical bills that would bankrupt them and deprive McNaugton of treatment that they considered miraculous. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.1">They turned to Penn State for help. Light and McNaughton’s father, David, hoped their position as faculty members would make the school more willing to intervene on their behalf.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.2">“After more than 30 years on faculty, my husband and I know that this is not how Penn State would want its students to be treated,” Light wrote to a school official in February 2021.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">In response to questions from ProPublica, Penn State spokesperson Lisa Powers wrote that “supporting the health and well-being of our students is always of primary importance” and that “our hearts go out to any student and family impacted by a serious medical condition.” The university, she wrote, does “not comment on students’ individual circumstances or disclose information from their records.” McNaughton offered to grant Penn State whatever permissions it needed to speak about his case with ProPublica. The school, however, wrote that it would not comment “even if confidentiality has been waived.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">The family appealed to school administrators. Because the effectiveness of biologics wanes in some patients if doses are skipped, McNaughton and his parents were worried about even a delay in treatment. His doctor wrote that if he missed scheduled infusions of the drugs, there was “a high likelihood they would no longer be effective.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">During a conference call arranged by Penn State officials on March 5, 2021, United agreed to pay for McNaughton’s care through the end of the plan year that August. Penn State immediately notified the family of the “wonderful news” while also apologizing for “the stress this has caused Chris and your family.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Behind the scenes, McNaughton’s review had “gone all the way to the top” at United’s student health plan division, Kavanaugh, the nurse, said in a recorded conversation.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">The family’s relief was short-lived. A month later, United started another review of McNaughton’s care, overseen by Kavanaugh, to determine if it would pay for the treatment in the upcoming plan year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">The nurse sent the McNaughton case to a company called <a href="https://www.mrioa.com/">Medical Review Institute of America</a>. Insurers often turn to companies like MRIoA to review coverage decisions involving expensive treatments or specialized care.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">Kavanaugh, who was assigned to a special investigations unit at United, let her feelings about the matter be known in a recorded telephone call with a representative of MRIoA.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">“This school apparently is a big client of ours,” she said. She then shared her opinion of McNaughton’s treatment. “Really this is a case of a kid who’s getting a drug way too much, like too much of a dose,” Kavanaugh said. She said it was “insane that they would even think that this is reasonable” and “to be honest with you, they’re awfully pushy considering that we are paying through the end of this school year.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">MRIoA sent the case to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikaspabby/">Dr. Vikas Pabby</a>, a gastroenterologist at UCLA Health and a professor at the university’s medical school. His May 2021 review of McNaughton’s case was just one of more than 300 Pabby did for MRIoA that month, for which he was paid $23,000 in total, according to a log of his work produced in the lawsuit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="69.0">In a May 4, 2021 report, Pabby concluded McNaughton’s treatment was not medically necessary, because United’s policies for the two drugs taken by McNaughton did not support using them in combination.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">Insurers spell out what services they cover in plan policies, lengthy documents that can be confusing and difficult to understand. Many policies, such as McNaughton’s, contain a provision that treatments and procedures must be “medically necessary” in order to be covered. The definition of medically necessary differs by plan. Some don’t even define the term. McNaughton’s policy contains a five-part definition, including that the treatment must be “in accordance with the standards of good medical policy” and “the most appropriate supply or level of service which can be safely provided.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Behind the scenes at United, Opperman and Kavanaugh agreed that if McNaughton were to appeal Pabby’s decision, the insurer would simply rule against him. “I just think it’s a waste of money and time to appeal and send it to another one when we know we’re gonna get the same answer,” Opperman said, according to a recording in court files. At Opperman’s urging, United decided to skip the usual appeals process and arrange for Pabby to have a so-called “peer-to-peer” discussion with Loftus, the Mayo physician treating McNaughton. Such a conversation, in which a patient’s doctor talks with an insurance company’s doctor to advocate for the prescribed treatment, usually only occurs after a customer has appealed a denial and the appeal has been rejected.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">When Kavanaugh called Loftus’ office to set up a conversation with Pabby, she explained it was an urgent matter and had been requested by McNaughton. “You know I’ve just gotten to know Christopher,” she explained, although she had never spoken with him. “We’re trying to advocate and help and get this peer-to-peer set up.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">McNaughton, meanwhile, had no idea at the time that a United doctor had decided his treatment was unnecessary and that the insurer was trying to set up a phone call with his physician. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.1">In the peer-to-peer conversation, Loftus told Pabby that McNaughton had “a very complicated case” and that lower doses had not worked for him, according to an internal MRIoA memo.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">Following his conversation with Loftus, Pabby created a second report for United. He recommended the insurer pay for both drugs, but at reduced doses. He added new language saying that the safety of using both drugs at the higher levels “is not established.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">When Kavanaugh shared the May 12 decision from Pabby with others at United, her boss responded with an email calling it “great news.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.1">Then Opperman sent an email that puzzled the McNaughtons.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">In it, Opperman claimed that Loftus and Pabby had agreed that McNaughton should be on significantly lower doses of both drugs. He said Loftus “will work with the patient to start titrating them down” — or reducing the dosage — “to a normal dose range.” Opperman wrote that United would cover McNaughton’s treatment in the coming year, but only at the reduced doses. Opperman did not respond to emails and phone messages seeking comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">McNaughton didn’t believe a word of it. He had already tried and failed treatment with those drugs at lower doses, and it was Loftus who had upped the doses, leading to his remission from severe colitis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">The only thing that made sense to McNaughton was that the treatment United said it would now pay for was dramatically cheaper — saving the company at least hundreds of thousands of dollars a year — than his prescribed treatment because it sliced the size of the doses by more than half.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">When the family contacted Loftus for an explanation, they were outraged by what they heard. Loftus told them that he had never recommended lowering the dosage. In a letter, Loftus wrote that changing McNaughton’s treatment “would have serious detrimental effects on both his short term and long term health and could potentially involve life threatening complications. This would ultimately incur far greater medical costs. Chris was on the doses suggested by United Healthcare before, and they were not at all effective.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">It would not be until the lawsuit that it would become clear how Loftus’ conversations had been so seriously misrepresented. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.1">Under questioning by McNaughton’s lawyers, Kavanaugh acknowledged that she was the source of the incorrect claim that McNaughton’s doctor had agreed to a change in treatment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">“I incorrectly made an assumption that they had come to some sort of agreement,” she said in a deposition last August. “It was my first peer-to-peer. I did not realize that that simply does not occur.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">Kavanaugh did not respond to emails and telephone messages seeking comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.1">When the McNaughtons first learned of Opperman’s inaccurate report of the phone call with Loftus, it unnerved them. They started to question if their case would be fairly reviewed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="84.0">“When we got the denial and they lied about what Dr. Loftus said, it just hit me that none of this matters,” McNaughton said. “They will just say or do anything to get rid of me. It delegitimized the entire review process. When I got that denial, I was crushed.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>A Buried Report</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">While the family tried to sort out the inaccurate report, United continued putting the McNaughton case in front of more company doctors.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">On May 21, 2021, United sent the case to one of its own doctors, Dr. Nady Cates, for an additional review. The review was marked “escalated issue.” Cates is a United medical director, a title used by many insurers for physicians who review cases. It is work he has been doing as an employee of health insurers since 1989 and at United since 2010. He has not practiced medicine since the early 1990s.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">Cates, in a deposition, said he stopped seeing patients because of the long hours involved and because “AIDS was coming around then. I was seeing a lot of military folks who had venereal diseases, and I guess I was concerned about being exposed.” He transitioned to reviewing paperwork for the insurance industry, he said, because “I guess I was a chicken.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">When he had practiced, Cates said, he hadn’t treated patients with ulcerative colitis and had referred those cases to a gastroenterologist.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">He said his review of McNaughton’s case primarily involved reading a United nurse’s recommendation to deny his care and making sure “that there wasn't a decimal place that was out of line.” He said he copied and pasted the nurse’s recommendation and typed “agree” on his review of McNaughton’s case.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Cates said that he does about a hundred reviews a week. He said that in his reviews he typically checks to see if any medications are prescribed in accordance with the insurer’s guidelines, and if not, he denies it. United’s policies, he said, prevented him from considering that McNaughton had failed other treatments or that Loftus was a leading expert in his field.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">“You are giving zero weight to the treating doctor’s opinion on the necessity of the treatment regimen?” a lawyer asked Cates in his deposition. He responded, “Yeah.” </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.1">Attempts to contact Cates for comment were unsuccessful.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="93.0">At the same time Cates was looking at McNaughton’s case, yet another review was underway at MRIoA. United said it sent the case back to MRIoA after the insurer received the letter from Loftus warning of the life-threatening complications that might occur if the dosages were reduced.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">On May 24, 2021, the new report requested by MRIoA arrived. It came to a completely different conclusion than all of the previous reviews.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">Dr. Nitin Kumar, a gastroenterologist in Illinois, concluded that McNaughton’s established treatment plan was not only medically necessary and appropriate but that lowering his doses “can result in a lack of effective therapy of Ulcerative Colitis, with complications of uncontrolled disease (including dysplasia leading to colorectal cancer), flare, hospitalization, need for surgery, and toxic megacolon.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">Unlike other doctors who produced reports for United, Kumar discussed the harm that McNaughton might suffer if United required him to change his treatment. “His disease is significantly severe, with diagnosis at a young age,” Kumar wrote. “He has failed every biologic medication class recommended by guidelines. Therefore, guidelines can no longer be applied in this case.” He cited six studies of patients using two biologic drugs together and wrote that they revealed no significant safety issues and found the therapy to be “broadly successful.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="98.0">When Kavanaugh learned of Kumar’s report, she quickly moved to quash it and get the case returned to Pabby, according to her deposition.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="99.0">In a recorded telephone call, Kavanaugh told an MRIoA representative that “I had asked that this go back through Dr. Pabby, and it went through a different doctor and they had a much different result.” After further discussion, the MRIoA representative agreed to send the case back to Pabby. “I appreciate that,” Kavanaugh replied. “I just want to make sure, because, I mean, it’s obviously a very different result than what we’ve been getting on this case.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="100.0">MRIoA case notes show that at 7:04 a.m. on May 25, 2021, Pabby was assigned to take a look at the case for the third time. At 7:27 a.m., the notes indicate, Pabby again rejected McNaughton’s treatment plan. While noting it was “difficult to control” McNaughton’s ulcerative colitis, Pabby added that his doses “far exceed what is approved by literature” and that the “safety of the requested doses is not supported by literature.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="101.0">In a deposition, Kavanaugh said that after she opened the Kumar report and read that he was supporting McNaughton’s current treatment plan, she immediately spoke to her supervisor, who told her to call MRIoA and have the case sent back to Pabby for review.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="102.0">Kavanaugh said she didn’t save a copy of the Kumar report, nor did she forward it to anyone at United or to officials at Penn State who had been inquiring about the McNaughton case. “I didn’t because it shouldn’t have existed,” she said. “It should have gone back to Dr. Pabby.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="103.0">When asked if the Kumar report caused her any concerns given his warning that McNaughton risked cancer or hospitalization if his regimen were changed, Kavanaugh said she didn’t read his full report. “I saw that it was not the correct doctor, I saw the initial outcome and I was asked to send it back,” she said. Kavanaugh added, “I have a lot of empathy for this member, but it needed to go back to the peer-to-peer reviewer.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">In a court filing, United said Kavanaugh was correct in insisting that Pabby conduct the review and that MRIoA confirmed that Pabby should have been the one doing the review.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">The Kumar report was not provided to McNaughton when his lawyer, <a href="https://gesklaw.com/attorney/jonathan-m-gesk/">Jonathan Gesk</a>, first asked United and MRIoA for any reviews of the case. Gesk discovered it by accident when he was listening to a recorded telephone call produced by United in which Kavanaugh mentioned a report number Gesk had not heard before. He then called MRIoA, which confirmed the report existed and eventually provided it to him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">Pabby asked ProPublica to direct any questions about his involvement in the matter to MRIoA. The company did not respond to questions from ProPublica about the case. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">When McNaughton enrolled at Penn State in 2020, it brought a sense of normalcy that he had lost when he was first diagnosed with colitis. He still needed monthly hours-long infusions and suffered occasional flare-ups and symptoms, but he was attending classes in person and living a life similar to the one he had before his diagnosis.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="109.0">It was a striking contrast to the previous six years, which he had spent largely confined to his parents’ house in State College. The frequent bouts of diarrhea made it difficult to go out. He didn’t talk much to friends and spent as much time as he could studying potential treatments and reviewing ongoing clinical trials. He tried to keep up with the occasional online course, but his disease made it difficult to make any real progress toward a degree.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">United, in correspondence with McNaughton, noted that its review of his care was “not a treatment decision. Treatment decisions are made between you and your physician.” But by threatening not to pay for his medications, or only to pay for a different regimen, McNaughton said, United was in fact attempting to dictate his treatment. From his perspective, the insurer was playing doctor, making decisions without ever examining him or even speaking to him.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">The idea of changing his treatment or stopping it altogether caused constant worry for McNaughton, exacerbating his colitis and triggering physical symptoms, according to his doctors. Those included a large ulcer on his leg and welts under his skin on his thighs and shin that made his leg muscles stiff and painful to the point where he couldn’t bend his leg or walk properly. There were daily migraines and severe stomach pain. “I was consumed with this situation,” McNaughton said. “My path was unconventional, but I was proud of myself for fighting back and finishing school and getting my life back on track. I thought they were singling me out. My biggest fear was going back to the hell.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">McNaughton said he contemplated suicide on several occasions, dreading a return to a life where he was housebound or hospitalized.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">McNaughton and his parents talked about him possibly moving to Canada where his grandmother lived and seeking treatment there under the nation’s government health plan. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.1">Loftus connected McNaughton with a psychologist who specializes in helping patients with chronic digestive diseases.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">The psychologist, Tiffany Taft, said McNaughton was not an unusual case. About 1 in 3 patients with diseases like colitis suffer from medical trauma or PTSD related to it, she said, often the result of issues related to getting appropriate treatment approved by insurers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">“You get into hopelessness,” she said of the depression that accompanies fighting with insurance companies over care. “They feel like ‘I can’t fix that. I am screwed.’ When you can’t control things with what an insurance company is doing, anxiety, PTSD and depression get mixed together.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">In the case of McNaughton, Taft said, he was being treated by one of the best gastroenterologists in the world, was doing well with his treatment and then was suddenly notified he might be on the hook for nearly a million dollars in medical charges without access to his medications. “It sends you immediately into panic about all these horrific things that could happen,” Taft said. The physical and mental symptoms McNaughton suffered after his care was threatened were “triggered” by the stress he experienced, she said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">In early June 2021, United informed McNaughton in a letter that it would not cover the cost of his treatment regimen in the next academic year, starting in August. The insurer said it would only pay for a treatment plan that called for a significant reduction in the doses of the drugs he took.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">United wrote that the decision came after his “records have been reviewed three times and the medical reviewers have concluded that the medication as prescribed does not meet the Medical Necessity requirement of the plan.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">In August 2021, McNaughton filed a federal lawsuit accusing United of acting in bad faith and unreasonably making treatment decisions based on financial concerns and not what was the best and most effective treatment. It claims United had a duty to find information that supported McNaughton’s claim for treatment rather than looking for ways to deny coverage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">United, in a court filing, said it did not breach any duty it owed to McNaughton and acted in good faith. On Sept. 20, 2021, a month after filing the lawsuit, and with United again balking at paying for his treatment, McNaughton asked a judge to grant a temporary restraining order requiring United to pay for his care. With the looming threat of a court hearing on the motion, United quickly agreed to cover the cost of McNaughton’s treatment through the end of the 2021-2022 academic year. It also dropped a demand requiring McNaughton to settle the matter as a condition of the insurer paying for his treatment as prescribed by Loftus, according to an email sent by United’s lawyer.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">It is not surprising that insurers are carefully scrutinizing the care of patients treated with biologics, which are among the most expensive medications on the market. Biologics are considered specialty drugs, a class that includes the best-selling Humira, used to treat arthritis. Specialty drug spending in the U.S. is expected to reach $505 billion in 2023, according to an estimate from Optum, United’s health services division. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, a nonprofit that analyzes the value of drugs, found in 2020 that the biologic drugs used to treat patients like McNaughton are <a href="https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ICER_UC_Final_Evidence_Report_101620.pdf">often effective but overpriced</a> for their therapeutic benefit. To be judged cost-effective by ICER, the biologics should sell at a steep discount to their current market price, the panel found.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="126.0">A panel convened by ICER to review its analysis cautioned that insurance coverage “should be structured to prevent situations in which patients are forced to choose a treatment approach on the basis of cost.” ICER also found examples where insurance company policies failed to keep pace with updates to clinical practice guidelines based on emerging research.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">United officials did not make the cost of treatment an issue when discussing McNaughton’s care with Penn State administrators or the family.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">Bill Truxal, the president of UnitedHealthcare StudentResources, the company’s student health plan division, told a Penn State official that the insurer wanted the “best for the student” and it had “nothing to do with cost,” according to notes the official took of the conversation.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">Behind the scenes, however, the price of McNaughton’s care was front and center at United.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="130.0">In one email, Opperman asked about the cost difference if the insurer insisted on only paying for greatly reduced doses of the biologic drugs. Kavanaugh responded that the insurer had paid $1.1 million in claims for McNaughton’s care as of the middle of May 2021. If the reduced doses had been in place, the amount would have been cut to $260,218, she wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="131.0">United was keeping close tabs on McNaughton at the highest levels of the company. On Aug. 2, 2021, Opperman notified Truxal and a United lawyer that McNaughton “has just purchased the plan again for the 21-22 school year.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="132.0">A month later, Kavanaugh shared another calculation with United executives showing that the insurer spent over $1.7 million on McNaughton in the prior plan year.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="133.0">United officials strategized about how to best explain why it was reviewing McNaughton’s drug regimen, according to an internal email. They pointed to a justification often used by health insurers when denying claims. “As the cost of healthcare continues to climb to soaring heights, it has been determined that a judicious review of these drugs should be included” in order to “make healthcare more affordable for our members,” Kavanaugh offered as a potential talking point in an April 23, 2021, email.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="135.0">Three days later, UnitedHealth Group filed an annual statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing its pay for top executives in the prior year. Then-CEO David Wichmann was paid $17.9 million in salary and other compensation in 2020. Wichmann retired early the following year, and his total compensation that year exceeded $140 million, according to calculations in a <a href="https://www.startribune.com/former-unitedhealth-ceo-made-142-2m-last-year/600171979/">compensation database</a> maintained by the Star Tribune in Minneapolis. The newspaper said the amount was the most paid to an executive in the state since it started tracking pay more than two decades ago. About $110 million of that total came from Wichmann exercising stock options accumulated during his stewardship.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="136.0">The McNaughtons were well aware of the financial situation at United. They looked at publicly available financial results and annual reports. Last year, United reported a profit of $20.1 billion on revenues of $324.2 billion.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="137.0">When discussing the case with Penn State, Light said, she told university administrators that United could pay for a year of her son’s treatment using just minutes’ worth of profit.</p>

In October, United notified him it was once again reviewing his care, although the insurer quickly reversed course when his lawyer intervened.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="140.0">McNaughton said he is fortunate his parents were employed at the same school he was attending, which was critical in getting the attention of administrators there. But that help had its limits.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="140.1">In June 2021, just a week after United told McNaughton it would not cover his treatment plan in the upcoming plan year, Penn State essentially walked away from the matter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="141.0">In an email to the McNaughtons and United, Penn State Associate Vice President for Student Affairs Andrea Dowhower wrote that administrators “have observed an unfortunate breakdown in communication” between McNaughton and his family and the university health insurance plan, “which appears from our perspective to have resulted in a standstill between the two parties.” While she proposed some potential steps to help settle the matter, she wrote that “Penn State’s role in this process is as a resource for students like Chris who, for whatever reason, have experienced difficulty navigating the complex world of health insurance.” The university’s role “is limited,” she wrote, and the school “simply must leave” the issue of the best treatment for McNaughton to “the appropriate health care professionals.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="142.0">In a statement, a Penn State spokesperson wrote that “as a third party in this arrangement, the University’s role is limited and Penn State officials can only help a student manage an issue based on information that a student/family, medical personnel, and/or insurance provider give — with the hope that all information is accurate and that the lines of communication remain open between the insured and the insurer.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="144.0">Penn State declined to provide financial information about the plan. However, the university and United share at least one tie that they have not publicly disclosed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="145.0">When the McNaughtons first reached out to the university for help, they were referred to the school’s student health insurance coordinator. The official, Heather Klinger, wrote in an email to the family in February 2021 that “I appreciate your trusting me to resolve this for you.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="146.0">In April 2022, United began paying Klinger’s salary, an arrangement which is not noted on the university website. Klinger appears in the online staff directory on the Penn State University Health Services webpage, and has a university phone number, a university address and a Penn State email listed as her contact. The school said she has maintained a part-time status with the university to allow her to access relevant data systems at both the university and United.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.0">The university said students “benefit” from having a United employee to handle questions about insurance coverage and that the arrangement is “not uncommon” for student health plans.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.1">The family was dismayed to learn that Klinger was now a full-time employee of United. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="147.2">“We did feel betrayed,” Light said. Klinger did not respond to an email seeking comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="148.0">McNaughton’s fight to maintain his treatment regimen has come at a cost of time, debilitating stress and depression. “My biggest fear is realizing I might have to do this every year of my life,” he said.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="150.0">McNaughton said one motivation for his lawsuit was to expose how insurers like United make decisions about what care they will pay for and what they will not. The case remains pending, a court docket shows.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="151.0">He has been accepted to Penn State’s law school. He hopes to become a health care lawyer working for patients who find themselves in situations similar to his. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="151.1">He plans to reenroll in the United health care plan when he starts school next fall.</p>

    <div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>We were recently notified by a reader that [Tom Evans] had filed a copyright claim against [Mark]’s repair video on his&nbsp;<em>Mend it Mark</em> YouTube channel, taking down said repair video as well as [Mark]’s delightful commentary. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPIrCaeVtvI" target="_blank">new video, [Mark] comments</a> on this takedown and the implications. The biggest question is what exactly was copyrighted in the original video, which was tough because YouTube refused to pass on [Mark]’s questions or provide further details.</p>
<p>In this new video the entire repair is summarized once again using props instead of the actual pre-amp, which you can still catch a glimpse of in <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/11/14/repairing-the-questionable-25000-tom-evans-audiophile-pre-amp/">our earlier coverage</a> of the repair. To summarize, there was one bad tantalum capacitor that caused issues for one channel, and the insides of this twenty-five thousand quid pre-amp looks like an artistic interpretation of a Jenga tower using PCBs. We hope that this new video does stay safe from further copyright strikes from an oddly vengeful manufacturer after said manufacturer event sent the defective unit to [Mark] for a repair challenge.</p>
<p>Since this purportedly ‘audiophile-level’ pre-amplifier uses no special circuits or filtering – just carefully matched opamps – this is one of those copyright strike cases that leave you scratching your head.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://photostatic.shreyans.org/diary/20240925-smoosh-v2.jpg">
<br></p>
<p><strong>Arrival</strong></p>
<p>Do you remember falling in love for the first time? I remember that week. I remember listening to songs I already knew but <em>understanding</em> them for the first time. I remember walking down the street with this secret almost bursting out of me. I remember feeling a little more connected to the human experience and to everyone around me.</p>
<p>Fatherhood feels like this. In the weeks after Theo was born, I would walk to the store and barely be able to contain myself. 'I have witnessed a miracle! I saw my wife give birth to our son! She <em>made</em> a person and that person is in the world with us!' I looked the same as the week before, but was fundamentally changed. My parents, all parents, made more sense to me.</p>
<p>It's a surreal thing, to have a child. When I'm not in a room with him, I sometimes remember with a startle that there's a part of me somewhere else. In the first week home, Kate and I would sit in bed as we had a thousand times before and would look between us and be shocked that there was a whole new person in that space. Life, multiplied.</p>
<p>Watching the birth of a child is surreal too. Seeing the top of his head while it was still in the darkness inside Kate. Seeing his tiny head emerge, resting just outside her in between pushes. Watching the placenta be pulled out and cutting the rubbery cord that had fed him for the last 9 months, bringing him with finality into our waking world. We all came out like this. This is how it has always happened. Insane.</p>
<p><img src="https://photostatic.shreyans.org/diary/2024-09-21-4am.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Survival</strong></p>
<p>One day later, we returned home with this new life, and while I expected many things to change, I didn't expect time itself to feel different. The days doubled in length because we were awake every night; days blended into each other so the concept of a week disappeared; Theo changed so much from day to day and there was such a constant stream of questions that weeks felt like months, and these last two months have felt like a year.</p>
<p>Other parents had warned us that when we had questions, everyone would share their pet parenting advice and we'd have to get good at taking what we needed and discarding the rest. What they hadn't said was that most of the confusion would come from within. When everything seems so consequential, it's tempting to look it all up, and in the first days I did. But life with Theo became more bearable when I started to believe two things: that a few foundational practices would make a bigger difference for him than most of the details, and that we already knew a lot of what we needed, and should take a deep breath and follow our instincts.</p>
<p>My mother came in with a great tip: when in doubt, ask second time parents, not other first timers. Replace frazzled guesswork with earned perspective. When I stressed about the exact boiling and sterilization process for the first formula bottles, I asked a second time mom what she does and she...just uses tap water. </p>
<p>Feeding was the biggest hurdle in those early weeks. The official literature focuses entirely on breastfeeding (and would only provide a narrow set of 'correct' answers for most situations, e.g. co-sleeping). The likelihood of great health outcomes with formula - missing. How to choose a formula - irrelevant. The physical pain of pumping every 3 hours and the emotional toll of taking time away from bonding - not mentioned.</p>
<p>Feeding ourselves, thankfully, was taken care of by parents and friends. If someone you know just had a baby and you want to support them, send them fresh meals. If you're in the thick of it, ask. People want to help and leaning on relationships brings joy and gives life to all involved.</p>
<p><img src="https://photostatic.shreyans.org/diary/2024-10-theo-fam.jpeg"></p>
<p><strong>Transformations</strong></p>
<p>Within a few weeks, we found our groove, and then the bigger changes started to emerge. The first one: he got cute. And hilarious. Indonesians get it: there's one word, lucu, that means both cute and funny. And the cuter Theo got the more I found myself laughing out loud at him. He squeaks, he squirms, and he farts when I pick him up after a nap. Finding babies funny is probably a useful survival mechanism for an overworked parent.</p>
<p>Cuteness aside, I've felt beautiful emotions I had not known before. Looking down at his sleeping face after he passes out in my arms produces the purest sensation of love that I have ever felt, and watching him follow my face and let out a smile is exhilarating every time. The world affects me differently too. I watched the Apple hearing aid ad twice and cried both times, imagining our life as a family unfolding.</p>
<p>A friend asked me what I want to teach Theo, and I told him about a letter I had started writing, to be delivered in 15 years, for which I compiled a long list of advice on how to live a rich and beautiful life. Somewhere along the way I stopped and asked myself, "wait, am <em>I</em> doing these things?" The main way Theo will learn how to be is by watching Kate and me, so whatever it is I want him to learn - I need to live it first.</p>
<p>That was the second thing Theo taught me. The first thing he taught me, at 430am in his first week, when he wouldn't stop crying, as a rage started bubbling up in me, was that no amount of urging, forcing, or frustration will get this tiny baby to do what I want him to do. All I can do is surrender and listen; find peace and meet him from a place of equanimity. Then maybe I'll have the presence of mind to change the wet diaper that was making him cry.</p>
<p>"Surrender" is, I've been told, quite a powerful idea for parenting. So much is out of our hands: the timing of the birth, their health at birth, their temperament, whether or not they will latch. Needing to control these uncontrollable things can drive you and the child mad. Surrender to the situation. Save your energy for after it happens so you can deal with it.</p>
<p>He taught me another thing in the quiet of the night as I fed him in silence. He was barely awake. I was in the dark. Naturally I reached for my phone. But the glare of the screen, his confused little face, and the thought of Kate's disapproval - all made me put it down. And after a few minutes passed I started to...think. I thought about what meals we should cook that week. I thought about how AI makes wearables more interesting. I wrote paragraphs of this piece in my head. That time remained quiet on the outside but became rich and dynamic inside.</p>
<p>The constant changes in Theo - new expressions and sounds and ways he can use his body - bring awe but also a strange sadness. We love to see him do new things but are always aware that the way he is today is fleeting and he'll be a new boy next week, and again the week after that, and we can't hold on to any version of him for too long. We've got to love it when we have it, with no expectation of constancy.</p>
<p>There's a lot to look forward to in his changes though. I've heard parents talk about re-living their own childhoods by watching their kids go through all the firsts - foods and music and places and feelings. My last sleepover with my middle school friends was a long time ago but Theo has hundreds of late-night messy-room take-over-the-living-room nights with his friends ahead of him, and I can't wait to see that happen.</p>
<p><img src="https://photostatic.shreyans.org/diary/20241026-me-theo-2-1.jpg"></p>
<p>Early parenting is all-consuming, so it's easy to forget yourself in it, and it's even easier to forget your partner. Divorces turn out to be very common right after a baby is born. Your time disappears, boundaries get drawn too tightly or not at all, and things snap. Kate and I took it on as a challenge to become the best versions of ourselves through this, to expand not contract, to enrich our lives with each other and welcome Theo into that, as opposed to making him the center of our world.</p>
<p>Some of this is a matter of perspective. I thought I knew my wife, but I now see that she's more than I knew. The way she sweetly talks to him while changing him, the songs she makes up and sings while feeding him, her confidence when holding or soothing him, and her wisdom around what matters and what doesn't - they're revealing parts of her soul and character that I hadn't seen before, and I'm glad my eyes are open to them.</p>
<p>Thanks to Theo I've also gotten to know my parents better. Two months of working on a shared project has shown me more about them than any 2 week vacation in the last 20 years. We've discussed life philosophies and laughed about me becoming like them, I've seen them socialize as peers with my friends, and I've loved seeing how much they love and care for Theo. They gave me the life, I gave them Theo, and Theo gave us time together.</p>
<p>Babies are a gift to the world. They're a love letter to our families and to the future. They're an expression of hope and determined optimism. If one can look through the haze, they can provide purpose and clarity. They force you to ask and answer some big questions. None of this comes easily.</p>
<p>For me, Theo has been a force for strength, discipline, and bigger, bolder dreams.
Having a baby at 41 makes me think a lot about the strength of my body, which has to be fortified before it's too late. When he's 20 I'll be 61, and I'd like to still win a game or two of tennis against him. </p>
<p>More than that it makes me think about time. Because we've decided that we want life to expand, not contract, the only way to reconcile that with the time cost of childcare is to be very thoughtful about how every bit of time gets spent. There's small wins like not taking the phone to the bathroom or finally using the dishwasher, bigger ones like only taking on truly important tasks at work or at home, or the biggest one: realizing that if there's something we <em>eventually</em> want to do, we should find a way to <em>do it now</em>. Discipline feels like a muscle to exercise, and when practices layer on top of each other it eventually starts to feel true that sometimes "it's easier to do more than less."</p>
<p>This moment is both the beginning of a grand new adventure, and a continuation of one (or two). The dreams Kate and I have had haven't diminished, they've sharpened and evolved and somehow, with a little nudge from his tiny hands, they've started to matter more.</p>
<p>Thanks Theo.</p>

<p>Syrian Prime Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali said the government was ready to “extend its hand” to the opposition and turn its functions over to a transitional government.</p><p>“I am in my house and I have not left, and this is because of my belonging to this country,” Jalili said in a video statement. He said he would go to his office to continue work in the morning and called on Syrian citizens not to deface public property.</p>



<p>He did not address reports that Assad had fled.</p><p>Rami Abdurrahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights told The Associated Press that Assad took a flight Sunday from Damascus.</p>
    
    
    
<p>State television in Iran, Assad’s main backer in the years of war in Syria, reported that Assad had left the capital. It cited Qatar’s Al Jazeera news network for the information and did not elaborate.</p><p>There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

            </div><p>As daylight broke over Damascus, crowds gathered to pray in the city’s mosques and to celebrate in the squares, chanting “God is great.” People also chanted anti-Assad slogans and honked car horns. In some areas, celebratory gunshots rang out.</p>
    

<p>Soldiers and police officers left their posts and fled, and looters broke into the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense.</p><p>“My feelings are indescribable,” said Omar Daher, a 29-year-old lawyer. “After the fear that he (Assad) and his father made us live in for many years, and the panic and state of terror that I was living in, I can’t believe it.”</p><p>Daher said his father was killed by security forces and his brother was in detention, his fate unknown. Assad “is a criminal, a tyrant and a dog,” he said.”</p><p>“Damn his soul and the soul of the entire Assad family,” said Ghazal al-Sharif, another reveler in central Damascus. “It is the prayer of every oppressed person and God answered it today. We thought we would never see it, but thank God, we saw it.”</p><p>The police headquarters in the capital appeared to be abandoned, its door left ajar with no officers outside. An Associated Press journalist shot footage of an abandoned army checkpoint where uniforms were discarded on the ground under a poster of Assad’s face. Footage broadcast on opposition-linked media showed a tank in one of the capital’s central squares.</p>
    

<p>It was the first time opposition forces had reached Damascus since 2018, when Syrian troops recaptured areas on the outskirts of the capital following a yearslong siege.</p><p>The pro-government Sham FM radio reported that the Damascus airport had been evacuated and all flights halted.</p><div data-align-center="">

Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which at one point sent thousands of fighters to shore up Assad’s forces, has been weakened by a yearlong conflict with Israel.

The resolution calls for the establishment of a transitional governing body, followed by the drafting of a new constitution and ending with U.N.-supervised elections.</p><p>Later Saturday, foreign ministers and senior diplomats from eight key countries, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, Egypt, Turkey and Iran, along with Pederson, gathered on the sidelines of the Doha Summit to discuss the situation in Syria.</p><p>In a statement, the participants affirmed their support for a political solution to the Syrian crisis “that would lead to the end of military activity and protect civilians.”</p><h2>The insurgents’ march</h2><p>A commander with the insurgents, Hassan Abdul-Ghani, posted on the Telegram messaging app that opposition forces had begun the “final stage” of their offensive by encircling Damascus.</p><div data-align-fullwidth="">

  <div>
    <h3>Never leave the keyboard with powerful link hinting.</h3>
    <p>Speed up the process as you follow
      links with your keyboard. In this example we follow a link to view
      a page about <i>Aerodynamic Forces</i>, without resorting to the mouse
      pointer.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/element-hint.png" alt="The user using element hints. Element hints display a
              character shortcode next to each element on the page. The
              user can then type in that shortcode to interact with said
              element.">
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Quickly navigate documents with Jump Headings.</h3>
    <p>Immediately skip to important
      chapters with Jump Headings by fuzzily searching through header
      tags. In this example we jump to the section: <i>Intelligence and
        Learning</i>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/jump-heading.png" alt="The user using fuzzy search to jump around between
              headings. The user types in any characters that appear in a
              heading, and the browser jumps to that position in the
              document.">

    <h3>Instantly switch between your tabs.</h3>
    <p>Easily find relevant tabs with a
      fuzzy search. In this example we have 11 open tabs, and we
      narrow this group with each keystroke.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/switch-buffer.png" alt="The user using a fuzzy search to switch between many
              buffers. This allows them to jump to any tab instantly.">

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Find the right info the first time with multi-tab search.</h3>
    <p>Search multiple tabs
      simultaneously. In this example we look for the diet of penguins
      across several pages at once.

    <h3>Avoid tedious repetition by selecting groups of tabs.</h3>
    <p>Run commands against multiple tabs
      to avoid repeating yourself. In the example below we finish our
      online research of elephants by selecting and closing all webpages
      that match the string "ele".

    <p>Use the built-in REPL to program
      Nyxt. Run short scripts, and try out new workflows. Everything
      in Nyxt is fully extensible and modifiable.

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>Customizable autofills.</h3>
    <p>Use autofills to fill in
      forms. Autofills can be functions or plain strings. In the case
      of functions, you can make them intelligent. For example, you may
      want an autofill to fill in the current date.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><img src="https://nyxt.atlas.engineer/image/animation/auto-fill.png" alt="The user using autofills. Autofills are shortcodes to
              operations that can fill in input fields.">

    <h3>Clipboard history.</h3>
    <p>Anything you copy is remembered so
      that you can re-paste it at any time. No more looking for the
      'last thing' you pasted!

    <h3>Lossless tree history.</h3>
    <p>A tree based history ensures that
      you never lose track of where you've been. All pages you've
      visited are stored in a tree that you can traverse and search. No
      more losing items in your history.

On the video, the officer can be heard saying, “I don’t care about your consent stuff,” when David repeatedly denied the agent’s requests to search his bag.</p><p>Nothing was found inside, but David missed his flight.</p><p>Inspector General report</p><p>The Justice Department Inspector General reopened a decades-long investigation of the Operation Jetway program after seeing David’s video, which was first published by the non-profit <a href="https://ij.org/" target="_blank">Institute for Justice</a>.</p><p>“Without the subject, the individual, thinking to immediately use their cell phone to record the event,” said Inspector General Michael Horowitz, “in fact, we clearly wouldn’t have known about it because absent that video, there was no record of the incident.”</p><p>When the Office of The Inspector General requested records of David’s search, the DEA responded no records existed. “The DEA wasn’t keeping records of its encounters unless it found cash or drugs,” Horowitz said.</p><p>“When we began our investigation and asked for the paperwork, that’s when, months later, they started creating paperwork trying to lay out why they did what they did,” Horowitz added.</p><h3>The secret airline informant</h3><p>As part of its investigation in 2023, <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>discovered Transportation Security Administration agents and airline employees received informant fees for tipping off the DEA to passengers likely carrying large amounts of cash.</p><p>Traveling domestically with any amount of currency is legal in the U.S.; only international travelers are required to declare carrying $10,000 or more in currency. David was not carrying a large amount of cash with him on the flight.</p><p>The DOJ Inspector General found out David was stopped because an airline employee paid by the DEA had reported him for buying a last-minute ticket.</p><p>‘It turned out that the individual was getting a percentage of the amount seized on multiple occasions over a longer period of time,” Horowitz said.</p><p>The IG report showed one airline employee “has received tens of thousands of dollars from the DEA over the past several years for seizures resulting from information [they] provided of travelers with tickets purchased within 48 hours of their flight.”</p><p>The Inspector General told <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>there was no other evidence of drug trafficking in David’s case, other than his purchase of a last-minute ticket to New York City, where he lives. “Approaching individuals based solely on that basis, without any lead, any other information to suggest they might be a drug courier or money launderer was concerning,” Horowitz said.</p><h3>Sen. Ossoff inquiry</h3><p>A draft of the Inspector General’s report landed on the Attorney General’s desk days before a inquiry from Georgia U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/2024/11/18/sen-ossoff-demands-answers-dea-after-atlanta-news-first-investigation/" target="_blank">demanded answers </a>after seeing the <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/page/in-plane-sight/" target="_blank"><i><b>Atlanta News First Investigates report </b></i></a>featuring David’s video.</p><p>“It is a scathing description of serious deficiencies in this program that impact the constitutional rights of my constituents in Georgia,” Ossoff said. “And I don’t know whether without reporting from <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First</b></a> that would have come to light.”</p><figure><p><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/newsletter/" rel="" target="_self"><img loading="lazy" src="https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=980&amp;height=121&amp;smart=true" width="980" height="121" srcset="https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=540&amp;height=66&amp;smart=true 540w, https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=720&amp;height=88&amp;smart=true 720w, https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=980&amp;height=120&amp;smart=true 980w, https://gray-wgcl-prod.gtv-cdn.com/resizer/v2/GTWMO5P7BNHDLHYJAPFL3VHNWA.png?auth=987088ebe85dfb4fd1dc8170b0a689205b2a9dde3a0d3fc3d047a4b655ad5e4b&amp;width=1300&amp;height=160&amp;smart=true 1300w"></a></p></figure><p>Ossoff said he particularly concerned with the informant fees paid to airline employees who were alerting the DEA to passengers without any evidence of criminal activity. “If informants are being paid with confiscated property from searches that the informants triggered with no real evidence, it’s obvious why that’s a potential abuse and a potential violation of civil rights,” Ossoff said.</p><h3>Plainclothes agents nowhere to be seen at airport</h3><p>The Nov. 12 directive ordered the immediate suspension of the entire DEA cold consent encounter program nationwide. That directive was revealed publicly only when the Office of Inspector General released its report Nov. 21, 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>went to dozens of airport gates in Georgia, Washington, D.C., and Louisiana since the directive was issued, and saw no sign of the plainclothes drug agents previously recorded searching passengers at boarding doors.</p><p>The DOJ directive does allow the DEA to search suspects of drug trafficking “as part of a pre-planned activity in an ongoing, predicated investigation involving one or more identified targets or criminal networks.”</p><p>The directive explicitly bans searches predicated only on tips received from airline employees about last minute ticket purchases, like the one that put David on the DEA search list.</p><p>“The receipt of travel information from a confidential source, standing alone, does not constitute the type of predicated, ongoing investigation which will support a consensual encounter,” the Deputy Attorney General wrote.</p><h3>DEA responds</h3><p>The DEA had not responded to <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>questions or requests for interviews for over a year, after the agency had declined an initial interview request.</p><p>After the airport search program was suspended, <a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates </b></a>reached out to the agency again by email.</p><p>“DEA is relentlessly committed to its core mission: saving American lives,” the agency said. “We regularly review our enforcement efforts and programs to ensure that we are using resources in the best way to fulfill that mission. For the last several months, DEA has been conducting an internal review of its Transportation Interdiction Program, which has been suspended. That review is ongoing. The DEA is committed to executing our mission with integrity and professionalism at every turn.”</p><p><a href="https://www.atlantanewsfirst.com/news/investigate/" target="_blank"><b>Atlanta News First Investigates</b></a> also reached out to Nimeskern through his primary employer, the Montgomery (Ohio) Police Department.</p><p>Police Chief John Crowell responded, “I will check with him, but I doubt he wishes to speak to you.”</p><p><b>If there’s something you would like Atlanta News First Chief Investigator Brendan Keefe to look into, email him directly at </b><a href="mailto:brendan.keefe@wanf.com"><b>brendan.keefe@wanf.com</b></a><b>.</b></p><p><i>Copyright 2024 WANF.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Sega Channel was a games-on-demand service that gave cable subscribers access to a library of around 50 Sega Genesis games per month in exchange for a monthly fee (typically $10-$15/month depending on the cable provider). It operated between June 1994 (with a nationwide rollout in December 1994) and June 1998. Cable subscribers would be given an adapter cartridge that would connect their Genesis to a cable TV line. On boot, the cartridge would search for the Sega Channel signal, then download the game menu. This process typically took around 20 seconds. The user would then pick a game and wait about a minute for it to be downloaded to the adapter's RAM. At this point, the game would function exactly the same as a retail cartridge. Turning the system off or pressing the menu button on the adapter would erase the downloaded game, but game save data was retained unless the user downloaded a different game. Besides retail games, Sega Channel offered a "Test Drives" section where users could play time or content restricted versions of games before they got a retail release. There were also a number of games that were only available via Sega Channel, although it seems that most of them were titles where either Sega or the publisher weren't confident enough in their quality to give them a physical cartridge release. Sega Channel was a modest success, peaking at around 250,000 subscribers.</p>
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/adapter.jpg" alt="photograph of a Sega Channel adapter">

<p>Sega Channel data was delivered to cable customers through a somewhat long-winded process. First, Sega Channel employees would select the game line-up and other content (game hints, manuals, news, digitized fan-art, etc.) for a given month. They would then send everything to a company called Foley Hi-Tech, who would create the game menu graphics/animations and insert all the monthly content. They ended up with a ~60MB file called a "game image", which was burnt to a CD and sent to a satellite uplink facility in Denver, Colorado. The CD would then be installed in the uplink game server computer, which would continuously transmit the game data in a loop over satellite. Cable headends all over the US would receive the satellite transmission and send it to cable subscribers. The data being sent in a continuous loop is how the service's "interactivity" was achieved at a time when cable TV providers could only transmit data to all subscribers and couldn't receive data (i.e. what game a given subscriber wants to download). When a user chose a game from the menu, their adapter was instructed to look through the Sega Channel data stream and pick out the data for the game they selected. The ~60MB game image file was transmitted at a rate of about 8Mbps. Assuming that there were no signal problems, the user always got to play whatever game they picked within a minute (one loop of the data). The menu downloaded in less than a minute because additional redundant copies of it were added to the data stream to speed up downloads.</p>

<h3>Game Image</h3>
<p>In November 2024, the user RisingFromRuins on the Sonic Retro forum <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?posts/1084673/">announced</a> that he had found a Sega Channel game image CD for September 1996 while he was going through a lot of PC equipment he had bought years earlier. He posted pictures of the CD and <a href="https://retrocdn.net/File:DOM0816_zipped_image_file.zip">uploaded a copy</a> of the game image file on the disc. I thought it would be a fun project to see if I could extract the data from the game image file to see if there were any exclusive or prototype games on there. It's always neat to see games that nobody's been able to play for over 25 years.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/gameimagecase.jpg" width="400" alt="photograph of a Sega Channel game image CD case">
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/gameimagedisc.jpg" width="400" alt="photograph of a Sega Channel game image CD">
</p>

<h3>Process</h3>
<p>My first idea was to check out the image file's contents in a hex editor. Genesis games all have a standardized ASCII header, and I figured the game hints/downloadable manuals would be readable as well. Unfortunately, when I scrolled through the image file, there wasn't anything readable. My best guess was that the image file was either scrambled or encrypted.</p>
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/hxd.png" width="500" alt="screenshot of a portion of the image file being displayed in a hex editor">

<p>At this point, I hit a lucky break. In 2017, someone with the username tdijital had <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/Sega_Channel_(January_1996_dev_disc)">uploaded</a> a backup CD from Foley Hi-Tech (company I mentioned earlier that made the Sega Channel menus) containing Sega Channel development materials. People had <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?posts/897224/">previously gone over</a> some of the CD's contents and found some interesting stuff, including contest versions of Primal Rage, a couple quiz games from the Japanese version of Sega Channel, and standalone menu demo ROMs for December 1994 - January 1996 that could be run in an emulator and acted as time capsules for what was on the service that month. However, as far as I was aware, nobody had looked at any of the development tooling on the disc. My point of view was that if I wanted to extract the data from the game image file, it would be easier to reverse engineer the tooling that created the game image than to reverse engineer the Genesis-side downloading code and hope that the image file remained mostly intact during the data transmission process.</p>

<p>After a bit of trial and error, I figured out how the image files were created. First, developers would add all the games, descriptions, news text, art, music, etc. using a program called MENUMAKR. They'd end up with a menu binary file and a script file (misleadingly named MENUSPIN.BAT despite not being a batch file) containing the ROM file paths, data offsets, how many copies of the ROM to include, and other metadata for each game.</p>
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/menumakr.png" alt="screenshot of MENUMAKR program">

<p>Next, they'd run a program written by Scientific Atlanta (a cable equipment company that Sega partnered with to create the Sega Channel broadcast equipment and cartridge adapter) called PKSPREAD. This would validate the contents of the MENUSPIN.BAT file and output a binary file called PMAP.DAT, which contained instructions on how to split up and process the menu and game data for transmission.</p>
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/pkspread.png" alt="screenshot of PKSPREAD program">

<p>Finally, they'd run another program written by Scientific Atlanta called NSF, which would use the PMAP.DAT file to encode all the input files and create the game image file. I decided that if I wanted to decode the image file, this was the program I should focus on.</p>
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/nsf.png" alt="screenshot of NSF program">

<p>At this point, I hit another lucky break. I found that NSF.EXE had been compiled in debug mode, with optimizations turned off and with symbols embedded into the EXE. This meant that it would be easy to reverse engineer. Unfortunately, IDA Pro didn't automatically pick up the debug symbols from the executable, so I had to open NSF in Turbo Debugger (it was compiled with Borland C++ 4.1) and manually copy them over. Fortunately, the program was pretty small so this didn't take too long.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/td.png" width="500" alt="screenshot of portion of NSF code in Turbo Debugger">
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/ida.png" width="500" alt="screenshot of portion of NSF code in IDA">
</p>

<p>I could have gone straight to writing a decoder program here, but I thought it would be a better idea to first write an equivalent program to NSF.EXE. That way, if I was able to make a byte-for-byte identical image file to one created by the DOS NSF.EXE utility, I knew I had the algorithm figured out correctly. I created a test game image file (what the above screenshots of PKSPREAD and NSF show) and set about trying to match it. It took me a day of work and another couple evenings of debugging, but I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/nfroggy/sctools/blob/master/nsf.c">equivalent C program</a> to NSF.EXE and got the output to match. My basic process was I had IDA open on one monitor and Visual Studio open on the other, and I tried to match the assembly as closely as possible. This led to a couple interesting insights. Whoever wrote NSF was likely a novice C programmer. They also spent considerable effort on making everything 1-indexed rather than 0-indexed (maybe they were a Pascal fan?). Note that I made no effort to try to get the compiled binary to match the original. In fact, it likely won't even compile as a C file under Borland C++ 4, as I used C99 declarations and stdint.h types everywhere.</p>

<details><summary><b>Simplified overview of what NSF does (click to expand)</b></summary>
<ol>
<li>The GetData function pulls information such as what file to open for a given packet, where to seek into the file for the packet, and Sega Channel specific metadata (file ID, how long the game should be playable for if it's a time-limited demo, etc.) from the PMAP.DAT file. It then loads a 246-byte chunk of data from the data file.</li>
<li>The LoadFrame function adds a header to the start of the data packet and reverses all the data bytes (not sure if this is some data transmission thing, or if it was just to obfuscate the packet contents). It also intersperses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCH_code">BCH error-correcting codes</a> and parity bits throughout the game data. After this, 288 bytes are now used to hold the 246 bytes of data. Here's what the header structure looks like: (all multi-bit fields are in reverse bit order):
<table>
<thead><tr><th>Bit # (0-indexed)</th> <th>Bit Length</th> <th>Item</th> <th>Description</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>0</td> <td>27</td> <td>Unknown</td> <td>Not added by NSF, maybe added at transmission by the server?</td></tr>
<tr><td>27</td> <td>2</td> <td>Padding</td> <td>Always 0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>29</td> <td>1</td> <td>GameTimeSync</td> <td>1 when the GameTimeBit field contains bit 15 of the game time-out value.</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td> <td>1</td> <td>GameTimeBit</td> <td>Contains one bit of the game time-out value (how long to allow the game to be played in 10-second intervals), clocked out for a given file in reverse bit order (highest bit first).</td></tr>
<tr><td>31</td> <td>7</td> <td>ServiceID</td> <td>This is usually 1. May have something to do with Express Games (new titles that had to be individually ordered from a cable operator for an additional fee).</td></tr>
<tr><td>38</td> <td>14</td> <td>FileID</td> <td>Uniquely identifies each file in the game image. The menu is always file 0.</td></tr>
<tr><td>52</td> <td>15</td> <td>Address</td> <td>Where in RAM the adapter should download the file to.</td></tr>
<tr><td>67</td> <td>16</td> <td>HeaderCRC</td> <td>16-bit CRC of bits 27-66 of the header.</td>
</tr><tr><td>83</td> <td>56</td> <td>Header Copy</td> <td>Copy of bits 27-82 of the header.</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li>
<li>The InterLeave function splits the packet into 450-bit chunks and scrambles the bits around for each chunk. I think this has to have been done to obfuscate the data stream, as I can't think of a practical reason for this.</li>
<li>The above steps are repeated for another 9 packets.</li>
<li>All 10 packets are bundled up into a 2880 byte frame, and the data is woven together such that the first two bytes are from packet 0, the next two are from packet 1, and so on. The frame is then written to disk.</li>
<li>This process repeats until the entire image file has been created.</li>
</ol>
</details>

<p>Once I figured out how NSF works, it was fairly easy to write <a href="https://github.com/nfroggy/sctools/blob/master/densf.cpp">a decoder program</a> that would undo all these steps in reverse and spit out a bunch of individual data files. However, the data my decoder program output still wasn't valid Genesis ROM data:</p>
<img src="https://www.infochunk.com/schannel/hexcompare.png" width="800" alt="screenshot of a game from an image file compared to a regular ROM">

<p>Thankfully, this was just because the game data was compressed before transmission. The tool used to compress ROMS was in the Foley Hi-Tech CD (GAMEEDIT.EXE) but I didn't have to reverse engineer it because a GitHub user named Octocontrabass had <a href="https://github.com/Octocontrabass/channelzss">already done so</a>. I used his/her "unsa" tool to decompress all the .SA files into standard ROM files.</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>
<p>The most notable games from the image file are the two exclusive games that were broadcast in September 1996, Chessmaster and Klondike. Chessmaster is a chess game that was available on many platforms in the 90s (but not Genesis) and Klondike is a solitaire game commissioned by Sega for Sega Channel and programmed by David Crane of Pitfall fame.</p>

<p>After I posted my findings, Black Squirrel on Sonic Retro <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?posts/1085118/">found</a> that it was possible to get the September 1996 menu running in an emulator by copying bytes 0-0x1003FF from one of the Sega Channel demo cartridge ROMs and appending the menu data from the game image to the end. Obviously the download functionality doesn't work, but it's still fun to look around in the menu.</p>

<p>The final bit of content from the image file was the game instructions ROM. It looked like a normal Genesis ROM file, but when I tried to run it in an emulator I just got a black screen. The problem here turned out to be that the ROM was linked with a base address of 0x100000 rather than 0 like a normal cartridge. It seems like it was meant to be run directly out of the Sega Channel adapter's memory without it getting mapped to the normal cartridge address space. My best guess is this had something to do with the functionality for jumping into the manual for a specific game from the game menu. I got it working in an emulator by adding zeroes after the header until the code lined up correctly with the vectors in the header. When it's started like this, at boot you see a menu intended for developers with all the internal names for each game. At this point, all of the content from the game image file was now able to be run in an emulator.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I have to thank Tdijital for releasing the Sega Channel development backup CD, Octocontrabass for reverse engineeering the .SA compression format, and whoever at Scientific Atlanta compiled NSF.EXE in debug mode. This project would have been much harder without all of their assistance. Most of all, I have to thank RisingFromRuins for releasing the game image file. I hope if anyone else has a Sega Channel game image disc, they follow his example.</p>

		The infrastructure underlying <a href="https://as.ap.foundation/" target="_blank">AS54316</a> -- the network supporting the services offered by the <a href="https://ap.foundation/" target="_blank">AP Foundation</a> -- has historically been based out of a datacenter in NYC (NetActuate in Telehouse Chelsea). To add some resiliency, I thought it'd be interesting -- and a potentially fun challenge -- to leverage some spare real estate at my home in neighboring Connecticut, rather co-locating at another datacenter location.
		</p>

		<p>
	Hosting "always-on" physical infrastructure poses a few challenges -- climate control, power, security, network connectivity, etc. While each of these are probably worth their own posts (and some still in progress), the last element of network connectivity was a fascinating journey which I thought was worth sharing (taking 2+ months, 2.5+ miles of fiber, a handful of police officers, and 10+ telecom engineers)

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>
		We manage our own IPv4 and IPv6 address space allocated by ARIN, which is announced under AS54316 by BGP peering with IP transit providers. Getting these transit relationships in a data center setting is quite easy -- your colocation provider might offer it, but cross connects are often available to the likes of global providers like GTT, Cogent, HE, etc (special shout out to <a href="https://neptunenetworks.org/" target="_blank">Neptune Networks</a> in NYC, for providing us with affordable IP transit at Telehouse Chelsea)
		</p>
		<p>
		BGP peering in a residential setting proved to be an entirely different story. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm lucky to live in an area serviced by two different fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) providers -- Verizon FiOS and Optimum (Altice) -- and I already was using FiOS for personal use. However, bring up the phrase "BGP peering" to either of these providers and quickly see their eyes glaze over...it's just not something they do since BGP is typically only leveraged by large enterprises. 
		</p>
		<p>
		While it is possible to BGP peer over a VPN connection to VPS providers like Neptune or Vultr (who offer IP transit), I wanted to have confidence in the underlying connectivity as most FTTH providers lack any SLA. 
		</p>

		<p>
		I could have purchased FTTH service from both Verizon FiOS and Optimum, and then multi-homed over VPNs to a VPS, but both ISPs mostly use above-ground infrastructure strung on local power utility poles -- in my area, trees falling on lines seemed like the most likely common point of failure to which both would be equally vulnerable.
		</p>

		<h2>Finding a solution</h2>
		<p>
		Seeking a more sophisticated solution over the FTTH ISPs, I eventually came across the concept of "dedicated internet access" ("DIA";  or "dedicated ethernet", depending on who you're talking to).
		</p>
		<p>
		Almost all non-enterprise FTTH/FTTB ISP services are architected around a shared resource model, where your neighborhood is essentially "sharing" a backhaul circuit to the ISP's central office (CO) using technologies like passive optical networking (PON). While there are a bunch of interesting technology and economics at play, this architecture enables ISPs to only run a single fiber strand to service an entire neighborhood, leveraging passive optical splitters to break out connections to each home/building (saving on cost in the central office with less equipment, and in the field with less fiber). ISPs tend to oversubscribe these services as well (where you and your 10 neighbors might all be able to sign up for 1Gbps symmetric service, but not everyone can leverage that full 1Gbps at the same time).
		</p>

		<p>
		With DIA on the other hand, the ISP runs a dedicated pair of fibers from a router in their CO, straight to your building, only for your use, with guarantees on bandwidth, uptime, latency, jitter, etc. and importantly, repair time. It's literally a long fiber connection from your router to the ISP's "point of presence" (POP) router. These types of services are (as you can imagine) expensive and therefore mostly used by larger enterprises who can justify the cost. But crucial for my use case, DIA providers allow customers to BGP peer with their POP router.
		</p>

		<h2>Buying a solution</h2>
		<p>
		Now that I knew what I was trying to buy, I went shopping for DIA providers that might service my area -- having little idea on what I was getting myself into. The obvious options were Verizon Enterprise and Lightpath (Altice's enterprise brand), since I knew they already had infrastructure in the area. Though for good measure I reached out to many of the major connectivity players (AT&amp;T, Cogent, Zayo, Crown Castle, Lumen, etc).
		</p>
		<p>
		A few surprises came out of this search:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Some providers flat out rejected the idea of working with "residential zoned" buildings (since connecting -- or "lighting up" -- a commercial building could bring multiple new customers, rather than just one who could churn after a few years).
			</li>
			<li>Others were willing to quote me extremely high monthly minimums, build-outs, and/or year-long construction given permitting requirements, etc. (e.g., one provider quoted $128k to run 1,148ft of fiber to their nearest "live" bundle)
			</li>
			<li>Quickly I learned about the concept of "local exchange carriers" -- a telephone term: a handful of providers were willing to provide service without an up-front build-out cost, but contracted out the "last mile" physical infrastructure to a 3rd party (likely Verizon given their existing right-of-ways in my area, and legacy in telecom). From my research, it seemed these should be avoided if possible (since repairs would involve coordinating with the 3rd party, and could also lead to finger pointing when attempting to establish who is at fault if things go wrong). These were also generally more expensive on a monthly basis.
			</li>
			<li>Some providers rely on contractors to manage their physical infrastructure, rather than staff, and poor coordination can lead to absurd installation / repair times.
			</li>
			<li>Almost all providers require 3-year commitment
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		Ultimately I decided to move forward with Verizon Enterprise given they claimed my home was already "on net" (meaning "on network", implying no build-out fee), and had transparent pricing which they actually listed on their website (no other provider did). To give an idea of cost, Verizon (and most other providers) will basically sell you whatever circuit speed you want, but often some pre-set "tiers" make the most sense (as of this writing, VZ was pricing 50Mbps committed @ $455/mo; 100Mbps @ $661/mo; 1Gbps @ $999/mo; 5Gbps @ $2,099/mo; and 10Gbps @ $3,099/mo).
		</p>
		<p>
		The above prices are certainly more expensive than FiOS (and way slower for those lower tiers), but remember these circuits are backed with an SLA and come with BGP sessions, dual-stack connectivity, etc. You can also get creative with 95th percentile billing, but the pricing didn't make sense for my use case (e.g., a circuit with 100Mbps committed, burstable to 1Gbps, was actually more expensive than a 1Gbps committed circuit -- even ignoring overages).
		</p>
		<p>
		Taking the 50Mbps committed tier at $455/mo as an example: the cost consist of two elements: ~$90/mo for the actual internet "access", with the remaining ~$365/mo going towards the physical layer 1 connectivity (the "port"). More on this later.
		</p>
		<p>
		As part of the service configuration, I was surprisingly able to select the type of network handoff I wanted (e.g., 100base-FX, 1000base-LX, 1000base-T, single-mode, multi-mode, etc) -- coming from lower tier services, I had assumed it'd be a "you get what you get" situation, though this eventually made more sense once I got into the implementation stage.
		</p>
		<p>
		As an aside, the sales process was quite refreshing compared to what I'm used to as well. In many cases, rather than getting connected to a generic call center, I was connected to a specific sales rep. who specialized in the area I was calling about -- and everyone was willing to get a sales engineer involved who was intimately familiar with the nuances.
		</p>

		<h2>Installing the circuit</h2>
		<p>
		This was where the really interesting stuff happened, ultimately taking ~2 months, 10+ Verizon engineers/technicians, 5 dispatches, and a handful of police officers (!).
		</p>
		<p>
		I quickly learned that Verizon actually segments their business into "Verizon Telecom" (handling the physical layer 1 infrastructure) and "Verizon Business" (handling the routing layer). A bulk of the work was by the former.
		</p>
		<p>
		The activation process was managed offshore by a dedicated "order manager" who coordinated internally within Verizon, and served as my main contact point through the installation.
		</p>

		<h2>Dispatch 1: Site survey</h2>
		<p>
		First, Verizon Telecom sent a "High Capacity Outside Plant Engineer" to conduct a site survey. A lovely gentlemen by the name of Roger who had been with Verizon for what I believe was 40+ years. During this time, we walked my street, figured out which utility poles they'd running the fiber drop from, where my house's service entrance was, and where the server rack will be. He also explained the conduit requirements for their fiber cable in relation to my service entrance and the server rack, and power / rack space requirements for their equipment (4U of space, which seemed like a lot!).
		</p>
		<p>
		I learned that on most major streets they run giant bundles of fiber optic cable (I think he mentioned 800+ strands on some roads?), with many of those strands left dark for future projects like mine. Since I lived right off a major street, he said they'd run a few hundred feet of new fiber, which they'd splice into a larger bundle (with one end ultimately connecting to a switch port in Verizon's local central office, other end to the server rack).
		</p>

		<p>
		A few days passed while Verizon's engineering team processed the site survey and planned the construction on their end, and then I eventually got a "firm order commitment" date for around ~1.5 months later (the guaranteed "go-live"). That initially felt like a long time, but once I fully understood the work that went into setting up the circuit, I thought it was quite fast!
		</p>
		<p>
		There was a bunch of work on my end left to do as well -- including installing appropriate power, a service entrance, the server rack, networking equipment, etc. -- which of course took much longer than I planned. Once I completed a few essentials, I submitted a "site ready" certification to Verizon, so they could begin construction on their end.
		</p>

		<h2>Dispatch 2: Fiber drop</h2>
		<p>
		A few weeks later, a crew of four technicians stopped by with a bucket truck to run a new fiber optic cable from the utility pole to the new server rack -- and thanks to some oddities in my local law, also had to have local police to standing by. The crew also installed a 2U fiber patch panel on the rack.
		</p>
		<p>
		Oddly though I noticed the fiber cable wasn't terminated at either end. After chatting with the crew, it turns out a separate fiber splicing crew would later splice it at the utility pole and the patch panel.
		</p>
		<p>
		For those who are curious, the installed cable was single-mode with 12-strands from Corning, which they ran direct from the utility pole into the rack (compared to the 1-strand cable which was already in place for the FiOS service, and was adapted to an indoor patch cable before entering the building).
		</p>

		<h2>Dispatch 3: Network Interface Device (NID) install</h2>
		<p>
		Later that week another technician stopped by to install a NID, which took 1U of rack space and serves as Verizon's service demarcation point (where "their problems" are demarcated from "your problems"). These boxes are apparently built to be robust, and allow their NOC engineers to run diagnostics on the network remotely. Being naturally curious, I took a look at closer look at the hardware: it's a Canoga Perkins 9145E, and on "telecom" (NNI) side there was installed a 40 kilometer 1310nm 1.25Gbps single-mode SPF transceiver, and on the "user" (UNI) side a similar 10km transceiver.
		</p>
		<p>
		Oddly, the version they installed only had a single internal PSU, though the manufacturer offers a dual PSU model (I requested the dual PSU version but was told this was "not Verizon certified").
		</p>
		<p>
The technician who came by funnily mentioned that never in his career had he been dispatched to install a NID in a house.
		</p>

		<h2>Dispatch 4: The fiber splicing team</h2>
		<p>
		A couple of weeks passed since the last dispatch; after checking in, Verizon said a crew of two splicers were working in manholes to "get the fiber pairs to my site", meaning from their local central office to the new server rack. Of course that made a lot of sense after thinking about it -- the dark fibers mentioned earlier, which are left unused in the field, are not connected on either end -- so a crew was literally having to fusion splice fiber pairs across a patchwork of bundles throughout town, to ultimately get live pairs to the site.
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure enough, a few days later I saw a handful of police officers and a couple of Verizon trucks at the end of my road (a bucket truck and a splicing van). The next day we made an appointment for them to finish the work inside the house and get the patch panel spliced to the fiber cable which the earlier crew had run. This was a fun conversation and the crew was nice enough to entertain my questions while letting me watch them fusion splice in the house, while the other tech was working on splicing on the utility pole.
		</p>
		<p>
		After they tested the final splices via OTDR, the final run ended up being over ~2.5 miles (!) -- from the local CO to the patch panel.
		</p>
		<p>
		Like the others, it seems these guys were with Verizon for 30+ years and seemed to enjoy their work, having transitioned from the old copper days to new fiber runs.
		</p>
		<p>
		After their work was through, I was a bit confounded on why the circuit still seemed offline -- and then came the last dispatch.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Dispatch 5: NID #2 install</h2>
		<p>
		This is where I began to see the distinction between Verizon Telecom (VzT) and Verizon Business (VzB). While the layer 1 infrastructure had been installed and tested, there still remained the IP layer, which required another dispatch for another technician to install a dedicated NID for Verizon Business -- a Ciena 3903, with 1310nm single mode optics.
		</p>
		<p>
		This NID essentially serves the same function as the first one, but for VzB. VzT provides an EVC to VzB, and apparently I was a customer of the latter (I tried calling Verizon Telecom and it seemed they were not used to getting calls from people like me!).
		</p>
		<p>
		Ultimately, here's how things ended up getting connected: VZ CO ↔ ~2.5 miles of fiber ↔ VzT NID ↔ VzB NID ↔ our router
		</p>
		
		<h2>Activation</h2>
		<p>
		Once that last NID was installed and tested, I was very shortly later provided with IP details to spin up my connection along with peering details for the BGP session.
		</p>
		<p>
In the activation phase, I was given a couple of interesting bits of information on the underlying Verizon infrastructure. Namely, it seems they rely on a Fujitsu 9500 for DWDM / ROADM and a Juniper MX960 for the gateway / peering router (which is located ~30-40 miles away in NYC, rather than the local CO).
		</p>

		<h2>Other notes (after a few months of going live)</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There is an additional ~30% Federal Universal Service Fund tax on the "port" fee -- which, as mentioned, makes up a bulk of the monthly recurring cost, so the tax adds a meaningful amount to each bill. This tax fluctuates on a quarterly basis, but it's something to budget into a cost analysis if you're considering a DIA circuit (or any circuit with meaningful inter-state traffic)
			</li>
			<li>A bulk of Verizon's helpdesk has been offshored, which does make it difficult to diagnose intermittent issues sometimes, but for major issues its quite easy to escalate (e.g., anytime a trouble ticket is opened, an automated system checks if your NIDs / router are ping-able and BGP sessions active).
			</li>
			<li>While the SLA says 100%, don't expect perfection -- I've had a handful of momentary flaps over the past few months and a ~30 minute outage (though I still consider this acceptable for our use case).
			</li>
		</ul>

<p>An actual red carpet was rolled out for Trump as Macron bestowed the kind of full diplomatic welcome that France offers sitting American presidents, complete with trumpets blaring and members of the Republican Guard in full uniform. It was a clear sign that even though Trump doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, 2025, Macron and other European leaders are already working to win his favor and treating him as America’s representative on the world stage.</p>
    

<p>President Joe Biden declined an invitation to attend the Notre Dame ceremony, marking five years after a devastating fire, and first lady Jill Biden was the official U.S. representative. The White House cited a scheduling conflict.</p><p>Macron and leaders across Europe are trying to persuade the president-elect to maintain support for Ukraine in its defense against Russia’s invasion.

Then, the four organists who took turns formulating improvised responses to the archbishop’s prompts literally pulled out the stops and let rip. </p><p>Eight times, the archbishop addressed the instrument. Eight times, it responded with a symphony of notes and sounds — as though rediscovering and relearning the joy and power from its nearly 8,000 pipes.</p>
    

<h2>Macron praises the bravery of fire fighters </h2><p>Macron praised the bravery of fire fighters and recalled how, at 10:47 p.m. on the night of April 15, 2019, the first message came through saying that the inferno was being beaten. </p><p>“Notre Dame of Paris was saved. Disfigured but saved,” he said. Moving onto the rebuilding effort, he detailed the toil of the more than 2,000 workers and artisans who worked to a 5-year reconstruction deadline set by Macron. “We decided to rebuild Notre Dame of Paris even more beautiful than before.” </p><p>Macron delivered the entire speech in French despite the multinational mix of VIP guests. At the end, Trump and Macron shook hands.</p><h2>Macron expresses ‘gratitude’ to those who saved, helped and rebuilt Notre Dame Cathedral</h2>
    

<p>French President Emmanuel Macron expressed “gratitude” Saturday to those who saved, helped and rebuilt Notre Dame Cathedral.</p><p>“I stand before you ... to express the gratitude of the French nation,” Macron said at the reopening ceremony.</p><p>“Tonight, the bells of Notre Dame are ringing again. And in a moment, the organ will awaken,” sending the “music of hope” to Parisians, France and the world.</p><p>Macron spoke in front of more than 2,500 guests invited to celebrate the restoration of Paris’ 12th-century cathedral which was nearly destroyed by a fire in 2019. They included world leaders like President-elect <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-paris-notre-dame-macron-32d9086e3d2f21ae871f5bb1120929be">Donald Trump</a></span>, U.S. first lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
    

<h2>Guests give standing ovation after short film documenting the rebuilding efforts</h2><p>Notre Dame echoed to the sound of a sustained standing ovation after the showing of a short movie that documented the gargantuan rebuilding effort by thousands of workers who labored — and ultimately met — a 5-year deadline set by French President Emmanuel Macron in the aftermath of the blaze. Outside, the word “MERCI” — thank you — was projected against the cathedral’s iconic western facade in multiple languages.</p><p>The movie showed the terrible wounds left by the inferno — the gaping holes torn into its vaulted ceilings and the burned roof. But that was followed by images of all types of artisans, many using traditional hand-craft techniques, who collectively restored Notre Dame to look better now than ever.</p><p>“We went from night to light,” said one of the workers in the movie.</p><h2>Notre Dame’s largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rings out </h2><p>The congregation inside the huge cathedral was ghostly quiet as its largest bell, the 13-ton Emmanuel, rang out into the Paris night, signaling the start of the ceremony. </p><p>Inside, Elon Musk gazed up at the renovated vaulted ceilings. Jill Biden was the last VIP welcomed outside by President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, before Archbishop Laurent Ulrich then took over. </p><p>“Brothers and sisters, let us enter now into Notre Dame,” he said as he stood outside, before its closed doors. “It is she who accompanies us on our path to peace.”</p><p>He then banged on the door three times with the base of his crosier, or bishop’s cross. Inside, the choir erupted into song, the crystalline voices filing what — until recently — had been a building site. Three times, Ulrich appealed to the cathedral to open its doors. Three times, the choir responded in song. He then pushed open the heavy door: Notre Dame’s rebirth was underway. </p><h2>Archibishop Laurent Ulrich knocks three times on Notre Dame’s doors, officially marking cathedral’s reopening</h2><p>With three resounding knocks on its doors by Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich, wielding a staff carved from fire-scorched beams, the cathedral roared back to life Saturday evening.</p><p>For the first time since a devastating 2019 blaze, the towering Gothic masterpiece reopened for worship, its rebirth marked by song, prayer, and awe beneath its soaring arches.</p><p>While the ceremony was initially planned to begin on the forecourt, unusually fierce December winds whipping across the central Paris island, flanked by the River Seine, forced all events inside. Yet the occasion lost none of its splendor. Inside the luminous nave, choirs are singing psalms, and the cathedral’s mighty organ, silent for nearly five years, is thundering to life in a triumphant interplay of melodies.</p><p>The evening’s celebration, being attended by more than 2,500 guests and dignitaries, including President-elect Donald Trump, U.S. First Lady Jill Biden, Britain’s Prince William, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, underscores Notre Dame’s enduring role as both a spiritual and cultural beacon. </p><h2>Groups gather in Paris to protest Trump</h2><p>A small group of American expats gathered near Notre Dame Cathedral on Saturday to protest the presence of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at the reopening ceremony. Organized under the banner “Paris Against Trump,” the group criticized French President Emmanuel Macron for inviting Trump but chose not to organize a large demonstration to avoid disrupting the event.</p><p>“We find this a bit shameful and sad that Trump is invited here, especially since he has gone against everything the Church stands for,” said Ehlyr O’Rourke, 34, a spokesperson for the association. “We don’t understand why a criminal, a sex offender, a felon can actually be invited in here.”</p><p>Later in the day, thousands marched through Paris, denouncing Trump’s visit and expressing support for Palestine. Organized by left-wing parties, unions, and pro-Palestinian groups, the demonstration featured Palestinian flags, keffiyehs, and chants calling for Palestinian resistance, President Macron’s impeachment, and criticizing Trump’s alleged complicity in Middle East conflicts.</p><p>“We are protesting every week to support Palestine, but what’s special today is the arrival of Donald Trump,” said Nadia Messai, one of the protesters in the crowd. “Trump has been supporting Israel, much like the United States has been since the beginning of the creation of this rogue state that is occupying Palestine illegally.”</p><h2>Cathedral’s renovation chief hopes the reopening is a moment of unity</h2><p>Philippe Jost, Notre Dame cathedral renovation chief, said the reopening is an opportunity for unity as so many divisions remain in the world. </p><p>“We hope it will be a great moment of unity for the French people, for guests from all over the world and for spectators from all over the world,” he said. “Notre Dame de Paris unites. There are so many divisive factors. An event like this must unite, must help concord and peace to grow throughout the world.”</p><h2>Notre Dame’s rector emphasizes the importance of the separation of church and state</h2><p>rector of Notre Dame and chief of the reconstruction project: (credit to Mark Carlson)</p><p>Olivier Ribadeau Dumas, the Notre Dame rector called the reopening an important moment that has been awaited a long time. </p><p>“Notre Dame de Paris is the very sign of the presence of a soul in the heart of our city. It’s important for Parisians, it’s important for Catholics, it’s important for the French and for the whole world,” he said. </p><p>“In general, the sphere of politics doesn’t enter the sphere of the religious, and shouldn’t. In the same way, the religious sphere doesn’t enter politics,” he added. “The Archbishop of Paris invited the President of the Republic to speak inside the cathedral as a sign of the unity that could be seen in the reconstruction. The archbishop allowed him to speak inside because the weather conditions did not allow him to speak outside.”</p><h2>Guests file into Notre Dame Cathedral for the ceremonies</h2><p>Guests gradually filing the cathedral for the evening reopening ceremonies are reveling at the renovated interiors, with many whipping out cell phones to take souvenir photos.</p><p>“It’s a sense of perfection,” said François Le Page, who works for the Notre Dame foundation that raised nearly half of the nearly 900 million euros of donations. He last set foot in the cathedral in 2021, on a visit</p><p>“It’s night and day,” said Rev. Andriy Morkvas, a Ukrainian pastor who leads the The Cathedral of Saint Volodymyr the Great church in Paris’ St. Germain des Pres said it had been 10 years since he last stepped foot inside Notre Dame. “God is very powerful, he can change things.”</p><p>He expressed hope that the cathedral could help bring peace to his country and he drew heart from the expected attendance of Ukraine’s president. </p><p>“I hope Notre Dame and Mary will help us resolve this conflict,” he said.</p><h2>French government security agents are helping to ensure Trump’s safety alongside the Secret Service</h2><p>Outside the Elysee Palace, the official residence of the French president, dozens of members of the French Republican Guard stood by awaiting Donald Trump’s arrival.</p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump">Trump</a></span> was in Paris on Saturday for his first international trip as president-elect, ready to join world leaders celebrating the <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/notre-dame-cathedral-reopens-ceremony-security-fire-efc740d20cf91f5ba1eabf45eecfe8ad">renovation of Notre Dame Cathedral</a></span> and meet with French President Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s Prince William.</p><p>More than 20 French government security agents have been helping ensure Trump’s safety alongside the Secret Service, according to French national police. A special French police van was providing anti-drone protection for Trump’s convoy.</p><p>Security was tighter than usual outside the U.S. Embassy and other sites around Paris for the Notre Dame reopening, where dozens of international VIPs were expected.</p><p>Macron, who has had an up-and-down relationship with Trump, has made a point of cultivating a relationship since the Republican defeated Democrat Kamala Harris last month. But Macron’s office nonetheless played down the significance of the invitation, saying other politicians not now in office had been invited as well.</p><p>Trump was invited as president-elect of a “friendly nation,” Macron’s office said, adding, “This is in no way exceptional, we’ve done it before.” </p><h2>Notre Dame in numbers</h2><p>Perhaps not surprisingly for such a big cathedral, some of the numbers that help tell the story of Notre Dame’s reopening are on the very big side, too. The bell that will sound to signal the start of the service weighs 13 tons, making it the cathedral’s largest. It has a name - Emmanuel – given to it by King Louis XIV after it was cast in 1683. It rings in F sharp. </p><p>Inside, 42,000 square meters of stonework were cleaned during the renovation — an area equivalent to roughly six soccer pitches. The first stone of Notre Dame was laid in 1163. The thunderous great organ of Notre Dame that will be heard in public at Saturday’s service for the first time since April 15, 2019, has 7,952 pipes — the largest as broad as a human torso; the smallest no larger than a pen. The renovated giant console that controls the instrument has five keyboards of 56 notes each, foot pedals for 30 notes, and 115 stops. </p><p>Unseen, above the congregation and the repaired vaulted ceilings, is a framework of beams holding up the roof and spire – so dense and intricate that it’s nicknamed “the forest.” Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild it. </p><h2>Trump to meet with Macron ahead of the reopening ceremonies</h2><p>President-elect Donald Trump is to meet Saturday with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee presidential palace ahead of the reopening ceremony for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. This is Trump’s first foreign trip since the election.</p><p>Macron’s office said both leaders will discuss global crisis, including wars in the Middle East and in Ukraine as well as French-American bilateral relations.</p><p>Macron is scheduled to have a meeting with Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy right after his meeting with Trump.</p><p>Notre Dame celebrations comes as Macron’s presidency now faces its gravest crisis after the government’s collapse this week in a historic no-confidence vote that toppled Prime Minister Michel Barnier. </p><h2>Devout Catholics say the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening will ‘nourish us’</h2><p>For devout Catholics Patricia and Cyrille Brenner, waiting in the cold outside Notre Dame for its reopening service that they weren’t invited to was the place to be. The couple traveled by night train from Cannes on the French Riviera – famous for its movie festival – to be among the onlookers Saturday hoping for some of the 40,000 spots set aside for the public on the banks of the River Seine facing the cathedral. They bought their train tickets six months ago.</p><p>“I’m from Cannes. It’s a bit like the festival. You have to be there to experience it,” said Patricia, 65. “It’s a pilgrimage for us.”</p><p>Cyrille, 66, said they were the only members of their parish to make the long trip. “We like to be at the heart of things and, as Christians, it will nourish us,” he said.</p><p>While Cyrille said they’d felt “distress, sadness” when Notre Dame burned, they both also noted how sacred relics, statues and the golden cross on the altar – almost miraculously – survived the inferno.</p><p>They both marveled at the renovation works that have not only eradicated nearly all traces of the fire inside but made it more resplendent than ever.</p><h2>Some visitors hope talks on the sidelines will be good for Ukraine</h2><p>Andrey Alexeev, a Ukrainian among onlookers gathering for the reopening of Notre Dame, hopes U.S. president-elect Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy can meet and talk on the ceremony’s sidelines. Their host, French President Emmanuel Macron, was meeting with both leaders before they attend the reopening service for the cathedral.</p><p>Alexeev was hoping Trump and Zelenskyy would meet, too. “I hope that meeting can change something in a good way for Ukraine,” he said. “It’s good that Zelenskyy has a chance to speak with Trump and Macron. At least it’s an opportunity for Ukraine.”</p><p>Alexeev, who lives in Poland, was visiting Paris with his mother, Olha, who travelled from Ukraine. They were hoping for two of the 40,000 places that were set aside for the public in fenced-off areas on the banks of the River Seine, facing the cathedral. Alexeev said he’s agnostic but that it felt important for him to be as close to the ceremonies as possible. By coincidence, his sister was visiting Paris when Notre Dame burned on April 15, 2019.</p><p>“It’s one of the greatest places not only in Europe but also the whole world,” he said. Such an occasion “happens once in 1,000 years, I think. So we are part of history.”</p><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Saturday’s events will blend solemn religious tradition with an official presidential speech and cultural grandeur.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte will welcome the dozens of heads of state and government. Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will then take over — with a rite to symbolically reopen Notre Dame’s doors, kicking off the ceremonies at 7 p.m.</p><p>The ceremony that was to have been held outside will then unfold inside, with a film retracing the renovations, music and a speech by Macron.</p><p>Ulrich will then take over again, with a rite to reawaken Notre Dame’s organ and the rest of the religious service scheduled to last about 55 minutes.</p><h2>Notre Dame reopening falls victim to bad weather</h2><p>PARIS — After more than 5 years of renovation, the reopening of Notre Dame — like the Paris Olympics before it — has fallen victim to bad weather.</p><p>Forecasted strong winds have upended the running order of the reopening ceremonies on Saturday evening, and forced the whole thing indoors.</p><p>The original plan was for an initial outdoor state ceremony led by President Emmanuel Macron, after which Archbishop Laurent Ulrich was to have taken over, leading rites and a religious service inside the cathedral. Those plans would have emphasized France’s carefully policed divide between state and church.</p><p>But expected stormy winds prompted the Paris diocese and Macron’s office to telescope the ceremonies together, now all to be held inside the cathedral.</p><p>It’s the second time this year that weather has intervened in significant moments for Paris. Rains drenched the July 26 opening ceremony of the Summer Games, dampening the show and the spirits of some spectators.</p>
