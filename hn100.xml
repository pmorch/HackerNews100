<p>On December 16th 1997 <em>Pokémon </em>made international headlines when their latest episode, “Dennō Senshi Porygon”—now commonly translated as “Electric Soldier Porygon”— caused 685 children to be taken into hospital by ambulance due to seizures, blindness, and convulsions. The event was dubbed by the Japanese Press as “Pokémon<em> </em>Shock” (“Pokémon Shokku”), and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ryqo7jjEZAw"> launched an investigation by the Japanese Government</a> into what had happened. When discussed the story usually ends there, just a fun way to conclude a listicle of banned anime episodes, or an explanation to fans as to why Porygon has never had a major role&nbsp; in the main anime since. But there is far more to the story of <em>Pokémon’s </em>banned episode: a story that includes a model train enthusiast from Birmingham, England, and a little mouse who got away scott free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an Epileptic, I’ve been <a href="https://brainbuffering.tumblr.com/post/719379808780451840/i-see-many-able-bodied-people-and">very</a> <a href="https://brainbuffering.tumblr.com/post/708429924621484032/an-argument-that-regularly-occurs-within-the">outspoken</a> <a href="https://brainbuffering.tumblr.com/post/175756944444/so-i-know-this-is-late-to-the-party-but-im">about</a> my opinions on the increased use of strobe lighting effects in American cartoons. Even today with movies like <em>The Incredibles II</em>, the use of flashing lights and red lighting effects has made a lot of cinema not only inaccessible but potentially deadly for many viewers. Yet people have accused me of being a hypocrite: why do I continue to love <em>Pokémon</em>? Surely if I had conviction in my beliefs, I’d refuse to watch the show that caused all those children to be taken to hospital! My response often surprises people. That, in my personal opinion, morally speaking, the animators were not responsible for what happened. That Porygon was, in fact, innocent.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Electric Soldier Porygon and the Birth of the Harding Test</h2>



<p><a href="https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/about-epilepsy/what-epilepsy/epilepsy-facts-and-myths">About 1 in 100 people</a> have epilepsy, one of the most common neurological conditions. Epileptic Seizures occur when there is a sudden spike in the brain’s usual electrical activity, causing it to “short circuit” if you will. Despite common misconceptions, there are in fact six seizure types. These include Absence Seizures, when a person stops what they are doing altogether, loses awareness but does not collapse or have visible convulsions; Myoclonic Seizures, when a person’s limbs suddenly jerk uncontrollably but they remain conscious and aware; and Tonic Clonic Seizures where a person loses consciousness, collapses, and their whole body convulses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tonic Clonic Seizures are the type of seizures we are referring to when talking about those affected during the “Electric Soldier Porygon” incident. Triggers for seizures come in multiple forms. Common triggers include menstruation, stress, and sleep deprivation. In fact, only around 3% of people with epilepsy are triggered by flashing lights or patterns. However, photosensitivity is not just connected to seizures! Photosensitivity also affects those who are visually impaired, and those who have migraines, amongst other conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seizures do not automatically mean a person has epilepsy. According to the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy">World Health Organisation</a>, about 10% of people will have a seizure in their lifetime. And these non-epileptic seizures are exactly what occurred during “Electric Soldier Porygon.” <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.31405.x">76% of those who had seizures during the event had never experienced a seizure before</a>, and of those who had, most had never had a seizure provoked by TV before. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.31405.x">This event is actually what helped confirm that people without any history of epilepsy can have seizures triggered by flashing lights</a>. It is estimated that of the 7 million viewers, 10% had some sort of physical medical reaction but not all of these needed specific medical attention.</p>



<p>In the immediate aftermath of the event, the broadcaster (TV Tokyo) pulled the show completely from the air, putting it on a four-month hiatus whilst they worked out what had happened. The producers were questioned by the police, but found completely innocent of any deliberate wrongdoing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government directly flew in <a href="https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/news/aston-university-professor-named-among-nations-lifesavers-work-around-photosensitive-epilepsy">neurology expert Graham Harding</a>, a research professor at Aster University, Birmingham, England, to help give them advice on the situation going forward and provide needed insight into what happened. Harding had previously conducted research into photosensitive seizures triggered by video screens, and the same guidelines he had recommended in the UK were immediately implemented by the Japanese government. For years afterwards episodes of anime would start with a warning telling people to make sure they were watching in a brightly lit room and not sitting too close to the TV.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naturally, this was not the first time that photosensitive seizures had been observed. Seizures triggered by patterns have been <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/epilepsy">recorded as far back as 4000 BCE</a>. Yet it had never occurred on this scale before! While there had been much research on photosensitivity and video games, in terms of flashing lights on television triggering seizures there was little presidence, any blame being put down the general flickering of the TV screen itself. So whilst it was not exactly unknown that flashing lights on TV screens could cause seizures, it was definitely not the absolute common knowledge that it is today. In an ideal world, the animators in 1997 should absolutely have been aware of the risk using flashing lights could cause, but in reality, their ignorance is understandable.</p>



<p>Whilst it was known that seizures could be triggered by flashing lights, it was not known at the time the impact red lighting could have. The episode itself is a jaunt through cyberspace to defeat Team Rocket with the help of the newly developed computer pokémon Porygon. When confronting Team Rocket, Pikachu releases its usual thundershock attacks. Yet because they are not in the real world, the lighting is made to be red and blue! And it is this four-second shot of red light rapidly transitioning to blue, caused by Pikachu and <em>not </em>sweet dear Porygon, that caused this unprecedented event.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There had been no previous recording of the color of light having any significant impact on seizures. Yet research afterwards following this event, partly funded by the government and TV network themselves, showed that it was specifically the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.31405.x">red colored light</a> that was responsible. The animators at the time had no reason to believe that using red light could cause such a devastating catastrophe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers like <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1528-1167.2005.31405.x">Harding discovered that photosensitive seizures were usually triggered at a rate of 5 to 25 flashes per second</a>, although some people can be triggered anywhere between three flashes per second and 60 per second. Therefore, Harding proposed that broadcasters go frame by frame on their media and check the exact rate the flashes of light occurred, along with the exact amount of screen space they took up. He recommended that oscillating patterns, and high contrast dark/light images should not take up more than 25% of the screen. These guidelines are still in place today <a href="https://www.tv-tokyo.co.jp/kouhou/guideenglish.htm">in Japan</a> and<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00v5j2v"> the UK</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naturally, going frame by frame is incredibly time consuming. So Harding was asked by the UK and Japanese regulating committees if he could come up with a better, quicker method of testing if a piece of media was safe to show or not. Working together, Graham and Polly Harding created a computer program that would do the check for them. This is now known as <em>“The Harding Test”</em> and it is still a legal requirement for all broadcast media in the UK and Japan to be put through this program and given a “pass,” although it should be noted that the parameters for passing are<a href="https://www.epilepsy.org.uk/press/photosensitive-epilepsy-and-online-content"> stricter in Japan than in the UK</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Japan, the stricter rules for passing the Harding Test have resulted in techniques known as <a href="https://animecorner.me/what-is-anime-dimming-and-why-is-it-porygons-fault/">“dimming” and “ghosting</a>”. Dimming is when, in order to pass the test, footage will have a dark filter placed over the top that mutes the contrasting colors and reduces the amount of luminance contrast on the screen. It will also help to reduce the amount of red light that is used. “Ghosting” meanwhile, is when frames will be layered on top of one another to create a smoother transition. This method has been used in series such as <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/tag/my-hero-academia/"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/tag/attack-on-titan/"><em>Attack on Titan</em></a>. However, it does have an impact on the overall appearance of the series. This is something that Western anime fans have been incredibly vocal about, especially when Season 2 of <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/tag/jujutsu-kaisen/"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a> aired: many viewers were furious at how these safety techniques were used, claiming that they absolutely ruined the whole series for them. Over 2500 fans signed a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/remove-ghosting-and-dimming-from-jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-on-crunchyroll">change.org petition</a> asking Crunchyroll to take down this edited, safe, version of the series and instead upload an unedited version that was true to the original vision—even if it had the potential to cause seizures.</p>



<h2>Western Mockery of Basic Accessibility, or: “But I’m not Epileptic!”</h2>



<p>I have seen many fans, in the face of being told the reason for these changes, say that it doesn’t matter because they aren’t personally epileptic. This is, as you might understand, incredibly personally frustrating, and yes, very ableist. In saying this, these fans claim that disabled people do not have a right to feel safe when watching their favorite series, and that their wellbeing doesn’t matter in comparison to a few brighter shots of teenagers using their magic powers to punch each other.&nbsp;</p>







<p>It also needs reminding, that Pokémon Shock scientifically proved that anybody <em>regardless of their history with seizures</em> can experience one if exposed to certain stimuli. In fact, the care that TV Tokyo and the Japanese Broadcast Industry as a whole have towards photosensitive viewers makes anime one of the safest things for photosensitive people to watch. (Though there are, of course, exceptions. For example, my mother suffers from photosensitive migraines and had one triggered by the opening of <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/tag/spy-x-family/"><em>Spy X Family</em></a><em> </em>Season 2.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seizures are also incredibly serious and have a huge emotional and physical toll on a person. Many epileptics, even if not diagnosed with photosensitivity, will choose to stay away from strobe effects out of fear of it triggering a seizure. Seizures that occur after a long period of time are known as “breakthrough seizures,” and can happen unexpectedly even decades after your last. This is why many epileptics choose not to take part in any activity that might result in having a seizure or where a seizure would make a situation worse. In worst case scenarios, people can even die from Tonic Clonic seizures. This is known as <a href="https://epilepsysociety.org.uk/SUDEP">“Sudden Death in Epilepsy” or “SUDEP,”</a> and is something that many people with epilepsy must live with. That one day they could have a seizure and never wake up from it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To all the Western fans who dismiss concerns about photosensitivity: I want to take you through my personal last Tonic Clonic Seizure. I woke up in a hospital room covered in wires, a cannula in each arm, absolutely no idea how I got there, and a back that made me understand what a 10 on the pain scale was. Whilst the doctors tried to work out why I had had a Tonic Clonic seizure after having been free of them since infancy—previously I’d only had absences and myoclonics—I learnt that I had managed to somehow fracture my back during my seizure. Whilst they were only stress fractures, not a full break, over a year later I am still unable to stand for more than five minutes without experiencing intense pain. Seizures are serious business.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Current State of Photosensitivity in Animation</h2>



<p>Sadly, this willful dismissal of the facts continues to happen in American animation and appears to be getting worse. In 2018 Pixar released their long awaited sequel to <em>The Incredibles</em>. The sequel included scenes where the villain uses strobe effects to hypnotise and mind control his victims. The scene lasted for 90 seconds, and also included a repetitive black and white hypnotic pattern. <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/18/health/incredibles-2-seizures-warning-bn/index.htm">Reports</a> soon came in of children having seizures in the cinema, although the number of those affected is unknown. After the first seizure reports came through, Disney released a request for cinemas to put up signs warning that the scene could trigger photosensitive people. Unlike with “Electric Soldier Porygon” the movie continued to be shown unedited in American cinemas throughout its entire run. Since the movie failed to pass the Harding Test, an alternative cut had to be shown in the UK, Ireland, and Japan. This meant that for at least two months of its theatrical run, Pixar had a safe cut they could show to English speaking American audiences and yet still chose to have the unsafe version in US cinemas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking safety into consideration when animating does naturally lead to some difficult choices and challenges. Sometimes you have to remove certain things to pass through regulations but in the right hands this can be seen as a challenge to be risen to. Ufotable is one such company. Having seen that companies like MAPPA were opting for dimming and ghosting effects to let them pass the Harding Test, and then<a href="https://gamerant.com/anime-ghosting-dimming-explained/"> just removing them later for BluRay </a>release (because apparently photosensitive folk don’t like owning shows on disc and only want to watch them on TV), <a href="http://digitalteam.ufotable.co.jp/2021/11/vs-harding.html?m=1">Ufotable decided</a> that they would not compromise their original vision at all. So when producing the TV cut of <a href="https://www.animefeminist.com/tag/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba/"><em>Demon Slayer: Mugen Train</em></a> instead of lazily applying filters, they painstakingly went through frame by frame to alter the individual elements that had caused the problems to occur and change small elements that would make it safe for people to watch. It proves that you can create beautifully animated action sequences and not have to put a keep out sign on the door to prevent disabled people from watching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2019, Disney’s <em>Descendents </em>actor Cameron Boyce died as a result of an epileptic seizure at just age 20. Another victim to SUDEP, his death was met with both mourning from fans… and a social media trend known as the “<a href="https://www.capitalfm.com/news/tv-film/cameron-boyce-challenge-dead-epilepsy-seizure/">Cameron Boyce Challenge</a>” where people pretended to have a seizure. Disability discrimination, and epileptic discrimination in particular, is still very much prevalent in every step of our society. Yet, if it is one thing that Porygon has shown us, it is that there are people out there who <em>do </em>care. There are those, like Graham and Polly Harding, who want to dedicate their lives to helping people with epilepsy have full and enriching lives. And yes, that does very much include being able to join in with the discussion of what happened on the latest episode of that thing you all love.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The fact that more people around the world are able to enjoy anime in a safe format, that this format is easily available on platforms like Crunchyroll as well as on broadcast TV, is a thing to be celebrated. As an Epileptic, I believe “Electric Soldier Porygon”<em> </em>has led to a net benefit to all photosensitive people around the world. Whilst the events of that day are horrific and should never be joked about, the positive change that occurred helped to protect the lives of far more people than those immediately affected. So I say, Porygon was innocent! He did nothing wrong at all! Let him back into the anime, and into our lives, as the icon for improvements in animation and a symbol for things getting better in the world.&nbsp;</p>

					<div><p><span>NEW YORK and CHICAGO, Nov. 13, 2024 — </span><a href="https://www.wonder.com/"><span>Wonder</span></a><span>, a new kind of food hall that is revolutionizing the food industry by creating the super app for mealtime, announced that it is acquiring </span><a href="https://www.grubhub.com/"><span>Grubhub</span></a><span>, a leading food ordering and delivery platform with more than 375,000 merchants and 200,000 delivery partners across the United States. </span><span>Integrating Grubhub with Wonder is the next step in Wonder’s mission to make great food more accessible, bringing together the convenience, speed and selection of first-party and third-party restaurants, groceries and meal kits in a single app order.</span> <span>Additionally, all Wonder locations will be available on Grubhub for third-party delivery.</span></p>
<p><span>Wonder will acquire Grubhub from Just Eat Takeaway.com for an enterprise value of $650 million, including $500 million of senior notes and $150 million cash. Completion is expected during Q1 2025, subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals. Jefferies served as Wonder’s exclusive financial advisor on the transaction.</span></p>
<p><span>Wonder has also announced an additional $250 million in capital raised exclusively from new investors to further its mission and growth.</span></p>

Beyond its consumer delivery marketplace, Grubhub has a </span><a href="https://www.grubhub.com/about/campus"><span>Campus Dining</span></a><span> business that powers online ordering at more than 360 universities and a </span><a href="https://corporate.grubhub.com/"><span>Corporate Accounts</span></a><span> business that provides flexible meal perks platforms for more than 10,000 companies.</span></p>
<p><span>“Wonder’s acquisition of Grubhub continues our mission to make great food more accessible. As we enhance our customer experience with selection, speed, and variety, we’re excited to soon offer a curated selection of Grubhub’s restaurant partners directly in the Wonder app, alongside our owned and operated restaurants and meal kits,” said Marc Lore, Founder and CEO of Wonder. “Bringing Wonder and Grubhub together is the next step in our vision to create the super app for meal time, re-envisioning the future of food delivery.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“I am incredibly excited for Grubhub to join forces with Wonder and bring more value to our diners, merchants and delivery partners,” said Howard Migdal, Grubhub CEO. “Since our earliest days, Grubhub has helped restaurants open their doors to new customers, while introducing diners to new cuisines. That’s why I’m confident that Grubhub will complement Wonder’s mission to make great food more accessible and that together we will create remarkable dining experiences for more customers across the country.”</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Jungle music was found in countless games from the early 90s. This article explains what jungle is, where it comes from, and why its soundtrack was such a perfect match for titles of the PlayStation &amp; Nintendo 64 era.</p><div>
                        <p>This blog post will be fundamentally different and less technical than the other ones we have in our school website. You might be surprised to find an entire blog post dedicated to a style of music in an education platform, but the more I studied and learned about this topic, the more I realized how much some of my life-long passions overlapped. We are about to go on a journey filled with game development history, retro 3D polygons, electronic music, old synths, samplers, and audio production using ancient Amiga &amp; Atari computers. It's a beautiful thing!</p>
                        <p>The 90s saw 3D polygons taking over the main stage in people's homes with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" target="_blank">Sony PlayStation</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Saturn" target="_blank">Sega Saturn</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64" target="_blank">Nintendo 64</a>. This generation of 32-bit consoles not only redefined our understanding of game graphics but also helped in amplifying the reach of a new style of music around the globe.</p>
                        <p>Born in the UK in the end of the 80s, Jungle music was full of energetic drum patterns, tasty bass lines, and a high tempo that matched the fast-pace nature of these new 3D titles. Combine all these elements with that naïve <i>"hope for the future"</i> that was flowing in the air in the 90s and we get ourselves an amazing decade to be alive!</p>

                        <h3>Looking Back</h3>
                        <p>Let's position ourselves back in time to contemplate what was really happening in terms of music and technology. We'll briefly review the birth of electronic music and explore its evolution until we reach the early days of jungle music.</p>
                        <p>Up until the 70s and 80s, the vast majority of instruments used in recordings and live concerts were <i>organic</i>. We are just leaving the 50s and 60s which were the peak years of jazz albums using drums, bass, acoustic pianos, trumpet, saxophone, etc. The evolution of the urban sound of the Chicago blues and the popularity of rock &amp; roll music changed things a bit, for we could already find many instruments using electricity to either produce, amplify, or distort sound. Electric guitars, tonewheel organs, electric pianos, and many other instruments were now using electricity and mechanical parts to create music. But still, they were fundamentally <i>organic</i> instruments that did not use any form of digital transformation to produce or alter sound waves.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/hammond-rhodes.png" alt="hammond organ fender rhodes"></p><p>Both the Hammond B3 organ and the Fender Rhodes are electro-mechanic instruments</p>
                        <p>The 80s saw an explosion of digital equipment being used in music production. Synthesizers became the mascots of 80s music and digital computers were now being largely used to create, record, and edit audio. Sequencers, drum machines, samples, and software-based instruments were now being used to create the music that was being broadcasted to the world. We were seeing the birth to the electronic dance music (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music" target="_blank">EDM</a>) scene, which is strongly associated to the culture of raves &amp; clubbers.</p>

                        <p>By the late 80s and early 90s, the advent of the home computer with multimedia capabilities allowed virtually anyone that owned a computer to create and record music. Not only big music labels were able to produce high-quality albums, but many independent artists had the chance to do so from improvised digital home studios.</p>

                        <p>Most of this production was happening in rich countries with easy access to technology, like US, UK, and Germany. The techno scene originated in Germany, reached the UK, and it was later associated with the Chicago &amp; Detroit EDM scene in America.</p>

                        <h3>The Early Days of Jungle Music</h3>
                        <p>Music producers started to explore using different tempos and including different break patterns in their tracks. One popular technique was to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(musical_instrument)" target="_blank">sampler</a> to isolate and record parts of existing songs and use them to create new tunes. In simple terms, a sampler is a musical instrument that can record and play back samples (portions of sound recordings). The most popular samplers from that era were the ones from AKAI.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/akai-s1100.jpg" alt="akai s1100"></p><p>The AKAI S1100 was one of the first samplers that could add effects to audio (reverbs, delays, echoes).</p>
                        <p>UK producers started to use samplers to isolate drums from existing songs and create different break patterns for their own tracks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabio_(DJ)" target="_blank">Fabio</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grooverider" target="_blank">Grooverider</a> are considered by many the two originators of Jungle. Famous jungle producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldie" target="_blank">Goldie</a> even mentioned in an interview that Fabio was the first person to ever use the term "jungle" to describe this new style of music. Both Fabio and Grooverider started mixing R&amp;B and Funk tunes with fast-tempo beats from techno &amp; house tracks. They noticed that people enjoyed the combination so they started using the same formula in their own productions. They would browse their collection of R&amp;B albums and sample drum breaks that could then be chopped up &amp; rearranged to serve as a foundation for a new song.</p>
                        <h5>The "Amen Break"</h5>
                        <p>One of the first challenges is to find a good drum break. The method consists in browsing one's vinyl collection looking for a clear drum solo that can be isolated, sampled, and chopped up. The following audio is an excerpt of a very popular drum break that was used many times in jungle music production. The song is called "Amen Brother!" and it was recorded in 1969 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winstons" target="_blank">The Winstons</a>.</p>

                        <p>This is arguably the most popular sample in the history of jungle music. The drum break above was sped up, sampled, and used in so many tracks that it was even awarded a special name: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break" target="_blank"><i>The Amen Break</i></a>.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/amen-break-notation.svg" alt="amen break notation"></p><p>Drum notation for the Amen break</p>
                        <p>Of course, the Amen break is not the only famous drum pattern used by jungle artists. Other classic drum samples also became famous and are instantly recognizable by jungle listeners. Examples of popular drum breaks are:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        <h3>Chopping Things Up</h3>
                        <p>UK producers started to chop up breaks, add synths, pads, chords, vocals, and many other elements on top of the original drum pattern.</p>
                        <p>Back in the day, most electronic producers would glue all these pieces together using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" target="_blank">Commodore Amiga</a> or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST" target="_blank">Atari ST</a> computer. A very popular tracker that could be used to chop up samples from the early jungle days was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OctaMED">OctaMED</a> on the Amiga.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/octamed.jpg" alt="octamed"></p><p>OctaMED tracker on the Commodore Amiga</p>
                        <p>Some producers also used a MIDI sequencer called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinberg_Cubase" target="_blank">Cubase</a> on the Atari ST. They could connect samplers and synths to the computer via MIDI and sequence a track using the advanced (at the time) features of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinberg" target="_blank">Steinberg's</a> software. Nowadays, Cubase is a complete digital audio workstation (DAW) that can record, arrange, and edit audio. But the first Cubase version that ran on the Atari ST was originally only a MIDI sequencer.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/cubase-atari-st.jpg" alt="cubase atari st"></p><p>Cubase sequencer on the Atari ST</p>
                        <p>Many jungle tunes have staple synth, strings, and pads sounds. Some famous synths &amp; keyboards from this era were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet-5" target="_blank">Sequential Prophet-5</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_CZ_synthesizers" target="_blank">Casio CZ-1000</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korg_Poly-61" target="_blank">Korg Poly-61</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Alpha_Juno" target="_blank">Roland Alpha Juno</a>.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/jungle-synths.png" alt="jungle synths"></p><p>The Prophet-5, the Korg Poly-61, and the Casio CZ-1000 were largely used in early EDM recordings</p>
                        <p>To give you a taste of what the final product sounds like, the track below is an example of a complete song produced by Andy C &amp; Ant Miles called "Valley of the Shadows" from 1992. It uses sampled drums, bass, keyboards, and vocals.</p>

                        <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: It's very common for jungle tracks to use samples extracted from movies &amp; TV shows. The "long dark tunnel" sample above is from a late 80s BBC Q.E.D. science documentary about near death experiences.</p>

                        <h3>The Jamaican Influence</h3>
                        <p>Jungle music was always strongly associated with the Jamaican culture and has strong roots in elements of Jamaican music. During the UK growth period following the Second World War, Caribbean people were strongly encouraged to immigrate to the United Kingdom to help with jobs and the development of the country. They brought their families and traditions to the UK and slowly started infusing their culture into the communities they became a part of. This included food, clothing, language, and of course, music.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/jamaica-mc.jpg" alt="jamaica jungle"></p><p>The <i>Sound System</i> is an important part of Jamaican culture and history.</p>
                        <p>The UK rave scene that brought large groups of people together to hear and celebrate electronic dance music was very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_system_(Jamaican)" target="_blank">Jamaican sound system.</a> The sound system represented a gathering site and social mixing where a group of DJs and MCs played mostly ska, dancehall, and reggae music. The sound system found a new home in the UK and it is an important part of Jamaican culture which largely influenced the UK hardcode and jungle scene. Samples of Jamaican music with ragga vocals and dubs are very common in the early days of jungle.</p>
                        <p>The track below is a classic example of jungle with Jamaican ragga vocals. "Champion Dj" was recorded by Blackstar (a.k.a. Congo Natty, a.k.a. Rebel MC) and Top Cat:</p>

                        <p>Another great example of Jamaican ragga vocals is the jungle version of "How The West Was Won" by Bounty Killer. Bounty Killer started in the dancehall industry in Kingston and is now worldwide famous for his aggressive vocal style:</p>

                        <h3>Jungle Evolution &amp; Subgenres</h3>
                        <p>It was very difficult for rave culture to be embraced by the mainstream media in its early days, mainly because of its association with drug use in the UK. While licensed radio stations would flat out refuse to play any underground music, pirated stations were happy to do so.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Unlicensed stations began streaming jungle music from onboard ships off the coast of Britain, hence the expression "pirate radios." These illegal streaming sites would soon move to city council flats (housing facilities similar to what Americans call “the projects”). Popular jungle producer <a hreg="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roni_Size" target="_blank">Roni Size</a> mentioned in an interview that he used to live in a council flat with prepaid electricity and he could only work 15-20 minutes on a track before the flat ran out of electricity and he was forced to top up the meter.</p>
                        <p>Pirate radios such as <a href="" target="_blank">Kool FM</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_(UK_radio_station)" target="_blank">Kiss FM</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinse_FM" target="_blank">Rinse FM</a> were undeniably one of the big reasons jungle music became so popular in the UK. These pirate stations were built around communities and helped stream the style to thousands of listeners every day.</p>
                        <p>Jungle music grew, evolved, and gave birth to many subgenres:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li><strong>Ragga</strong>: A subgenre where jungle breaks contain Jamaican dub samples and ragga vocals by MCs. Popular names of the ragga jungle style are Serial Killaz, Rebel MC, General Levy, Benny Page, Shy FX, Top Cat, Sizzla, M-Beat, Krinjah, and Jacky Murda.</li>
                          <li><strong>Atmospheric</strong>: Jungle breaks with atmospheric sounds made from synth pads and keyboards. Artists like LTJ Bukem, 4Hero, and Artemis helped spread the style and the label Good Looking Records became a synonym of ambient and atmospheric jungle.</li>
                          <li><strong>Liquid</strong>: Liquid jungle or sometimes called Liquid funk uses several influences from soul &amp; funk music, including melodic vocals and R&amp;B basslines similar to the ones found in house and trance music. A few examples of liquid jungle artists are High Contrast, Calibre, Netsky, Makoto, Solid State, and Nu:Tone.</li>
                          <li><strong>Jazzstep</strong>: Jungle breaks combined with organic jazz instruments like upright bass, Rhodes piano, organ, saxophone, trumpet, and sometimes played using a real live drum kit instead of electronic drum samples. Some known jazzy jungle producers are Roni Size, Alex Reece, LTJ Bukem, London Elektricity, EZ-Rollers, and A-Sides.</li>
                          <li><strong>Darkstep</strong>: Heavy use of deep pads with low frequencies to achieve a dark mood; often includes samples from horror movies. Popular darkstep artists are Goldie, Limewax, Dieselboy, Bad Company, 4Hero, Ray Keith, and Black Sun Empire.</li>
                          <li><strong>Techstep</strong>: A subgenre characterized by removing the R&amp;B influence and the lack of organic instruments. It contains a dark sci-fi mood and near exclusive use of synthesized or sampled sound sources. It brings many influences from industrial techno music and some popular names of the style are Ed Rush, Trace, and other artists from the Metalheadz label.</li>
                          <li><strong>Sambass</strong>: This style uses Brazilian elements from samba, bossa nova, and other Latin music styles on top of a drum'n'bass base. The pioneers of this style are Patife, Marky, XRS, and Drumagick.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>By the second half of the 90s, jungle music was everywhere and as a consequence the sound ended up losing a bit of its essence. At the same time, the party drug of choice switched from ecstasy to cocaine and the atmosphere of the rave scene started to change. Wanting to distance themselves from this environment and aiming to gain more mainstream space, producers began to tweak the formula further, removing the ragga and reggae influences from their tunes but keeping the same fast BPM breaks and heavy basslines. This new style was named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_and_bass" target="_blank">drum'n'bass</a> and it achieved massive popularity in the following years.</p>

                        <h3>Electronic &amp; Jungle Music in 90s Games</h3>
                        <p>Jungle and many other genres of EDM were a perfect match for the fast-pace games that were developed in the 90s. Most of the titles using a jungle soundtrack were from the second half of the decade, although the trend continued all the way up through the mid 2000s.</p>
                        <p>Consoles from this generation were also able to store and play CD-quality audio, which meant developers could really take advantage of the entire spectrum of frequencies and sounds that both jungle &amp; drum'n'bass demanded.</p>
                        <p>Many PlayStation &amp; Nintendo 64 games dipped into different subgenres of jungle as different levels required different moods. Atmospheric &amp; ambient were often used in games with a futuristic or space-like style. Some developers would prefer a calmer jazzy track for menus and transition levels, while other games required a more chaotic high-BPM track for levels where the objective was to create tension.</p>

                        <h5>Wipeout</h5>
                        <p>Back in 1994, Sony was getting everything ready for the release of the PlayStation. Sony knew that it needed two important things to succeed in the following years: an easy SDK and a set of competent developers that would help them create exciting games for the new console.</p>
                        <p>One of Sony's big decisions before the release of the PlayStation was the acquisition of the British game development studio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psygnosis" target="_blank">Psygnosis</a>. The Liverpool-based studio was involved not only in the development of the official PlayStation SDK but also in launch titles for the console.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important games for the Sony PlayStation was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wipeout_(video_game)" target="_blank">Wipeout</a>. Unique at the time, the game was noted for its futuristic setting and by its influence of electronic music and rave scene. The development of Wipeout overlapped with a boom in popularity of EDM, and the British-based developers were able to inject their experiences from the UK rave scene into the game's sound and visuals.</p>
                        <p><img src="https://pikuma.com/images/blog/jungle-music-video-game-drum-bass/wipeout.png" alt="wipeout game"></p><p>Psygnosis' Wipeout for the Sony PlayStation</p>
                        <p>1994 was considered by many as "the summer of jungle". Many legal stations started to play the style and several CD compilations of jungle music appeared on store shelves.</p>
                        <p>Wipeout's electronic music soundtrack featured original in-house compositions by Tim Wright (a.k.a. CoLD SToRAGE) and some modern versions of the series also include tracks from famous EDM artist like Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, New Order and The Prodigy.</p>
                        <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: Tim Wright mentioned in an interview that he did not really enjoy electronic music culture before his work on Wipeout, and he was actually disappointed when the marketing team gave him a box of EDM albums to serve "as inspiration" for the new game's soundtrack. Tim also mentioned that he only fully understood the mood that the development team wanted once he was forced to visit a UK underground club and experience the sound and the culture by himself.</p>

                        <h5>Rage Racer</h5>
                        <p>It is impossible to talk about jungle music on PlayStation games without mentioning the prolificity and the influence of composer <a href="https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/Tetsukazu_Nakanishi" target="_blank">Tetsukazu Nakanishi</a>, who joined Namco in 1996 to work on the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Racer" target="_blank">Rage Racer</a>.</p>

                        <p>Nakanishi's compositions can be found in many games from this era, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Combat" target="_blank">Ace Combat, </a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_Racer" target="_blank">Ridge Racer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken" target="_blank">Tekken</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_%26_My_Katamari" target="_blank">Me &amp; My Katamari</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klonoa:_Door_to_Phantomile" target="_blank">Klonoa: Door To Phantomile</a>, and many others.</p>

                        <h5>Ace Combat</h5>
                        <p>One of Nakanishi's most notable contributions is the music of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Combat" target="_blank">Ace Combat</a>. Even though most of the game soundtrack does not really go too deep into electronic music, some of the tracks were influenced by jungle elements. The following track is called "Dead End" and it's part of Ace Combat 2's original soundtrack.</p>

                        <h5>Klonoa: Door To Phantomile</h5>
                        <p>Namco released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klonoa:_Door_to_Phantomile" target="_blank">Klonoa: Door To Phantomile</a> in 1998 and the game soundtrack included many jungle tracks. The song below is called "Beats from Above" and it's part of the original soundtrack composed by Nakanishi.</p>

                        <h5>Gran Turismo</h5>
                        <p>Another great example of PlayStation title with a beautiful jungle soundtrack is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gran_Turismo_(series)" target="_blank">Gran Turismo</a>. The artist behind the tracks is the Japanese guitarrist and composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masahiro_Andoh" target="_blank">Masahiro Andō</a>. Andō was comissioned by the studio <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony_Digital" target="_blank">Polyphony Digital</a> in 1997 to create the music for the game. The following track is called "High" and it is only present in the western version of the game. If you listen closely, you'll spot the use of a modified <i>Think break.</i></p>

                        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_of_the_Samurai" target="_blank">Soul of the Samurai</a> was a PlayStation exclusive released and published by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami" target="_blank">Konami</a> in 1999.

                        <h5>Ape Escape</h5>
                        <p>Composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soichi_Terada" target="_blank">Soichi Terada</a> has plenty of experience with electronic music and was never able to hide his passion for jungle music. You can hear some of his best work in the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ape_Escape" target="_blank">Ape Escape</a> from 1999. One of the game directors listened to Terada's work on the album <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrTZV1oyUMM" target="_blank">Sumo Jungle</a> and approached him to compose the music for the game.</p>
                        <p>The music changes in-game depending on the situation and level; for example, should players act stealthily, the music alters slightly to give the gameplay a mellow atmosphere. The track below is called "Snowy Mammoth" and it is just one example of many beautiful jungle tunes included in this game's soundtrack.</p>

                        <h5>Bomberman</h5>
                        <p>The Nintendo 64 also had its share of jungle soundtracks. One great example is the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jun_Chikuma" target="_blank">June Chikuma</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomberman" target="_blank">Bomberman</a> series.

                        <p>We could also find amazing jungle music for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamcast" target="_blank">Sega Dreamcast</a> console. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Marine_Fishing" target="_blank">Sega Marine Fishing</a>, released in 1999 as a sequel to 1997's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sega_Bass_Fishing" target="_blank">Sega Bass Fishing</a>. The game was also available for the Sega NAOMI arcade &amp; for Windows/PC but one unique aspect of the Dreamcast version was that users could play the game using the Dreamcast fishing rod controller. Makoto Iida was the composer for both Sega Bass Fishing &amp; Sega Marine Fishing.</p>

                        <h5>Magical Tetris Challenge</h5>
                        <p>It's funny how you could find jungle breaks in unexpected places. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Tetris_Challenge" target="_blank">Magical Tetris Challenge</a> was a puzzle game featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" target="_blank">Disney</a> characters that was released by Capcom in 1998 for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_64" target="_blank">Nintendo 64</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy_Color" target="_blank">Game Boy Color</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console)" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. It is one of the few Nintendo 64 games to be entirely in 2D, in addition to being Capcom's first game for the console. Masato Kouda composed the soundtrack for both Nintendo 64 &amp; PlayStation consoles and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harumi_Fujita" target="_blank">Harumi Fujita</a> composed the tracks for the Game Boy Color.</p>

                        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                        <p>This topic is so much fun! And the best thing is that it never ends; I keep discovering new games and new jungle tracks from that era almost every week. Every once in a while I find a new port or a new game composer that was clearly influenced by the 90s jungle scene.</p>
                        <p>It goes without saying that it would be impossible to include a full list of all games with jungle soundtrack. I have decided to mention just a small list of titles that really caught my attention when I was younger. If you have a suggestion of a game or a soundtrack from that period that you think I should have included in my selection, feel free to <a hreg="https://x.com/pikuma" target="_blank">drop me a message on Twitter</a> and I'll see what I can do about it.</p>
                        <p>I hope this whole thing was informative and fun...</p>

            <p>As the world struggles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, researchers are seeking practical, economical ways to capture carbon dioxide and convert it into useful products, such as transportation fuels, chemical feedstocks, or even building materials. But so far, such attempts have struggled to reach economic viability.</p><p>New research by engineers at MIT could lead to rapid improvements in a variety of electrochemical systems that are under development to convert carbon dioxide into a valuable commodity. The team developed a new design for the electrodes used in these systems, which increases the efficiency of the conversion process.</p><p>The findings are reported today in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>, in a paper by MIT doctoral student Simon Rufer, professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi, and three others.</p><p>“The CO2 problem is a big challenge for our times, and we are using all kinds of levers to solve and address this problem,” Varanasi says. It will be essential to find practical ways of removing the gas, he says, either from sources such as power plant emissions, or straight out of the air or the oceans. But then, once the CO2 has been removed, it has to go somewhere.</p><p>A wide variety of systems have been developed for converting that captured gas into a useful chemical product, Varanasi says. “It’s not that we can’t do it — we can do it. But the question is how can we make this efficient? How can we make this cost-effective?”</p><p>In the new study, the team focused on the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to ethylene, a widely used chemical that can be made into a variety of plastics as well as fuels, and which today is made from petroleum. But the approach they developed could also be applied to producing other high-value chemical products as well, including methane, methanol, carbon monoxide, and others, the researchers say.</p><p>Currently, ethylene sells for about $1,000 per ton, so the goal is to be able to meet or beat that price. The electrochemical process that converts CO2 into ethylene involves a water-based solution and a catalyst material, which come into contact along with an electric current in a device called a gas diffusion electrode.</p><p>There are two competing characteristics of the gas diffusion electrode materials that affect their performance: They must be good electrical conductors so that the current that drives the process doesn’t get wasted through resistance heating, but they must also be “hydrophobic,” or water repelling, so the water-based electrolyte solution doesn’t leak through and interfere with the reactions taking place at the electrode surface.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s a tradeoff. Improving the conductivity reduces the hydrophobicity, and vice versa. Varanasi and his team set out to see if they could find a way around that conflict, and after many months of work, they did just that.</p><p>The solution, devised by Rufer and Varanasi, is elegant in its simplicity. They used a plastic material, PTFE (essentially Teflon), that has been known to have good hydrophobic properties. However, PTFE’s lack of conductivity means that electrons must travel through a very thin catalyst layer, leading to significant voltage drop with distance. To overcome this limitation, the researchers wove a series of conductive copper wires through the very thin sheet of the PTFE.</p><p>“This work really addressed this challenge, as we can now get both conductivity and hydrophobicity,” Varanasi says.</p><p>Research on potential carbon conversion systems tends to be done on very small, lab-scale samples, typically less than 1-inch (2.5-centimeter) squares. To demonstrate the potential for scaling up, Varanasi’s team produced a sheet 10 times larger in area and demonstrated its effective performance.</p><p>To get to that point, they had to do some basic tests that had apparently never been done before, running tests under identical conditions but using electrodes of different sizes to analyze the relationship between conductivity and electrode size. They found that conductivity dropped off dramatically with size, which would mean much more energy, and thus cost, would be needed to drive the reaction.</p><p>“That’s exactly what we would expect, but it was something that nobody had really dedicatedly investigated before,” Rufer says. In addition, the larger sizes produced more unwanted chemical byproducts besides the intended ethylene.</p><p>Real-world industrial applications would require electrodes that are perhaps 100 times larger than the lab versions, so adding the conductive wires will be necessary for making such systems practical, the researchers say. They also developed a model which captures the spatial variability in voltage and product distribution on electrodes due to ohmic losses. The model along with the experimental data they collected enabled them to calculate the optimal spacing for conductive wires to counteract the drop off in conductivity.</p><p>In effect, by weaving the wire through the material, the material is divided into smaller subsections determined by the spacing of the wires. “We split it into a bunch of little subsegments, each of which is effectively a smaller electrode,” Rufer says. “And as we’ve seen, small electrodes can work really well.”</p><p>Because the copper wire is so much more conductive than the PTFE material, it acts as a kind of superhighway for electrons passing through, bridging the areas where they are confined to the substrate and face greater resistance.</p><p>To demonstrate that their system is robust, the researchers ran a test electrode for 75 hours continuously, with little change in performance. Overall, Rufer says, their system “is the first PTFE-based electrode which has gone beyond the lab scale on the order of 5 centimeters or smaller. It’s the first work that has progressed into a much larger scale and has done so without sacrificing efficiency.”</p><p>The weaving process for incorporating the wire can be easily integrated into existing manufacturing processes, even in a large-scale roll-to-roll process, he adds.</p><p>“Our approach is very powerful because it doesn’t have anything to do with the actual catalyst being used,” Rufer says. “You can sew this micrometric copper wire into any gas diffusion electrode you want, independent of catalyst morphology or chemistry. So, this approach can be used to scale anybody’s electrode.”</p><p>“Given that we will need to process gigatons of CO2 annually to combat the CO2 challenge, we really need to think about solutions that can scale,” Varanasi says. “Starting with this mindset enables us to identify critical bottlenecks and develop innovative approaches that can make a meaningful impact in solving the problem. Our hierarchically conductive electrode is a result of such thinking.”</p><p>The research team included MIT graduate students Michael Nitzsche and Sanjay Garimella,&nbsp; as well as Jack Lake PhD ’23. The work was supported by Shell, through the MIT Energy Initiative.</p>

<p dir="auto">This project was born out of a desire to help a friend who couldn't use his favorite Bluetooth mouse and keyboard due to Bluetooth being disabled on his work laptop. As someone who enjoys tinkering and problem-solving, I saw this as an opportunity to create something useful while learning more about Linux internals, USB gadgets, and Go programming. The Raspberry Pi Zero became the perfect bridge, connecting Bluetooth peripherals to computers that wouldn't normally allow it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-permalink-context="/2024/Nov/12/qwen25-coder/">

<p>12th November 2024</p>



<p>There’s a whole lot of buzz around the new <a href="https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/qwen2.5-coder-family/">Qwen2.5-Coder Series</a> of open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) LLM releases from Alibaba’s Qwen research team. On first impression it looks like the buzz is well deserved.</p>
<p>Qwen claim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct has become the current SOTA open-source code model, matching the coding capabilities of GPT-4o.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s a <em>big</em> claim for a 32B model that’s small enough that it can run on my 64GB MacBook Pro M2. The Qwen published scores look impressive, comparing favorably with GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet (October 2024) edition across various code-related benchmarks:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/qwen-scores.jpg" alt="In benchmark comparisons, Qwen 2.5 Coder (32B Instruct) outperforms both GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet on LiveCodeBench, Spider, and BIRD-SQL metrics, falls behind on MBPP, Aider, and CodeArena, shows mixed results on MultiPL-E, and performs similarly on HumanEval and McEval benchmarks."></p>
<p>How about benchmarks from other researchers? Paul Gauthier’s <a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">Aider benchmarks</a> have a great reputation and <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1856018124031832236">Paul reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The new Qwen 2.5 Coder models did very well on aider’s code editing benchmark. The 32B Instruct model scored in between GPT-4o and 3.5 Haiku.</p>
<p>84% 3.5 Sonnet,
75% 3.5 Haiku,
74% Qwen2.5 Coder 32B,
71% GPT-4o,
69% Qwen2.5 Coder 14B,
58% Qwen2.5 Coder 7B</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/qwen-paul.jpg" alt="Those numbers as a chart"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was for the Aider “whole edit” benchmark. The “diff” benchmark <a href="https://twitter.com/paulgauthier/status/1856042640279777420">scores well</a> too, with Qwen2.5 Coder 32B tying with GPT-4o (but a little behind Claude 3.5 Haiku).</p>
<p>Given these scores (and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1gp84in/qwen25coder_32b_the_ai_thats_revolutionizing/">positive buzz on Reddit</a>) I had to try it for myself.</p>
<p>My attempts to run the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF">Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-GGUF</a> Q8 using <a href="https://github.com/simonw/llm-gguf">llm-gguf</a> were a bit too slow, because I don’t have that compiled to use my Mac’s GPU at the moment.</p>
<p>But both the <a href="https://ollama.com/">Ollama</a> version <em>and</em> the <a href="https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx">MLX</a> version worked great!</p>
<p>I installed the Ollama version using:</p>
<pre><code>ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:32b
</code></pre>
<p>That fetched a 20GB quantized file. I ran a prompt through that using my <a href="https://llm.datasette.io/">LLM</a> tool and Sergey Alexandrov’s <a href="https://github.com/taketwo/llm-ollama">llm-ollama</a> plugin like this:</p>
<pre><code>llm install llm-ollama
llm models # Confirming the new model is present
llm -m qwen2.5-coder:32b 'python function that takes URL to a CSV file and path to a SQLite database, fetches the CSV with the standard library, creates a table with the right columns and inserts the data'
</code></pre>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/0a47f9e35a50d4e25a47826f4ab75dda">the result</a>. The code worked, but I had to work around a frustrating <code>ssl</code> bug first (which wouldn’t have been an issue if I’d allowed the model to use <code>requests</code> or <code>httpx</code> instead of the standard library).</p>
<p>I also tried running it using the Apple Silicon fast array framework MLX using the <a href="https://github.com/riccardomusmeci/mlx-llm">mlx-llm</a> library directly, run via <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/uv">uv</a> like this:</p>
<pre><code>uv run --with mlx-lm \
  mlx_lm.generate \
  --model mlx-community/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct-8bit \
  --max-tokens 4000 \
  --prompt 'write me a python function that renders a mandelbrot fractal as wide as the current terminal'
</code></pre>
<p>That gave me a <em>very</em> <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/1cc1e0418a04dbd19cd281cf9b43666f">satisfying result</a>—when I ran the code it generated in a terminal I got this:</p>
<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/mlx-fractal.jpg" alt="macOS terminal window displaying a pleasing mandelbrot fractal as ASCII art"></p>
<p>This is a really promising development. 32GB is just small enough that I can run the model on my Mac without having to quit every other application I’m running, and both the speed and the quality of the results feel genuinely competitive with the current best of the hosted models.</p>

<p>Given that code assistance is probably around 80% of my LLM usage at the moment this is a meaningfully useful release for how I engage with this class of technology.</p>

			<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker-compose</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a tool for working with Docker containers. It solves very real problems with deploying complex applications. By itself it is not enough to make self-hosting applications simple enough for the mass-market. What we need is something like docker-compose, but at a higher level of abstraction that has a concept of SQL databases, local caches, durable storage, service discovery, and resource management.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-docker-do">What does docker do?</h2>
<p>I’m actually going to assume that you’re already familiar with <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">containerization</a> as popularized by Docker. Metaphorically, you can think of some host system with an unknown configuration like a ship. The ship can be large or small, efficient or not. It has a method for holding some number of containers. It doesn’t need to care what’s in them, only that they are a standard shape and strength.</p>
<p>A basic system diagram running containers looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tealok.tech/post/docker-compose-isnt-enough/containers-without-compose.png" alt="A stacked-block diagram. At the bottom is the system hardware. Above that is the operating system. Above that is the container runtime, reverse web proxy, and database which run on the operating system. Above the container runtime are containers for an application, including a webapp container and an API container" title="If I had an artist on staff I would have put these blocks into a happy whale-shaped container ship for hopefully obvious reasons."></p>
<p>You’ve got some hardware with an operating system and a container runtime. Containers run within the runtime and talk to some other services like databases or a webserver.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-docker-compose-do">What does docker-compose do?</h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">Docker-compose</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a tool for specifying groups of containers that work together. I’m also going to assume in this article that you’re familiar with the basics. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Docker-compose<!-- raw HTML omitted --> kinda breaks our metaphor - within shipping there’s no reason a given ship would need to position some number of containers together and let them communicate with each other.</p>
<p>This may seem like a minor point, but I want to expand upon it. The entire point of containers is simplifying operations by standardizing the interface. <code>Docker-compose</code> breaks the standardization and recreates the problems that containers originally solved. Within shipping there is the concept of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport">intermodal freight system</a>. <code>Docker-compose</code> should have been like intermodal freight - standardizing interactions between commonly used tools and reducing the cost of switching carrying networks.</p>
<p>That said, <code>docker-compose</code> has been extremely popular as a tool for specifying how to deploy self-hosted applications. It’s declarative and makes it possible to get multiple separate processes (web server, database, cache, background workers, API) to communicate with each other. In order explain where <code>docker-compose</code> falls short it’s useful to build up to an example.</p>
<h3 id="pihole">Pihole</h3>
<p>Let’s look at an application that lots of people want to self-host: <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pihole</a>. Here’s <a href="https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/examples/docker-compose.yml.example">an example docker-compose file</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code># https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/blob/master/README.md

services:
  pihole:
    container_name: pihole
    image: pihole/pihole:latest
    # For DHCP it is recommended to remove these ports and instead add: network_mode: "host"
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "67:67/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"
    environment:
      TZ: 'America/Chicago'
      # WEBPASSWORD: 'set a secure password here or it will be random'
    # Volumes store your data between container upgrades
    volumes:
      - './etc-pihole:/etc/pihole'
      - './etc-dnsmasq.d:/etc/dnsmasq.d'
    #   https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole#note-on-capabilities
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    restart: unless-stopped # Recommended but not required (DHCP needs NET_ADMIN)  
</code></pre><p>This is pretty complex because pihole is a DNS server. We have the <code>name</code> and the <code>image</code> to use, then a slew of ports to open up (53 for the DNS queries, 67 for DHCP, 80 for the web admin interface). There’s some <code>environment</code> that gets passed to the container, including the timezone we are running in and the ability to set a password. <code>Volumes</code> mounts some data from the host into the container, in this case it’s two different directories that store configuration data that can be changed from the web interface. <code>Cap_add</code> grants additional capabilities to the container, <code>NET_ADMIN</code> specifies the ability to configure network interfaces. Finally, <code>restart</code> specifies the behavior when the container crashes. In this case we bring it back up since our entire network is going to depend on it.</p>
<p>Whew! That’s a lot of stuff! And this is running just one container for pihole. It could, in theory, have a separate container for the web admin interface, a separate database, a batch processing container, and on and on.</p>
<p>Pihole could be more like Jitsi Meet</p>
<h3 id="jitsi-meet">Jitsi Meet</h3>
<p><a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-meet/">Jitsi Meet</a> is complex software. It comes with <a href="https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/devops-guide/devops-guide-docker/">a system</a> for <em>generating</em> a <code>docker-compose</code> configuration. That configuration involves 4 different containers in a single network, 7 volumes, 9 ports, and 200+ lines of environment configuration.</p>
<p>I won’t reproduce it here.</p>
<p>This is a bit extreme, but not very much.</p>
<p>Let’s look at some others.</p>
<h3 id="other-applications">Other Applications</h3>
<p>I’m going to choose a few applications that are popular in the self-hosting community, and that I’m familiar with. Some have a single <code>docker-compose</code> configuration, others use scripts to generate it, others have a menu of configurations that you choose from.</p>

<p>On the positive side <code>docker-compose</code> is <strong>far</strong> <strong>easier than raw docker commands.</strong> Each of these configurations would take dozens, if not hundreds of <code>docker</code> commands to reproduce. <code>Docker-compose</code> is a huge improvement over the existing alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The problem is that <code>docker-compose</code> is <strong>too flexible</strong>, <strong>too detailed,</strong> and <strong>operates at the wrong layer of abstraction</strong>. Each of the applications above have some kind of HTTP-handling process. Each of them have a cache or a database (or both). Every single one has one or more volumes for dealing with persistent data.</p>
<p>These applications leave database backup as an exercise for the system operator. Getting back to the shipping metaphor, let’s pretend databases are our railway lines. If you run multiple container workloads on a single host using <code>docker-compose</code> it’s like hand building a crane out of wood to move your container to your rail lines rather than enjoying the benefits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_crane">container cranes</a>.</p>
<p>The problem is best detailed by looking closely at the number #1 issue when using <code>docker-compose</code> - reverse http(s) proxies.</p>
<h3 id="reverse-http-proxies">Reverse HTTP proxies</h3>
<p>A reverse HTTP proxy is a program that receives incoming HTTP requests and forwards them on to another program. It stands in as a proxy for the program itself on <em>incoming</em> requests. The fact that it’s incoming instead of outgoing is what makes it a “reverse” proxy.</p>
<p>Each of the programs above have some kind of administrative or user interface that is served over HTTP.</p>
<p>For each program the developers must decide: do we include a web server or not?</p>
<p>Frankly, you’re damned if you do. You’re also damned if you don’t.</p>
<h4 id="included-web-server">Included Web Server</h4>
<p>If you include a web server then your program will work, including the browser-based interface. It will only work on a particular port, and unless you use host networking, a specific container-only IP address.</p>
<p>If you run IPv4 networking and more than one container with a web server, you’ll need to remap their ports on the host. Then you’ll need a reverse proxy, with its bespoke configuration, to pass web requests to this web server. You have at least two web servers to serve one application.</p>
<p>If every program does this we end up deploying multiple redundant programs doing approximately the same work, taking up compute resources.</p>
<h4 id="no-web-server">No Web Server</h4>
<p>If you don’t include a web server then at least you aren’t wasting resources through redundant server processes. Instead, you have to configure the application without an administrative interface (config files, environment variables) so that it can communicate with the web server you provide. This may include generating static assets (HTML, CSS), setting headers (CORS, Authentication), and breaking requests out to different ports based on their path.</p>
<h4 id="dns">DNS</h4>
<p>Your web interface is going to have an address, whether it’s available on the public internet or not. If you want TLS (<a href="https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls/">and you do</a>) then you’ll need a name, not just an IP address. If you run multiple services on a single host you’ll need to route requests either by domain name or by path (please choose domain name).</p>
<p>If your service is publicly addressable, you can register a domain name and use <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let’s Encrypt</a>. If your service is not publicly addressable, you can <a href="https://smallstep.com/docs/step-ca/">run your own certificate authority</a>. Either way, you’re going to need an automated system for getting new certificates, or you’re going to need incredible patience for toil.</p>
<h4 id="ports">Ports</h4>
<p>Really, the problem is ports. <code>Docker-compose</code> allows for exposing and remapping ports. This is great if you want arbitrarily complex networking setups.</p>
<p>We want to be able to support arbitrarily complex networking setups.</p>
<p>We don’t want applications to actually use them.</p>
<p>What we want is for an application like Immich not to say “I expose some networked service on port 2283, read the manual and find out what it is and how dangerous it might be!” What we want is for Immich to say “I need an HTTPS proxy in front of me to handle client requests. Please let me know what domain name it’s using so I can configure myself internally accordingly.”</p>
<h3 id="databases">Databases</h3>
<p>Okay, I said reverse proxies are the #1 issue. Databases are issue #1 ½</p>
<p>Docker <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-concepts/running-containers/persisting-container-data/">says</a>:</p>
<p>“When a container starts, it uses the files and configuration provided by the image. Each container is able to create, modify, and delete files and does so without affecting any other containers. When the container is deleted,** these file changes are also deleted**.” (emphasis mine)</p>
<p>So a <code>docker-compose</code> file says it needs a database. By nature, that database container is going to delete everything when the database stops. The smart developer then adds a volume to the <code>docker-compose</code> file to store the database contents.</p>
<p>What happens if I hit the machine with a sledgehammer?</p>
<p>Your volume won’t save you.</p>
<h4 id="n12-or-something">N+1=2 or something</h4>
<p>You can save your database from my sledgehammer, or at least the resulting consequences to your application, by having an off-site backup.</p>
<p>Do you know how to backup Authentik?</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>I could probably do okay by iterating over all of the volumes on the service and copying the files in the volume. That may be wasteful and capture files I don’t care about. It may also produce corruption unless I take the service offline.</p>
<p>You could modify the <code>docker-compose</code> configuration and add in a sidecar that stops the database server and exports its databases into a backup-friendly format, then export that from the cluster.</p>
<p>You could also do some <a href="https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/how-to-use-snapshots-clones-and-replication-in-zfs-on-linux">crazy stuff </a>with filesystem-level replication.</p>
<p>There be dragons.</p>
<h4 id="waste">Waste</h4>
<p>Did you know that one database server can service many logical databases? It can! So, if each of your services bundles a separate database server process we are wasting compute resources, just like a reverse proxy. Nobody needs 5 copies of Postgres fighting for context switches on the same system. Run one Postgres, have it manage 5 databases.</p>
<p>Can one learn this power? Not from <code>docker-compose</code></p>
<h3 id="in-pictures">In Pictures</h3>
<p>To summarize the problem I drew this pretty diagram of services running with docker-compose:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.tealok.tech/post/docker-compose-isnt-enough/containers-with-compose.png" alt="Another block diagram that starts with hardware, an operating system, and a container runtime. This time we have multiple database containers in the container runtime talking to volumes and a port remapper between the webapp containers and the reverse proxy. There’s duplicate containers for everything." title="This image really understates how annoying it is to have dozens of services that need manual port remapping and how annoying it is to figure out what the hell any given application is doing with each of the 5 ports they want to expose."></p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Okay, maybe not “the” solution, not yet, but certainly <strong>a solution</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s move up a layer of abstraction. Instead of talking about meaningless interchangeable container images and opaque network protocols let’s add some semantics. Our semantics are going to delimit the kinds of containers that we can depend on: databases, reverse web proxy, cache, static web assets, etc.</p>
<h3 id="an-example-in-semantics">An Example in Semantics</h3>
<p>Here’s a configuration for a pretend web app  in <code>docker-compose</code>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>services:
 web:
   build: .
   ports:
     - "8000:5000"
 redis:
   image: "redis:alpine"
</code></pre><p>From the view of docker this is just two containers on the same network (which is implied) and exposing a single port. The actual type of containers and the protocol of the port is meaningless.</p>
<p>Now I’m going to introduce a new configuration format for my higher-level semantic constructs. I’m not using YAML, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12423733">it’s garbage</a>. I’m going to use TOML</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>service = "mywebapp"
build = "."

[https]
reverse-proxy = true

[cache]
variant = "redis"
</code></pre><p>In this snippet I’m providing a name for the application. I’m still building a container image from the current directory. I’m specifying that I want an https-capable reverse proxy. I don’t specify a port - the container will always use a standard port for incoming requests from the reverse proxy. That’s because I didn’t tell you, but each of these containers gets an IPv6 address within a specific subnet, so all the containers on a host don’t have to fight for the same pool of ports. I also specify I want a caching service, one that specifically speaks “redis”, but the actual provider is up to the runtime.</p>
<h3 id="solution-1">Solution #1</h3>
<p>This already solves most of the reverse proxy problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each program requests a reverse proxy, it doesn’t instantiate one. No duplication, no waste.</li>
<li>That reverse proxy provides the DNS name the program runs at on a standard environment variable. It’s not configurable on purpose.</li>
<li>The reverse proxy can be informed by the container of assets that should be extracted from the container image and made available by the reverse proxy. The runtime handles the extraction.</li>
<li>The reverse proxy forwards all paths (that aren’t static assets) to the program without the need for configuration in the reverse proxy. The application will need to conform to this rather than doing whatever the developers think of and being a snowflake.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution-15">Solution #1.5</h3>
<p>Okay, so what about databases?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>service = "myphotoapp"
image = "github.com/eliribble/iminurphotos"

[https]
reverse-proxy = true

[database]
variant = "sql:2023"
permissions = "full"
</code></pre><p>The only new items here are the <code>database</code> section. It specifies we need a database that complies with the 2023 version of the SQL standard and that the program expects “full” permissions. This means the applications will create the schema and populate the tables and will take no care to coordinate with other programs within the database.</p>
<p>If an application needs a specific database it can specify a given variant. In general, I’d encourage app developers to be standards-compliant and avoid requiring specific database variants. This allows operators the freedom to choose a database that’s best for them.</p>
<p>With this configuration - database owned outside the application - operators are free to stream replication to a second host, create backups, and store those backups however they see fit. This only needs to be configured once and any number of applications can benefit.</p>
<h3 id="what-about-ports">What About Ports?</h3>
<p>Like I said before, each program gets its own IPv6 address that’s routable over the network the host is on. This means I can run Jellyfin and Paperless NGX on the same host and they can both use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers">well-known port numbers</a> for HTTP (80). Since we care about security, we’re going to use a firewall to prevent anything but the reverse proxy from accessing that port.</p>
<p>Applications that bind to port 443 are expected to terminate their own TLS and have a facility for handling certificates. This doesn’t need to be negotiated or configured. If the application binds to that well-known port, it’s expected they are using the corresponding protocol, and they are responsible for it.</p>
<p>Pihole should still bind port 53, which is the standard for DNS. Since it has a valid IP address on the network, it can receive DHCP on port 67 and respond properly.</p>
<p>In a lot of ways we got here because containers default to IPv4. This meant there was contention between containers for the host’s port numbers. This meant we couldn’t use standard port numbers. Then we had to communicate what we were doing on non-standard port numbers out-of-band through product documentation.</p>
<p>If you start with IPv6 you can have multiple addresses on a single adapter. Then you can have an address per container. Then you can use standard port numbers. Then you can add semantics to your runtime about the right ways to handle the different protocols. Adding all of this together makes it possible to have a single runtime that can run all your applications with standardized interfaces.</p>
<h3 id="moar-pictures">Moar Pictures</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.tealok.tech/post/docker-compose-isnt-enough/containers-with-tealok.png" alt="“Another block diagram. Hardware and operating system on the bottom. The container runtime has just one block - the Tealok runtime. Within that runtime is the webproxy, database, and storage volumes. It also has an arrow out to offsite backups. Above the Tealok runtime is a number of application containers.”" title="I haven't decided yet whether or not Tealok should enforce an application having a single container. I'm leaning toward doing it. It certainly makes the diagram cleaner."></p>
<h2 id="tealok---a-new-container-runtime">Tealok - A New Container Runtime</h2>
<p>Tealok is a runtime we’re building for running containers. It’s like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermodal_freight_transport">intermodal freight transport system</a> in the <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/">ongoing extended metaphor</a> Docker started over a decade ago. Tealok imposes certain constraints on containers and provides standardized interfaces.</p>
<p>Tealok runs on Linux hosts. You tell it what applications you want to run and it runs them. The applications tell Tealok what they need and Tealok supplies it to the application. Tealok gets TLS certificates, runs a reverse proxy, sets up DNS records, and makes backups. For operators it helps avoid waste, ensure consistent good practices, and reduces the burden of managing individual snowflake deployment configurations. For application developers it makes it easier to make decisions about how their application is deployed.</p>
<p>Tealok’s designed to make hosting applications operationally simple. So simple, in fact, that anyone who can use a phone can have a Tealok and own their own cloud computing. This means owning your data, owning your services, and owning your destiny.

I want to thank users Makefile, acgs, sergey, Timo W., sharkcz, Hpela, Alvaro64, Chuck(G), Theoryboy, modem7, Toportyán, Hak Foo, sorphin, ajacocks, Eudimorphodon, lowen, jonny64, HoJoPo, mogwaay, upnorth and sqpat for their responses, constructive ideas and discussions, and technical feedback!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In particular I want to thank Johann (jonny64) who took an active concern and participation in my project to help reverse engineer the PAL chips on the 5170 mainboard.
This process has been extremely difficult and Johann helped a lot by programming python scripts to quickly be able to analyze large volumes of logic equation information.
Resulting from our cooperation Johann has developed a reverse engineering python program called "pete" and a script which can generate the PAL fuse maps from reverse analysis which can be directly programmed into a GAL. He is planning, or has published his work in the mean time on GitHub so be sure to search for his project here if you are doing similar work on PAL ICs used in old devices.</p>
<p dir="auto">User Alvaro64 from Spain was very kind to provide friendly discussions and various information and he even offered me to borrow his legacy Intel mainboard for checking and analysis.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was happy to see some reactions from Sergey who also did some amazing work to design and build various classic PCs. He developed a BIOS of his own and a HD Floppy supporting BIOS extension.</p>
<p dir="auto">User lowen gave me some very useful time saving tips in using CPLD programmable logic from Atmel/Microchip, to be able to more easily and quickly get started with suitable CPLD parts in this project.
This will be my first programmable logic project which I will explain below.
User Eudomorphodon provided me some valuable feedback in terms of which type of logic would be possible to exist within the IBM PALS which was a big issue and problem to determine exactly what IBM did in their PAL programming, literally costing me a few weeks.
User sharkcz was very helpful for pointing me to the Copam PC-501 schematics where I found more clues about the 80287 coprocessor control circuits which are also located in a PAL on the IBM 5170.
User Chuck(G) also provided various information and wrote extensive useful information about PAL chips and how to reverse engineer them.</p>
<p dir="auto">I thank Charles MacDonald for developing his PAL read adapter and PA.EXE software which reduces the logic equations.
As I mentioned, Johann(jonny64) developed his own version of a PAL analyzer named "pete" which can do a few more advanced things to be able to do very important logic reductions and conclusions on RAW PAL read data from Charles' adapter. Especially is "pete" able to detect certain inputs on a PAL which sometimes switch to operating as an output. So the scripts Johann made can conclude this mode of operation by itself and also can reduce the subsequent logic consequences of this operation mode in the logic equations. If we don't have this automatic function from pete, it will be the person doing the analysis who will need to reason what is happening back from the observations, which is what I have initially done myself, it was quite a frustrating process to discover what was happening exactly inside the PAL U87 which caused me a lot of stress and lost sleep!</p>
<p dir="auto">Also a special thanks goes out to user LimeProgramming (Adam) here on GitHub for making his excellent USB to serial mouse project with the RP2040!
<a href="https://github.com/LimeProgramming/USB-serial-mouse-adapter">https://github.com/LimeProgramming/USB-serial-mouse-adapter</a>
He kindly agrees for his project to be integrated into mine in a modified form, thank you Adam!</p>
<p dir="auto">During my work I always keep meeting other enthousiasts, a special mention deserves Luca (Retro*Tech) from Italy who supported me with encouraging words and expressed the kind wish to contribute some helpful hardware items for my research and development work. Thanks Luca!</p>
<p dir="auto">Thanks to sqpat for the friendly discussions about how to enhance my project, for sending me two of his verified high clock rate 286 CPUs, and for his suggested assembly code to make a shadow copy of all ROM code into shadow RAM. This change made 20MHz operation a reality! Do remember to check out <a href="https://github.com/sqpat/RealDOOM">his project RealDoom here on GitHub</a>!</p>
<p dir="auto">Thank you dreNorteR for your helpful assembly code contributions and X86 programming tips for detecting a warm boot to support shadow copy functions!</p>

<p dir="auto">After elaborately studying the available source design files which inspired the system, I conceived this design with my own variations, circuit additions and changes which I see as improvements according to my personal design views and preferences.</p>
<p dir="auto">My purpose was a good and clear recreation in my own methods, and never to exactly copy the original.
This project also serves to document the historical 16 bit AT PC design by implementing the fundamental concepts in a functional build which incorporates a lot of the original design concepts and functions which Don Estridge of IBM conceived. I admire Don and his work and I will attempt to explain in this text why his 16 bit AT concept was so important and elemental in promoting the industry standard development process!</p>
<p dir="auto">I have designed various I/O control circuits using the chip manufacturer datasheets to determine the proper interfacing methods, ports etc suitable for this 286 AT design.
I also searched in many IO port documents to determine how to interface the onboard devices.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How the project took more solid form</h2><a id="user-content-how-the-project-took-more-solid-form" aria-label="Permalink: How the project took more solid form" href="#how-the-project-took-more-solid-form"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I started by finding a suitable mainboard for study, testing and analysis. I found a few examples from NCR and ARC however these proved to be frustratingly unstable and in a poorly operating condition. By no means would I have been able to base this project on those designs. Luckily I found an Ebay auction which offered an IBM 5170 mainboard for a very reasonable price. I repaired this mainboard and I have extensively tested it out. The IBM has the added advantage of being completely documented in their schematics which was very useful for this project.</p>
<p dir="auto">I proceeded to draft modern KiCad schematics for the 5170 and subsequently modified the IBM designs to suit this project as much as possible. This involved removing the DRAM support logic and parity checking mechanisms from the schematics. Next I needed to reverse engineer the contents of PAL U87 which is elemental in the 5170 operation. Without the U87 design, a 5170 and its schematics will be useless and missing the vital operating circuits without which we have no AT! At the time there was not any documentation of the logic contained inside U87 to be found anywhere. So I proceeded to discover the logic by analysis. I used the method developed by Charles MacDonald initially and discussed with Johann to develop a utility program python script which I needed to form my conclusions about the actual operation of the U87 PAL.
Finally we succeeded to crack the design and even further simplify the logic equations of U87 to their most likely original PAL source code as originally created, probably by Don Estridge himself. If anyone has more information on how he developed the AT, please contact me, I am very much interested!</p>
<p dir="auto">After I had the complete design of the 5170, I had to evaluate the large amount of logic chips which would be involved in case I would choose to use TTL chips only to implement the whole design. From the equations of U87, I could conclude why IBM chose this path of development. Adding all this additional logic would make the PCB even larger and make this whole concept impossible to properly implement on a single PCB in a practical PCB size. So I have concluded that I will need to use programmable logic in order to reduce the PCB area needed. And since I needed to use programmable logic anyway, I decided I had better do it properly to benefit from this concept the most. So I chose the ATF1508AS CPLD with the help and advice of user lowen.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Development path leading up to the first design revision</h2><a id="user-content-development-path-leading-up-to-the-first-design-revision" aria-label="Permalink: Development path leading up to the first design revision" href="#development-path-leading-up-to-the-first-design-revision"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">After reverse engineering PAL U87, I proceeded to draft schematics and did some initial parts placements on the mainboard. This quickly led me to conclude that in order to integrate many necessary devices onboard as planned, I would need to shift the entire memory subsystem and decoder CPLD onto a ISA adapter card. The BIOS and option ROM EPROMS are still placed on the mainboard because I like it more this way in a more traditional view of typical mainboards of the time.</p>
<p dir="auto">I proceeded to draft my modified and new design of this project into schematics using KiCad and Quartus.</p>
<p dir="auto">The complete design including my changes and additions is contained in and needs:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>a full ATX size mainboard PCB</li>
<li>three 84 pin PLCC CPLDs which can be plugged into through-hole sockets</li>
<li>a ISA memory subsystem card PCB containing the footprints for a total of 15MB of fully decoded SRAM memory.
This card provides 640KB of conventional memory, 128KB of UMBs at D0000 and E0000 segments with disable jumpers, and 14MB of XMS memory.
Each set of two 512KB SRAM ICs provides an additional megabyte of RAM for the system.
The amount of memory can be chosen by populating the desired amount of SRAM chips.
So basically this ISA slot card takes the function of the historically more typical DRAM SIMMs and implements the full PC memory space in SRAM memory.
Please note to observe the pin 1 mark of your particular RAM ICs and make sure you are not using a reversed pinout SRAM which would need to be soldered in flipped over orientation!</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The mainboard provides two 16 bit IDE ports, a 8 bit SCSI port, a floppy drive interface, 16 bit Realtek LAN, USB to serial mouse using RP2040, discrete simplified LPT port, ATX power supply control, reset logic, and various LEDs to indicate certain system functions. The 64k BIOS is contained in two EPROMs on the mainboard and there is also a 32kb sized option ROM EPROM socket included on the mainboard. The design of this project is meant to use the XT-IDE BIOS option ROM software developed by XT IDE universal BIOS team, which needs to be configured and programmed into an option ROM EPROM IC which can be placed in the option ROM socket on the mainboard.</p>

<p dir="auto">IBM released the 5170 on the market for a price which no competitor on the PC market could equal at the time. For a long period of time, the AT went without any competition!
IBM even could not meet the demand of new units.
The 5170 offered substantial performance increases which raised the PC standard to a whole new level of usage, and formed a true competing product for mini computers at the time.
But the AT was much more than those aspects when you dive deep into the technology which powers it. IBM succeeded in creating a 16 bit PC which achieved 100% compatibility with all previous 8-bit hardware and software. When you study how this was done, you realize it was no small thing! In order to achieve this they created some pretty ingenious mechanisms of 8 to 16 bit data byte conversions for which they even synchronized and modified the CPU cycles on the 80286 by delaying them while the data bytes are being converted with perfect timings. The more I studied this principle, the more respect I developed for the work by IBM engineers. To provide such advanced conversion technology in the AT was a stroke of genious and this has played an extremely important role in the historic success of the 16 bit AT PC and it further solidified the success of the emerging industry standard. When you look at computer history, this achievement of true backward compatibility is truly amazing to behold and in my opinion this is a much overlooked fact. To the user it is almost invisible because everything simply works and is fully functional. 8 And 16 bit technology just works seemlessly and perfectly together. But for those who study everything in full detail, this reveils some amazing technology and circuits developed by IBM which deserve some proper respect and credit.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">BIOS to use</h2><a id="user-content-bios-to-use" aria-label="Permalink: BIOS to use" href="#bios-to-use"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I recommend using a BIOS other than the IBM one mainly because the IBM BIOS is known to contain restrictions in operation and verifies the clock speed to lockout operation if the speed is raised.
So any similar BIOS to the IBM 5170 from other sources would possibly qualify to run on this project.
There have been BIOS code produced by ARC, COPAM, NCR and MR BIOS to name a few examples.
MR BIOS is the most elegant BIOS at the moment. It may sometimes misdetect the COM port chip, erasing the CMOS RAM will reset detection.
Recommended to backup the CMOS RAM with a utility to file as soon as the COM port is detected.
Restoring that file and a CTRL-ALT-DEL ensures that you can use the mouse properly.
The Quadtel BIOS for 5170 is best at detecting all hardware though less elegant looking, but 100% reliable.</p>

<p dir="auto">The mainboard and ISA memory card are built and extensively tested.
The CPLD programs are verified and debugged, and latest versions are uploaded here in a single archive containing all the CPLD design projects and JED files.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is no Turbo function in the design, the CPU internal clock speed is verified at 16Mhz, tested for many hours.
Recommended a Harris 286 rated at 16Mhz. Higher speeds pending, waiting for further testing and verification.
When using sockets, please find tight fitting and reliable ones.
There is a lot of garbage being sold on the internet, stable contacts are a requirement of 16Mhz CPU clock operation.
If your system freezes, the most likely reason is a loose contact so re-insert all ICs.</p>

<p dir="auto">It is currently not recommended to add the RTL8019AS chip on the mainboard.
On my setup this created a lot of interference.
In fact I recommend a UMC UM9008 LAN card instead.
FTP transfer works most reliable when "putting" a large archive backup for example into the remote FTP server.
This allows to transfer gigabytes without any freeze.
For archiving and backups ARJ is recommended on this type of system.
If you want to play Doom, I highly recommend the Doom8088 project here at GitHub
Make sure to add enough RAM, for example 8 chips will make 4MB of RAM.
All RAM should be added in sequence, and will be automatically detected by the BIOS.
All RAM above 1MB is technically XMS memory (HIMEM.SYS) and DOS can be loaded into high memory.
128 KB of UMB blocks in segment D and E fully available for loading TSR drivers, needs UMB RAM clearing and UMB driver by Marco van Zwetselaar same as on XT PC.</p>
<p dir="auto">VGA card: recommended a Trident TVGA9000B card. Otherwise just test what you have.
Usually older and slower cards may not work at 16Mhz CPU clock.</p>
<p dir="auto">The DMA controllers operate at 5.33Mhz at 1/3 division from 16Mhz FDC clock, this is slightly over spec but with newer date DMA chips this seems fine. Tested and verified formatting and booting from floppy disks, using disk images to restore to floppy disk, all appears to function 100% reliably using this DMA clock speed. This can benefit games where sound data is loaded via DMA for example so the game routines experience less delays from loading the sound.</p>

<p dir="auto">I have replaced all the output system control signals previously coming from the 82284 and 82288 with my own custom logic.
So this makes the 82284 and 82288 chips no longer necessary for this project. This means that some level of rewiring is needed for the current PCB. I have done these upgrades in such a way that a minimal amount of wires will need to be added. Compared to the whole system it's not that much.
The System controller now receives the double clock frequency from an oscillator, and controls the CPU clock, CPU synchronization to the /RES input and system /RESET net.
All the system control is now generated by the System control CPLD by extensive state machine logic which I created. I was inspired after finding an article by Doug Kern of AMD in a documentation book full of applications for AMD programmable logic. So one of the example application was the replacement of the 82284 and 82288. Doug had created his own version of the 82284 and 82288 using a custom CPU cycle type. After a few brief tests using his method, I decided to design my own version of such logic. Basically I started from scratch, having only the datasheets of the 82284, 82288, and 80286 as a source of information. I have done many measurements and analysis of the system and the resulting design is my recreation. After seeing what Doug created using a state machine model of logic, I also decided to design my own state machine which facilitates very straight forward interpretation of the state bits in other logic areas. So the system controller now outputs all the system control signals, and we no longer need the 82284 and 82288. This upgrade also allows much faster logic to take over these functions inside the CPLDs.</p>

<p dir="auto">When working with CPU speeds of 20MHz and higher, it's no longer reliable to use ROM chips to initialize the system from. So I started work on a Shadow RAM system, encouraged by sqpat and dreNorteR on the VCF forums. Sqpat and dreNorteR gave me some sound advice on the assembly commands needed for shadow copying the BIOS and option ROM space into a shadow RAM area. I changed the RESET jump command to jump into my code, which then continues to jump into the BIOS INIT/POST entry point. Next I developed a system to switch the Shadow RAM into place after the copy is completed by writing to a memory location in the 0C0000 memory region. After testing this system, immediately I saw a big improvement in my 20MHz tests.</p>

<p dir="auto">The 74LS646 used in the IBM 5170 AT design is another part which needs substitution. So I proceeded to analyze and rewrite the logic of the 74LS646, specifically as used in the 5170 AT logic. The result is that the 74LS646 can be replaced by a single 74F245 transceiver and a 74F574 latch. I have tested this solution extensively and it now has the added advantage that the functions of the 74LS646 can now be replaced with much faster 74F type logic.</p>

<p dir="auto">I have done extensive testing with the RTC and CMOS RAM chip. In my tests, I achieved the most reliable results using a DS12885 chip, which I recommend using. The two jumpers next to the RTC need to be set accordingly for the DS12885 chip. Also, I suggest that no battery is really needed as long as you leave the ATX PSU on the power cable and the back power switch set to the ON position. The circuits on the mainboard will provide power to the RTC and RTC clock generator in order to advance the system clock and keep the CMOS settings. So there is no need to be working with potentially harmful batteries in the system if you prefer not to, as I also do.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting 20MHz to function reliably</h2><a id="user-content-getting-20mhz-to-function-reliably" aria-label="Permalink: Getting 20MHz to function reliably" href="#getting-20mhz-to-function-reliably"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Operating the system at 20MHz needs a few modifications:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Shadow RAM</li>
<li>CPU clock cycle control, meaning to manipulate the CPU clock for certain operations like reading the VGA BIOS, accessing the VGA RAM. These memory map areas are behind the VGA controller and thus this interpretation of memory causes some delays which needs adjustment of the cycles. I have created decoding which can also be expanded and upgraded to facilitate other areas of memory or I/O as needed to accommodate slower expansion cards or system chips.</li>
<li>extending the ALE signal, the ALE signal is normally of the same period length as one double CPU clock. However around 18MHz and above, this is simply getting too short for the address latches on the ISA slots to reliably store the address states for all the cycles. So this means that the ALE signal needs further enhancement. I have tried various mechanisms, and the best result was achieved by extending the ALE signal to start earlier at the CPU assertion of S1/S0 status signals, and to remain within the CPU state of T_STATUS. Using this method can extend the ALE signal long enough to reliably be able to catch the address states at 20MHz.</li>
<li>changing the logic type of many of the transceivers and latches in the system to speed up the bus.</li>
<li>At 20MHz, the System controller CPLD has difficulty terminating the cycles at 1 wait state, which results in skewing the cycle termination one cycle more than the logic is set to. Which is fine for I/O operations which are inherently slower than fast memory access. For speeding up the 16 bit memory access I have reduced the circuit to zero wait states. With the added wait state by frequency limits of the System controller, we now get a single wait state. This results in 13322 writes per millisecond using the "VIDSPEED.EXE *" test.</li>
<li>the option ROM is now no longer a separate ROM chip but included in the system BIOS ROM positions. The SA16 line needs to be wired to pin 1 on both these ROMS and the memory decoder in the 20MHz version is already updated to support this. The lower half of the ROM chips provides 32KB of option ROM space at 0C8000 - 0CFFFF. This allows for example XT-IDE ROM routines to run at fast 16 bit RAM speeds using the shadow RAM system. So the option ROM socket needs to be left empty and the ROMs replaced with fast types of 64KB flash ROM chips which support the standard DIP ROM pin locations.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Mostly the system now operates on 74F logic. Certain areas need HCT, ALS and HC logic.
20MHz Is really stretching the capabilities of the 10ns CPLDs. I am not sure how much higher the system could run, though I have been able to get into the MR BIOS menu at 25 MHz a few times. But that is far from a functional system. At 20MHz, in windows there is some minor graphics glitching going on, though it's nothing like freezing the system or causing resets. Other than some glitching, the system keeps running fine. In DOS the system is completely stable and I have not seen any problems running games or software in DOS.</p>

<p dir="auto">I should mention, building this system is an advanced work, not for novice builders. The designs need some understanding of the system in order to be able to do the modification wiring on the mainboard. You will need to know which signal goes where by looking at the quartus projects. Some signals are wired between the CPLDs which carry the same net names. I am working on a layout upgrade to include all the changes, which will eventually be released, however this is a lot of work because many areas of the PCB need to be reworked. Changing some of the logic also invites moving circuits around slightly, which will cost even more time than the modifications. I also decided to not include the RTL8019AS and the SCSI controller. The SCSI chips are too hard to find, and the RTL8019AS proved not a stable device on this system. Instead I decided to use a ISA card with a UMC9008AF network chip. I may decide to take an easier path and simply connect everything together in the new configuration, and just leaving some empty spaces on the board where chips were removed. Maybe it's not efficient, however the function of the system is the real goal that we want to achieve.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What's next now?</h2><a id="user-content-whats-next-now" aria-label="Permalink: What's next now?" href="#whats-next-now"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since we have a working AT concept system design, it's now possible to upgrade the core 5170 system concept into a 486 based AT PC design. I will attempt to first feature a 486DX type CPU and forcing it in 16 bit mode. This will make the transition later into a full 32 bit system more easy. So I am working on this concept now. This new design will feature one of more FPGAs for replacing much of the system logic, and to provide and control the system RAM memory. It's my intention to use the fastest affordable memory type which can hopefully support a very clock-efficient CPU function in the new design. The system will be featured using custom cards which fulfill certain functions. Such as a FPGA and memory card, a CPU card, and a core AT logic card. I also have ideas to design the system in such a way that also other solutions would be possible to form a system. Such as when a mainboard with chipset logic is badly damaged because of battery chemicals, someone could opt to move the chipset ICs onto a card and use that card to form a new ATX PC system. Basically it would be giving new life to the chipset ICs in a new design. These are just some of the research phase outlines of the next project, so due to alteration depending on what will be the best design method in my vision.</p>
<p dir="auto">I will continue my work in <a href="https://github.com/rodneyknaap/atx-486at-mainboard">a new project repository here on GitHub</a> which features research, development and design information for my next generation system.
This system will support at least the 286 CPU and the 486DX CPU, and later possibly others.</p>

<p>In the twisting vaults of a subway, metro, or U-Bahn, there’s often no reliable cell service, wifi, or GPS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Which means you had no good way of keeping track of your stops or ETA when underground.</p>

<h4><strong>Step 1: basic motion classification</strong></h4>



<p>Once you enter a train tunnel with bad GPS, the magic begins. First, we have to figure out where you are between stations. For that, we need to confirm that you’re on a moving train!</p>



<p>To get our bearings, let’s look at some accelerometer data from Stephen, the fastest-walking Transit employee, which he recorded on his phone during his commute to our Montreal office:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="2000" height="830" data-attachment-id="14749" data-permalink="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-underground/phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-en/" data-orig-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" data-orig-size="2000,830" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Phone acceleration during a commute EN" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-705x510.png" data-large-file="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" src="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN.png 2000w, https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-768x319.png 768w, https://blog.transitapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Phone-acceleration-during-a-commute-EN-1536x637.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"></figure>



<p>Fast but also meticulous, Stephen labeled the different parts of his trip, like:</p>



<ul>
<li>when he started walking</li>



<li>when he descended a set of stairs</li>



<li>when he was waiting on the platform</li>



<li>when the train started moving, when it stopped, etc.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>With inspiration from one of our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">favourite French mathematicians</a>, we can clean up Stephen’s acceleration data and turn it into frequency data, which can start to give us an idea about what’s happening on a moving train vs. elsewhere.</p>

<p>There’s a few clues. For one, when Stephen’s train is moving his phone vibrates at ~5 Hz, versus ~2 Hz when he’s walking. But the pattern isn’t clear-cut, with lots of random noise and harmonic frequencies (those fainter pink lines cascading above the more vivid red ones) muddying up the picture.</p>



<p>To definitively say “this is a moving train” vs. “this is not” we need to train a machine to classify motion types — a task which requires A LOT of training data.</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 2: gathering ground truth</strong></h4>



<p>We asked Stephen and his valiant colleagues to repeat the exercise: but now labeling data for hundreds of trips across dozens of cities, so that we could build a generalized model to say “yes! moving train!” regardless of the type of train or tracks being used.</p>



<p>Our trusty emissaries Étienne and Elijah were sent down from Montreal to collect vibration data on our app’s most popular underground system: the <a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region/nyc">New York City</a> subway.</p>

<p>Armed with iPhones, Androids, and MetroCards, they spent a week riding the MTA’s buses and trains, labeling each step of every trip:</p>

<p>We’d rely on their data for clues to distinguish between on-a-train vibrations vs. other vibrations in a train station.</p>



<p>Which meant Elijah and Étienne had to ride the escalators and elevators up and down for hours at a time, vigilantly annotating each time they stopped to catch their breath.</p>



<p>They eventually rode every subway line in New York, from the Bronx to Brighton Beach, across the Queensboro, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges (where there is cell service) back through the rickety Canarsie Tunnel (where there is not).</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 3: training our motion classifier</strong></h4>



<p>After cleaning and processing our data, we could begin training our motion classifier to distinguish “moving train!” from “not moving train!”.</p>



<p>We start by feeding the model our unlabelled sensor data and ask it to randomly guess whether the phone is on a moving train, a stopped train, walking, going up an escalator, et cetera. We verify these guesses against our manual annotations (the “ground truth”) and add logic to guide our model to more accurate predictions.</p>



<p>After a great deal of tinkering, our model can now confidently predict if someone is on a moving train – or if their phone is just vibin’.</p>

<p>Now that we know when a rider is moving underground, the next step is to make that information useful: <strong>where, precisely, is their train?</strong></p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Step 4: making a location prediction</strong></h4>



<p>It was time to add one last model to the mix, aptly named <strong><em>The Mixer.</em></strong></p>



<p>We trained this model to weigh…</p>



<ol>
<li>the motion type prediction<strong> </strong>(aka “is this a moving train?”)&nbsp;</li>



<li>the last-known location of the user</li>



<li>whether the last-known location came recently or a long time ago</li>



<li>the train schedule</li>
</ol>



<p>…to predict the user’s <strong><em>current</em></strong> <strong>location</strong>.</p>



<p>It now makes the right location prediction 90% of the time.</p>

<p>This is the holy grail of underground detection:<strong> since you can predict where a rider is, you can show them where they are on a map, update their ETA, and tell them when to get off at the right station.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a step up from the status quo method of detecting your location underground. No more relying on spotty GPS — or bobbing and weaving between incomprehensibly tall humans to read those digital screens!</p>

<p><strong>What’s even more wonderful? Our station counting works completely offline. </strong>Both of our models (the motion classifier, and the mixer) have been compressed into tiny files that run on your phone, without sending any data to Transit’s servers.</p>



<p>No tracking. No cookies. Your vibration data is your own damn business!</p>



<hr>



<h4><strong>Want to try out our underground detection for yourself?</strong></h4>



<p>Easy: just find yourself an underground train, open Transit, start a trip with GO, and watch the stations tick down, one-by-one! We’ve helped riders detect 1.5 million underground stations and ~400,000 trips during our initial tests.</p>



<p>GO’s step-by-step navigation was already being used by millions of aboveground riders in<a href="https://transitapp.com/en/region"> 600+ cities</a> — including folks propelled by bikes, since our launch of <a href="https://blog.transitapp.com/go-bike/">GO Bike</a> last month.</p>



<p>Now, their subterranean train-riding counterparts can rely on it more confidently in areas with bad service, so Transit can be their guiding light from end-to-end in every tunnel.</p>
