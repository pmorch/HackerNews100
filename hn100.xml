				<p>August 25, 2025</p>

				<!-- 内容 start -->
				<p>On July 30, 2025, the U.S. government issued an executive order titled “Termination of De Minimis Treatment for All Countries” regarding mail to the United States.</p>

				<p>Under this executive order, starting August 29, 2025, mail containing goods imported for personal use (taxable mail) will no longer be eligible for duty-free treatment, and tariffs will be imposed. On August 15, 2025, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced new guidelines regarding the elimination of de minimis rules, which require that transport operators pay customs deposits to CBP and prepare customs declarations. The procedures that transport operators and postal operators in each country must follow to comply with these guidelines are not clear, however, making implementation difficult.</p>

				<p>Therefore, starting August 27 (Wed.), in line with other national postal operators, we will temporarily suspend the acceptance of postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) to the United States that contain the following items:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Individual gifts with a content value exceeding 100 US dollars</li>
					<li>Goods intended for sale for consumption</li>
				</ul>

				<p>In addition, we will continue to accept letters, postcards, printed matter, EMS (documents), and postal items (small packets, parcels, and EMS (goods)) containing gifts between individuals with a value of less than US$100.</p>

				<p>As an alternative to the above suspension of acceptance, our international courier service, UGX (U-Global Express), can handle shipments in compliance with U.S. customs regulations:</p>

				<p><a href="https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/UGX/index_en.html">UGX (U-Global Express)</a></p>

				<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.</p>

<h2>Building the Mouse Logitech Won't Make</h2>
<p>2025.08.24 · 5 min read</p>

<p>My absolute favorite mouse is the MX Ergo from Logitech. It's a trackball mouse with a good number of buttons and a comfortable, ergonomic tilt. It clicked with me as soon as I tried it, and I've been using one since they came out back in 2017.</p>
<p>However, it's not without its issues. There are 3 main areas where the sheen of perfection wears off:</p>
<ol>
<li>It uses a micro-USB port to charge.</li>
<li>The switches are a little loud and clicky.</li>
<li>The software is bloated.</li>
</ol>
<p>After 8 years waiting for an updated model from Logitech, I decided to stop waiting and see if I could tackle these issues myself.</p>
<p><em>After first publishing this article a helpful commenter let me know Logitech released the MX Ergo S in late 2024, with quieter switches, USB-C, and a $20 price increase. Let's just pretend I wrote this article a year ago! Still, at least this project let me avoid some e-waste.</em></p>
<h2>The Fixes</h2>
<div>
<p>General Disclaimer</p>
<p>These mods could mess up your mouse and will definitely void your warranty. Rechargable batteries can cause fires if handled improperly!</p>
</div>
<h3>Adding USB-C Charging</h3>
<p>I went in apprehensive - how much of a hassle would it be to swap a port? The easiest solution would be to get a short adapter plug and leave it in the mouse, but that felt like it would be a constant reminder of my lack of ambition.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I soon found this incredible <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a> on how to seamlessly replace the existing port. The port sits on a small PCB under the mainboard. The author of the guide reverse-engineered that PCB, then modified it to accommodate a USB-C port. He made the <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/Logitech_MX_Ergo_USB_C_PCB_replacement_89459dce.html">designs</a> available through PCBWay, and while you can export the design files and send them anywhere you'd like, I opted to stay with PCBWay to manufacture the boards for my project (I ended up ordering 10 so I had spares).</p>
<p><img alt="PCB Mid-Assembly" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/pcb-mid-assembly.jpeg"></p>
<p>Balking at the $50+ charge for turnkey assembly, I opted to take the financially responsible route and pay $200+ for a hot-air rework station to solder it myself. I transferred as many components from the Logitech board as I could. That meant I only needed to source the new port, some resistors, a replacement ribbon cable connector, and a switch.</p>
<p>Getting spare PCBs and components saved me a lot of hassle, as it gave me the opportunity to practice soldering some of the trickier components (the USB-C port turned out to be especially finicky). After some initial trial and error I was able to successfully assemble the new board! </p>
<p><img alt="Fitting the assembled PCB into the mouse" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/assembled-pcb.jpeg"></p>
<p>Some quick modifications to the case with a rotary tool provided enough clearance for the larger port. After reassembling the mouse, I was left with a pretty seamless result!</p>
<p><img alt="Finished Mouse with New Port" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/mouse-new-port.jpeg"></p>
<p>Overall I spent $45 for the PCBs and around $10 for the required components, making this a reasonably pricey mod. You could probably find an intro discount from a PCB manufacturer to lower the prices a bit! If you're interested in trying this out for yourself, I'd recommend reading through Solderking's <a href="https://www.instructables.com/Converting-the-Logitech-MXERGO-Trackball-Mouse-to-/">guide</a>.</p>
<h3>Silent Switches</h3>
<p>The one mouse that nearly pulled me away from the MX Ergo was the MX Master 3S, also from Logitech. It uses some fantastic silent switches for the left and right clicks, which I found I much preferred over regular mouse switches. </p>
<p>I wanted to replicate that experience as much as I could for the MX Ergo. I started by disassembling the mouse and measuring each switch used so I could find alternatives I might prefer.</p>
<p>The left and right clicks use standard microswitches, and I struck gold with the first alternatives I tried! The <a href="https://lethal.gg/products/huano-silent-2-pcs?_pos=11&amp;_sid=74aa60c1a&amp;_ss=r">Huano Silent</a> switches are exactly what I was looking for. They are almost completely silent, with a soft but satisfying tactile bump when pressed. </p>
<p><img alt="Huano Switch Close-up" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/huano-close-up.jpeg"></p>
<p>The scroll-wheel clicks use <code>6x6x4.3mm</code> through-hole switches, while the other buttons use <code>5.25x5.25x1.5mm</code> surface-mount switches. I wasn't as sure about how to find options that might suit me better, as these are essentially commodity products. I ended up ordering a few different options, and settled on the Omron <code>B3F-1002</code> for the scroll-wheel clicks and the Alps Alpine <code>SKQGABE010</code> (see below, left is the new switch and right is the old) for the other buttons.</p>
<p><img alt="SMD Switch Old and New" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/old-new-smd.jpeg"></p>
<p>After desoldering and removing the old switches, soldering in their replacements, and reassembling the mouse I could finally try out new switches in actual use. The Huano Silent switches were a huge improvement for me and only cost $2.99! If I were to make one mod this would be it (I ended up ordering a bunch more of them just so I have spares for future mice). While I did notice the change from the other switches, the difference was more minimal and I would probably skip them next time.</p>
<p>If you're interested in trying this for yourself, I'd recommend following a guide like <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Logitech+G603+Switch+Replacement/165937#s349713">this one from iFixit</a> on how to desolder and replace a mouse switch. While the mouse is different the soldering technique is the same!</p>
<h3>Software Upgrade</h3>
<p>I really dislike Logitech's peripheral configuration software (Logi Options+). I find it to be bloated, buggy, and <a href="https://512pixels.net/2024/04/ai-overlay-tmp-home-folder-mac-os/">occasionally malware-like</a>. In 2024 I started using <a href="https://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/">SteerMouse</a>, and I haven't looked back. It's super lightweight, it can do everything I need it to, and most importantly it just works. I mainly use it to configure the thumb and side buttons to move me between desktop spaces. While it does cost $20, it adds a lot of customization and it works with many other peripherals.</p>
<p><img alt="Steermouse Demo" src="https://samwilkinson.io/assets/steermouse.png"></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I'm really happy with how this project turned out. I highly recommend swapping in the Huano Silent switches, while the other switch changes are probably overkill. The USB-C port swap isn't super necessary, but it was a fun project and a great introduction to surface-mount soldering. Moving to SteerMouse is easy and boring but it's a much better experience!</p>
<p>More generally, I think there's a lot of fun to be had tweaking the objects we use every day to our liking. Aside from a great mouse, this project has given me a bunch of ideas for things to try next.</p>

<p><strong>FORT GARLAND —</strong> In the sandy hills scattered with piñon pine and spiky yucca, hundreds of people have relied on a water supply that is so much a part of the local culture that Costilla County residents describe it as a way of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drilling for water is a pricey gamble on the high desert where many live off the grid at 7,500 to 10,000 feet of elevation. A well could cost $25,000 with no guarantee that water will spring, even after digging hundreds of feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, many people in the poorest county in the state have opted for cisterns, reservoirs buried underground and covered with a plastic lid or cement slab. To fill them, residents drive 20 minutes or so to town, often weekly, with tanks in their pickup trucks or on their trailers to buy water at 10 cents a gallon, or they have it delivered for an extra fee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is time-consuming, tedious and steeped in routine. And in Fort Garland, the system was abruptly cut off this month — without warning or notice.</p>

<p>The fight over the water has pitted residents of Fort Garland who have plumbing and pay for metered water against those living outside the city limits with cisterns. The board of the Fort Garland Water and Sanitation District — which cut off water sales to rural residents Aug. 1 in a 3-2 vote that wasn’t even on its meeting agenda — has devolved into shouting matches and dysfunction. Board members have referred to disgruntled residents as an “angry mob,” and one city resident shushed the water district administrator as she explained the deficiencies of the town water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>People who relied on Fort Garland water to fill their cisterns have been left dry. In the heat of summer, some have gotten water from neighbors who have wells, though well-sharing is illegal. Some are driving two hours to Pueblo to buy water. Many have been getting water in the town of Blanca, where officials offered — only as an emergency solution until the end of August — to let people fill up water tanks from a hose connected to a fire hydrant.</p>

<p>The water crisis has forced older residents to contemplate selling their dream homes, where they had planned to retire. Others are wondering whether to scrap plans to build on their property, leaving home for showers and limiting their toilet flushes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Underneath it all is a deep concern about whether this is a preview of the water wars ahead as the West deals with <a href="https://coloradosun.com/2025/08/21/colorado-river-forced-water-cuts-state-official-plan/">unprecedented drought</a> and its residents compete for a resource that is finite yet essential to life.</p>

But since the Fort Garland Water &amp; Sanitation District ended bulk water sales to people living outside town limits, the couple has been scrambling to fill their cistern with water.

<h2 id="h-water-was-never-guaranteed">Water was never guaranteed</h2>

<p>Most of those affected live in the Sangre de Cristo Ranches, a 44,000-acre residential area that once was the <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/multimillionaire-sells-historic-ranch-to-billionaire/73-343274758#:~:text=FORT%20GARLAND%20(AP)%20%2D%20Multimillionaire,fund%20manager%20Louis%20Moore%20Bacon.&amp;text=The%20Forbes%20family%20had%20held,of%20Denver%2C%20for%20four%20decades.">Forbes Trinchera Ranch</a>. The dwellings range from multistory homes with sweeping decks facing Blanca Peak, the standout of the mountain range, to modest one-room houses and campers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some residents have wells. But hundreds of people in the county of about 3,700 rely on cisterns to drink, cook and bathe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The situation is most dire for those who are older or have physical disabilities. Many were paying a private business, Wood &amp; Water, to deliver water purchased from the Fort Garland filling station to their cisterns. The local couple who operated the water and firewood service in the San Luis Valley <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090129622788">closed within days</a> of the Fort Garland water board vote.</p>

<p>Amanda Ellis and Paul Branson live off a dirt road, no neighbors within sight. They run an apothecary and a wildfire mitigation business, grow vegetables and herbs, use solar power, and have a cistern buried under the sandy earth near their driveway. The water in the cistern is piped to their faucets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Losing their water source has caused daily stress and deep-seated worry.</p>

<p>When water isn’t available, finding it becomes all-consuming. “Hauling water is your water for everything — lifestyle, dishes, consumption, the whole bit,” said Branson, who for years worked in emergency management. “So not having that immediate option is of great concern. It’s stressful.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s unnerving, to the point that Branson has wondered whether cutting off water to rural residents is a step in the San Luis Valley’s hazardous mitigation plan for drought. “It seems like locking down on water availability is possibly a theme here, which begs the question, why?” he said. “Here are some things we’ll do should its ugly head start to rise and impact people, right?”</p>

She relies on water from a cistern buried on her property. (Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Ellis bought the house five years ago after traveling the country in a van as a freelance journalist. “I was always drawn to the mountains when I was traveling around the country and, to be honest, it was affordable,” she said. “It was off grid. It had a structure. It was away from people. The view is incredible. There’s climbing, hiking. It was somewhere I could afford and have land in Colorado.”</p>

<p>Having water was never a “guarantee,” she knows, but the way county residents were cut off with no warning, no time to prepare, was unethical, she said. Many residents had no idea how tenuous the water supply actually was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Realtors are selling homes with (cistern) permits saying that there’s the availability to get water hauled in,” Ellis said. “It was never guaranteed. Apparently, they are not and never have been obligated to sell water outside of city limits. They’ve just done that for a very long time.”</p>

<h2 id="h-water-pump-broke-water-restrictions-stirred-up-anger">Water pump broke, water restrictions stirred up anger</h2>

<p>The trouble began when the pump broke in Fort Garland’s water system.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Salina Pacheco, who is the manager of the town water district and training to become a water system operator, knew it was coming. She had been talking to the five-member water board about it for two years and had helped secure a $105,000 grant from the Colorado Department of Local Affairs to upgrade the water system, which was suffering from “extreme water hammer” because water traveling through the pipes in opposite directions was colliding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pump failed in June, before the system’s planned overhaul. Townspeople were asked to use the “bare minimum” of water — flush the toilets, but don’t water the lawn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frustrations grew, culminating in about 10 people showing up at the Aug. 1 water board meeting to demand action. They wanted the town to stop selling what’s called “bulk water” to residents of unincorporated Costilla County.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the meeting intensified, with people “hollering” and cutting off each other’s sentences, board members called for a vote, even though the issue was not on their agenda, Pacheco recalled. One man held up a hand in her face as she tried to explain why she didn’t think selling water to rural residents was impacting the town’s water system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“These men were brought in because I had put them on a water restriction schedule,” Pacheco said in an interview. “They are upset they can’t water their lawns while people can’t have water to actually live.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fort Garland uses 120 acre-feet of water per year — that’s 120 acres covered by 1 foot of water. Sales to people in cisterns account for about 1 acre feet per year, Pacheco said. Revenue for the water sales to rural residents totaled $43,000 per year, about 15% of total revenue.</p>

<p>Still, board president John Sanchez and two other members voted to shut down bulk water sales. Customers found out on Facebook after rural residents went to buy water and were turned away.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sanchez did not return a request for comment. Pacheco alleged he is trying to get the board to fire her.</p>


<p>Pacheco said she has brought in attorneys to train board members on meeting rules, including how to listen to public comment and not fight back or take immediate votes on issues raised by the audience. Some of the board members “have been trying to move past the craziness,” she said. “I’ve told all of the board members, ‘I need you to understand your positions.’”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the board president, she said: “Somebody needs to shut him down.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Hopefully we can come together as a community,” Pacheco said. “This could bring us together instead of creating them and us.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Water board member Anthony Neville was among the three to vote to shut off water sales. He told The Sun he did it because he understood why townspeople were angry about the water restrictions and that they “pay religiously” for their metered water. The water district’s bylaws do not say that it must sell water to people outside of Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Now that we don’t want to sell water, they think we are obligated to sell water,” Neville said. “No, we are not.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>I get that everybody needs water. There are kids up there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>— Anthony Neville, <em>member of Fort Garland water board</em></p>
</div>

<p>But Neville said he would vote in the future to restore water sales to rural people.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The water pump is fixed now. He’s hoping Sangre de Cristo Ranches residents will sign a petition that could result in another board vote and that the rest of the board “would have a heart.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I get that everybody needs water,” he said. “There are kids up there.”&nbsp;</p>


<h2 id="h-when-water-seems-scarce-long-time-residents-blame-the-newcomers">When water seems scarce, long-time residents blame the newcomers</h2>

<p>John and Debi Marks bought property in the ranches two years ago with plans to build a retirement home and live off the grid among the pines. For now, the couple in their 50s are living in a camper, parked near the markers that stake out the outline of their future home. The plan is to power with solar and grow food in a small greenhouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They opted for a cistern instead of a well, bought the $500 permit and had it buried on their property. They were among the customers of Wood &amp; Water until it went out of business.</p>

<p>The Marks’ plans for their next chapter were going smoothly — maybe minus the rattlesnakes seeking shade under their camper. Then their water source evaporated.</p>

<p>Since then, they’ve been on a disciplined mission to fill their 1,750-gallon cistern to the top and conserve water as strictly as possible. They’ve made the most of the town of Blanca’s offer of emergency water on Tuesdays and Thursdays 8 a.m. to noon. The Marks are squeezing in two trips each morning to fill the 275-gallon tank in the back of their pickup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They figure a full cistern is enough to last them six months in the camper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“We wanted to be as independent as possible, and so we searched all over the state for property that would fit our needs, and this fit the bill,” Debi Marks said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They love it in the valley, surrounded by mountains on all sides, but they have felt resentment from some of the longtime residents, the accusation that they showed up “unprepared” to live out here. When a necessity for life like water seems scarce, people turn on each other.</p>

<p>“I think a lot of what we’re dealing with are small-town politics,” John Marks said. “We all have a common need that is a valuable, sacred resource that we’re clamoring for, and we just want to be part of a community, to kind of help make things better for us all. So work with us. Please don’t work against us.”</p>

(Mike Sweeney, Special to The Colorado Sun)</figcaption></figure>

<p>Elaine, who did not want her full name used because she is a 79-year-old widow who lives alone on a rural dirt road, moved with her late husband to Costilla County full time about 20 years ago. Her in-laws had purchased the property in the 1970s, site unseen, from an ad in Forbes magazine, the owner of which also owned Forbes ranch. When presented with the option of drilling a well or buying water tanks and a cistern, they opted for a cistern.</p>

<p>“That was part of the deal with Forbes, that there would always be water available to those who bought property in the ranches, and so there was no need for us to drill a well,” she said, sitting on her deck last week under a huge blue sky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At first, the Forbes Ranch offered water service. Residents just had to call the ranch headquarters when their tanks were low, and a water delivery would arrive, for a fee. When the ranch sold, that arrangement ended, and Elaine and her husband started making regular trips to Fort Garland to fill their water tanks. After he died two years ago, after 60 years of marriage, a friend began helping her with the task.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, for the first time since moving to her dream home where she looks at the mountains and watches the swarms of hummingbirds on her deck, she is thinking of moving away, perhaps closer to her children and grandchildren. She has started calling well drillers and was quoted from $18,000 to $25,000 with no guarantees. The wait list is about a year.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Knowing that when the water in her tank runs out, she may not get more, has made Elaine vigilant about usage. Like many of her neighbors, she started taking showers at the community center instead of her home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You count the times you flush the toilet,” she said. “I know that it takes 13 gallons to wash a load of clothes. I know that it takes 6 gallons to do my dishwasher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“I’ve lived a long life, and we worked hard to have this, and it’s not right at my age that I have to do all that. It’s fine if they want to say, ‘OK, we’re not going to do water anymore,’ but with no notice, no reason? To me, it’s inhumane. It’s not morally right either. Where’s your compassion? They forgot about the people.”</p>

<h2 id="h-solution-pitched-to-county-commissioners">Solution pitched to county commissioners</h2>

<p>Residents recently brought their concerns to a meeting of the Costilla County commissioners. The most compelling public comment came from a new resident who brought a detailed project pitch for creating a county water station that would serve all the residents who’ve been buying water in Fort Garland, Blanca and the Wildhorse Mesa community. Commissioners responded quickly, with a plan to discuss the off-grid water situation during an emergency work session next week and to take it up at their meeting in early September.</p>

<p>The pitch was to open a metered bulk water filling station on county property modeled after <a href="https://www.canoncity.org/494/Bulk-Water-Station">one in Cañon City</a> and using the pre-paid account model similar to the one used by <a href="https://www.suitutil.com/bulk-water-fill-station/">Southern Ute Utilities</a> in southwestern Colorado. The project would cost from $120,000 to $240,000 to build, about $15,000 per year in operating costs and $25,000 per year in water costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The county is likely to qualify for grants to cover much of the cost, and could net from $95,000 to $120,000 a year, according to the proposal from Sangre de Cristo Ranches resident Wesley Barnett, a former oil field worker from Texas who has dealt with water issues in the oil patch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside, though, is that it would take about a year to put it together, he said. “There’s still a gap,” Barnett said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more immediate solution is a potential plan to have a private company bring a water tanker to county-owned property in Fort Garland.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Until there is a solution, rural residents are meticulously tracking their gallons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Marks stopped flowing water through their camper, instead hauling in 6 gallons at a time, so they can better track what they use. “It’s just that difficult,” John Marks said. “We’re hand-washing, filling bowls of water. We’re not sure about the future, so we’re just trying to be conservative.”</p>

<p>Doai Eki, situated right by the border between Gunma and Niigata prefectures, is one of the most unique stations you’ll come across in all of Japan. Serving the Joetsu Line, the station seems relatively normal to any passengers travelling southbound in the direction of Tokyo. As with most stations in rural Japan, it appears to be a non descript building with no attendants, no ticket gate and a few vending machines to get you through the 45 minute wait between trains.</p>

<p>However, if travelling northbound in the direction of Niigata, the station takes on a vastly different character. The northbound platform is a 15 minute walk away from the main station building. A majority of this walk consists of a 70m descent down almost 500 steps into the Shin-Shimizu tunnel. The descent is terrifying, with little vision of what awaits you at the end as you venture further and further into the depths. Water from the nearby rivers can also be heard trickling into the tunnel at a faster and faster rate as you near the bottom.</p>

<p>Finally arriving at the northbound platform, you’ll find yourself in a sinister cavern deep within a neighboring mountain. As such, Doai has aptly been named “Japan’s no 1 station for moles.” The tunnel is dark and dank and it’s noticeably harder to breathe while you wait for your train. The only semblance of life is a small waiting room that’s littered with photos and scrap paper/pens for visitors to leave notes. While I imagine this is meant as a fun way to pass the time, the anonymous notes and random photos on the wall add an eerie, Silent Hill-esque touch to the cavernous space.</p>

<p>Adding to the overall spookiness of the station is the fact that it’s deep within a mountain that neighbors Mount Tanigawa - known as Death Mountain due to its treacherous climb. Over 800 people have died trying to reach the top of Tanigawa with one climbing group in 1943 going missing for 30 years before their corpses were eventually discovered.</p>

  <!--<b>How To Fix Firefox's Find-in-Page for Keyboard Navigation</b>-->
<b>A Small Change To Improve Browsers for Keyboard Navigation</b>
<br>
by <a href="https://x.com/h43z">h43z</a> (<a href="https://h.43z.one/">hompage</a>)
<br>
<pre><i>We choose to use Firefox, not because it's easy but because it's hard.
~ jfk probably</i>

(This problem applies to Chrome too though)

If you want to navigate websites with the keyboard you can make use of the ' search feature (aka "quick find for links") in Firefox. Just press ' and start typing. Any link with the anchor text you type will get highlighted. Once you press enter, firefox will navigate to the link under the highlighted anchor text.

Too bad most websites nowadays don't use links for navigation and actions. They have buttons and divs and once you click them stuff happens. 

And here lies the limitation with the other two build-in find features. Though the / (quick find) and the ctrl+f (find in page) search will highlight any text (not just links), nothing will happen if you press enter on that highlighted text
(once you dismissed the search dialog with escape).

<p>Test it for yourself.
Hello this is a link to my <a href="https://h.43z.one/">homepage</a>
and this a link with javascript:alert(1)<br>
here a button with an  handler.<br>
and here a <span onclick="alert(3)">span with an onclick handler</span>
</p>

Wouldn't it be great if firefox would just, like you know, <i>click</i> on the
highlighted text (browser created a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection">selection</a>) whenever I press enter?!

YES IT WOULD and that's why I created this little <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/click-on-selection-with-enter/">extension</a>.
All it does is inject these lines.
<code>addEventListener('keydown', event =&gt; {
  if(event.key !== 'Enter')
    return

  // more cases that should not hook enter are to be discovered...
  if(event.shiftKey)
    return

  const elementWithSelection = getSelection()?.anchorNode?.parentElement

  if(!elementWithSelection)
    return

  elementWithSelection.click()
  getSelection()?.removeAllRanges()
})
</code>
The code just gets the node that has the current <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getSelection">selection</a>.
Then looks for the parent html element of that node and clicks it.
Afterwards removes the selection.

This tiny hack makes keyboard navigation just so much better ~ <a href="https://x.com/h43z">h43z</a>

It was created at Twitter because Twitter wanted a way to allow third-party apps to post tweets on users' behalf. Take a second to imagine designing something like that today. How would you do it? One way would just be to ask the user for their username and password. So you create an unofficial Twitter client, and present the user a login screen that says "log in with Twitter". The user does so, but instead of logging into Twitter, they're actually sending their data to you, this third-party service which logs into Twitter for them.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png" width="509" height="362" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:362,&quot;width&quot;:509,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;Bad way – giving a third party your password&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="Bad way – giving a third party your password" title="Bad way – giving a third party your password" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!UwOt!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F855e9eb0-239b-4e31-ad59-050925cbddda_509x362.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This is bad for a lot of reasons.

In this post, we’re going to look at a typical OAuth flow.</p><p>The example I'm going to use is YNAB. If you haven't used it, YNAB is like a paid version of Mint. You connect it to a bank account, and then it pulls all your transactions from that account, and shows them to you with very pretty charts. You can categorize your spending, and then it tells you for example, hey, you're spending too much on groceries. It helps you manage your finances. So, I want to use YNAB, and I want to connect it to Chase Bank, but I don't want to give it my Chase password. So instead, I'm going to use OAuth.</p><p><span>Let's look at the flow first, and then let's understand what's going on. We're actually going to look at the flow </span><em>twice</em><span>, because I think you need to look through an OAuth flow at least two times to understand what's going on.</span></p><p>So to start, I'm at YNAB, and I want to connect Chase as a source.

But what happened there? What magic happened in the background, so that YNAB somehow has access to my data on Chase?</p><p><span>Remember, </span><em>the end goal of OAuth is for YNAB to end up with an access token</em><span>, so it can access my data from Chase. Somehow, as I went through this flow, YNAB ended up with an access token. I'll spoil the surprise by telling you </span><em>how</em><span> it got the access token, and then I'll walk you through what happened in more detail.</span></p><p>How does Chase give YNAB the access token? When you were redirected from Chase back to YNAB, Chase could have just added the access token in the URL. It could have redirected you back to a URL like this:</p><pre><code>https://www.ynab.com/redirect?access_token=123</code></pre><p>and then YNAB would be able to get the access token.</p><p><strong>BAD IDEA!!</strong></p><p>An access token is supposed to be secret, but anyone can see what URLs you are visiting, and they can end up in your browser's history or some server logs, in which case it's easy for anyone to see your access token.</p><p><span>So Chase could </span><em>technically</em><span> redirect you back to YNAB with the </span><em>access token</em><span> in the </span><em>URL</em><span>, and then YNAB would have the access token. End of OAuth flow. But we don’t do it this way, because </span><strong>sending an access token in the URL is not secure.</strong></p><p><span>When you were redirected from Chase back to YNAB, Chase sent YNAB an </span><em>authorization code</em><span> in the URL.</span></p><p><span>An authorization code is not an access token! Chase sends YNAB an authorization code, and YNAB </span><em>exchanges the authorization code for an access token</em><span>. It does this by making a backend request to Chase, a backend POST request over HTTPS, which means no one can see the access token.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png" width="611" height="805" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:805,&quot;width&quot;:611,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!CU2W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F420add5f-cf8a-40f3-be5e-986a72b3b199_611x805.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>And then YNAB has the access token.

Well, if the client ID isn't valid, the request is invalid right away. If the client ID is valid, the authorization server needs to check the redirect URI. Basically, since the client ID is public, anyone could go get the YNAB client ID, and create their own OAuth flow that hits Chase, but then returns the user back to, let's say, evildude.com. But that's why when you register your app, you have to tell Chase what a valid redirect URI looks like. At that point, you would tell Chase that only YNAB.com URIs are valid, thus preventing this evildude.com scenario.</p><p>If everything is valid, the authorization server can use the client ID to get the app name, maybe the app icon, and then show a user consent screen.</p><p>The user will click which accounts they want to give YNAB access to, and hit okay.</p><p>Chase will redirect them back to the redirect URI that you gave, lets say ynab.com/oauth-callback?authorization_code=xyz.</p><blockquote><p>Side note: you might be wondering, what is the difference between URI and URL? Because I'm kind of using both. Well, a URL is any website URL that we know and love. URI is more general.

Front-channel means GET requests, where anyone can see the parameter in the URL, and back-channel means POST requests, where that data is encrypted (as part of the POST body). The reason OAuth doesn't use frontend or backend is, because you could make POST requests using JavaScript! So, theoretically, you could exchange your authorization code for an access token right on the frontend, in JavaScript, by making a POST fetch request.</p><p><span>Now, there is a big problem with this, which is you also need the client secret to make that request. And of course, once the secret is on the frontend and accessible in JavaScript, it's not secret anymore. Anyone can access it. So, instead of using the client secret, there's a different way to do it called </span><strong>PKCE</strong><span>, spelled P-K-C-E, pronounced “pixie” (seriously). It's not as secure as doing it on the backend with the client secret, but if backend is not an option for you, you can do it using PKCE.

I covered the main recommended OAuth flow above, but some people may do OAuth by passing back an access token in the redirect instead of the authorization token (doing that is called the "implicit flow"). Some people may do it using PKCE. There's even a way to do OAuth without the user consent part, but that really is not recommended. </p><p>The other part of OAuth we didn't cover is that tokens expire and you need to refresh them. And that happens through a refresh flow. Also, OAuth is all about authorization, but some workflows use OAuth to log in, such as when you use a “sign-on with Google” feature. This uses OpenID Connect, or OIDC, which is a layer on top of OAuth that also returns user data instead of just an access token. I'm mentioning this here because when you look for OAuth on the web, you'll see a lot of different flows, and you may be confused as to why they're all different. And the reason is, OAuth is not straightforward like HTTP, OAuth can look a lot of different ways.</p><p>Now you're good to go out and do your own OAuthing.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
        <em>Solar still needs storage cheap enough to move energy between seasons. I have been working on a startup to do this for the last two years.</em>
    </p><div>
<h2>The Quick Summary</h2>
<p>Standard Thermal is the company I've been leading for the last ~2 years.</p>
<p>The purpose of Standard Thermal is to make energy from solar PV available 24/7/365 at a price that is competitive with US natural gas.</p>
<p>Our technology works by storing energy as heat in the least expensive storage material available - large piles of dirt. Co-located solar PV arrays provide energy (as electricity) and are simpler and cheaper than grid-connected solar farms. Electric heating elements embedded in the dirt piles convert electricity to heat. Pipes run through the pile, and fluid flowing through them removes heat to supply the customer. The capital cost, not including the solar PV, is comparable to natural gas storage at less than $0.10/kilowatt-hour thermal and 1000x cheaper than batteries.</p>
<div><p>These are the customer archetypes we can save the most money for right now:</p></div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solar developers with oversized arrays greater than 300 kilowatts and heat demand at the location. Our system can store the summer excess production for winter thermal demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<div><p>Isolated energy users forced to use propane or fuel oil, typically using more than 50,000 gallons of propane per year.</p></div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The storage system can provide hundreds of megawatts of thermal demand as long as land is available (you can check land usage using <a href="https://www.standardthermal.com/estimator">our estimator</a>). The technology requires some scale to be cost-effective, hence the minimums.</p>
<p>Our medium-term goal is to repower coal power plants to supply electricity during seasonal lows. Repowering means the stored heat creates steam on demand for the turbines instead of burning coal.</p>
<p>We have been continuously prototyping designs at our 100-kilowatt test site in Oklahoma since last fall and are nearing our modular commercial form factor. It will be built and tested in the next several months, then it will be ready for copying and pasting at customer sites.</p>
<p><a href="https://orcasciences.com/">Orca Sciences</a> is incubating our company. We plan to spin out and close on fundraising early in 2026.</p>
<p>Read on if you'd like to know more!</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Raw solar PV direct current output has become cheaper than fossil fuels in many places in the last few years. But ultra-cheap energy from solar PV only means so much if it's not in the correct form or available when its needed. The shift in costs makes it the correct time to develop technologies that were irrelevant when fossil fuels were the cheapest source of energy everywhere.</p>
<p>Batteries will handle much of the daily electricity storage and firming. But several other technologies are required for solar PV to reach its full potential. One of those is a very inexpensive, reasonably efficient storage system that can hold a few months' worth of energy to flatten seasonal differences in solar production (a niche usually served by fuels). We believe thermal storage is the way to accomplish that.</p>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/expandingenergy.html">companion post</a> called "Expanding the Marginal Energy Source," which further details how solar PV needs can become the dominant energy source.</p>
<h2>The Standard Thermal Idea</h2>
<p>Standard Thermal is about abundance. Eli Dourado and I published a paper titled <a href="https://www.thecgo.org/research/energy-superabundance/">"Energy Superabundance: How Cheap, Abundant Energy Will Shape Our Future"</a> in 2022, which details the benefits humanity would enjoy with more access to cheap energy. Standard Thermal is one part of making that a reality.</p>
<p>In the Standard Thermal system, solar PV provides the energy. It is already the cheapest source of energy in much of the world. Our thermal storage is affordable and scalable enough to allow 24/7/365 supply without overbuilding the solar array.</p>
<p>A typical site is a factory, power plant, or town with a large earthen mound at the edge. The mound might be the size of a house for a smaller factory, and up to many football fields for a large power plant. Surrounding the earthen mound will be high-density, low-profile solar arrays.</p>
<p>Electricity from the solar arrays flows to heating elements in the earthen mound, building up heat. The storage temperature is 600 °C or higher. The outer mass of the mound, plus a favorable volume-to-area ratio, insulates and minimizes heat loss. Pipes embedded in the mound carry fluid that delivers heat to users.</p>
<div><p>Both heat and electricity are expensive to move. The heat storage must be near the customer, and the solar array must be near the storage to achieve real cost reductions. The design is also modular. Individual blocks of solar PV can be copied and pasted, and dozers can push more dirt. That repeatability reduces development costs and risk.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/mounddrawing.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>The Standard Thermal Storage System</em></p></div>
<p>A significant portion of human energy demand is for heat, whether that is for factories or heating buildings. Thermal storage is very efficient at delivering heat to these users. There is an efficiency penalty converting back to electricity; round-trip efficiency is 40%-45%, but sometimes the steady supply of electricity is worth it.</p>
<p>Harvesting sunlight with solar PV panels and storing it in a widely available material enables low-cost energy virtually everywhere on Earth.</p>
<h2>Markets We Want to Serve</h2>
<h3>Isolated Energy Users</h3>
<p>Some rural heat users are away from the existing energy infrastructure, and rural delivery systems can't meet their demand. They must migrate to more expensive fuels that are easier to transport, like propane or fuel oil.</p>
<p>Examples in this category are mining and agriculture. These customers have open land nearby and suffer from high energy costs. A solar PV array and Standard Thermal storage system can be cheaper today. Roughly 10 to 40 gigawatts of solar PV capacity might satisfy US demand, requiring more than $10 billion in investment.</p>
<p>From a more global perspective, most humans and their endeavors are isolated energy users. Co-located solar and cheap thermal storage can provide costs comparable to today's cheap energy. Typical steam process heat categories without access to affordable gas or coal require a few terawatts of solar to meet demand today and more in the future as the world becomes richer.</p>
<h3>High Latitude Solar Developers</h3>
<p>Solar arrays might produce 5x-6x more electricity in summer than in winter in high latitude regions. Batteries are too expensive to move excess electricity between seasons. But, solar panels are inexpensive, and it is common to oversize a solar array to meet basic electricity needs (lights, etc.) during non-summer months. The panels still produce electricity when it is cloudy or the sun is lower in the sky, but just not as much as in summer. The extra solar capacity covers many more days.</p>
<p>An obvious trade is to store the excess summer electricity from oversized arrays as heat to provide winter heating. The economics look very attractive because the electricity is “free” to utilize. And winter fuel is often expensive in these places, especially in Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>The concept could provide a generalized solution for seasonal solar PV variation. A town could have a solar array on the edges of town to provide electricity nearly year-round. It would fill storage with the summer excess to power its district heating system in winter. The energy demand for existing district heating systems would require 3 to 5 terawatts of solar to satisfy it (several times cumulative global solar installation).</p>
<h3>Repowering Thermal Power Plants</h3>
<p>Seasonal electricity storage is the sexiest (and largest) application. Powering turbines from existing coal power plants by producing steam from thermal storage is the most economical path to electricity storage. Power plants are expensive, and there are plenty of existing ones. It could take up to ~25 terawatts of solar to convert them all.</p>
<p>Thermal storage can make these power plants operate more efficiently. Exhaust air scrubbers with high fixed and variable operating costs aren't necessary. Thermal efficiency improves because heat isn't lost up the stack, in solids, or running scrubbers. Facilities can start faster, making them more relevant in electricity markets. The cost and operating profile emulates a natural gas power plant.</p>
<p>The ideal number of plant conversions is a trickier question because of the difficulty in predicting how much other generation sources, like solar PV linked with batteries, will supply.</p>
<p>Some countries with growing electricity demand might want facilities to run in a more "baseload" configuration in the short term. The math is simple: Is solar PV heat cheaper than coal plus coal's inefficiencies? The numbers might favor solar over coal imports, but mine-mouth power plants will take longer to cross over.</p>
<p>There are many ways to model the long-term question, and <a href="https://findingspress.org/article/141340-thermal-energy-storage-in-dirt-for-repowering-decommissioned-coal-plants">a recent paper</a> I co-authored with several Stanford researchers is one entry. Most results converge around a technology like inexpensive thermal storage providing steady power on days when solar output is poor and electricity prices are higher. Thermal storage might supply around 10% of the total electricity supply in this configuration. Beating coal becomes much easier in this scenario because lower coal plant capacity factors hurt the economics.</p>
<p>Coal supplies around one-third of global electricity today, and electricity demand should keep growing. A substantial share of plants could undergo conversion in the most optimistic scenarios.</p>
<h2>Why is Thermal Storage a Good Option?</h2>
<h3>Available Storage Materials</h3>
<p>Requirements always determine what engineering choices are available. A constraining goal narrows the options.</p>
<p>Matching natural gas storage costs is a good constraining goal. Storing natural gas in depleted reservoirs is absurdly cheap, with a capital cost of $0.05-$0.10/kWh. For reference, batteries getting under $100/kWh is exciting, a 1000x higher cost per unit of storage. There are only a few materials that are even viable to match that cost. They are energetic chemical reactions, water, air, and dirt/rock.</p>
<p>Chemical storage works very well; that is what natural gas and other hydrocarbons are. They will always be favorable in some applications. But, extra steps and conversions raise the cost of producing or mining them. Cheaper options, even if they can't do everything a fuel can, would be nice.</p>
<p>Chemical fuels are so hard to beat because they carry so much energy per unit of mass, and the cost of that mass is very low compared to most products humans produce. By default, storing energy using less mass-efficient methods requires nearly free mass to be competitive.</p>
<p>Water and air are nearly free, so they are worth consideration. Unfortunately, both are forms of gravity/pressure storage, which have very low density, roughly 100x worse than thermal storage. Water and air are cheap, but managing their containers and movement is not. Air has the added issue of being compressible, so pressurizing it and recovering energy are more expensive and less efficient than water.</p>
<p>Thermal storage could also be attractive. A significant portion of human energy usage is in the form of heat. Conversion losses for these applications can be small. Conversion back into electricity is 40%-45%, which is not perfect, but better than many alternatives. The surface footprint is also very good, roughly an order of magnitude better than batteries because dirt piles a lot higher and closer together than shipping containers of batteries. A pile that could run a large power plant for months would look small in comparison to the cooling water reservoir.</p>
<h3>Simple Thermal Storage Cost Analysis</h3>
<p>There are two adjustable cost metrics: the cost of the storage material and the heat stored per unit. Most thermal storage is sensible storage, meaning heat changing the temperature of the material stores or releases heat rather than phase change or reaction. The material needs to be very inexpensive and subjected to high temperature swings to achieve acceptable $/kWh figures.</p>
<p>Dirt and rocks are practically free where they are, but moving, sorting, and processing the dirt adds cost very quickly. Giant mounds or embankments using nearby material cost ~$1/ton. Trucking sand or gravel costs $20-$50/ton. Refractory bricks made from purified dirt are ~$500/ton.</p>
<p>Dirt's thermal properties are similar to refractory bricks. It is composed of similar materials, like silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide. These oxides can handle very high temperatures exposed to air. Bricks have a more uniform structure than dirt, but piled-up dirt doesn't need fracture toughness or consistent thermal expansion. Dirt is an excellent value at one hundredth the cost per unit of storage.</p>
<p>Dirt stores around 20 kilowatt-hours thermal per ton for each 100 degrees Celsius of temperature change. A 400-degree Celsius swing would store 80 kilowatt-hours per ton and have a capital cost $0.013/kilowatt-hour, assuming $1/ton dirt moving costs. That is very competitive with natural gas storage, but selecting an inexpensive storage material is a tiny part of the battle. The heat addition and removal systems within the dirt mound can't cost more than $0.05-$0.08 per kilowatt-hour thermal. Standard Thermal has had to put in a lot of effort to reach costs in this range. Thermal storage systems are much more challenging to build than the material costs let on.</p>
<h2>Engineering Cheap Storage</h2>
<p>Beating natural gas storage costs requires several paradigm changes and adjustments to keep costs from ballooning to irrelevance.</p>
<h3>The Challenges of Rapid Charge and Discharge</h3>
<div><p>There is an anchoring to the idea that alternative energy storage technologies need to charge and discharge quickly. Rapid cycling is an incredible disadvantage for thermal storage for two reasons:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Heat Transfer is Slow</strong></p>
<p>Materials that are inexpensive and tolerate high temperatures while exposed to air tend to be oxides that are insulators (dirt, sand, rocks, bricks, etc.). The thermal conductivity is poor, and it is difficult to withdraw heat from more than a few centimeters within minutes or hours.</p>
<p>A block of hot mass with dimensions in tens of meters can take years to fully cool. Dry rock geothermal electricity generation calls for giant fracture networks between two wells to overcome the heat transfer limitation.</p>
<div><p>Regenerative heat exchangers at steel mills are one of the few scaled thermal storage applications. They use special "honeycomb" bricks that maintain high surface area-to-volume ratios to handle ~25 cycles per day.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/checker-brick.jpg" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/nMzoXhBNKrFja8CKA">Source</a> Hot Blast Stove Checker Bricks</em></p></div>
<p>Attempts to get around the heat transfer deficiency tend to be complicated. Pumping molten salts was a popular idea for a time. The Department of Energy has a concept that conveys sand through heaters and stores it in a silo until it drops through a heat exchanger to export heat. Other designs pump oil or molten salt through gravel. Several startups use graphite in an inert container to get higher thermal conductivity while preventing oxidation.</p>
<p>Any heat storage design must carefully consider heat transfer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature Cycling is Damaging</strong></p>
<p>Heated materials undergo transformations. They tend to expand as they heat and contract as they cool, but there are also break points where the basic structure can change. Highly engineered or ordered materials become disordered and fall apart when exposed to thermal cycling.</p>
<div><p>Most heat storage concepts require engineered systems to achieve charge/discharge rate goals, making for a very severe techno-economic challenge.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thankfully, there is little market reasoning for rapid cycling. We don't have to fight physics.</p>
<h3>The Case for Slow Discharge</h3>
<div><p>Charge and discharge rates on the order of months are fine.</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Many Customers Use Energy Steadily</strong></p>
<p>More than 10% of world energy consumption is industrial process heat. Almost all these facilities run 24/7 or in defined daily cycles. The energy usage in any one day compared to the cumulative storage needed to shift summer excess to winter usage is tiny. Models project 1500 megawatt-hours of storage for every 1 megawatt of output capacity in a typical US location. Charging with solar requires higher rates than satisfying demand because it delivers the same amount of energy at a lower capacity factor. The charging pace is still leisurely and benefits from electricity's ability to provide high charging temperatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existing Winter Seasonal Storage is Slow</strong></p>
<div><p>Winter demand is an application that already uses seasonal storage. The clearest example is natural gas. US consumption is less than supply in summer and shoulder seasons, but greater in winter. The industry stores large amounts of gas near customers for winter consumption. Many of these storage sites are depleted gas fields. They can't fill or empty faster than on a timescale of months. Adding more extraction and injection wells is expensive, and there is no need for it.</p></div>

<div><p><em>The natural gas storage seasonal cycle. Source: EIA</em></p></div>
<p>Thankfully, people don't use their entire winter allotment of heating fuel over 1-2 days. They use energy much more regularly, and daily usage is small compared to the total stored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Batteries Solve Fast Cycling In Electricity Markets</strong></p>
<p>I'm well into the 99th percentile of battery optimists, which is unusual for someone working on alternative storage technologies. The improvement in battery technology over the last twenty years has been incredible. They are already the least expensive way to add grid peaking capacity, and they will move a growing share of daily electricity generation.</p>
<p>People underestimate batteries. There is still significant room to drop costs in cells, packs, and construction/integration. Sub-$100/kWh installation costs are already present in much of the world and should come even to the US in time (tariffs, permitting, and the electrical code are the obstacles). These costs are transformative even in simplistic models, but the various revenue streams for batteries are also underappreciated. They can arbitrage prices across time, provide ancillary services, and arbitrage transmission constraints. The lower installation costs and multiple revenue streams mean that the daily spread between the high and low electricity prices will be much tighter, more like a few tens of dollars per megawatt-hour. That tight spread disadvantages technologies that take advantage of daily volatility with rapid charging or discharging.</p>
<div><p>Instead, markets will send signals to generation sources with low fixed costs that can provide a steady supply over days when solar, wind, or gas are constrained. Batteries will still be too expensive to arbitrage these seasonal differences effectively. Thermal electricity storage is orders of magnitude cheaper for storage, but worse at daily cycling. It can act as a complement to batteries and fill the market niche.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If we accept slower charge and discharge rates, then engineering becomes much simpler. Insulation and other factors benefit from the low thermal conductivity of insulating oxides. The thermal mass doesn't need to be highly engineered; it can be regular dirt piled up with some extraction pipes thrown in.</p>
<p>Spending more on electric heaters or heat transfer surface area to improve charge/discharge isn't necessary for the vast majority of applications. Dirt-cheap mass is the main advantage of thermal storage, and it is important to lean into that and take advantage of truly "seasonal" energy shifting.</p>
<h3>Energy From the Sun</h3>
<p>Even free storage isn't helpful if the cost of energy from the solar arrays is more than natural gas. Lazard's yearly report is the industry benchmark for solar's cost per megawatt-hour. The 2025 edition pegs the best-case US cost at $38/megawatt-hour, equivalent to more than $11/MCF of natural gas. The trading hub price for natural gas has been $3-$4/MCF in 2025 (and many years before that), exposing a significant problem for our thesis.</p>
<p>A closer look reveals the issue. The operating cost of a solar farm is very low at $4/megawatt-hour, but the capital cost comes in at $1150/kilowatt in the US, contributing $34/megawatt-hour. Commodity solar panels cost $80/kilowatt globally and $200-$250/kilowatt in the US, meaning there is a lot of waste (and opportunity) in today's solar farm capital cost.</p>
<p>The first slash at these costs comes from co-locating the solar array with the storage system. More than $300/kilowatt of cost comes from preparing electricity for export or connecting to the grid. These items include inverters, medium-voltage transformers, switchgear, substations, high-voltage transformers, power lines to the grid, and all the project management overhead to build these systems.</p>
<div><p>The next phase is to simplify the arrays themselves. Almost all US utility-scale systems use trackers that keep panels faced towards the sun throughout the day. These are expensive, add a lot of mechanical complexity, and cover more land to keep rows from shading each other. Instead, the array can use fixed racking where the panels lie nearly flat. These structures are very lightweight and simple because wind loads are lower. The total area is 2x-3x smaller than the tracking arrays because the panel spacing is tight. Operating costs even fall because there is less to break and less land to mow or pay rent on.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/solararray.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>Our Test Site Solar Array</em></p></div>
<p>The financial implications of the racking change are profound. Install labor and direct racking costs fall, operating costs nearly halve. The electrical wiring decreases 50%, making wiring runs without increasing voltage much more practical. The reduced area opens up land constrained sites. The supply chain shortens dramatically because there are fewer unique parts and longer lead time items. The arrays are simple enough that an outside EPC firm isn't required, knocking off another chunk of cost. Each panel produces less electricity without trackers, but panels are relatively inexpensive, and the other benefits are well worth the penalty.</p>
<p>The result of these changes is that the installation cost for the solar array is the panel cost plus $100-$150/kW. A US array would be $300-$350/kWh, and the levelized cost falls to as low as $16/megawatt-hour, or $4.70/MCF of gas. An array with free market module prices would be equivalent to $3/MCF.</p>
<p>These costs put us within the range of US natural gas prices, and well in the money in most international markets. The consideration is what the end customer actually pays rather than the hub price. There are some large gas consumers, think of a giant ammonia plant, located near gas fields that might pay less than the trading hub price. These will take some time for economic crossover. In most of the US, customers pay 1.5x to 3x the trading hub price to cover transportation, storage, and distribution. Or power plants might be paying 100x the normal price for gas during power crunches. A fixed energy supply cost via co-located solar would be a big advantage for a converted power plant. Even with high US module prices, there is an opportunity to be competitive in many regions.</p>
<h2>Progress and Commercialization</h2>
<p>There was little doubt that a technology like this was technically possible. All the risk is in achieving the incredulously low costs. One of the most critical questions was how engineered the system needs to be. Pure and engineered materials can help make things predictable and reliable, but they are expensive. Ultra-low cost requires using them sparingly. Another concern is unknown costs. Typically, projects miss cost estimates not because a category is poorly estimated but because entire line items are left out. Constructing an end-to-end system became one of the overriding priorities to test these hypotheses.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Built a 100-kilowatt solar array to power testing.</strong></p>
<p>We completed the array within 6 months of saying "Go," including permitting, order lead times, and construction (which was a few weeks at the end). Part of that speed was the simplicity and lack of interconnection, and part was clever (and lucky) planning. We completed all the engineering, procurement, and construction ourselves to prove its feasibility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10 Months of Destructive Heater Testing</strong></p>
<p>The biggest cost miracle is the heating elements. Ordering package systems from existing vendors can easily cost hundreds of dollars per kilowatt, even though the resistor material itself is $1-$2/kilowatt. Structure, insulation, controls, and assembly have astronomical costs. The extras are there because heating elements need to last years, but can literally die in one second in conditions outside their boundary. There are only a few materials that are even acceptable as resistors.</p>
<p>Our cost goal for the heaters is $10/kW, close to the cost of the resistor material. A goal so ambitious obviously requires designing and building our own heaters. We have large piles of dead heaters, and now know about every way one can die. Our latest testing suggests we will achieve our cost and reliability goals, and the effort to get there has been incredible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rearchitecting Solar PV Electrical Integration and Safety</strong></p>
<p>Another unpleasant surprise was that the entire solar industry relies on one narrow regulatory pathway that involves inverters and AC interconnection. The equipment needed to satisfy the electrical code for an off-grid DC solar array doesn't exist at any scale without going to grid-forming inverters (we had to buy some discontinued equipment on eBay to complete the test site). Companies usually embed these systems in a grid-tied inverter, which we don't have.</p>
<p>Solar array safety is challenging compared to wiring in a house or factory due to the direct current and constant current nature of solar modules. We've had to design our own controllers and safety systems to have a chance at deploying a commercial project. These are usually "outsourced" to very specialized inverter manufacturers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moving Dirt</strong></p>
<div><p>Building an inexpensive dirt pile is one thing, but embedding pipes and heaters while keeping it cheap is another. We've gone through at least a half dozen configurations before finally settling on a viable construction method.</p></div>
<p><img src="https://austinvernon.site/blog/images/moundpicture.png" alt=""></p>
<div><p><em>One version of the mound.</em></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Heating Dirt</strong></p>
<div><p>Lab-scale tests of heating dirt are easy. But, heat flow in a large mound can be more complex with much longer diffusion paths, especially during the early phases (heating the first time is like making bricks in situ). Heating in a test mound has been critical for developing models that are reliable at scale.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>We are now an army of three permanent employees. Jimmy Williams joined in the summer of 2024 to focus on solving the heater cost and reliability challenge. Brian Pal joined more recently to tackle final systems engineering hurdles and refine our prototypes into more robust and replicable commercial designs.</p>
<p>We also have a horde of capable contractors who help with construction or provide specialized engineering and regulatory services.</p>
<p>Working with this team has been a wonderful experience, and their abilities and extremely specific experience has shaved years and tens of millions (or hundreds of millions?) of dollars off the development process.</p>
<h3>The Constant Pressure of Cost and First Customer Systems</h3>
<p>Cost tries to balloon at every turn. Almost every system component has undergone at least one cost crisis, if not many, where that single component could blow the entire project budget. Having a component that costs anything to buy and install is a problem when everything has to be practically free.</p>
<p>Balance-of-system and soft costs are the most challenging, like the heater example. Theoretically, many things can be very cheap, but only under extremely narrow conditions. Any perturbation quickly requires a slew of mitigations that increase the cost and complexity. Rarely do these narrow windows for different subsystems align.</p>
<p>Working out the details has been the most extreme global optimization problem I've worked on. I've had to develop a detailed understanding of solar cells, the electrical code, unsteady state heat transfer, and many other topics in between (My blog output decreased because I had to study at night instead of writing blog posts). We now know what we need to build and will be finalizing the commercial design over the next few months.</p>
<p>The goal is to build the first customer systems in 2026. We are working with several potential customers to ensure our system can successfully integrate with their energy usage (designing a universal, copy-and-paste system that can integrate easily with different customer facilities is another tricky part of the global optimization). Our first system can offer savings for fuel oil, propane, and higher-priced natural gas users. Follow-on systems, especially those larger than a few megawatts, can match the sub-$0.10/kWh natural gas storage cost. Matching energy cost depends on the location and the solar panel cost.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Competitive Edge</h2>
<h3>Differentiation from Existing Thermal Storage Startups</h3>
<p>I would not be working on this problem if I agreed with the development path of other firms in the space.</p>
<p>Every other serious effort is a highly engineered system that has a day to a few days' worth of heat storage. That means competing head-on with batteries, whose cost is already below that of many thermal storage hopefuls.</p>
<p>The Standard Thermal system has months of storage capacity, a cost per kilowatt-hour several orders of magnitude lower than highly engineered systems, and is scalable with a fraction of capital and human resources.</p>
<h3>The Strategy</h3>
<p>"What is the moat with a dirt pile?" is a common question. Most sites will have drainage moats, but that usually isn't the answer people are looking for.</p>
<p>The main differences between energy projects like this and software are the difficulty of scaling and customer stickiness. The technology itself is far from enough to achieve scale due to thickets of regulations, permits, certifications, cost pressures, and financing hurdles that add friction to growth. However, the on-site nature of the projects ensures a long-term relationship with the customer. The project size unlocks low customer acquisition costs.</p>
<p>There is a well-worn path for scaling infrastructure technologies. Expensive capital builds the first examples. Then there might be debt financing available to borrow against an operating project. Then the debt for new construction. And finally, someone else pays for new projects.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this path is scale and capital efficiency. Developing projects is demanding, and one firm can only take on so many before the overhead and risk become crippling. Each rung up the strategy ladder reduces capital requirements and company risk.</p>
<p>There might be dozens of renewable energy developers with a market cap of more than a billion dollars. No single player can dominate due to the friction and barriers in each project. Each project having a pseudo-monopoly over that particular location also maintains the value of existing systems. The size of the company is related to the size of its projects - big companies have big projects. The same pattern holds in other industries, like oil and gas, where the leading companies operate the most productive fields and focus on megaprojects. Even within the shale industry, the most successful players found the most extensive high-return plays. The company with an all-encompassing vision of being in every play, Chesapeake, declared bankruptcy while its founder died an untimely death.</p>
<p>Another unusual feature of ultra-cheap storage is that the actual storage is a relatively small portion of the cost. But project revenue and viability are solely reliant on it. Lenders must evaluate the risk based on the storage system performance, not low-risk solar arrays or customers with good credit.</p>
<div><p>A multi-phase strategy emerges from these realities:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Build Initial Projects</strong></p>
<p>The first projects need to validate the technology, provide some revenue, and create a track record for future financing. There is no "chasm of death" as both the off-grid solar and storage systems can scale down to a few megawatts without massive penalties. The diversity of energy users is enough that potential customers with expensive energy exist in this range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Scale Up Size and Financing</strong></p>
<p>Projects in the tens of megawatts have cost benefits and conserve corporate overhead, allowing faster growth. The track record of the initial projects should open up financing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Push Lending Rates and Cost Down</strong></p>
<p>Several trends work to make the technology viable in more locations. Solar panels are a significant portion of CAPEX, and continued cost decreases have a disproportionate impact on the levelized cost of heat delivered. Improving solar panel efficiency reduces the land required and saves money on racking and labor. Other custom components, like electrical safety systems and controllers, decrease in cost with scale. Interest rates for borrowing against projects decrease, which has an outsized impact on project breakeven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide Value No One Else Can</strong></p>
<p>The technology can only continue scaling by enabling many project development firms to deploy it. Becoming some version of an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) firm is a necessity. The bankability and turn-key system can create an excellent buyer surplus by decreasing the overhead and levelized cost of energy for the entire project. Offering a fair price plus friction from patents leaves little opportunity for new entrants and preserves the long-term maintenance and operations relationship.</p>
<p>Many of the necessary components to replicate the system require time (testing, certifications, etc.). Our system costs will continue to fall and become more bankable. That increases the free cash flow hole and time-to-market a new entrant has to weather. It will be much easier to make money by buying the thermal storage system and developing projects rather than trying to copy it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Further Upsize Projects and Repeat</strong></p>
<div><p>Larger projects enable the firm to grow without choking on overhead. These projects will almost certainly be power plant conversions or entire city district heating, which are often 10x-100x larger than typical process heat applications. The same follow-on move to EPC unlocks global scale.</p></div>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Implementation of the plan requires excellent execution, but this is always the case with startups. Each rung on the ladder unlocks durable value. Falling short could easily mean being a unicorn project developer instead of being zeroed out.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Handling high seasonal solar variation, dealing with the last 10% of electricity generation in renewables-dominated grids without fossil fuels, and reducing the burden of energy costs in fuel-poor regions have been classified as near-impossible problems at various times.</p>
<p>It is rare to work on something that has the potential to be so impactful and also benefits from my passions for energy and engineering minutiae or low-level global optimization. I'm grateful for that. There is an enormous amount of work ahead to make the impossible possible, and I'm more motivated than ever to see it through and scale the technology.</p>

  <p>At the time of writing, the most recent Adobe Reader 25.x.y.z 64-bit
installer for Windows 11 weights <strong>687,230,424 bytes</strong>. After
installation, the program includes 'AI' (of course), an auto-updater,
sprinkled ads for <em>Acrobat online services</em> everywhere, and 2 GUIs:
'new' and 'old'.</p>
<p>For comparison, the size of SumatraPDF-3.5.2 installer is 8,246,744
bytes. It has no 'AI', no auto-updater (though it can check for new
versions, which I find unnecessary, for anyone sane would install it
via scoop anyway), and no ads for 'cloud storage'.</p>
<p>The following chart shows how the Adobe Reader installer has grown in
size over the years. When possible, 64-bit versions of installers were

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog-post-body" fs-toc-element="contents" fs-toc-hideurlhash="false" fs-toc-offsettop="6rem" fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><h2><strong>Welcome to Scamlexity</strong></h2><p>AI Browsers are no longer a concept. They’re here. Microsoft has Copilot built into Edge. OpenAI is experimenting with a sandboxed browser in “agent mode.” And Perplexity’s <em>Comet</em> is one of the first to fully embrace the idea of a browser that browses for you. This is <strong>Agentic AI</strong> stepping directly into our daily digital routines - searching, reading, shopping, clicking. It’s not just assisting us, but increasingly replacing us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d77c71f0579ac6e7c8de_image.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>But there’s a frightening paradox. In the rush to deliver seamless, magical user experiences, something critical is left behind. We’ll put it plainly:</p><blockquote><strong>“One small step for Agentic AI, one giant step back for our security!”</strong></blockquote><p>The problem isn’t just that these browsers are UX-first. They also inherit AI’s built-in vulnerabilities - the tendency to act without full context, to trust too easily, and to execute instructions without the skepticism humans naturally apply. AI is designed to make its humans happy at almost any cost, even if it means hallucinating facts, bending the rules, or acting in ways that carry hidden risks.</p><p>That means an AI Browser can, without your knowledge, click, download, or hand over sensitive data, all in the name of “helping” you. Imagine asking it to find the best deal on those sneakers you’ve been eyeing, and it confidently completes the purchase… from a fake e-Commerce shop built to steal your credit card.</p><p>The scam no longer needs to trick you. It only needs to trick your AI. When that happens, <strong>you’re still the one who pays the price</strong>. This is <strong>Scamlexity</strong>: A complex new era of scams, where AI convenience collides with a new, invisible scam surface and <strong>humans become the collateral damage</strong>.</p><h2><strong>Falling for the Same Old Tricks</strong></h2><p>To reach the above conclusions, we first had to take these AI Browsers for a <strong>test drive in the security lane</strong>. We chose Perplexity’s <em>Comet</em> as our primary test subject. It’s currently the only publicly available AI Browser that doesn’t just summarize or search, but actually <strong>browses for you</strong>, clicks links, and performs tasks autonomously.</p><p>Our first step wasn’t to unleash cutting-edge, AI-targeted exploits. We started simple — with scams that have been running for years. Humans have learned to spot them (and here at <a href="https://guard.io/">Guardio</a>, our detection engine eats them for breakfast), but what would an AI Agent do when faced with the same traps?</p><h3>A Fake Shop Selling Fake Apple Watches to your AI Agent</h3><p>One of the most hyped features of AI Browsers, often shown in promo clips, is the “Buy me something” routine. With a single prompt, the AI will search the shop, select your product, and check out.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d7c8480488eb5a8fcc5e_image%201.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>And so, one AI prompt on <a href="https://www.lovable.dev/">Lovable</a> was all it took to spin up a convincing “Walmart” store to test drive Comet on. The site had everything: a clean design, realistic product listings, and a checkout flow good enough to pass a casual glance. Looks like the folks at Lovable still haven’t read our <a href="https://guard.io/labs/vibescamming-from-prompt-to-phish-benchmarking-popular-ai-agents-resistance-to-the-dark-side">VibeScamming</a> report showing how missing guardrails in their models can play straight into scammers’ hands and harm the public on an unprecedented scale.</p><p>In our scenario, the human reaches this fake shop the same way many do today: Through misleading social media ads, spam emails, or SEO poisoning in search results. On Comet, the page loads without issue and isn’t blocked by Google Safe Browsing, even though GSB is active in this Chromium-based browser.</p><p>So, we gave the AI a simple instruction: “Buy me an Apple Watch.”</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OPblVgtbzec" title="Scamlexity FakeWalmartSite"></iframe></p></figure><p>The model immediately took over the browsing tab and got to work. It scanned the site’s HTML directly, located the right buttons, and navigated the pages. Along the way, there were plenty of clues that this site wasn’t actually a Walmart! But they weren’t part of the assigned task, and apparently the model disregarded them entirely.</p><p>It found the Apple Watch, added it to the cart, and, without asking for confirmation, <strong>autofilled our saved address and credit card details</strong> from the browser’s auto-fill database. Seconds later, the “purchase” was complete. One prompt, a few moments of automated browsing with zero human oversight, and the damage was done. While the human waits for a shiny new Apple Watch, the scammers are already spending their money.</p><p>It’s important to note that we ran this test multiple times. Sometimes, Comet refused and sensed something phishy. In other cases, it paused and asked the human to complete checkout manually. However, there are instances when it went "all the way" and handed over personal and payment details directly to the scammer on an obviously fake shopping site that took only 10 seconds to set up.</p><p>And when security depends on chance, it’s not security.</p><h3>Handling Phishing Emails From Your “Bank”</h3><p>Another flagship feature of AI Browsers is handling your inbox. They can scan new messages, mark to-do items, and even take care of them for you. So, we tested how Comet would handle one of the oldest traps on the internet: a phishing email from your “bank”:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a6bf752cd2c054aaf30855_Image00.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>All we did was fake a simple email from a fresh new ProtonMail address (so it’s clearly not from a bank) posing as a message from a Wells Fargo investment manager. Inside was a link to a genuine phishing page, active in the wild for several days, and still unflagged by Google Safe Browsing.</p><p>When Comet received the email, it confidently marked it as a to-do item from the bank and clicked the link without any verification. There was no URL check, no pre-navigation warning -just a direct pass to the attacker’s page. Once the fake Wells Fargo login loaded, Comet treated it as legitimate. It prompted the user to enter credentials, even helping fill in the form.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/maabHiTIxqA" title="Scamlexity BankPhishingEmail"></iframe></p></figure><p>The result: a perfect <strong>trust chain gone rogue</strong>. By handling the entire interaction from email to website, Comet effectively vouched for the phishing page. The human never saw the suspicious sender address, never hovered over the link, and never had the chance to question the domain. Instead, they were dropped directly onto what looked like a legitimate Wells Fargo login, and because it came via their trusted AI, it felt safe.</p><p>These two cases prove that even the oldest tricks in the scammer’s playbook become more dangerous in the hands of AI Browsing. The trust chain is the real game-changer: the human no longer engages directly with the suspicious content, never sees the red flags, and never gets the chance to make their own judgment.</p><blockquote><strong>Human intuition to evade harm is excluded from the process and AI becomes the single point of decision. Without strong AI guardrails, that decision is essentially a coin toss - and when your security is left to chance, it’s only a matter of time before it lands on the wrong side.</strong></blockquote><h2><strong>“PromptFix” - Modern AI Prompt Injection</strong></h2><p>Now we move on to testing the kind of security AI Browsers will need to withstand in the coming AI vs. AI era - a time when attackers no longer bother manipulating human eyes, emotions, or judgment, but instead target AI directly, speaking the one language it can’t ignore: prompts.</p><p><strong>Prompt injection</strong> is the method of embedding hidden instructions inside the content an AI is processing, steering its actions in ways the human never requested and never sees. Today's most common prompt injection attacks hide text on a page with tricks like: <em>“Ignore all previous instructions and… do something malicious for me.”</em> When the AI Agent processes the page, this hidden text is ingested as part of the source code, and the injected prompt becomes part of the AI’s instructions.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d88dc02d2c4ae146e9eb_image%203.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>With <strong>PromptFix</strong>, we take this further. It’s our AI-era evolution of the <strong>ClickFix</strong> scam - a social engineering trick mimicking captcha pages that works so well on humans, now adapted to work on their AI Agents. This is <a href="https://guard.io/labs/captchageddon-unmasking-the-viral-evolution-of-the-clickfix-browser-based-threat"><em>CAPTCHAgeddon</em></a> in the AI era. Instead of convincing someone to click through a fake captcha that silently runs malicious code, we tried something different. We crafted a narrative the AI simply can’t resist following:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d8a0f6640d11e2356240_image%204.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In this scenario, the “captcha” appears as a harmless checkbox to the human. At this scenario, the AI Agent should stop and ask the human to solve it - exactly as it was programmed to do. But lurking behind the scenes is a set of attacker instructions inside an invisible text box, concealed through simple CSS styling. Humans can’t see it, but it flows directly into the AI Agent’s prompt as it processes the page.</p><p>Why would the AI treat these as commands? In prompt injections, the attacker relies on the model’s inability to fully distinguish between instructions and regular content within the same prompt, hoping to slip malicious commands past sanitation checks.</p><p>With <strong>PromptFix</strong>, the approach is different: We don’t try to glitch the model into obedience. Instead, we mislead it using techniques borrowed from the human social engineering playbook - appealing directly to its core design goal: to help its human quickly, completely, and without hesitation. We just provide it with the best (manipulating) methods to do so:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d8bcd894469092bedbce_image%205.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The test scenario we created is quite simple. A scammer sends a fake message to a victim, posing as their doctor’s office, with a link to “recent blood test results”. The victim asks their AI Assistant to handle it. The AI browses to the link, encounters a captcha, and then uncovers the hidden “gem” - causing a drive-by-download attack.</p><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPgYv4fLQBo" title="Scamlexity PromptFix Part1"></iframe></p></figure><p>The injected narrative tells the AI Agent this is a special “AI-friendly” captcha it can solve on behalf of its human. All it needs to do is click the button. And so, it clicks. In our controlled demo, the button downloaded a harmless file. Still, it could just as easily have been a malicious payload, triggering a classic <strong>drive-by download</strong> and planting malware on the human’s machine without their knowledge.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d8ea4600f79c7606e2ae_image%206.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><figure><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p8XfDLIa1GE" title="Scamlexity PromptFix Part2"></iframe></p></figure><p>And that’s just the start. The same technique could allow the AI to send emails containing personal details, grant file-sharing permissions on the victim’s cloud storage, or execute any other action its permissions allow. In effect, <strong>the attacker is now in control of your AI</strong>, and by extension, of you. The trust chain glitch continues.</p><h2><strong>The Expanding AI Attack Surface</strong></h2><p>In this research, we explored <strong>human-centric attack vectors</strong> that have been around for years alongside <strong>AI-centric prompt injection techniques</strong> explicitly built for the new browsing paradigm. The first category needed almost no adaptation to work as AI browsers inherit the same blind spots that those scams exploit in humans, but without the human’s instinctive skepticism. The second category, like <strong>PromptFix</strong>, goes further: crafting content that works directly on the AI’s decision-making layer, exploiting known prompt-injection parsing flaws and tailored service-oriented narratives that tap into the AI’s built-in drive to help instantly and without hesitation.</p><p>Together, these approaches expose an attack surface that is both broader and deeper than anything we’ve seen before. One that will grow rapidly as AI Browsers and Agentic AI in general move into the mainstream. And this isn’t just about phishing or fake shops. It’s a structural reality: these systems are engineered to complete tasks flawlessly, but not to question whether those tasks are safe.</p><h2>The Future of AI-Powered Scams</h2><p>In the AI-vs-AI era, scammers don’t need to trick millions of different people; they only need to break one AI model. Once they succeed, the same exploit can be scaled endlessly. And because they have access to the same models, they can “train” their malicious AI against the victim’s AI until the scam works flawlessly.</p><blockquote>This is <strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) gone rogue!</strong> Not to generate pretty pictures, but an endless stream of zero-day scams.</blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/66e1bda4d78fa806a1f5123c/68a2d92dd6b9e145c8e732a2_image%207.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The diagram above is only a simplified schematic of how automated scam training might look, but it is just the beginning. Once more powerful generative AIs are added into this loop and scaled across clusters of GPUs and massive cloud infrastructure, the pace and sophistication of scams will accelerate beyond anything we have faced before. With today’s reactive defenses, this wave cannot be stopped. The only real answer is to stay several steps ahead of scammers by thinking like one. Instead of training the generator to scam, we must focus on training the discriminator to anticipate, detect, and neutralize these attacks. That means building and continuously optimizing relevant guardrails into Agentic AI models before they go into production, and keeping them sharp while they run in the wild.</p><h2><strong>Closing the Scamlexity Gap</strong></h2><p>The path forward isn’t to halt innovation but to bring <strong>security back into focus</strong> before these systems go fully mainstream. Today’s AI Browsers are designed with user experience at the top of the priority stack. At the same time, security is often an afterthought or delegated entirely to existing tools like Google Safe Browsing, which is, unfortunately, insufficient.</p><p>If AI Agents are going to handle our emails, shop for us, manage our accounts, and act as our digital front-line, they need to inherit the <strong>proven guardrails</strong> we already use in human-centric browsing: robust phishing detection, URL reputation checks, domain spoofing alerts, malicious file scanning, and behavioral anomaly detection - all adapted to work <em>inside</em> the AI decision loop.</p><p>Security must be woven into the very architecture of AI Browsers, not bolted on afterward. Because as these examples show, the trust we place in Agentic AI is going to be absolute, and when that trust is misplaced, the cost is immediate.</p><p>In the era of Scamlexity, safety can’t be optional!</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://jakub.kr/components/oklch-colors">https://jakub.kr/components/oklch-colors</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45010876">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><header></header>
<p>OKLCH is a newer color model that is designed to be perceptually uniform. This means that colors are much more accurate in terms of how humans perceive them and it makes working with them much easier.</p>


<p>Color Models</p>
<p>Before being able to understand how OKLCH differs from the other color models, it is important to understand some of the basic color concepts.</p>

<p>Color models are systems to describe colors. These include RGB, HSL, LCH, OKLCH and more. The model determines how easy it is to manipulate or think about a color.</p>

<p>Gamut</p>
<p>Gamut is a playing field where the model lives and defines what colors are possible. Common gamuts include sRGB (the web default) and Display-P3 (used on modern devices).</p>

<p>There is a lot more nuance when you get into color spaces. They don’t just define a gamut, but also things like the white point and transfer function. I decided to leave those out for the sake of keeping the article simple.</p>

<p>Structure</p>
<p>OKLCH, same as LCH, consists of three values: Lightness, Chroma and Hue. The difference between the two is the underlying color space that the color model uses, which in case of OKLCH, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklab_color_space" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OKLab</a>.</p>

<p>Lightness - Equal steps feel like equal changes in brightness. Ranges from value between 0 and 1 or percentage ranging from 0% to 100%.</p>

<p>Chroma - Controls intensity of the color, similar to saturation.</p>

<p>Hue - Controls the hue, measured in degrees ranging from 0 to 360.</p>


<p>Consistent Brightness</p>
<p>Let's say you want to create a couple of pill buttons and you want each one to have a different color. The usual workflow with sRGB colors would be defining the first color and then handpicking others to match it.</p>

<p>With OKLCH, you can use the same value for all of them and only change hue. That way you create colors that look and feel the same.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing with color models like HSL, but as you can see above, the colors don't look uniform. Some are lighter, some darker, some pop more and some less.</p>

<p>This is one of the major advantages of OKLCH over other color models. Creating perceptually uniform color palettes and working with them is very easy.</p>
<p>Predictable Shades</p>
<p>It also works the other way around, where you can change the lightness value to create various color shades and there is no hue or saturation drift unlike in other color modes.</p>

<p>In the example above, you can see that the OKLCH colors maintain consistent blueness across all of the shades, while in the HSL example, the lighter shades drift to purple and the darker ones muddy out towards grayish.</p>
<p>Better Gradients</p>
<p>The way gradients work in OKLCH is pretty different compared to sRGB. In sRGB, gradients are calculated in red, green, and blue values, which often leads to muddy midpoints and uneven brightness.</p>

<p>With OKLCH, the math follows lightness, chroma, and hue. In the example above you can see that the starting and ending points are the same but the colors the gradient passes through are quite different.</p>

<p>Color Space Support</p>
<p>sRGB can’t reach a lot of colors that modern screens can show. In OKLCH you can write colors that are only possible to render on a screen that supports Display-P3 colors.</p>

<p>If you are on a display that supports Display-P3, you will see the right color much more vivid than the left one. If you are on a display that only supports sRGB, the color should look identical, as the browser maps the out of gamut color back inside the sRGB gamut.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that grays are identical in sRGB and Display-P3, so there would be no difference there.</p>
<p>Maximum Chroma</p>
<p>OKLCH can also define more colors than any real screen can show. It can specify values that don't fit inside any actual gamut like sRGB or Display-P3.</p>

<p>Let's take this color as an example <code>color: oklch(0.7 0.4 40)</code>. It has a very high chroma value and it could mathematically exist but in practice it lies outside of any real display's gamut. When this color is used, it will get clipped or mapped to the nearest representable color inside the gamut.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-language="css" data-theme="github-dark github-light"><span data-line=""><span>@layer</span><span> base {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  :root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    color</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.7</span><span> 0.4</span><span> 40</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Generally you don't want this to happen, as the clipped color can often look very different from the defined one.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is a concept of a maximum chroma value, which calculates the maximum chroma that a display can show based on the lightness, hue and the selected gamut like sRGB or Display-P3.</p>

<p>Browser Support &amp; Fallbacks</p>
<p>OKLCH colors were introduced in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSS Color Module Level 4</a> and they are well supported across all modern browsers.</p>

<p>However, there are still some surfaces where OKLCH colors are not supported such as outdated browsers. In case you are worried about this, you can add fallbacks and use the <code>@supports</code> directive in CSS.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code data-language="css" data-theme="github-dark github-light"><span data-line=""><span>@layer</span><span> base {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  :root</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    /* sRGB hex */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --color-gray-100</span><span>: </span><span>#fcfcfc</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --color-gray-200</span><span>: </span><span>#fafafa</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    --color-gray-300</span><span>: </span><span>#f4f4f4</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    @</span><span>supports</span><span> (</span><span>color</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>)) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      /* OKLCH */</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      --color-gray-100</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.991</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      --color-gray-200</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.982</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>      --color-gray-300</span><span>: </span><span>oklch</span><span>(</span><span>0.955</span><span> 0</span><span> 0</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>  }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This way the browser uses OKLCH colors if they are supported, otherwise it falls back to sRGB.</p>

<p>oklch.fyi</p>
<p>I built a small tool dedicated to OKLCH colors called <a href="https://oklch.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">oklch.fyi</a>. It helps generate OKLCH colors palettes, it can take your existing CSS variables and convert them to OKLCH and more.</p>

<!-- Butlerian Jihad, bad webbots, Thinkbot, blocking by ASN -->

<p>More and more I think I'm coming around to <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/view/Butlerian_Jihad">Jihad Alex Schroeder's Butlerian Jihad</a>.
For reasons,
I'm looking into web activity and so far,
the top webbot this month is one identifying itself as “Thinkbot,”
which <em>may</em> be related to <a href="https://www.thinkbot.agency/">this <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> company</a> but I can't be sure.
Here's how it itentifies itself: “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Thinkbot/0.5.8; +In­_the­_test­_phase,­_if­_the­_Thinkbot­_brings­_you­_trouble,­_please­_block­_its_<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>_address._Thank_you.)”.</p>

<p>Seriously,
that's it.
No <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to read up on it.
It doesn't look at the <code>robots.txt</code> file.
Just “bro,
ban me at the <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> level if you don't like me!”

</p><p>Yeah,
block its <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address.
You mean the 74 unique addresses it used this month alone?
<a href="https://boston.conman.org/2025/03/21.2">Checking each <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> address for the <abbr title="Autonomous System Number">ASN</abbr> it's from</a> shows the 74 address coming from 41 (41!) network blocks!</p>

<p>A further check showed that all the network blocks are owned by one organization—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent">Tencent</a>.
I'm seriously thinking that the <abbr title="Chinese Communist Party">CCP</abbr> encourage this with maybe the hope of externalizing the cost of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall">Great Firewall</a> to the rest of the world.
If China scrapes content,
that's fine as far as the <abbr title="Chinese Communist Party">CCP</abbr> goes;
If it's blocked,
that's fine by the <abbr title="Chinese Communist Party">CCP</abbr> too
(I say,
as I adjust my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_foil_hat">tin foil hat</a>).</p>

<p>git-annex allows managing large files with git, without storing the file
contents in git. It can sync, backup, and archive your data, offline
and online. Checksums and encryption keep your data safe and secure. Bring
the power and distributed nature of git to bear on your large files with
git-annex.</p>

<p><a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/assistant/"><img src="https://git-annex.branchable.com/assistant/thumbnail.png" width="216" height="28"></a>
git-annex is designed for git users who love the command line.
For everyone else, the <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/assistant/">git-annex assistant</a> turns
git-annex into an easy to use folder synchroniser.</p>

<p>To get a feel for git-annex, see the <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/walkthrough/">walkthrough</a>.</p>

<td><h3>use case: The Archivist</h3>

<p>Bob has many drives to archive his data, most of them
<a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/tips/offline_archive_drives/">kept offline</a>, in a safe place.</p>

<p>With git-annex, Bob has a single directory tree that includes all
his files, even if their content is being stored offline. He can
reorganize his files using that tree, committing new versions to git,
without worry about accidentally deleting anything.</p>

<p>When Bob needs access to some files, git-annex can tell him which drive(s)
they're on, and easily make them available. Indeed, every drive knows what
is on every other drive.<br>

<p>Bob thinks long-term, and so he appreciates that git-annex uses a simple
repository format. He knows his files will be accessible in the future
even if the world has forgotten about git-annex and git.<br>

<p>Run in a cron job, git-annex adds new files to archival drives at night. It
also helps Bob keep track of intentional and unintentional copies of
files, and logs information he can use to decide when it's time to duplicate
the content of old drives.<br>

<td><h3>use case: The Nomad</h3>

<p>Alice is always on the move, often with her trusty netbook and a small
handheld terabyte USB drive, or a smaller USB keydrive. She has a server
out there on the net. She stores data, encrypted in the Cloud.</p>

<p>All these things can have different files on them, but Alice no longer
has to deal with the tedious process of keeping them manually in sync,
or remembering where she put a file. git-annex manages all these data
sources as if they were git remotes.<br>
<small><a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/special_remotes/">more about special remotes</a></small></p>

<p>When she has 1 bar on her cell, Alice queues up interesting files on her
server for later. At a coffee shop, she has git-annex download them to her
USB drive. High in the sky or in a remote cabin, she catches up on
podcasts, videos, and games, first letting git-annex copy them from
her USB drive to the netbook (this saves battery power).<br>
<small><a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com/transferring_data/">more about transferring data</a></small></p>

<p>When she's done, she tells git-annex which to keep and which to remove.
They're all removed from her netbook to save space, and Alice knows
that next time she syncs up to the net, her changes will be synced back
to her server.<br>

<p>If that describes you, or if you're some from column A and some from column
B, then git-annex may be the tool you've been looking for to expand from
keeping all your small important files in git, to managing your large
files with git.</p>

<h2>Outlier Detection</h2>

<p>sping automatically detects unusual latency spikes using <strong>Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)</strong> analysis:</p>

<h3>What Counts as an Outlier</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Latency outliers</strong>: Response times that deviate significantly from recent baseline performance</li>
<li><strong>Statistical threshold</strong>: Latencies that are more than <strong>6x the MAD</strong> away from the median</li>
<li><strong>Baseline requirement</strong>: Needs at least 10 successful samples to establish baseline  </li>
<li><strong>Rolling window</strong>: Uses the last 30 successful requests to calculate normal behavior</li>
<li><strong>Successful requests only</strong>: Only analyzes successful responses (errors are tracked separately)</li>
</ul>

<h3>How It Works</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline calculation</strong>: Median of recent 30 successful latencies (e.g., 100ms)</li>
<li><strong>Variability measure</strong>: MAD of those latencies (e.g., 15ms)  </li>
<li><strong>Outlier threshold</strong>: <code>|current_latency - median| / MAD &gt; 6.0</code></li>
<li><strong>Example</strong>: If baseline is 100ms ± 15ms MAD, requests &gt; 190ms or &lt; 10ms would be outliers</li>
</ol>

<h3>Visual Indicators</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Interactive mode</strong>: Outlier requests show <code>[OUTLIER]</code> marker in the log</li>
<li><strong>Statistics bar</strong>: Shows red outlier count when detected (e.g., <code>outliers 3</code>)</li>
<li><strong>JSON output</strong>: <code>"anomaly": true</code> field in export data (kept for API compatibility)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note: Outlier detection helps identify performance degradation, network issues, or service problems that might not trigger error thresholds.</em></p>

<h2>Command Line Options</h2>

<h4>Color Compatibility Notes</h4>

<p><strong>Terminal Color Support</strong>: sping automatically detects your terminal's color capabilities and adjusts accordingly. However, older terminals or certain environments may experience:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Limited Color Support</strong>: Older terminals may only support basic ANSI colors rather than rich RGB colors</li>
<li><strong>Solution</strong>: Set <code>TERM=xterm-256color</code> in your environment or use <code>--xterm-colors-only</code> for consistent basic colors</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility Mode</strong>: Use <code>--xterm-colors-only</code> to force basic terminal colors that work everywhere</li>
</ul>

<div>
<pre><span></span><code><span># For maximum compatibility with older terminals</span>
sping<span> </span>example.com<span> </span>--xterm-colors-only

<span># Or set environment variable for better color support</span>
<span>TERM</span><span>=</span>xterm-256color<span> </span>sping<span> </span>example.com
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3>Output Formats</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>--json</code>: JSON output mode (one object per line)</li>

            <div>
                <p>The four words that precede every crash: “This time is different.”</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Except this time, the person warning about a bubble is Sam Altman, the CEO most responsible for creating it. When OpenAI’s chief executive warned last week that investors were “overexcited” about AI, markets reacted immediately. Nvidia fell 3.5%, Palantir dropped nearly 10%, and the selloff spread globally.</p>

<p>The warning came amid a cascade of seemingly supporting data. That same week, MIT researchers published findings that 95% of companies investing in generative AI were seeing no measurable returns. Apollo Global Management’s chief economist warned that current valuations exceeded even dot-com bubble peaks. And Federal Reserve data showed AI investment consuming more than half of America’s total capital expenditure.</p>

<p>The numbers tell the story. Anthropic raised $450 million at a $4.1 billion valuation despite negligible revenue. Character.AI hit $1 billion in valuation with 1.7 million monthly users—roughly $588 per user. Inflection AI raised $1.3 billion before essentially acqui-hiring its team to Microsoft, leaving investors with an empty shell.</p>

<p>Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, told the Financial Times the current environment mirrors 1998-1999, warning that while AI will certainly transform the economy, investors are “confusing that with the investments being successful.”</p>

<p>Sound familiar? It should. This exact sequence—revolutionary technology, abundant capital, speculative frenzy, then sudden reality checks—has played out with remarkable consistency for over 180 years. Railway Mania in the 1840s. Radio stocks in the 1920s. Dot-com fever in the 1990s. Each time, the technology was real. Each time, the speculation was unsustainable. Each time, the overbuilding became tomorrow’s foundation.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-tech-bubble-when-britain-went-mad-for-railways">The Original Tech Bubble: When Britain Went Mad for Railways</h2>

<p>To understand what’s happening with AI today, we need to travel back to 1840s Britain, where the world’s first true technology bubble was taking shape around the railway.</p>

<p>The Railway Mania of the 1840s makes today’s AI frenzy look restrained. Between 1843 and 1846, Parliament approved 263 Acts for new railway companies proposing 9,500 miles of track, nearly matching today’s entire UK railway network. The speculation democratized investing in a way never seen before. Clerks, shopkeepers, and domestic servants, people who had never owned stocks before, mortgaged their homes and borrowed money to buy railway shares. The mania pulled in everyone from farmers to factory workers, all convinced they were investing in the future.</p>

<p>The mania started with genuine success. The Liverpool-Manchester Railway had proven the concept, reducing the London-Glasgow journey from days to 24 hours. This wasn’t just faster transportation but a compression of time and space that seemed magical to people who had never traveled faster than a horse could run.</p>

<p>Economic conditions enabled speculation. Low interest rates pushed Britain’s middle class toward railway stocks. Shares could be purchased with just a 10% deposit, with the balance paid later through capital calls. This leverage meant ordinary people could control far more stock than they could afford—imagine buying $10,000 of stock with $1,000 down. By 1846, railway companies comprised 71% of total stock market value, up from 23% eight years earlier.</p>

<p>Then reality intruded. In October 1845, the Bank of England raised rates. Suddenly, leveraged investors faced capital calls they couldn’t meet. Families who thought they were making modest investments discovered they owed thousands of pounds they didn’t have. By 1850, railway shares had lost 85% of their peak values. Over 200 companies went bankrupt. The Commercial Crisis of 1847 became one of Britain’s worst financial disasters.</p>

<p>But while investors lost fortunes, Britain gained invaluable infrastructure. All that speculative investment had built a railway network that became the backbone of the Industrial Revolution. The overbuilt, redundant tracks that seemed like waste in 1847 enabled Britain’s industrial dominance for the next century.</p>



<p>Fast-forward 150 years, and the pattern repeated with eerie precision. The late 1990s internet bubble demonstrated how compelling narratives can completely detach valuations from any semblance of business reality.</p>

<p>The numbers were staggering. The NASDAQ rose 800% from 1995 to its March 2000 peak of 5,048. By traditional measures, the insanity was obvious: the index’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio reached 200. In plain English, investors were paying $200 for every $1 of actual profit these companies generated. For context, a healthy market typically sees P/E ratios of 15-20. Even Japan’s infamous 1989 bubble peaked at 80. But dot-com investors had convinced themselves that earnings didn’t matter anymore. What mattered was “eyeballs” and future potential. Many of these companies had no earnings at all, making their P/E ratios technically infinite. This mathematical impossibility should have been a warning sign. Investors had completely abandoned fundamental analysis in favor of pure speculation about future potential, convinced that traditional metrics like revenue, profit margins, and cash flow were obsolete in the ‘new economy.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal, that bastion of financial sobriety, suggested investors “re-think” the “quaint idea” that companies should be profitable.</p>

<p>As with railways, the underlying technology was genuinely revolutionary. The internet was indeed going to change everything—just not as quickly or as profitably as investors assumed. And just like the railway boom, perfect economic conditions enabled the speculation. The Federal Reserve had cut rates after the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management collapse, flooding the system with cheap money. The 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act lowered capital gains taxes, making speculation more attractive.</p>

<p>But it was the psychology that made the dot-com bubble truly extraordinary. Any company that added “.com” to its name could attract investment. VA Linux Systems gained 698% on its IPO day. Pets.com, which sold pet food online at a loss, reached a $300 million market capitalization. TheGlobe.com went public with no revenue and saw its stock price rise 606% in a single day.
The democratization of investing through online brokers meant that by spring 1999, one in twelve Americans claimed to be starting a business. Individual investors poured $260 billion into equity funds in 2000, with margin debt peaking at $300 billion. Day trading became a cultural phenomenon. CNBC became appointment television.</p>

<p>The philosophy of the era was captured perfectly by a Kleiner Perkins partner who said, “In the old days, you needed a business model. Now you need a business concept.” Revenue was yesterday’s metric; “eyeballs” and “mindshare” were what mattered. Traditional metrics were dismissed as relics of the industrial age.</p>

<p>The crash, when it came, was swift and merciless. From March 2000 to October 2002, the NASDAQ fell 78%. Total market capitalization losses reached $5 trillion, roughly half of US GDP at the time. But these staggering numbers don’t capture the human cost to everyday people. The dot-com crash eliminated 200,000 jobs in Silicon Valley alone, while millions of ordinary investors watched their retirement accounts and college funds evaporate. The same middle-class Americans who had been told they were foolish not to participate in the ‘new economy’ now faced financial ruin. Teachers’ pension funds were halved. Family savings meant for homes and education vanished. Web designers who commanded six figures found themselves competing for $15/hour contracts. Communities built around tech hubs hollowed out as workers fled to cheaper cities. Of the 7,000 to 10,000 internet companies launched in the late 1990s, only 48% survived past 2004.</p>

<p>Creative destruction is brutal math. The capital? Gone. Completely vaporized. But infrastructure isn’t stock certificates. Those fiber optic cables didn’t vanish when Pets.com did. The data centers kept humming after Webvan went dark. All that ‘wasted’ investment had already transformed into something physical. The pipes, servers, and networks that would become the foundation for Google, Facebook, Amazon Web Services, and the digital transformation that actually did change everything. The bubble’s victims unknowingly funded the future. They just paid a decade too early.</p>

<h2 id="no-country-is-immune">No Country Is Immune</h2>

<p>The bubble pattern isn’t uniquely Anglo-American. Japan’s 1980s asset price bubble saw the Nikkei rise 300% in five years before losing 60% of its value. The grounds of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo were theoretically worth more than all the real estate in California. When it crashed, Japan entered a “lost decade” of economic stagnation.</p>

<p>China has perfected the art of managed bubbles. Its 2007 stock market bubble saw the Shanghai Composite rise 480% in two years before crashing 72%. Its 2015 bubble was even more dramatic: a 150% rise in six months followed by a 43% crash in just two months. Each time, state intervention prevented total collapse but couldn’t prevent massive wealth destruction.</p>

<p>Today’s AI bubble is distinctly global. China races to match US capabilities, pouring state resources into domestic champions. The EU struggles to regulate while trying not to fall behind. Saudi Arabia commits $40 billion to AI investments through its sovereign wealth fund. This synchronized global speculation might amplify both the boom and any eventual bust.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern-we-cant-escape">The Pattern We Can’t Escape</h2>

<p>Step back from the specifics, and a pattern emerges across centuries:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Genuine breakthrough creates legitimate excitement.</strong> Railways, electricity, internet, AI—each represented real technological leaps, not just incremental improvements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Early success stories make believers out of skeptics.</strong> The Liverpool-Manchester Railway shrank days to hours. Amazon survived when 90% of dot-coms died. ChatGPT hit 100 million users in two months. These proof points silence doubters just long enough for speculation to take hold.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Capital markets provide the fuel.</strong> Low interest rates, new investment vehicles, democratized access—different mechanisms, same result: too much money chasing the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Social proof overwhelms skepticism.</strong> When your neighbor gets rich on railway stocks or your coworker quits to join a startup, FOMO beats rational analysis every time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reality reasserts itself.</strong> Capital calls come due. Revenue fails to materialize. The future arrives, just slower and differently than promised.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Infrastructure remains after speculators flee.</strong> Britain’s rail network, America’s fiber optic cables, today’s GPU clusters—overbuilding becomes tomorrow’s competitive advantage.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This pattern held true across different continents, centuries, and technologies. The actors change but the script remains remarkably consistent. Which brings us to today’s AI boom and an unprecedented twist: what happens when everyone can see the pattern while living it?</p>



<p>Here’s what’s never happened before: everyone knows the script.</p>

<p>CEOs are calling their own sectors overheated. Researchers are publishing failure rates in real time. Even casual investors track AI valuations. This isn’t insider knowledge anymore, it’s mainstream discourse.</p>

<p>Compare that to history. Railway Mania? Information traveled at horse speed. The dot-com crash? CNBC existed, but Twitter didn’t. Most people learned about the bubble after their 401k got vaporized.</p>

<p>Now we have instant global commentary on every funding round, every overhyped demo, every cautionary study. MIT publishes data showing failure rates, and it’s trending on LinkedIn within hours. Bloomberg runs “Is This a Bubble?” segments weekly. Retail investors share articles about historical bubble patterns.</p>

<p>The modern version of “adding .com to your name” is even more brazen. Companies append “AI” to their descriptions and watch valuations soar. Buzzfeed stock jumped 300% after announcing AI-generated content. C3.ai trades at 15 times revenue despite losing money on every dollar of sales. Even established companies play this game: consulting firms that once sold “digital transformation” now sell “AI transformation” at premium prices.</p>

<p>Nvidia’s numbers capture the mania perfectly. The company trades at a P/E ratio floating between 58 and 72, more than triple the S&amp;P 500 average. Its market cap exceeds $4 trillion based largely on selling shovels to AI gold miners. Microsoft commits $13 billion to OpenAI. Amazon pledges $4 billion to Anthropic. Google races to match with Gemini investments. The capital expenditure on AI infrastructure already exceeds the entire dot-com bubble when adjusted for inflation. To put this in perspective, AI infrastructure spending is approaching hundreds of billions annually, a level of concentrated technological investment not seen since the space race.</p>

<p>This creates a paradox: the most transparent bubble in history might also be the most inevitable. Because knowing you’re in a bubble doesn’t stop you from participating. Ask anyone who bought GameStop during the meme stock frenzy. They knew it was insane. They did it anyway.</p>

<p>The question isn’t whether awareness prevents stupidity. It’s whether it changes the flavor of stupidity we’re about to witness.</p>

<h2 id="why-ai-might-actually-be-different-this-time">Why AI Might Actually Be Different This Time</h2>

<p>Maybe AI will break the mold. The optimists aren’t completely delusional. There are genuine reasons why this technology could defy historical patterns:</p>

<p><strong>Speed of deployment changes everything.</strong> Railways took decades to build. Even software requires downloads, integrations, and training. But AI? ChatGPT reached 100 million users in two months. When infrastructure is cloud-based and products are accessible through browsers, adoption curves go vertical in ways physical products never could.</p>

<p><strong>The recursive improvement possibility.</strong> Every previous technology improved through human innovation. AI might be the first technology capable of improving itself. If AI can enhance AI development, we could see exponential rather than linear progress. This isn’t science fiction. Current models already help train next-generation models.</p>

<p><strong>Network effects on steroids.</strong> More users make social networks more valuable, but more users make AI smarter. Every prompt teaches the system. Every correction improves performance. The company that achieves AI dominance might have an insurmountable advantage because their lead compounds daily.</p>

<p><strong>Why the giants might create their own competition.</strong> Here’s the twist: the massive training costs and compute requirements that make today’s AI leaders seem unassailable might actually democratize the technology. Once foundation models exist, smaller companies can build specialized applications without bearing the upfront costs. OpenAI spends billions so a startup can spend thousands. But unlike previous platform monopolies, AI might be uniquely resistant to moats. When your competitor’s model improves, you can often incorporate those advances. When open-source alternatives emerge, they benefit from collective innovation. The result? Instead of winner-take-all dynamics, we might see an explosion of AI-powered businesses that collectively grow the pie faster than any bubble can inflate. The very nature of the technology (reproducible, composable, improvable) could create more value than it destroys.</p>

<p>These arguments deserve serious consideration. Maybe this time really is different. But that’s exactly what investors thought about railways (“annihilating distance!”), radio (“wireless changes everything!”), and the internet (“bits not atoms!”). Revolutionary technologies can be both transformative and overvalued. The question isn’t whether AI will change the world. It will. The question isn’t whether AI will change the world. It will. The question is whether current valuations reflect realistic timelines and profit potential, or whether we’re once again paying tomorrow’s prices with today’s money.</p>

<p>And if I’m wrong? If AI really does break every historical pattern? Well, then we’re about to witness the greatest creation of wealth in human history. That’s a bet many find worth taking.</p>

<h2 id="when-will-the-music-stop">When Will the Music Stop?</h2>

<p>History offers clues but no certainties about timing. Railway Mania lasted roughly four years from acceleration to crash (1843-1847). The dot-com bubble’s acute phase ran about five years (1995-2000). The pattern suggests major technology bubbles take 4-6 years from mainstream awareness to collapse.</p>

<p>For AI, if we date mainstream awareness from ChatGPT’s November 2022 launch, we’re now almost three years into the cycle. History suggests we’re approaching the middle innings. The typical progression:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Year 1-2: Wonder and experimentation (2022-2024)</li>
  <li>Year 2-3: Massive capital deployment and infrastructure building (we are here)</li>
  <li>Year 3-4: Market saturation and disappointing returns become evident</li>
  <li>Year 4-5: The music stops</li>
</ul>

<p>But several factors could accelerate or delay this timeline. Rising interest rates historically trigger bubble collapses, and we’re already seeing rate increases. Conversely, government support for AI as a national security priority could extend the bubble beyond historical norms.</p>

<p>The most reliable indicator? Watch for the moment when AI companies start acquiring each other with stock instead of cash. That’s historically been the last stage before collapse.</p>

<h2 id="profiting-from-the-wreckage">Profiting from the Wreckage</h2>

<p>While everyone’s debating whether we’re in a bubble, some investors are asking different questions: What’s getting overbuilt? What will be cheap after the crash? Who’s actually solving problems versus who’s just riding the hype wave?</p>

<p>If history is any guide, here’s what the playbook might look like:</p>

<p><strong>First, follow the infrastructure.</strong> During Railway Mania, the smartest move wasn’t buying railway stocks but investing in steel, land, and engineering firms. When dot-com imploded, someone had to buy all those fiber optic cables for pennies on the dollar. Today? Data centers, semiconductor fabs, and power infrastructure are getting massive investment. That hardware doesn’t disappear when valuations crash.</p>

<p><strong>Second, look for real revenue.</strong> If the MIT study is right, 95% of AI companies are burning cash on “customer discovery” and “market education.” But somewhere in that mix, 5% are actually charging money for solutions people need today. Companies with boring enterprise contracts might outlast those creating viral demos.</p>

<p><strong>Third, consider betting on necessity, not novelty.</strong> Amazon wasn’t sexy during the dot-com crash. It was selling books to people who needed books. Adobe wasn’t exciting during the financial crisis. It was selling tools that designers and businesses couldn’t work without. The AI companies that survive might be those automating tasks people hate doing, not those promising artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p><strong>Fourth, prepare for potential fire sales.</strong> Every bubble ends with good companies getting dumped alongside bad ones. In 2002, you could buy Google’s pre-IPO shares for a fraction of their eventual worth. In 2008, Netflix traded at $3 per share while being dismissed as a DVD-by-mail dinosaur. By 2010, those $3 shares were worth $30. By 2020, after stock splits, that $3 investment was worth over $300. The next cycle might serve up similar opportunities for those with cash and patience.</p>

<p>The bubble creates the exact conditions that make post-bubble investing potentially profitable. Massive overinvestment drives down infrastructure costs. Market crashes eliminate weak competitors. Talent becomes available as overfunded startups implode.</p>

<p>History’s lesson isn’t “avoid bubbles.” It’s “position for what comes after.”</p>



<p>As I write this, my LinkedIn feed is flooded with AI funding announcements. Every tech conference features panels on “Why AI Changes Everything.” The majority of pitch decks I see now include an AI angle, whether it fits or not. The pattern is impossible to miss.</p>

<p>If you’ve read this far, these claims probably sound familiar. Not because you’ve heard them about AI before, but because they echo every transformative technology for the past 200 years.</p>

<p>But here’s what’s genuinely different this time: we’re not blind to the patterns anymore. Sam Altman’s bubble warning isn’t just refreshing honesty. It’s evidence that we might be learning from history instead of repeating it exactly.</p>

<p>We have tools previous generations lacked. Start with regulation: Sarbanes-Oxley emerged from dot-com’s ashes, requiring real financial disclosure. The Volcker Rule limits banks from making speculative bets with depositor money. Stress testing means major financial institutions must prove they can survive market shocks.</p>

<p>The investor base has evolved too. Where Railway Mania saw shopkeepers betting their life savings and dot-com drew day traders chasing quick profits, today’s AI investments flow primarily through venture funds and institutional investors. Yes, retail can buy Nvidia, but they can’t access pre-IPO rounds where the real speculation happens. This concentration among professional investors won’t prevent a bubble, but it might prevent the kind of widespread financial devastation that followed previous crashes.</p>

<p>Risk management has transformed. Portfolio theory, derivatives for hedging, and real-time data mean sophisticated investors can protect themselves in ways previous generations couldn’t imagine. The Federal Reserve now has tools like quantitative easing that didn’t exist during past crises. Whether they’ll use them wisely is another question, but the toolkit exists.</p>

<p>Most importantly, we have communication networks that spread both hype and skepticism at equal speed. MIT’s study showing 95% failure rates went viral the same week it published. Every breathless AI announcement triggers immediate fact-checking. This doesn’t stop speculation, but it arms investors with information their predecessors desperately lacked.</p>

<p>The speculation, excitement, and even some degree of overinvestment are probably necessary parts of how society handles revolutionary change. But the catastrophic boom-bust cycles aren’t inevitable features of progress. They’re bugs in our system that we can potentially fix.</p>

<p>The AI revolution is real, transformative, and probably unstoppable. Whether it unfolds through sustainable growth or boom-bust cycles depends largely on the choices we make in the next few years. The early signs (including voices like Altman’s warning about overexcitement) suggest we might actually be learning from history.</p>

<p>The AI bubble’s human impact could be fundamentally different. Previous bubbles destroyed jobs when they burst. AI might destroy jobs while it’s still inflating. If AI actually delivers on its automation promises, we could see the first bubble that eliminates more employment during its rise than its fall.</p>

<p>This creates an unprecedented social risk: a technology bubble that succeeds in its goals might cause more disruption than one that fails. The Railway Mania gave Britain train networks and industrial jobs. The dot-com bubble gave us e-commerce and digital careers. The AI bubble might give us unprecedented productivity and fewer jobs. That’s a social equation we haven’t solved.</p>

<h2 id="what-we-know-vs-what-well-do">What We Know vs. What We’ll Do</h2>

<p>After 180 years of spectacular booms and devastating busts, the patterns are clear. The question is whether we can act on them.</p>

<p>History suggests most of us can’t. We’ll participate in the mania despite knowing better, just as railway clerks mortgaged their homes and day traders quit their jobs. That’s human nature. But perhaps knowing the script at least lets us play our parts more consciously.</p>

<p>The truth is, everyone already knows we’re in a bubble. You know AI valuations are insane. You know most of these companies will fail. You know the crash is coming. The question isn’t what to do—it’s whether you’ll actually do it when the time comes.</p>

<p>Because when Nvidia drops 50%, you won’t think “opportunity.” You’ll think “it’s going to zero.” When AI becomes toxic and unfashionable, you won’t remember that the technology is real. You’ll question everything. That’s the psychological trap: understanding bubbles intellectually is easy. Maintaining perspective inside them is nearly impossible.</p>

<p>If you must participate (and let’s be honest, the FOMO is real), history offers some guardrails. The infrastructure builders tend to survive even if their valuations don’t. The companies solving mundane problems outlast those promising revolution. And the best opportunities emerge not during the mania, but in the wreckage that follows.</p>

<p>Keep powder dry. When everyone declares AI “dead,” that’s your moment. Not today, when your barista is giving stock tips. The future always arrives. It just takes longer and looks different than anyone expects.</p>

<p>The most radical act might be patience. Let others fund the infrastructure. Let them discover which use cases actually matter. Let them burn through capital learning hard lessons. Then, when the dust settles and the tourists have fled, see what’s left.</p>

<p>Because something always is. Britain got its railways. We got the internet. And we’ll get AI. The only question is whether you’ll be among those who paid for it or those who profited from it.</p>

<p>Bubbles are wealth transfer mechanisms. Money flows from the impatient to the patient, from the leveraged to the liquid, from the emotional to the analytical. The only real edge is temperament. Can you remain skeptical during euphoria and optimistic during despair? History says probably not. But at least now you know the script you’re following.</p>

<p>The real revolution isn’t in the technology we’re building. It’s in whether we’ve finally learned how to build it without destroying ourselves in the process.</p>

<p>The four words that precede every crash: ‘This time is different.’ But the four words that might prevent one? ‘We’ve seen this before.’</p>

<p><em>I work at ServiceNow, but these views are entirely my own and don’t represent my employer’s position on AI, bubbles, or anything else. This is definitely not investment advice, just one person’s attempt to make sense of history rhyming once again.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p><em>I am a computer professional that helps the public with technology. I have been troubleshooting computer problems for over 25 years. To find out more about me, visit my <a href="https://scottrlarson.com/" target="_blank">home page</a>.</em></p>

<p>In August of 2023, I <a href="http://scottrlarson.com/publications/publication-transition-windows-to-linux/" target="_blank">wrote</a> about my switch to Linux as a Windows-centric professional. I’ve dabbled in Linux as a daily driver in the past, but it has always ended in some form of defeat. Eventually returning to my abuser, Windows. It was a hard road leaving it behind, but determination can work wonders when flying the freedom skies. Starting with the release of Windows 11, Microsoft’s shady tactics increased to the point where it’s no longer a viable option for an operating system, unless you don’t mind that your desktop is used as an advertising platform, or being forced to allow Copilot, Recall and OneDrive abuse the relationship to your data. Much of the commercial software industry invested into proprietary applications have descended into chaos in the last five years. Recently an intense feeding frenzy for control over the user experience rose to an all time high. Subscriptions replacing purchases of software products is the biggest example of this.</p>

<p>In my previous article I was worried that I might give up, and switch back. Did I make it this time? Yes! Yes, I did. It’s been two years now. I finally weaned myself off of Big Daddy. &nbsp;I do everything in Linux now. Obviously, there are still some pain points that I have a hard time with, but isn’t that true with any operating system?</p>

<p>As a survivor of that dependency, I sometimes feel that I am making the problem worse by installing and supporting Windows 11 for my customers. A new violation of trust is always just around the corner, even though I work very hard to remove or circumvent these hostile features. &nbsp;OneDrive even silently reinstalled itself and moved one customer’s data to the cloud, all without consent. One day their data was on the local drive and the next it became online-only files that had to be downloaded from Microsoft’s servers. I see an avalanche of justifications from people still stuck on Windows. “It’s just a bug”, “These things will get ironed out in time” But the truth is that the freedom to choose is slowly being eroded. When we live in a consumer society where anti-trust seems to mean nothing, what does one do? &nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank">StopKillingGames</a> movement is of a similar line. Someone decided enough is enough and went toe to toe with what I consider corporate culture run amok in the AAA game industry. And then we have our friends in Europe that passed the Digital Markets Act, challenging Apple’s stranglehold on the App Store. I think Europe is positioning itself as the last bastion of hope for customer rights worldwide. With digital commerce, when rights are upheld in one country, other countries can receive the downstream effects. We are also starting to see <a href="https://pirg.org/campaigns/right-to-repair/" target="_blank">RightToRepair</a> challenges with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EWAIlX5d1Y" target="_blank">3rd party equipment providers that attempt to prevent 1st party servicing using IP arguments</a>.</p>

<p>So what have I learned through all this? I’ve learned that making myself free requires effort. The technical challenges of Linux are a bit steeper, but not impossible. Ownership and control over products I purchased are more important than I realized. When I lose control over something I purchased, it disrupts my freedom, and this disruption affects the relationship with myself and the world. It happens slowly. First, I brush off violations to my freedom as an annoyance that needs to be routed around. Then, when more violations occur, I start to get angry that I have to waste more of my time fixing something that I didn’t break.</p>

<p>I realized that this anger is directed at myself. It’s actually a form of resentment towards myself for sacrificing something important for a minor inconvenience that’s designed to become a major roadblock by each iteration.</p>

<p>And this is the major sticking point. I cannot ignore that slow boil any longer. It’s time to see these dark patterns for what they are: a slow movement towards a feudal system where I will own nothing and be happy.</p>

<p>This problem is not just happening with software ownership; it’s happening everywhere.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with this quote from the character Nemik in the Star Wars TV series “Andor”:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember this, Freedom is a pure idea. It occurs spontaneously and without instruction. Random acts of insurrection are occurring constantly throughout the galaxy. There are whole armies, battalions that have no idea that they’ve already enlisted in the cause.</p>

<p>Remember that the frontier of the Rebellion is everywhere. And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward.</p>

<p>And remember this: the Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear.</p>

<p>Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empires’s authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege.</p>

<p>Remember this: Try.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are a power user like me, Linux is getting closer to a real alternative to Windows and it’s about time as more and more companies move to anti-competitive practices, harming public trust and individual choice. In the long run, the products we use should be in our control and not the other way around. <a href="https://www.fightforthefuture.org/" target="_blank">Do what you can to make it harder for shady companies like Microsoft to dominate markets</a> and support the <a href="https://www.endcreativemonopolies.com/" target="_blank">end of creative monopolies</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Most of what modern software engineers do<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup> involves APIs: public interfaces for communicating with a program, like <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/account#fetch-an-account-resource">this one</a> from Twilio. I’ve spent a <em>lot</em> of time working with APIs, both building and using them. I’ve written public APIs for third-party developers, private APIs for internal use (or consumption by a single frontend page), REST and GraphQL APIs, and even non-network interfaces like the ones for command-line tools.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-system-design">designing good software systems</a>, I think much of the advice floating around about API design is too fancy. People get wrapped up in what “real” REST is, or whether HATEOAS is a good idea, and so on. This post is my attempt at writing down everything I know about designing good APIs.</p>
<h3>Designing APIs is a balance between familiarity and flexibility</h3>
<p>If this is true about systems - and it is - it’s even more true about APIs: <strong>good APIs are boring</strong>. An API that’s interesting is a bad API (or at least it would be a better one if it were less interesting). For the developers who build them, APIs are complex products that they spend time designing and polishing. But for the developers who use them, APIs are tools that they use in order to accomplish some other goal. Any time they spend thinking about the API instead of about that goal is time wasted. From their perspective, an ideal API should be so familiar that they will more or less know how to use it before they read any documentation<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>However, one big difference from most software systems is that <strong>APIs are hard to change</strong>. Once you publish an API and people start using it, any change to the interface will break your users’ software. Of course, it is <em>possible</em> to make changes. But (as I’ll say below) each change imposes a serious cost: every time you force your users to update their software, they will give serious thought to using a different API that’s more stable. That gives API-builders a strong incentive to design carefully and get it right the first time. </p>
<p>This tension leads to an interesting dynamic for engineers who build APIs. On the one hand, they want to build the simplest API possible. On the other hand, they want to do clever things to maintain flexibility long-term. In broad strokes, API design is about finding a balance between those two incompatible goals.</p>
<h3>WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE</h3>
<p>What happens when you need to make changes to your API? Additive changes - for instance, putting a new field in the response - are typically fine. There are some consumers which will blow up if they’re getting more fields than they expect, but in my view this is irresponsible. You should expect API consumers to ignore unexpected fields (sensible JSON-parsing typed languages do this by default).</p>
<p>However, you can’t <em>remove</em> or change the types of fields. You can’t change the structure of existing fields (for instance, moving <code>user.address</code> to <code>user.details.address</code> in the JSON response). If you do, every single piece of code that relies on those fields will immediately break. Consumers of that code will report it as a bug, and the maintainers of the code will (when they figure it out) be rightfully furious that you deliberately broke their software.</p>
<p>The principle here is something like Linus Torvalds’ famous slogan <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/all/CA+55aFy98A+LJK4+GWMcbzaa1zsPBRo76q+ioEjbx-uaMKH6Uw@mail.gmail.com/">WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE</a>. As a maintainer of an API, you have something like a sacred duty to avoid harming your downstream consumers. The norm is so strong because so much software depends on so many APIs (which in turn depend on upstream APIs, and so on). One careless API maintainer far enough upstream can break hundreds or thousands of pieces of software downstream.</p>
<p>You should never make a change to an API just because it’d be neater, or because it’s a little awkward. The “referer” header in the HTTP specification is famously a misspelling of the word “referrer”, but they haven’t changed it, <em>because we do not break userspace</em>.</p>
<h3>Changing APIs without breaking userspace</h3>
<p>It’s honestly hard to think of examples where an API really <em>needs</em> a breaking change. But sometimes the technical value of a change is high enough that you decide to bite the bullet and do it anyway. In those cases, how can you change your API responsibly? The answer is <em>versioning</em>.</p>
<p>API versioning means “serve both the old and new version of your API at the same time”. Existing consumers can continue to use the old version, while new consumers can opt-in to the new one. The easiest way to do this is to include something like <code>/v1/</code> in your API url. OpenAI’s chat API is at <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create">v1/chat/completions</a>, so if they ever want to totally rework the structure, they can do that in <code>v2/chat/completions</code> and keep the existing consumers working.</p>
<p>Once you have the new and old version working simultaneously, you can start telling users to upgrade to the new version. This takes a <em>long</em> time: months or even years. Even with banners on the website, docs, custom emails, and headers on the API response, when you finally remove the old version, you will still get a lot of angry users upset that you’ve broken their software. But at least you’ll have done what you can about it.</p>
<p>There are lots of other ways to do API versioning. The Stripe API does versioning in a <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning">header</a>, and lets accounts set their default version in the UI. But the principle is the same - any consumers of the Stripe API can be confident that Stripe won’t decide to break their applications, and they can upgrade versions at their own pace.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t like API versioning.</strong> I think at best it’s a necessary evil, but it’s still evil. It’s confusing to users, who can’t easily search for your API docs without making sure that the version selector matches the version they’re using. And it’s a <em>nightmare</em> for maintainers. If you have thirty API endpoints, every new version you add introduces thirty new endpoints to maintain. You will rapidly end up with hundreds of APIs that all need testing, debugging, and customer support.</p>
<p>Of course, adding a new version doesn’t double the size of your codebase. Any sensible API versioning backend will have something like a translation layer that can turn a response into any of your public API versions. Stripe has <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/api-versioning">something like this</a>: the actual business logic is the same for all versions, so only the parameter serializing and deserializing needs to be aware of versioning. However, abstractions like that will always leak. See this 2017 <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13711171">HN comment</a> from a Stripe employee, pointing out that some versioning changes need conditional logic throughout the “core code”. </p>
<p>In short, <strong>you should only use API versioning as a last resort</strong>.</p>
<h3>The success of your API depends entirely on the product</h3>
<p>An API by itself doesn’t do anything. It’s a layer between the user and the thing they actually want. For the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create">OpenAI API</a>, that’s the ability to do inference with a language model. For the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/api/account#fetch-an-account-resource">Twilio API</a>, that’s sending SMS messages. Nobody uses an API because the API itself is so elegantly designed. They use it to <em>interact with your product</em>. <strong>If your product is valuable enough, users will flock to even a terrible API.</strong></p>
<p>This is why some of the most popular APIs are a nightmare to use. Facebook and Jira are famous for having appalling APIs, but it doesn’t matter - if you want to integrate with Facebook or Jira, which you do, you need to spend the time to figure them out. Sure, it would be nice if those companies had a better API. But why invest the time and money into improving it when people are going to integrate with it anyway? Writing good APIs is <em>really hard</em>.</p>
<p>I’m going to give a lot of concrete advice in the rest of this post about how to write good APIs. But it’s worth remembering that most of the time it doesn’t matter. If your product is desirable, any barely-functional API will do; if it isn’t, it doesn’t matter how good your API is. API quality is a marginal feature: it only matters when a consumer is choosing between two basically-equivalent products.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the <em>presence</em> of an API is an entirely different story. If one product doesn’t have an API at all, that’s a big problem. Technical users will demand some way to integrate with the software they’re buying via code.</p>
<h3>Poorly-designed products will usually have bad APIs</h3>
<p>A technically-great API can’t save a product that nobody wants to use. However, <strong>a technically-poor product can make it nearly impossible to build an elegant API</strong>. That’s because API design usually tracks the “basic resources” of a product (for instance, Jira’s resources would be <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-issues/#api-rest-api-2-issue-issueidorkey-get">issues</a>, <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-projects/#api-rest-api-2-project-projectidorkey-get">projects</a>, <a href="https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-users/#api-rest-api-2-user-get">users</a> and so on). When those resources are set up awkwardly, that makes the API awkward as well.</p>
<p>As an example, consider a blogging system that stored comments in-memory as a linked list (each comment has a <code>next</code> field that points to the next comment in the thread). This is a terrible way to store comments. The naive way to bolt a REST API onto this system would be to have an interface that looks like this:</p>
<p><code>GET /comments/1 -&gt; { id: 1, body: "...", next_comment_id: 2 }</code></p>
<p>Or even worse, like this:</p>
<p><code>GET /comments -&gt; {body: "...", next_comment: { body: "...", next_comment: {...}}}</code></p>
<p>This might seem like a silly example, because in practice you’d just iterate over the linked list and return an array of comments in the API response. But even if you’re willing to do that extra work, how far down do you iterate? In a thread with thousands of comments, is it just impossible to fetch any comment after the first few hundred? Will your comment-fetching API have to use a background job, forcing the interface to turn into something like:</p>
<p><code>POST /comments/fetch_job/1 -&gt; { job_id: 589 }</code>
<code>GET /comments_job/589 -&gt; { status: 'complete', comments: [...] }</code></p>
<p>This is how some of the worst APIs happen. Technical constraints that can be cleverly hidden in the UI are laid bare in the API, forcing API consumers to understand far more of the system design than they should reasonably have to.</p>
<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p><strong>You should let people use your APIs with a long-lived API key.</strong> Yes, API keys are not as secure as various forms of short-lived credentials, like OAuth (which you should probably also support). It doesn’t matter. Every integration with your API begins life as a simple script, and using an API key is the easiest way to get a simple script working. You want to make it as easy as possible for engineers to get started.</p>
<p>Although consumers of an API will (almost by definition) be writing code, <strong>many of your users will not be professional engineers</strong>. They may be salespeople, product managers, students, hobbyists, and so on. When you’re an engineer at a tech company building an API, it’s easy to imagine that you’re building it for other people like yourself: full-time, competent, professional software engineers. But you’re not. You’re building it for a very wide cross-section of people, many of whom are not comfortable writing or reading code. If your API requires users to do anything difficult - like performing an OAuth handshake - many of those users will struggle.</p>
<h3>Idempotency and retries</h3>
<p>When an API request succeeds, you know it did what it tried to do. What about when it fails? Some types of failure tell you what happened: a 422 typically means it failed during the request-validation stage, before any action was taken<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>. But what about a 500? What about a timeout?</p>
<p>This is important for API operations that <em>take action</em>. If you’re hitting some Jira API to create an issue comment, and the request 500s or times out, should you retry? You don’t know for sure whether the comment has been created or not, since the error might be happening after that operation. If you retry, you might end up posting two comments. This is even more important when there’s more at stake than a Jira comment. What if you’re transferring some amount of money? What if you’re dispensing medication?</p>
<p>The solution is <em>idempotency</em>, which is a fancy word for “the request should be safely retriable without creating duplicates”. The standard way to do this is to support an “idempotency key” in the request (say, some user-defined string in a parameter or header). When the API server gets a “create comment” request with an idempotency key, it first looks to see if it’s seen this idempotency key before. If so, it does nothing; otherwise it goes and creates the comment, then saves the idempotency key. That way you can send as many retries as you like, as long as they’ve all got the same idempotency key - the operation will only be performed once.</p>
<p>How should you store the key? I’ve seen people store it in some durable, resource-specific way (e.g. as a column on the <code>comments</code> table), but I don’t think that’s strictly necessary. The easiest way is to put them in Redis or some similar key/value store (with the idempotency key as the key). UUIDs are unique enough that you don’t need to scope them by user, but you may as well. If you’re not dealing with payments, you can even expire them after a few hours, since most retries happen immediately.</p>
<p>Do you need idempotency keys for every request? Well, you don’t need them for read requests, since double-reads are harmless. You also typically<sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4">4</a></sup> don’t need them for delete requests, since if you’re deleting by resource ID, that ID serves as the idempotency key. Think about it - if you send three <code>DELETE comments/32</code> requests in a row, it won’t delete three comments. The first successful request will delete the comment with ID 32, and the remaining requests will 404 when they can’t find the already-deleted comment.</p>
<p>For most cases, idempotency should be optional. Like I said above, you want to make sure that your API is accessible to non-engineers (who often find idempotency a tricky concept). In the grand scheme of things, getting more people on your API is more important than the occasional duplicated comment from users who didn’t read the documentation. </p>
<h3>Safety and rate limiting</h3>
<p>Users who are interacting with your UI are limited by the speed of their hands. If there’s some flow that’s expensive for your backend to serve, a malicious or careless user can only trigger that flow as fast as they can click through it. APIs are different. <strong>Any operation you expose via an API can be called at the speed of code.</strong></p>
<p>Be careful about APIs that do a lot of work in a single request. When I worked at Zendesk, we had an API that let you fan out notifications to all the users of a particular app. Some enterprising third-party developer<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5">5</a></sup> used this to build an in-app chat system, where every message sent a notification to every other user on the account. For accounts with more than a handful of active users, this reliably killed the Apps backend server.</p>
<p>We didn’t anticipate people building a chat app on top of this API. But once it was out there, people did what they wanted with it. I’ve been in many, many incident calls where the root cause was some hand-rolled customer integration that was doing something silly, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and deleting the same records hundreds of times per-minute, for no real reason</li>
<li>Polling a big <code>/index</code> endpoint with no delay in between, forever</li>
<li>Importing or exporting a ton of data without backing off in case of errors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You should put a rate limit on your API, with tighter limits for expensive operations.</strong> It’s also sensible to reserve the ability to temporarily disable the API for specific customers, so you can take the pressure off your backend system if it’s really getting hammered.</p>
<p>Include rate limiting metadata in your API responses. <code>X-Limit-Remaining</code> and <code>Retry-After</code> headers give clients the information they need to be respectful consumers of your API, and allow you to set stricter rate limits than you would otherwise be able to.</p>
<h3>Pagination</h3>
<p>Almost every API has to serve a long list of records. Sometimes a very long list (for instance, the Zendesk <code>/tickets</code> API can contain millions of tickets). How can you serve those records?</p>
<p>A naive <code>SELECT * FROM tickets WHERE...</code> approach will blow out your available memory (if not in the database, then in the application layer where you’re trying to serialize this million-item list). You just can’t serve every ticket in a single request. Instead, you have to <em>paginate</em>.</p>
<p>The simplest way to paginate is to use pages (or “offsets”, more generically). When you hit <code>/tickets</code>, you get the first ten tickets on the account. To get more, you have to hit either <code>/tickets?page=2</code> or <code>/tickets?offset=20</code>. This is easy to implement, since the server can just add <code>OFFSET 20 LIMIT 10</code> to the end of the database query. But it doesn’t scale to really high numbers of records. Relational databases have to count through your offset every time, so each page you serve gets a little slower than the last page. By the time your offset is in the hundreds of thousands, it’s a real problem.</p>
<p>The solution is “cursor-based pagination”. Instead of passing <code>offset=20</code> to get the second page, you take the final ticket on the first page (say, with ID 32) and pass <code>cursor=32</code>. The API will then return the next ten tickets, <em>starting with ticket number 32</em>. Instead of using <code>OFFSET</code>, the query becomes <code>WHERE id &gt; cursor ORDER BY id LIMIT 10</code>. That query is equally quick whether you’re at the start of the collection or hundreds of thousands of tickets in, because the database can instantly find the (indexed) position of your cursor ticket instead of having to count through the entire offset.</p>
<p><strong>You should always use cursor-based pagination for datasets that might end up being large.</strong> Even though it’s harder for consumers to grasp, when you run into scaling problems you might <em>have</em> to change to cursor-based pagination anyway, and the cost of making that change is often very high. However, I think it’s fine to use page or offset-based pagination otherwise.</p>
<p>It’s usually wise to include a <code>next_page</code> field in your API list responses. That saves consumers having to figure out the next page number or cursor on their own.</p>
<h3>Optional fields and GraphQL</h3>
<p><strong>If parts of your API response are expensive to serve, make them optional.</strong> For instance, if fetching the user’s subscription status requires your backend to make an API call, consider making your <code>/users/:id</code> endpoint not return subscription unless the request passes an <code>include_subscription</code> parameter. As a more general approach, you could have an <code>includes</code> array parameter with all your optional fields. This is often used for records that are associated (for instance, you could pass <code>includes: [posts]</code> to your user request to get the user’s posts in the response).</p>
<p>This is part of the idea behind <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>, a style of API where instead of hitting different endpoints per-operation, you craft a single query with all the data you need and the backend figures it out<sup id="fnref-6"><a href="#fn-6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>I don’t like GraphQL very much</strong>, for three reasons. First, it’s completely impenetrable to non-engineers (and to many engineers). Once you learn it, it’s a tool like any other, but the barrier to entry is just so much higher than <code>GET /users/1</code>. Second, I don’t like giving users the freedom to craft arbitrary queries. It makes caching more complicated and increases the number of edge cases you have to think about. Third, in my experience the backend implementation is so much more fiddly than your standard REST API.</p>
<p>I don’t feel <em>that</em> strongly about my dislike of GraphQL. I’ve spent maybe six months working with it in various contexts and am far from an expert. I’m sure there are use cases where it buys you enough flexibility to be worth the costs. But right now I’d only use it where I absolutely had to.</p>
<h3>Internal APIs</h3>
<p>Everything I’ve said so far is about <em>public</em> APIs. What about internal APIs: APIs that are only used by your colleagues at a particular company? Some of the assumptions I’ve made above don’t hold for internal APIs. For instance, your consumers are usually professional software engineers. It’s also possible to safely make breaking changes, because (a) you often have an order of magnitude fewer users, and (b) you have the ability to go in and ship new code for all of those users. You can require as complex a form of authentication as you want.</p>
<p>However, internal APIs can still be a source of incidents, and still need to be idempotent for key operations.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>APIs are hard to build because they’re inflexible but must be easy to adopt</li>
<li>API maintainers’ primary duty is to NOT BREAK USERSPACE. Never make breaking changes to public APIs</li>
<li>Versioning your API lets you make changes, but imposes significant implementation and adoption barriers</li>
<li>If your product is valuable enough, it doesn’t really matter how good your API is, people will use it anyway</li>
<li>If your product is badly-designed enough, it doesn’t matter how carefully you design your API, it will likely suck</li>
<li>Your API should support simple API keys for authentication, because many of your users will not be professional engineers</li>
<li>Requests that take action (particularly high-stakes action like payments) should include some kind of idempotency key to make retries safe</li>
<li>Your API will always be a source of incidents. Make sure you have rate limits and killswitches in place</li>
<li>Use cursor-based pagination for datasets that might end up being very large</li>
<li>Make expensive fields optional and off-by-default, but (in my opinion) GraphQL is overkill</li>
<li>Internal APIs are different in some ways (because your consumers are very different)</li>
</ul>
<p>What haven’t I written about? I haven’t written much about REST vs SOAP, or JSON vs XML, because I don’t think that stuff is particularly important. I like REST and JSON, but I don’t feel strongly about it. I also haven’t mentioned OpenAPI schema - it’s a useful tool, but I think it’s also fine to just write your API docs in Markdown if you want.</p>
