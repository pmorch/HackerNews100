Therefore, to love somebody else in the first place is always an escape which we all hope for, and we all enjoy it when we are capable of it. But in the long run, it comes back on us. You cannot stay away from yourself forever, you have to return, have to come to that experiment—whether you can love yourself, and that will be the test. —Carl Jung, lecturing on Nietzsche</p><figure id="attachment_289500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-289500"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum-239x360.jpeg" alt="" width="203" height="305" srcset="https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum-239x360.jpeg 239w, https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum-679x1024.jpeg 679w, https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum-768x1157.jpeg 768w, https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum-1019x1536.jpeg 1019w, https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum-199x300.jpeg 199w, https://3quarksdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Pablo_Picasso_1908_Lamitie_Friendship_Two_Nudes_oil_on_canvas_151.3_x_101.8_cm_Hermitage_Museum.jpeg 1274w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-289500"><em>L’amitie,</em> Pablo Picasso, 1908.

Friendship Born of Self</strong></p><p>It is commonly, and truly, said that you can only love someone as well as you love yourself. For many of us, myself included, this is a hard teaching. As Jung says in the epigraph, we hope that we can love others without figuring out how to love ourselves, but eventually “it comes back on us.” The love I’m talking about is friendship. (It should come as no surprise that philosophers and psychologists haven’t looked to familial or romantic relationships as exemplars of enlightened love!) I want to explore how this curious relation between befriending ourselves and befriending others works. Along the way I show how we can use our discoveries to become better at both.</p><p>The notion that loving others depends on loving ourselves is not new. Aristotle discusses how the kind of friend we are to ourselves will be reflected in the kind of friendships we have with others. Where there is “internal conflict,” where, as he puts it, “souls are divided against themselves,” they will not be able to love themselves, or others. I think of people I’ve known who end up in therapy because a friend or partner made it clear that the relationship would be over if they didn’t address their depression or anxiety or addiction—examples of how internal discord causes troubles for others.</p><p><strong>2. It’s Mutual, Actually</strong></p><p>But friendships don’t just reflect who we are. Who we are, and how we show up in relationships, depends also on how we have been treated by others. If you grew up with a hypercritical rejecting mother, your attachment pattern and personality will reflect this. In other words, our way of being with others is informed by the way others have been with us; in particular, by how attentive and attuned (friendly) early caregivers were.<span id="more-289491"></span></p><p>So, as we say of friendship, it’s a two-way street. Our friendships tend to reflect who we are, but who we are also reflects how we’ve been related to. This mutuality radiates inward and outward. Thus Plato and Aristotle don’t just relate self-harmony to harmony in friendship, they note that these intimate harmonies can be difficult to establish when there is discord in larger social and political orders. That’s why, at the level of family, it’s hard to have a secure attachment pattern if our parenting wasn’t good enough. Moving outward, it’s why, as Milan Kundera’s novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joke-Definitive-Version-Milan-Kundera/dp/006099505X/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XUjZTwvC06v_AQ1YkicnjbzD_v5w0qXHa89lFwOSq5rG-dolDocOaHVsiWRmm9ZzvhGqXx3XoACEgi8V46mW2QEjX_J4AN1fA1_IlDmqVQ463GG85Om1f1e6nLzc9RyPLML10OqZvRo9oJt-RhwQ_-62fFWeuf80mSCsNOl4q_rKfRwgzjSpKjt2jeGM70qQEXvXIsmI7by8uI_rsiJGubmt1rRkZujC20xRurCV1kE.sZRU7qW0MulM9c3xwwnqajzaMEihmR7v6jtDUWbPZiw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=the+joke+novel&amp;qid=1760305887&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Joke</em></a> illustrates so vividly, bad political orders like communism and fascism make friendship harder. Closer to home, many therapists have patients whose discord is exacerbated by the political discord and chaos in the US.</p><p>The Greek view that flourishing depends on establishing inner and outer harmony profoundly influenced modern psychology. Freud was acquainted with at least some of Plato’s metaphors for the organization of the psyche. Two prominent examples are Socrates comparing the parts of the soul to the parts of a city in the <em>Republic</em>; and in the <em>Phaedrus</em> he compares it to a charioteer and two horses. Freud would begin thinking of the psyche in terms of <em>id</em>, <em>ego</em>, and <em>superego</em>. His method of psychoanalysis aimed at roughly the same goal the Greeks sought through philosophic friendship: becoming aware of the soul’s psychodynamics, and using this awareness to reduce the conflicts and suffering, so as to become better friends to ourselves and others.</p><p>In a further deepening of this mutual relation, the greatest development in psychoanalysis after Freud has been the ontological shift from an egoic individual psychology to a relational one. (My essay, <a href="https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2025/07/how-to-start-thinking-about-attachment.html#more-283429"><em>How to Start Thinking about Attachment</em></a>, explains what led to this shift.) Many recent models of therapy take up these themes. Internal Family Systems (IFS), for example, explores how roles found in the external social order have analogues in roles played by parts of the self. For instance, if you were raised in a ‘family system’ characterized by a critical attitude and emotional aloofness, chances are you’ll have internalized a fierce inner critic. As you might guess, the therapy involves befriending all the parts. In a phrase that could have been taken from Plato or Aristotle, an adage of IFS is that ‘there are no bad parts, just good parts in bad roles.’</p><p><strong>3. Some Uses of Friendship</strong><br> As I’ve said, friendship exemplifies the ideal way of relating to ourselves and others, one that prizes awareness, free choice, mutuality, and justice. Indeed, in the Gospel of John, we’re even invited to think of friendship as the ideal way of relating to Jesus. (Thinking about the son of God as our best friend puts being <em>imago dei</em> in a fresh light!) As we explore the uses of ‘friendship,’ keep in mind that this refers both to self-friendship and friendship with others.</p><p>How can we use what we know about friendship to better our relations? First, notice that because friendships are active and dynamic, they are always pointing in a direction and providing feedback as to how they, and we, are doing. Think for example of some important partnerships or friendships in your life. Now ask yourself whether, overall, the relation is in a virtuous or vicious cycle, or holding pattern. When a friendship is going well, it’s typical to feel enlivened and empowered by it, and to seek more of the friend’s company. When it’s not, we often feel demoralized, even dragged down or made worse. For instance, someone trying to recover from an addiction is worsened by the company of a friend who is still using and encouraging them to start again.</p><p>Next, it’s helpful to notice whether you’re more introverted or extroverted, whether you’re more inclined to spend time with yourself or with others. For introverts in therapy, it can be hard to accept that the path to being on better terms with ourselves leads through developing our relations with others. Returning to this essay’s epigraph, both Jung and Nietzsche famously embraced the struggle to know and love themselves. Yet in Nietzsche’s case, and perhaps in Jung’s, this inner work was easier than the outer, interpersonal work. For extroverts, on the other hand, who tend to find being with others more attractive, the path often leads in the other direction, toward the solitude and introspection needed for getting to know and befriend themselves.</p><p>In psychotherapy, some patients need to be encouraged to lean more inward, others to lean more outward, the common aim being integration—more harmony and friendship. It’s worth noticing here how difficult and unsentimental the true endeavor of befriending ourselves is, contrary to a tendency of therapy culture to prefer coddling patients to challenging them. The tough love starts with accepting that if we want things to change, <em>we</em> have to change. It’s not enough to have bright ideas for what others need to be doing better! Even if abusing alcohol is our partner’s problem, still, we have to figure out how best to respond.</p><p>But talk of change, much less making changes, meets resistance. Which is where our awareness of mutuality can encourage us, by reminding us that where friendships are concerned, it is rarely accurate or useful either to blame ourselves or to view ourselves as blameless victims. If we tend to blame and shame ourselves for our difficulties, it’s useful to recall how early attachment relations and environment have shaped us, contributing to why we behave as we do—for better and worse. In short, it’s useful to remind ourselves of the complex dialectical weave in which we are embedded.</p><p>To illustrate, I’ve worked with patients who honestly saw their habitually critical and demanding attitude toward others as totally reasonable—“it’s what I hope for from others,” as one patient said when I noted how harsh she sounded when talking about her son. But as she has become aware of how distorted and unreasonable her so-called reasonableness has turned out to be, she’s pained at how unfair she’s been to others. But she’s also relieved because (no surprise by now) she had been treating herself in the same critical demeaning way. What a relief, then, to explore how this critic was actually a defense meant to protect her: keeping her ever-vigilant by rehearsing every way she had screwed up, and anticipating every way she might be about to. In general, seeing how we habitually relate, and where this come from, usually leads to more empathy. This in turn can help us nudge parts like that inner critic into a better role—much as we might talk to a friend about how their well-meaning but misplaced feedback (or critical attitude) isn’t working for us.</p><p>Ideally, friends love us as we aspire to love ourselves. Good therapists treat their patients with the same warm and friendly, but also honest and challenging, mindset that they hope the patient can eventually bring to themselves and their relationships. Ideally, our friends recognize and love our good qualities, while also expressing their concern about our tendency, say, to be overly critical or to dominate conversations.</p><p>Let me close with a further note about friendship’s dual aspect as warm and loving, yet guided by the cooler spirit of awareness and concern for justice. This combination gives friendship its unique character, and contributes to the virtuous cycle I’ve been describing, in which we are more able to know and love ourselves as we come to know and love others, and vice versa. On the cooler side, in Plato’s dialogues we see Socrates encouraging the open dialectical mindset of friendship in his young interlocutors, while discouraging the warmer romantic, competitive, or adversarial alternatives.</p><p>As the philosophers knew, it’s more challenging and even painful, as Jung notes in the epigraph, to face that “glowing red-hot iron” of who one actually is. Yet doing so is the path to true love—to more genuine and intimate connections with ourselves and others. I think of the woman I mentioned, so fiercely critical, and the way she felt when she apologized to her adult son for how she’d spoken to him in their last conversation, but really for much of his life. He’d responded to her apology with such heartfelt gratitude that she felt simultaneously heartbroken and hopeful. Heartbroken to know the trouble she’d caused her beloved son, but hopeful, as she said, that she and her son could now become friends.</p><p><strong>Enjoying the content on 3QD?

Stéphane and Steve have created a nearly magical tinnitus solution. Whenever my tinnitus starts acting up, I pop on these settings for a few minutes, and when I take the headphones off... Silence. Absolute silence. I have no idea how this works, but it's genius!</span></p><p>

You wouldn't think such an exotic, high-pitched, and beepy sound generator would be calming, but when you find the right spot and let it go for a few minutes, then pause the audio, it's so much quieter—not gone, but still a relief compared to before. Even just letting it play and noticing your ear ringing contributing to the music instead of being a distracting annoyance is calming.</span></p><p>

Once properly calibrated, after a few minutes of listening, it helps reduce the perception of tinnitus—and even after removing the headphones, the sensation almost seems to vanish. myNoise is a great tool to use when needed.</span></p><p>

I've been using this neuromodulator on a daily basis for many weeks and this is by far the best help I could ever find to release my tinnitus 24/7 head drill. It doesn’t get rid of it completely, but it tones it down massively - just leaves a soft background hum that lets you live your life. Honestly, it feels like magic. No idea how it works this well. Huge thanks to the creators - you guys rock!</span></p><p>

I use the tinnitus neuromodulator when things get rough. It doesn't just mask the tinnitus, it transports me into a space where I can focus again. For a while, I feel clear. What gets me is this: when I take off the headphones, the tinnitus is gone. Not reduced—gone. Then, slowly, it creeps back. That minute of silence is everything.</span></p><p>

I don't have tinnitus, but I love the strangeness of this generator. It sounds really fascinating and seems to help me focus. By the way, I guess this is what an aural representation (a strange tone poem?) of a ketamine trip would sound like :D</span></p><p>

This doesn't so much drown out my tinnitus as blend with it, but it's still a fantastic change from the usual! I've had tinnitus my entire life, and as a kid, I never understood why people liked silence so much since it was so loud! Weird alien beep-boops is the new silence.</span></p><p>

This is crazy, it actually works. Thankfully my tinnitus is not constant, but very annoying when it's present. It actually makes it disappear, even after I've closed the sound generator, for quite some time.</span></p><p>

This is the first time in a while that I've been able to just sit and be content without that infernal ringing hijacking my thoughts.

I was using this to help me focus because I have really bad tinnitus, and it makes it so hard to focus! As soon as it started playing, it drowned out my tinnitus and made me able to think way better!

Against all odds, it apparently works. I have tested it a couple of times today by playing the audio on headphones for 5-10 minutes, and there is a significant relief in my tinnitus for shorter periods of time. I will try running the audio for a longer time to see if I can have a longer-lasting effect.</span></p><p>

I needed this sound every day in 2022 when I was having major mental issues and anxiety, which created a feedback loop for my tinnitus (tinnitus increased anxiety, anxiety increased tinnitus.) with the help of this sound generator I managed to reduce my anxiety and tinnitus to the point where it's nothing more than a passing thought every now and then, that I come back here to get rid of.

I don't have tinnitus; I have MS. Certain sounds have started to bother me a lot, even waking me up. I can't sleep for longer than 2 hours some nights. It's not fun. I usually have to turn some white noise on loud enough to mask the sounds but that hurts sometimes, and is hard to sleep with. This sound however is pretty weird. I don't have to crank it up loud, and it works. I'm actually sleepy.</span></p><p>

Dude thank you, I've had musical ear syndrome since I was a kid, and a life of listening to heavy metal and rock and roll at high volume on headphones and going to shows has made tinnitus worse.

Relief from tinnitus, for the first time in years!  I can't handle listening to it for much longer than twenty minutes (because I'm bored by generated noise after a while), but when I take my headphones off, my tinnitus is so massively diminished I can hardly believe it.

Suffering from tinitus for many years, this is helping me tremendously. My tinitus sounds resemble the high pitch noise you get from old TV sets.

I started using MyNoise's ocean sounds years ago to help me sleep due to severe misophonia, it blocks the noise from the street and I don't need to sleep with earplugs or headphones anymore.

For a few years I've used myNoise to block out the sounds of busy city life and to get to sleep.
More recently in late 2022 I contracted covid which unfortunately left me with hearing damage and significant tinnitus in one ear.
The only thing that has been able to relieve the horrible ringing so far are some of the neuromodulator tracks here, and for that I am grateful. </span></p><p>

As an autistic person with pretty debilitating hyperacusis (I pretty much can't function without ear plugs) the onset of some mild tinnitus was distressing to say the least. White noise is usually the recommended go-to for tinnitus but it's painful to me. High pitched fuzzy or low constant humming sounds are literal agony. This is varied enough to ease and accommodate both issues. Miraculous!</span></p><p>

Well it just works. I get into music stuff lately after a long session of mixing, mastering or drum take your ear just start to deafen sometimes with headaches. I used this as a tool to "reset" my ear by listening to it at a barely heard loudness and turning it down even more after I can hear it clearly, just rinse and repeat!</span></p><p>

Just wanted to add my comment to say that yes, in my experience (loud ~9kHz in left ear) this is more than a placebo effect re: tinnitus relief. HOW exciting. Cheers! Breathing deeper and slower too.</span></p><p>

When getting the automation right, it takes ages for piano or guitar sounds to get repetitive, sounds of nature and human voices (radio chatter etc) sound completely natural, organic, and at home here without feeling repetitive at all. And sci-fi sounds, and drone like instruments can pretty much do their thing forever and play well off of each other while they do it.</span></p><p>

Amazing, always helps when silence is a bit too noisy. My uncle who has bad tinnitus commented that it helped even after a few minutes without headphones...

I developed a high pitched whistling tinnitus  10 years ago when I was 14 and I thought I lost the sound of silence forever, but listening to this for 20 minutes on shuffle makes my tinnitus disappear completely!

I can't say if this will work for everyone's tinnitus, but it does for mine! After listening for 20 minutes or so, my tinnitus is much reduced and stays that way for up to two hours afterward. I am interested to see if there is any long-term effect from using this generator daily.</span></p><p>

Thank you so much! My tinnitus began after a concussion 6 years ago. I have no hearing problems, just issues caused by my brain. I found your website, turned on my computer speakers &amp; immediately my neck &amp; shoulders relaxed as the tinnitus decreased significantly. Initially I listened for about 1/2 hour &amp; when I walked away it was much lower volume than before. Best for me on the default setting.</span></p><p>

This generator is completely amazing, if for no other reason it detracts attention away from my tinnitus, which is now chronic for years and years. The Neural Symphony functions are easy to use and adjust. I have discovered that for me I drop all pulses and warble to zero, and then use the automated slider animation. Wide range of high frequencies, ever changing. Bliss.</span></p><p>

This is certainly promising, and I did notice an affect pretty quickly. However, ACRN should be tunable to the frequency of of your tinnitus. The Steve Sequence is kind of all over the place, and mostly tuned lower than my own (6kHz, and pretty common). Would be nice to see something where the frequency can be tuned, and maybe change the waveform (sine, sawtooth, fuzz, etc). [Note from editor : try the Tape Speed Control feature]</span></p><p>

Yes. Really does improve my tinnitus. Even more, I find it actually quite soothing as ambience for indoor work - less aural fatigue than white noise. For some reason, it even makes house-cleaning less tedious :-)  Kudos!</span></p><p>

The tinnitus neuromodulation noises have had a proufound effect on lessening my tinnitus and I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who is seeking relief. Short of a future breakthrough in medication or surgical treatments, this is the best solution I have come across and it makes life that bit more bearable. Many, many, many thanks!</span></p><p>

After listening to the Sinescape preset for this generator for only maybe 20 minutes, I found that my rather loud tinnitus because much quieter and almost non-existent immediately after removing my headphones. I'm curious to see how long this lasts, but it's quite a relief even for a little while!</span></p><p>

This generator is the first thing that helps with my tinnitus, lowering its pitch and volume until it's almost gone even after I took off the headphones. The relief only lasts for a few hours, but to someone who has a constant high pitched noise in their ears otherwise, those hours mean the world. I cannot thank you enough for your amazing work, Stphane. You're a true blessing to the world.</span></p><p>

My tinnitus is quite high-pitched and fairly constant. If I play this sequence for a little while, it brings it back down under a low roar, if only for a few hours. &lt;3</span></p><p>

Brilliant site I could spend hours here.  I have tinnitus  a different high pitched frequency in each ear.Slightly spacey space-station? A little dreamy but a little sedating as well and kills the tinnitus.</span></p><p>

This is a very strange soundscape, but in an enjoyable way. I personally do not have tinnitus, but I think this is still fun to listen to. You just have to find the right sliders to make sense of this one, hahaha.</span></p><p>

I have Tinnitus. I also have perfect hearing and from years of being a musician one would anticipate hearing loss. None. I am also a Director for an electric and water utility and I have a lot of concentrating work (reports, analysis, etc). When My Tinnitus is in full flight, it is impossible to concentrate. This is a life saver. I can work all day and feel the calming of the tones. Amazing! </span></p><p>

May be my imagination, listened for about 15 min,  then when taking my speakers away from my ears, my pulsating tinnitus was quieter.</span></p><p>

First I found myself heaving a relieved sigh, and then started crying when I found the custom noise that masked my tinnitus. It has been five months of unrelenting high pitched whine, yet I refused to allow myself a pity party, concluding, "It is what it is; suck it up, girl, there is little you can do." But to have this respite is a great blessing. Thank you! </span></p><p>

I noticed listening to  music with different frequencies helps soften my Tinnitus. I have a constant 24/7 14,000hz sawtooth sound in my head for the two years.  This program is amazing!   </span></p><p>

Not for me. Sounds more like star wars. What really helps me is a soft noise plug. Stick in the ear canal and when the sounds starts bothering switch to other ear. This is the only thing that helps me.</span></p><p>

I have been listening to music with MY Tinnitus frequency embedded into the music. I understand this works for some, not me. After over 6 months, no change. The past two days have been horrible... I am a musician and although I have been playing rock music for over 40 years, I have no hearing damage at all... 20 minutes on customizing my own pattern, I can actually concentrate on my work!</span></p><p>

Thank you so much for this incredible site!  I'm quite happy to make a donation to you out of simple gratitude for all your efforts putting these sounds online for us, and keeping the site (and your iOS app, myNoise) working.  I've experienced persistent tinnitus for a couple decades, now, with almost no respite except after one minutes or so of "Neural Hack" or "Neural Symphony!" Amazing!</span></p><p>

I'm a fairly new comer to myNoise having serendipitously discovered the site only three weeks ago and a very long sufferer of Tinnitus. I have only discovered this particular generator only moments ago and jumped right in to listen. Ironically, I've been having episodes all week so I'll absolutely write the results of my experience after one week and again at two weeks. Today is 8 June '16 </span></p><p>

Something very weird happens if I listen to this for 15-20 minutes: in addition to the tinnitus masking, my mind actually "quiets down". The parts of my brain that would normally be wandering seem to be occupied chasing down the bells and warbles, allowing the rest of my attention to focus entirely on the task at hand. Awesome brain hack.</span></p><p>

I don't have tinnitus, but I find myself enjoying the bizarre dreamlike discord that using the animation sliders can provide. It's a rather lovely chiming chaos... that is weirdly calming to me. I'm not sure what that says :)</span></p><p>

I guess I am fortunate that I only get ringing in my ears when I take certain prescription medications  I can't believe my luck that a few hours after I took the medication I started to get the ringing and came here to find some rain sounds and discovered this new generator.  What a gift this is!  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Luxury goods are special: they are scarce and expensive, and they earn us status with some folks because it shows that we paid more than we needed to.</p>



<p>Luxury isn’t about quality, suitability or performance. Luxury isn’t a more accurate watch or a faster processor. Luxury is a marker that we can afford to do something others might consider wasteful.</p>



<p>A Birkin bag is a luxury good, and so is reading an entire non-fiction book, listening to a public radio broadcast or attending a concert when we could stay at home and listen for free.</p>



<p>By ‘wasting’ our attention on nuance, narrative, experiences and everything except the checkbox takeaway, we’re sending a message to ourselves and others. A message about allocating our time to something beyond optimized performance or survival.</p>



<p>If you’ve signed up to offer an attention-luxury good, you undermine it when you also try to make it quick and convenient.</p>

<p dir="auto">Flowistry is a tool that analyzes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_(information_theory)" rel="nofollow">information flow</a> of Rust programs. Flowistry understands whether it's possible for one piece of code to affect another. Flowistry integrates into the IDE to provide a "focus mode" which helps you focus on the code that's related to your current task.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, this GIF shows the focus mode when reading a function that unions two sets together:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062086-4d58a149-86c8-4a48-a6aa-a07cf027641c.gif"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062086-4d58a149-86c8-4a48-a6aa-a07cf027641c.gif" height="180" data-animated-image=""></a>
 </kbd>
 <p dir="auto">When the user clicks a given variable or expression, Flowistry fades out all code that <em>does not influence</em> that code, and <em>is not influenced by</em> that code. For example, <code>orig_len</code> is not influenced by the for-loop, while <code>set.len()</code> is.</p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry can be helpful when you're reading a function with a lot of code. For example, this GIF shows a real function in the Rust compiler. If you want to understand the role of a specific argument to the function, then Flowistry can filter out most of the code as irrelevant:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062527-6b42f64a-3429-4572-860f-7c2e244691d6.gif"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155062527-6b42f64a-3429-4572-860f-7c2e244691d6.gif" height="500" data-animated-image=""></a>

<p dir="auto">Flowistry is available as a VSCode plugin. You can install Flowistry from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wcrichton.flowistry" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Marketplace</a> or the <a href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/wcrichton/flowistry" rel="nofollow">Open VSX Registry</a>. In VSCode:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Go to the Extensions pane by clicking this button in the left margin: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/134039225-68d11dce-be71-4f33-8057-569346ef26bc.png"><img width="30" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-20 at 9 30 43 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/134039225-68d11dce-be71-4f33-8057-569346ef26bc.png"></a></li>
<li>Search for "Flowistry" and then click "Install".</li>
<li>Open a Rust workspace and wait for the tool to finish installing.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note on platform support:</strong> Flowistry does not yet support NixOS. Flowistry cannot provide pre-built binaries for ARM targets like M1 Macs, so Flowistry must be installed from scratch on these targets (this is done for you, but will take a few more minutes than usual).</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, you can install it from source:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# Install flowistry binaries
git clone https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry
cd flowistry
cargo install --path crates/flowistry_ide

# Install vscode extension
cd ide
npm install
npm run build

</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Rustc plugin</h3><a id="user-content-rustc-plugin" aria-label="Permalink: Rustc plugin" href="#rustc-plugin"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you are interested in the underlying analysis, you can use the <code>flowistry</code> crate published to crates.io: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/flowistry" rel="nofollow">https://crates.io/crates/flowistry</a></p>
<p dir="auto">The documentation is published here: <a href="https://willcrichton.net/flowistry/flowistry/" rel="nofollow">https://willcrichton.net/flowistry/flowistry/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Docs.rs doesn't support documentation for crates that use <code>#![feature(rustc_private)]</code> so we have to host it ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Note that the latest Flowistry has a <a href="https://github.com/cognitive-engineering-lab/rustc_plugin/tree/main#maximum-supported-rust-version"><strong>Maximum</strong> Supported Rust Version</a> of <strong>Rust 1.73</strong>.
Flowistry is not guaranteed to work with features implemented after 1.73.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Startup</h3><a id="user-content-startup" aria-label="Permalink: Startup" href="#startup"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once you have installed Flowistry, open a Rust workspace in VSCode. You should see this icon in the bottom toolbar:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155207447-4efb34b1-5e3d-4416-89aa-a0f7cd334ca4.png"><img width="121" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 46 12 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155207447-4efb34b1-5e3d-4416-89aa-a0f7cd334ca4.png"></a>
</kbd>
 <p dir="auto">Flowistry starts up by type-checking your codebase. This may take a few minutes if you have many dependencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Flowistry type-checking results are cached in the <code>target/flowistry</code> directory. If you delete this folder, Flowistry will have to recompute types. Also for a large codebase this directory may take up a fair amount of disk space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Entering focus mode</h3><a id="user-content-entering-focus-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Entering focus mode" href="#entering-focus-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Once Flowistry has booted up, the loading icon will disappear. Then you can enter focus mode by running the "Toggle focus mode" command. By default the keyboard shortcut is Ctrl+R Ctrl+A (⌘+R ⌘+A on Mac), or you can use the Flowistry context menu:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208449-83fceff7-86fe-4fe8-9fca-62552e6b0b43.png"><img width="450" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 52 39 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208449-83fceff7-86fe-4fe8-9fca-62552e6b0b43.png"></a>
</kbd>
 <p dir="auto">In focus mode, Flowistry will automatically compute the information flow within a given function once you put your cursor there. Once Flowistry has finished analysis, the status bar will look like this:</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208955-1f47ab0c-f3ae-4028-82b3-6f67e6fc0db7.png"><img width="120" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 11 55 36 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155208955-1f47ab0c-f3ae-4028-82b3-6f67e6fc0db7.png"></a>
</kbd>
 <blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Note: Flowistry can be a bit slow for larger functions. It may take up to 15 seconds to finish the analysis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry infers what you want to focus on based on your cursor. So if you click on a variable, you should see the focus region of that variable. Flowistry will highlight the focused code in gray, and then fade out code outside the focus region. For example, because the user's cursor is on <code>view_projection</code>, that variable is highlighted in gray, and its focus region is shown.</p>
<kbd>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155209805-75a23ed9-01ba-4100-b8bb-324b516f84cf.png"><img width="900" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-22 at 12 00 22 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/663326/155209805-75a23ed9-01ba-4100-b8bb-324b516f84cf.png"></a>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Setting a mark</h3><a id="user-content-setting-a-mark" aria-label="Permalink: Setting a mark" href="#setting-a-mark"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Sometimes you want to keep the focus region where it is, and click on other code to inspect it without changing focus. For this purpose, Flowistry has a concept of a "mark". Once you have selected code to focus on, you can run the "Set mark" command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+S / ⌘+R ⌘+S). Then a mark is set at your cursor's current position, and the focus will stay there until you run the "Unset mark" command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+D / ⌘+R ⌘+D).</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Selecting the focus region</h3><a id="user-content-selecting-the-focus-region" aria-label="Permalink: Selecting the focus region" href="#selecting-the-focus-region"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to modify all the code in the focus region, e.g. to comment it out or copy it, then you can run the "Select focused region" command (Ctrl+R Ctrl+T / ⌘+R ⌘+T). This will add the entire focus region into your editor's selection.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Limitations</h2><a id="user-content-limitations" aria-label="Permalink: Limitations" href="#limitations"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry is an active research project into the applications of information flow analysis for Rust. It is continually evolving as we experiment with analysis techniques and interaction paradigms. So it's not quite as polished or efficient as tools like Rust Analyzer, but we hope you can still find it useful! Nevertheless, there are a number of important limitations you should understand when using Flowistry to avoid being surprised.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you have questions or issues, please <a href="https://github.com/willcrichton/flowistry/issues">file a Github issue</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/XkcpkQn2Ah" rel="nofollow">join our Discord</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/wcrichton" rel="nofollow">DM @wcrichton on Twitter</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Flowistry does not completely handle interior mutability</h3><a id="user-content-flowistry-does-not-completely-handle-interior-mutability" aria-label="Permalink: Flowistry does not completely handle interior mutability" href="#flowistry-does-not-completely-handle-interior-mutability"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When your code has references, Flowistry needs to understand what that reference points-to. Flowistry uses Rust's lifetime information to determine points-to information. However, data structures that use interior mutability such as <code>Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> explicitly <em>do not</em> share lifetimes between pointers to the same data. For example, in this snippet:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let x = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
let y = x.clone();
*x.lock().unwrap() = 1;
println!(&quot;{}&quot;, y.lock().unwrap());"><pre><span>let</span> x = <span>Arc</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>Mutex</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> y = x<span>.</span><span>clone</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>*</span>x<span>.</span><span>lock</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>unwrap</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> = <span>1</span><span>;</span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> y<span>.</span>lock<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>unwrap<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry <em>can</em> determine that <code>*x.lock().unwrap() = 1</code> is a mutation to <code>x</code>, but it <em>can not</em> determine that it is a mutation to <code>y</code>. So if you focus on <code>y</code>, the assignment to 1 would be faded out, even though it is relevant to the value of <code>y</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">We are researching methods to overcome this limitation, but for now just be aware that this is the main case where Flowistry is known to provide an incorrect answer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A focus region may include more code than you expect</h3><a id="user-content-a-focus-region-may-include-more-code-than-you-expect" aria-label="Permalink: A focus region may include more code than you expect" href="#a-focus-region-may-include-more-code-than-you-expect"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry's analysis tries to include all code that <em>could</em> have an influence on a focal point. This analysis makes a number of assumptions for both practical and fundamental reasons. For example, in this snippet:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3];
let x = v.get_mut(0);
println!(&quot;{:?} {}&quot;, v, x);"><pre><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> v = <span>vec</span><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> x = v<span>.</span><span>get_mut</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>println</span><span>!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?} {}"</span><span>,</span> v<span>,</span> x<span>)</span><span>;</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">If you focus on <code>v</code> on line 3, it will include <code>v.get_mut(0)</code> as an operation that could have modified <code>v</code>. The reason is that Flowistry does not actually analyze the bodies of called functions, but rather approximates based on their type signatures. Because <code>get_mut</code> takes <code>&amp;mut self</code> as input, it assumes that the vector <em>could</em> be modified.</p>
<p dir="auto">In general, you should use focus mode as a pruning tool. If code is faded out, then you don't have to read it (minus the limitation mentioned above!). If it isn't faded out, then it might be relevant to your task.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Not all code is selectable</h3><a id="user-content-not-all-code-is-selectable" aria-label="Permalink: Not all code is selectable" href="#not-all-code-is-selectable"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry works by analyzing the <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html" rel="nofollow">MIR</a> graph for a given function using the Rust compiler's API. Then the IDE extension lifts the analysis results from the MIR level back to the source level. However, a lot of information about the program is lost in the journey from source code to MIR.</p>
<p dir="auto">For example, if the source contains an expression <code>foo.whomp.bar().baz()</code>, it's possible that a temporary variable is only generated for the expression <code>foo.whomp.bar()</code>. So if the user selects <code>foo</code>, Flowistry may not be able to determine that this corresponds to the MIR <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html" rel="nofollow">place</a> that represents <code>foo</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This is why the IDE extension highlights the focused code in gray, so you can understand what your cursor's selection actually maps to.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Nested functions cannot be analyzed together (including closures and async)</h3><a id="user-content-nested-functions-cannot-be-analyzed-together-including-closures-and-async" aria-label="Permalink: Nested functions cannot be analyzed together (including closures and async)" href="#nested-functions-cannot-be-analyzed-together-including-closures-and-async"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Flowistry analyzes a single function at a time. If a function contains other functions, e.g. <code>fn</code> definitions, or closures, or implicitly via async, then Flowistry will only show you focus regions within the smallest function body containing your cursor. This is usually well defined for function definitions and closures, but may be confusing for async since that depends on how rustc decides to carve up your async function.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2><a id="user-content-faq" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ" href="#faq"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">If rustup fails, especially with an error like "could not rename downloaded file", this is probably because Flowistry is running rustup concurrently with another tool (like rust-analyzer). Until <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/988" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/rust-lang/rustup/issues/988/hovercard">rustup#988</a> is resolved, there is unfortunately no automated way around this.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-08-25 -c rust-src -c rustc-dev -c llvm-tools-preview"><pre><code>rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-08-25 -c rust-src -c rustc-dev -c llvm-tools-preview
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Then go back to VSCode and click "Continue" to let Flowistry continue installing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why isn't Flowistry part of Rust Analyzer?</h3><a id="user-content-why-isnt-flowistry-part-of-rust-analyzer" aria-label="Permalink: Why isn't Flowistry part of Rust Analyzer?" href="#why-isnt-flowistry-part-of-rust-analyzer"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rust Analyzer does not support <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/mir/index.html" rel="nofollow">MIR</a> and the borrow checker, which are essential parts of Flowistry's analysis.

<p>ripgrep 15 is a new major version release of ripgrep that mostly has bug fixes,<br>
some minor performance improvements and minor new features.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In case you haven't heard of it before, ripgrep is a line-oriented search<br>
tool that recursively searches the current directory for a regex pattern.<br>
By default, ripgrep will respect gitignore rules and automatically skip<br>
hidden files/directories and binary files.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Several bugs around gitignore matching have been fixed. This includes<br>
a commonly reported bug related to applying gitignore rules from parent<br>
directories.</li>
<li>A memory usage regression when handling very large gitignore files has been<br>
fixed.</li>
<li><code>rg -vf file</code>, where <code>file</code> is empty, now matches everything.</li>
<li>The <code>-r/--replace</code> flag now works with <code>--json</code>.</li>
<li>A subset of Jujutsu (<code>jj</code>) repositories are now treated as if they were git<br>
repositories. That is, ripgrep will respect <code>jj</code>'s gitignores.</li>
<li>Globs can now use nested curly braces.</li>
</ul>
<p>Platform support:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aarch64</code> for Windows now has release artifacts.</li>
<li><code>powerpc64</code> no longer has release artifacts generated for it. The CI<br>
release workflow stopped working, and I didn't deem it worth my time to<br>
debug it. If someone wants this and can test it, I'd be happy to add it<br>
back.</li>
<li>ripgrep binaries are now compiled with full LTO enabled. You may notice<br>
small performance improvements from this and a modest decrease in binary<br>
size.</li>
</ul>
