<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Functional programming library for golang</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>🚧 Work in progress! 🚧</strong> Despite major version 1 because of <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="589023119" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1507" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1507/hovercard" href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/issues/1507">semantic-release/semantic-release#1507</a>. Trying to not make breaking changes, but devil is in the details.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/IBM/fp-go/blob/main/resources/images/logo.png"><img src="https://github.com/IBM/fp-go/raw/main/resources/images/logo.png" alt="logo"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This library is strongly influenced by the awesome <a href="https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts">fp-ts</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting started</h2>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="go get github.com/IBM/fp-go"><pre>go get github.com/IBM/fp-go</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Refer to the <a href="https://github.com/IBM/fp-go/blob/main/samples">samples</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Design Goal</h2>
<p dir="auto">This library aims to provide a set of data types and functions that make it easy and fun to write maintainable and testable code in golang. It encourages the following patterns:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>write many small, testable and pure functions, i.e. functions that produce output only depending on their input and that do not execute side effects</li>
<li>offer helpers to isolate side effects into lazily executed functions (IO)</li>
<li>expose a consistent set of composition to create new functions from existing ones
<ul dir="auto">
<li>for each data type there exists a small set of composition functions</li>
<li>these functions are called the same across all data types, so you only have to learn a small number of function names</li>
<li>the semantic of functions of the same name is consistent across all data types</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How does this play with the <a href="https://the-zen-of-go.netlify.app/" rel="nofollow">🧘🏽 Zen Of Go</a>?</h3>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Each package fulfils a single purpose</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ Each of the top level packages (e.g. Option, Either, ReaderIOEither, ...) fulfils the purpose of defining the respective data type and implementing the set of common operations for this data type.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Handle errors explicitly</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ The library makes a clear distinction between that operations that cannot fail by design and operations that can fail. Failure is represented via the <code>Either</code> type and errors are handled explicitly by using <code>Either</code>'s monadic set of operations.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Return early rather than nesting deeply</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ We recommend to implement simple, small functions that implement one feature and that would typically not invoke other functions. Interaction with other functions is done by function composition and the composition makes sure to run one function after the other. In the error case the <code>Either</code> monad makes sure to skip the error path.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Leave concurrency to the caller</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ All pure are synchronous by default. The I/O operations are asynchronous per default.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Before you launch a goroutine, know when it will stop</h4>
<p dir="auto">🤷🏽 This is left to the user of the library since the library itself will not start goroutines on its own. The Task monad offers support for cancellation via the golang context, though.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Avoid package level state</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ No package level state anywhere, this would be a significant anti-pattern</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Simplicity matters</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ The library is simple in the sense that it offers a small, consistent interface to a variety of data types. Users can concentrate on implementing business logic rather than dealing with low level data structures.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Write tests to lock in the behaviour of your package’s API</h4>
<p dir="auto">🟡 The programming pattern suggested by this library encourages writing test cases. The library itself also has a growing number of tests, but not enough, yet. TBD</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 If you think it’s slow, first prove it with a benchmark</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ Absolutely. If you think the function composition offered by this library is too slow, please provide a benchmark.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Moderation is a virtue</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ The library does not implement its own goroutines and also does not require any expensive synchronization primitives. Coordination of IO operations is implemented via atomic counters without additional primitives.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧘🏽 Maintainability counts</h4>
<p dir="auto">✔️ Code that consumes this library is easy to maintain because of the small and concise set of operations exposed. Also the suggested programming paradigm to decompose an application into small functions increases maintainability, because these functions are easy to understand and if they are pure, it's often sufficient to look at the type signature to understand the purpose.</p>
<p dir="auto">The library itself also comprises many small functions, but it's admittedly harder to maintain than code that uses it. However this asymmetry is intended because it offloads complexity from users into a central component.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comparation to Idiomatic Go</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this section we discuss how the functional APIs differ from idiomatic go function signatures and how to convert back and forth.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Pure functions</h3>
<p dir="auto">Pure functions are functions that take input parameters and that compute an output without changing any global state and without mutating the input parameters. They will always return the same output for the same input.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Without Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your pure function does not return an error, the idiomatic signature is just fine and no changes are required.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">With Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your pure function can return an error, then it will have a <code>(T, error)</code> return value in idiomatic go. In functional style the return value is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/either" rel="nofollow">Either[error, T]</a> because function composition is easier with such a return type. Use the <code>EitherizeXXX</code> methods in <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/either" rel="nofollow">"github.com/IBM/fp-go/either"</a> to convert from idiomatic to functional style and <code>UneitherizeXXX</code> to convert from functional to idiomatic style.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Effectful functions</h3>
<p dir="auto">An effectful function (or function with a side effect) is one that changes data outside the scope of the function or that does not always produce the same output for the same input (because it depends on some external, mutable state). There is no special way in idiomatic go to identify such a function other than documentation. In functional style we represent them as functions that do not take an input but that produce an output. The base type for these functions is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/io" rel="nofollow">IO[T]</a> because in many cases such functions represent <code>I/O</code> operations.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Without Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your effectful function does not return an error, the functional signature is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/io" rel="nofollow">IO[T]</a></p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">With Errors</h4>
<p dir="auto">If your effectful function can return an error, the functional signature is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither" rel="nofollow">IOEither[error, T]</a>. Use <code>EitherizeXXX</code> from <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither" rel="nofollow">"github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither"</a> to convert an idiomatic go function to functional style.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Go Context</h3>
<p dir="auto">Functions that take a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> are per definition effectful because they depend on the context parameter that is designed to be mutable (it can e.g. be used to cancel a running operation). Furthermore in idiomatic go the parameter is typically passed as the first parameter to a function.</p>
<p dir="auto">In functional style we isolate the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> and represent the nature of the effectful function as an <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/ioeither" rel="nofollow">IOEither[error, T]</a>. The resulting type is <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/context/readerioeither" rel="nofollow">ReaderIOEither[T]</a>, a function taking a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> that returns a function without parameters returning an <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/either" rel="nofollow">Either[error, T]</a>. Use the <code>EitherizeXXX</code> methods from <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/IBM/fp-go/context/readerioeither" rel="nofollow">"github.com/IBM/fp-go/context/readerioeither"</a> to convert an idiomatic go function with a <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/context" rel="nofollow">context</a> to functional style.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Implementation Notes</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Generics</h3>
<p dir="auto">All monadic operations are implemented via generics, i.e. they offer a type safe way to compose operations. This allows for convenient IDE support and also gives confidence about the correctness of the composition at compile time.</p>
<p dir="auto">Downside is that this will result in different versions of each operation per type, these versions are generated by the golang compiler at build time (unlike type erasure in languages such as Java of TypeScript). This might lead to large binaries for codebases with many different types. If this is a concern, you can always implement type erasure on top, i.e. use the monadic operations with the <code>any</code> type as if generics were not supported. You loose type safety, but this might result in smaller binaries.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ordering of Generic Type Parameters</h3>
<p dir="auto">In go we need to specify all type parameters of a function on the global function definition, even if the function returns a higher order function and some of the type parameters are only applicable to the higher order function. So the following is not possible:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[A, B any](f func(A) B) [R, E any]func(fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) [<span>R</span>, <span>E</span> <span>any</span>]<span>func</span>(<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Note that the parameters <code>R</code> and <code>E</code> are not needed by the first level of <code>Map</code> but only by the resulting higher order function. Instead we need to specify the following:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[R, E, A, B any](f func(A) B) func(fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">which overspecifies <code>Map</code> on the global scope. As a result the go compiler will not be able to auto-detect these parameters, it can only auto detect <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> since they appear in the argument of <code>Map</code>. We need to explicitly pass values for these type parameters when <code>Map</code> is being used.</p>
<p dir="auto">Because of this limitation the order of parameters on a function matters. We want to make sure that we define those parameters that cannot be auto-detected, first, and the parameters that can be auto-detected, last. This can lead to inconsistencies in parameter ordering, but we believe that the gain in convenience is worth it. The parameter order of <code>Ap</code> is e.g. different from that of <code>Map</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Ap[B, R, E, A any](fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) func(fab ReaderIOEither[R, E, func(A) B]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Ap</span>[<span>B</span>, <span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span> <span>any</span>](<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>func</span>(<span>fab</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">because <code>R</code>, <code>E</code> and <code>A</code> can be determined from the argument to <code>Ap</code> but <code>B</code> cannot.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Use of the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/47781-parameterized-go-ast.md" rel="nofollow">~ Operator</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">The FP library attempts to be easy to consume and one aspect of this is the definition of higher level type definitions instead of having to use their low level equivalent. It is e.g. more convenient and readable to use</p>

<p dir="auto">than</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func(R) func() Either.Either[E, A]"><pre><span>func</span>(<span>R</span>) <span>func</span>() Either.<span>Either</span>[<span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">although both are logically equivalent. At the time of this writing the go type system does not support generic type aliases, only generic type definition, i.e. it is not possible to write:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type ReaderIOEither[R, E, A any] = RD.Reader[R, IOE.IOEither[E, A]]"><pre><span>type</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span> <span>any</span>] <span>=</span> RD.<span>Reader</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>IOE</span>.<span>IOEither</span>[<span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">only</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="type ReaderIOEither[R, E, A any] RD.Reader[R, IOE.IOEither[E, A]]"><pre><span>type</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span> <span>any</span>] RD.<span>Reader</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>IOE</span>.<span>IOEither</span>[<span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This makes a big difference, because in the second case the type <code>ReaderIOEither[R, E, A any]</code> is considered a completely new type, not compatible to its right hand side, so it's not just a shortcut but a fully new type.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the implementation perspective however there is no reason to restrict the implementation to the new type, it can be generic for all compatible types. The way to express this in go is the <a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/47781-parameterized-go-ast.md" rel="nofollow">~</a> operator. This comes with some quite complicated type declarations in some cases, which undermines the goal of the library to be easy to use.</p>
<p dir="auto">For that reason there exist sub-packages called <code>Generic</code> for all higher level types. These packages contain the fully generic implementation of the operations, preferring abstraction over usability. These packages are not meant to be used by end-users but are meant to be used by library extensions. The implementation for the convenient higher level types specializes the generic implementation for the particular higher level type, i.e. this layer does not contain any business logic but only <em>type magic</em>.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Higher Kinded Types</h3>
<p dir="auto">Go does not support higher kinded types (HKT). Such types occur if a generic type itself is parametrized by another generic type. Example:</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>Map</code> operation for <code>ReaderIOEither</code> is defined as:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[R, E, A, B any](f func(A) B) func(fa ReaderIOEither[R, E, A]) ReaderIOEither[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>fa</span> <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>ReaderIOEither</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">and in fact the equivalent operations for all other mondas follow the same pattern, we could try to introduce a new type for <code>ReaderIOEither</code> (without a parameter) as a HKT, e.g. like so (made-up syntax, does not work in go):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="func Map[HKT, R, E, A, B any](f func(A) B) func(HKT[R, E, A]) HKT[R, E, B]"><pre><span>func</span> <span>Map</span>[<span>HKT</span>, <span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>, <span>B</span> <span>any</span>](<span>f</span> <span>func</span>(<span>A</span>) <span>B</span>) <span>func</span>(<span>HKT</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>A</span>]) <span>HKT</span>[<span>R</span>, <span>E</span>, <span>B</span>]</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">this would be the completely generic method signature for all possible monads. In particular in many cases it is possible to compose functions independent of the concrete knowledge of the actual <code>HKT</code>. From the perspective of a library this is the ideal situation because then a particular algorithm only has to be implemented and tested once.</p>
<p dir="auto">This FP library addresses this by introducing the HKTs as individual types, e.g. <code>HKT[A]</code> would be represented as a new generic type <code>HKTA</code>. This loses the correlation to the type <code>A</code> but allows to implement generic algorithms, at the price of readability.</p>
<p dir="auto">For that reason these implementations are kept in the <code>internal</code> package. These are meant to be used by the library itself or by extensions, not by end users.</p>

<p>
The Python global interpreter lock (GIL) has long been a barrier to
increasing the performance of programs by using multiple threads—the GIL
serializes access to the interpreter's virtual machine such that only one thread
can be executing Python code at any given time.  There are other mechanisms
to provide 
concurrency for the language, but the specter of the GIL—and its reality as
well—have often been cited as a major negative for Python.  Back in October
2021, Sam Gross <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/python-dev/CAGr09bSrMNyVNLTvFq-h6t38kTxqTXfgxJYApmbEWnT71L74-g@mail.gmail.com/">introduced</a>
a <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/872869/">proof-of-concept, no-GIL version of the
language</a>. It was met with a lot of excitement at the time, but
seemed to languish to a certain extent for more than a year; now, the Python
Steering 
Council has <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/939568/">announced its intent to accept the
no-GIL feature</a>.  It will still be some time before it lands in a
released Python version—and there is the possibility that it all has to be
rolled back at some point—but there are several companies backing the
effort, which gives it all a good chance to succeed.
</p>

<p>
After its introduction in&nbsp;2021, and the discussion around that, the next public
appearance for the feature was at the <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_01678898482.html">2022
Python Language Summit</a> in April. Gross gave a <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit-python_11.html">talk</a> about
his <a href="https://github.com/colesbury/nogil">no-GIL fork</a> in the
hopes of getting some tacit agreement on proceeding with the work.  That
agreement 
was not forthcoming, in part because the full details and implications of
a no-GIL interpreter were not really known.
Meanwhile, the Faster CPython project, which <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/857754/">came about in mid-2021</a> had been working along
on its plan to increase the <i>single-threaded</i> performance of the
interpreter. 
Mark Shannon <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2022/05/the-2022-python-language-summit_2.html">reported
on the status of that effort</a> at the&nbsp;2022 summit as well.  He also
authored <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/">PEP&nbsp;659</a>
("Specialized Adaptive Interpreter") that describes the kinds of changes
being made, some of which have found their way into Python&nbsp;3.10
and&nbsp;3.11. 
</p>

<p>
At this year's PyCon, two of the Faster CPython team gave talks describing
the techniques they have been using to improve the performance of the
interpreter: Brandt Bucher <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/930705/">looked at adaptive
instructions</a>, while Shannon  <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/931197/">described memory layout improvements and other
optimizations</a>. 
Given the GIL, nearly all existing Python
programs are single threaded, so improving the performance of
those programs will effectively speed up the entire Python world.  One of
the concerns that has been heard about no-GIL Python is what its impact on
single-threaded programs would be.
</p>

<h4>PEP 703</h4>

<p>
In January 2023, Łukasz Langa <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606">posted</a>
the first version of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/">PEP&nbsp;703</a> ("Making the
Global Interpreter Lock Optional in CPython") that is authored by Gross;
Langa is sponsoring the PEP 
as a core developer.  As might be guessed, that set off a lengthy thread,
with, once again, a lot of excitement.  There were also some concerns expressed
with regard to the implications of not having a GIL, especially for Python
extensions written in C; since the GIL protects that code from 
many concurrency problems, removing it might well lead to bugs. 
</p> 

<p>
One
thing that everyone wants to avoid is another "flag day" transition like
that of Python&nbsp;2 to&nbsp;3.  The huge and unfortunate impact of
Python&nbsp;3 being incompatible with its predecessor was not foreseen—the
core developers vastly underestimated the growing popularity of the
language, for one thing—but that mistake will not be repeated.  Any switch
to remove the GIL will need to smoothly work with code that is not (yet)
ready for it.
</p>

<p>
There was a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/25">question</a>
from Shannon about "<q>what people think is a acceptable slowdown for
single-threaded code</q>".  To a large extent, that question went
unanswered in the thread, but he had estimated an impact "<q>in the 15-20%
range, but it could be more, depending on the impact on PEP 659</q>".
</p>

<p>
Another Faster CPython team member, Eric Snow, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/84">posted</a>
a lengthy analysis with a bunch of questions, which he summarized as:
"<q>tl;dr I'm really excited by this proposal but have significant
concerns, which I genuinely hope the PEP can address.</q>"  He noted that
he was the author of a "competing" concurrency option in <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0684/">PEP&nbsp;684</a> ("A
Per-Interpreter GIL"), along with the related <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0683/">PEP&nbsp;683</a> ("Immortal
Objects, Using a Fixed Refcount"), though he does not truly see multiple
sub-interpreters, each with their own GIL, as being incompatible with the
no-GIL work.  Much of his concern was focused on the impacts on the C
extensions (which is also a problem for PEP&nbsp;684, though to a lesser
extent), but single-threaded performance was also mentioned.  Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/97">replied</a>
that the impact on the extensions was not completely negative:
</p><blockquote>
There are also substantial benefits to extension module maintainers. The
PEP includes quotes from a number of maintainers of widely used C API
extensions who suffer the complexity of working around the GIL. For
example, Zachary DeVito, PyTorch core developer, wrote "On three separate
occasions in the past couple of months… I spent an order-of-magnitude more
time figuring out how to work around GIL limitations than actually solving
the particular problem." 
</blockquote>


<h4>Updated PEP</h4>

<p>
The thread had mostly run its course by the end of January.
In early May, Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503">posted</a>
an updated version of PEP&nbsp;703, along with an <a href="https://github.com/colesbury/nogil-3.12">implementation based on the
in-progress Python&nbsp;3.12</a>.  There was just one <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/2">response</a>
early on 
(which Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/3">replied
to</a>).  On May&nbsp;12, Gross <a href="https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/188">asked the
steering council to decide on the PEP</a>.  As it turned out, there was
still a lot more discussion to go before any decision would be made.
</p>

<p>
On June 2, Shannon <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/9">posted
a performance assessment</a> of the PEP with some pretty eye-opening
numbers (that were disputed) on the impact of the changes; his estimates
of the impact ranged from&nbsp;11 to&nbsp;30%.
He also noted that removing the GIL had some negative impacts on the
existing and planned Faster CPython work:
</p><blockquote>
The adaptive specializing interpreter relies on the GIL; it is not
thread-friendly. 
If NoGIL is accepted, then some redesign of our optimization strategy will
be necessary. 
While this is perfectly possible, it does have a cost.
The effort spent on this redesign and resulting implementation is not being
spent on actual optimizations. 
</blockquote>


<p>
Shannon has noted that he is not a fan of the free-threading, shared-memory
concurrency model; his assessment ends with a suggestion that
sub-interpreters provide a better concurrency solution with fewer of the
performance and other concerns that no-GIL brings.  Others, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/13">including
steering council member Gregory P. Smith</a> found that analysis to be
somewhat oversimplified.  Langa <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/17">posted
benchmark numbers</a> that showed considerably less impact than Shannon's
estimates. Langa <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/18">followed
that up</a> with some additional results that correspond closely with what
Gross had reported in the PEP.
</p>

<p>
Guido van Rossum, who  heads up the Faster CPython team, wanted to
ensure that everyone 
learned from the mistakes made in the past:
</p><blockquote>
If there's one lesson we've learned from the Python 2 to 3 transition, it's
that it would have been very beneficial if Python 2 and 3 code could
<i>coexist</i> in the same Python interpreter. We blew it that time, and it
set us 
back by about a decade. 
<p>
Let's not blow it this time. If we're going forward with nogil (and I'm not
saying we are, but I can't exclude it), let's make sure there is a way to
be able to import extensions requiring the GIL in a nogil interpreter
without any additional shenanigans – neither the application code nor the
extension module should have to be modified in any way [...]
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Meanwhile, Smith replied to Gross's steering-council request (and <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/20">copied
it to the forum thread</a>): 
</p><blockquote>
The steering council is going to take its time on this. A huge thank you
for working to keep it up to date! We're not ready to simply pronounce on
703 as it has a HUGE blast radius. 
<p>
[...] That does not mean "no" to this. There is demand for it. (<i>personally,
I've wanted this since forever!</i>) It's just that it won't be easy and we'll
need to consider the entire ecosystem and how to smoothly allow such a
change to happen without breaking the world. 
</p><p>
I'm glad to see the continued discuss thread with faster-cpython folks in
particular piping up. The intersection between this work and ongoing single
threaded performance improvements will always be high and we don't want to
hamper that in the near term. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Gross <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/28">largely
disagreed</a> with Shannon's assessment and, in particular, with his
characterization of threading.  He was also, seemingly, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/43">somewhat
unhappy</a> with Smith's reply:
</p><blockquote>
You wrote that the Steering Council's decision does not mean "no," but the
steering council has not set a bar for acceptance, stated what evidence is
actually needed, nor said when a final decision will be made. Given the
expressed demand for PEP 703, it makes sense to me 
for the steering committee to develop a timeline for identifying the
factors it may need to consider and for determining the steps that would be
required for the change to happen smoothly. 
<p>
Without these timelines and milestones in place, I would like to explain
that the effect of the Steering Council's answer is a "no" in practice. I
have been funded to work on this for the past few years with the milestone
of submitting the PEP along with a comprehensive implementation to convince
the Python community. Without specific concerns or a clear bar for
acceptance, I (and my funding organization) will have to treat the current
decision-in-limbo as a "no" and will be unable to pursue the PEP further. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
That obviously put pressure on the council, as did the users who were
clamoring for a no-GIL Python, but the decision is clearly not a simple
one.  On June&nbsp;14, more pressure was applied from the Faster CPython
team.  Van Rossum <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-3-12-updates/26503/118">described</a>
some of
the costs of no-GIL, but also expressed concern about waiting for a
decision:
</p><blockquote>
We've had a group discussion about how our work would be affected by free
threading. Our key conclusion is that merging nogil will set back our
current results by a significant amount of time, and in addition will
reduce our velocity in the future. We don't see this as a reason to reject
nogil – it's just a new set of problems we would have to overcome, and we
expect that our ultimate design would be quite different as a result. But
there is a significant cost, and it's not a one-time cost. We could use
help from someone (Sam?) who has experience thinking about the problems
posed by the new environment. 
<p>
[...] In the meantime we're treading water, unsure whether to put our
efforts in continuing with the current plan, or in designing a new,
thread-safe optimization architecture. 
</p></blockquote>


<h4>Fast, free threading</h4>

<p>
The next day, Shannon <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903">started
a new thread</a> (titled: "A fast, free threading Python") that described
three possible options for a way forward.  It started with a lengthy
description of the tradeoffs for optimization of a dynamic language like
Python. Of the three aspects that he thinks need to be considered,
single-threaded performance, parallelism, and mutability, the last has
mostly been glossed over in earlier discussions, "<q>but it is key</q>":
</p><blockquote>
It isn't quite:
<blockquote>
    Performance, parallelism, mutability: pick two.
</blockquote>
but more like:
<blockquote>
    Performance, parallelism, mutability: pick one to restrict.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>
He also cautioned that there are some unknowns:
</p><blockquote>
Performing the optimizations necessary to make Python fast in a
free-threading environment will need some original research. That makes it
more costly and a lot more risky. 
</blockquote>


<p>
The options for the steering council amount to choosing a fast
single-threaded interpreter as currently planned, a no-GIL free-threading
interpreter with an unknown (but non-zero) impact on single-threaded
performance, or both at the same time.  His preference is for both,
but he is concerned that the council might choose no-GIL without also
committing to the rest of the work needed:
</p><blockquote>
Please don't choose option 2 [no-GIL] hoping that we will get option 3
[both], because 
"someone will sort out the performance issue". They won't, unless the
resources are there. 
<p>
If we must choose option 1 [current Faster CPython plans] or 2, then I
think it has to be option 1. 
It gives us a speedup at much lower cost in CPUs and energy,
by doing things more efficiently rather than just throwing lots of cores at
the problem. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Marc-André Lemburg <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/2">asked</a>
about a phased approach, where, effectively, GIL or no-GIL were chosen at
the command line; over time, the two could slowly be merged. "<q>Or would
this not be feasible because the 'slow merge' would actually require
redesigning the whole specialization approach?</q>"  Smith <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/30">replied</a> 
that he thinks that is more or less what PEP&nbsp;703 is proposing; even
though Shannon basically recommended against it, Smith thinks pursuing
both at once is possible:
</p><blockquote>
I'd more or less expect work on specialization for to proceed in parallel
without worrying if those benefits cannot yet be available in a free
threaded build for a few of releases. Turning it mostly into an additional
code maintenance and test matrix burden on the CPython core dev side to
keep both our still-primary single threaded GIL based interpreter and the
experimental free threaded build working. 
<p>
I figure this is basically exactly what Mark claims <i>not</i> to
want. Presumably 
due to the interim added build and maintenance complexity. But also seems
like the most likely way to get to his "both" option 3 that I suspect we
all <i>magically wish would just happen</i>. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Smith <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/31">followed
that up</a> by noting that free threading will need to addressed at some
point; even if the Faster CPython plans work out and Python&nbsp;3.15 is
five times faster than Python&nbsp;3.10, nobody will "<q>be satisfied at 'just
5x' in the end</q>".   Van Rossum <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/34">agreed</a>,
but was also concerned that the council "<q>might be betting on hope as a
strategy</q>" by choosing no-GIL and hoping for the best.
</p><blockquote>
Like Mark, I hope that you're choosing (3) – like Mark says, it's clearly
the best option. But we will need to be honest about it, and accept that we
need more resources to improve single-threaded performance. (And, as I
believe someone already pointed out, it will also be harder to do future
maintenance on CPython's C code, since so much of it is now exposed to
potential race conditions. This is a problem for a language that's for a
large part maintained by volunteers.) 
</blockquote>


<p>
The talk of "more resources" led Itamar Oren to 
<a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/41">wonder</a>
what that means: "<q>It's not clear to me to what extent the SC
[steering council] is in a position to tie PEP acceptance or rejection to
allocation of funding.</q>"  Van Rossum <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/45">replied</a>
that Microsoft was committed to continue funding the team and that "<q>our
charter 
is not limited to single-threaded performance work</q>", but that there is
extra work to do in a no-GIL world:
</p><blockquote>
Meanwhile, we can start adapting the specialization and optimization work
to a no-GIL world, with the goal of obtaining Mark's Option 3 (free
threading and faster per-thread performance). Ideally we would reach a
state where we can make no-GIL the one and only build mode without a drop
in single-threaded performance (important for apps that haven't been
re-architected, e.g. apps that currently use multi-processing, or
algorithms that are hard to parallelize). 
<p>
It is this latter step (getting to Option 3) that requires extra resources
– for example, it would be great if Meta or another tech company could
spare some engineers with established CPython internals experience to help
the core dev team with this work.
</p><p>
Finally, I want to re-emphasize that while Microsoft has a team using the
Faster CPython moniker, we don't intend to own CPython performance – we
believe in good citizenship and want to contribute in a way that puts our
skills and experience to the best possible use for the Python community. 
</p></blockquote>


<p>
Van Rossum did not just choose Meta out of a hat, here; Gross works for the
company, which presumably funded his no-GIL work, and the <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/cinder">Cinder</a> CPython fork
is maintained by a team at Meta.  Carl Meyer <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/46">said</a>
that he expected the Cinder team to work on no-GIL Python.  In fact, on
July&nbsp;7, Meyer <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-fast-free-threading-python/27903/99">announced</a>
that Meta would fund work on the no-GIL interpreter:
</p><blockquote>
If PEP 703 is accepted, Meta can commit to support in the form of three
engineer-years (from engineers experienced working in CPython internals)
between the acceptance of PEP 703 and the end of 2025, to collaborate with
the core dev team on landing the PEP 703 implementation smoothly in CPython
and on ongoing improvements to the compatibility and performance of nogil
CPython. 
</blockquote>


<p>
On July 19, Anaconda <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional/22606/121">followed
suit</a>. Stan Seibert said that the company would fund work on the
"<q>packaging challenges that will be associated with adopting PEP 703,
including any work on pip, cibuildwheel, and conda-forge that will be
needed to get nogil-compatible packages into the hands of the Python
community</q>".  Some of that funding commitment likely helped the council
reach a verdict, but the results of a <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/poll-feedback-to-the-sc-on-making-cpython-free-threaded-and-pep-703/28540">core-developer
poll on no-GIL</a> also pushed the council in the direction of accepting the
PEP.   That poll showed 87% of 46 voters thought that free-threaded Python
should be actively pursued and 63% of 38 voters said that they were willing
to help support and maintain a no-GIL Python based on PEP&nbsp;703.
</p>

<h4>Steering council decision</h4>

<p>
On July 28, council member Thomas Wouters <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/a-steering-council-notice-about-pep-703-making-the-global-interpreter-lock-optional-in-cpython/30474">announced</a>
that the council would be accepting PEP&nbsp;703, though it was "<q>still
working on the acceptance details</q>".  The idea would be to introduce the
no-GIL version of the interpreter in order to give everyone a chance to
figure out what pieces are missing, so that they can be filled in before
no-GIL becomes the default and, eventually, the only, version of Python.
The time frame for that transition is estimated to be around five years,
but there will be no repeat of earlier mistakes:
</p><blockquote>
We do not want another Python 3 situation, so any changes in third-party
code needed to accommodate no-GIL builds should just work in with-GIL
builds (although backward compatibility with older Python versions will
still need to be addressed). This is not Python 4. We are still considering
the requirements we want to place on ABI compatibility and other details
for the two builds and the effect on backward compatibility. 
</blockquote>


<p>
As was noted in the various discussions, there is more to removing the GIL
than simply adopting a PEP.  Wouters made it clear that the core developers
will need to gain experience with no-GIL Python so that they can lead the
rest of the community:
</p><blockquote>
We will probably need to figure out new C APIs and Python APIs as we sort
out thread safety in existing code. We also need to bring along the rest of
the Python community as we gain those insights and make sure the changes we
want to make, and the changes we want them to make, are palatable. 
</blockquote>


<p>
If the Python community finds that the switch is "<q>just
going to be too disruptive for too little gain</q>", the council wants to
be able to change its mind anytime before declaring no-GIL as the default
mode for the language.  He outlined the steps that the council sees,
starting with a short-term (perhaps for Python&nbsp;3.13, which is due in
October 2024) experimental no-GIL build of the interpreter that core
developers and others can try out.  In the medium term, no-GIL would be a
supported option, but not the default; when that happens depends a lot on
how quickly the community adopts and supports the no-GIL build.  In the
long term, 
no-GIL would be the default build and the GIL would be completely excised
("<q>without unnecessarily breaking backward compatibility</q>").   Along
the way, periodic reviews will be needed:
</p><blockquote>
Throughout the process we (the core devs, not just the SC) will need to
re-evaluate the progress and the suggested timelines. We don't want this to
turn into another ten year backward compatibility struggle, and we want to
be able to call off PEP 703 and find another solution if it looks to become
problematic, and so we need to regularly check that the continued work is
worth it. 
</blockquote>


<p>
As might be guessed, that spawned multiple congratulatory and
excited-for-the-future responses, though there are a few who think that
keeping the GIL would be a better choice for the language.  The
announcement presumably 
also sent the Faster CPython folks back to their drawing boards; though
there were some accusations of turf wars in the discussions, that did not
really seem to be the case.  The Faster CPython team simply wanted to
ensure that all of the costs were taken into consideration;  overall, the
team seems quite excited to work on surmounting the challenges of producing
a no-GIL 
interpreter, with minimal (or, ideally, no) performance impact on
single-threaded 
code.
</p>

<p>
It is quite a turning point in the history of the language, but the work is
(obviously) not done yet.  There is a huge amount of researching, coding,
testing, experimenting,
documenting, and so on between here and a no-GIL-only version of the language
in, say, Python&nbsp;3.17 in October&nbsp;2028. One guesses that the work
will not be done, then, either—there will be more optimizations to be
found and applied if there is still funding available to do so.
Meanwhile, we have yet to dig into the details of the PEP itself; that will
come soon. We will be keeping an eye on the no-GIL development process as
it plays 
out over the coming years as well.

Five years later, here we go again. </p><p> Before the delisting, EQT Private Equity plans to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to SUSE’s remaining shareholders. Marcel has committed to pay a price of EUR 16.00 per SUSE share, less the gross amount per share of an interim dividend paid by SUSE. This represents a 67% premium on SUSE’s closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023. </p><p> Both SUSE’s Management and Supervisory Boards have expressed support for the strategic opportunity presented by this delisting. They believe that it will enable SUSE to concentrate on its operational priorities and the execution of its long-term strategy without the pressure of public markets. </p><p> To facilitate the transaction, SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel, which includes provisions for paying the interim dividend. This interim dividend, to be paid to all shareholders before the settlement of the offer, will assist Marcel in financing its purchase of SUSE shares under the offer and covering specific transaction costs. </p><p> “The strategic opportunity of taking the company private gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “Our partnership with EQT Private Equity in a private setting has been fruitful before, and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration.” </p><p> The offer document will be published by Marcel soon, initiating an acceptance period of at least four weeks. Settlement of the offer is anticipated to occur in the first half of October 2023. Subsequently, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE is expected to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023. Afterward, the company will be taken private. </p><p> Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE is committed to declaring and paying an interim dividend to all shareholders, regardless of whether they accept the offer. This dividend will be funded through a combination of SUSE’s existing cash and additional borrowing, which is not expected to exceed EUR 500 million. </p><p> There is, however, no obligation for shareholders to accept the offer. EQT Private Equity assures stock owners that it won't pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders desiring to remain invested in SUSE in its new private setting will have the option to do so. </p><p> As usual, this transaction is subject to various conditions, including receipt by Marcel of an interim dividend for the SUSE shares held by it, which must be sufficient to fund the offer price for all tendered SUSE shares and certain transaction costs. </p><p> Considering the nature of the deal and Marcel's dominating stock position, I've no doubt this deal will go through. What that will mean for SUSE remains to be seen. I will say, though, that SUSE manages to keep going despite one ownership and management change after another. I'm sure it will make it through this one too. </p><p><span><b>Noteworthy Linux and open-source stories:</b></span></p><div><ul><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.36u8QeHTpms79eRxuzldUGjekXgqZX43BE6CK926niI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">New CrossOver 23 out for better Windows gameplay on MacOS, ChromeOS, and Linux</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.fRcjTQH7H0GScCXWH8-0F_qDYl-E7NFNW9-wgvBGvMU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">HashiCorp Abandons Open Source for Business Source License</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.wKzq21AH1HBh4UQCvtoESpg5V81wvizO94wN5BeCTpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">AMD and Intel CPU security bugs bring Linux patches</a></p></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>
      
      Oxalate nephropathy is an uncommon condition that causes acute kidney injury with the potential for progression to end-stage renal disease. Diagnosis is based on the kidney biopsy findings of abundant polarizable calcium oxalate crystals in the epithelium and lumen of renal tubules. We report a case of acute oxalate nephropathy in a 65-year-old woman, temporally associated with the consumption of an oxalate-rich green smoothie juice "cleanse" prepared from juicing oxalate-rich green leafy vegetables and fruits. Predisposing factors included a remote history of gastric bypass and recent prolonged antibiotic therapy. She had normal kidney function before using the cleanse and developed acute kidney injury that progressed to end-stage renal disease. Consumption of such juice cleanses increases oxalate absorption, causing hyperoxaluria and acute oxalate nephropathy in patients with predisposing risk factors. Given the increasing popularity of juice cleanses, it is important that both patients and physicians have greater awareness of the potential for acute oxalate nephropathy in susceptible individuals with risk factors such as chronic kidney disease, gastric bypass, and antibiotic use.

                    manipulate arbitrary objects in diverse settings has been a distant goal for several decades. This
                    is in-part because of the paucity of diverse robotics datasets to train such agents, at the same
                    time absence of generic agents than can generate such dataset.

                    <h2> RoboSet: Diverse multi-skill multi-task multi-modal dataset</h2>

                    <p>
                        Building a robotic agent that can generalize to many different scenarios requires a dataset with broad coverage. With the recognition that scaling efforts will generally help (e.g. <a href="https://robotics-transformer1.github.io/">RT-1</a> presents results with ~130,000 robot trajectories), our goal is to understand the principles of <strong> efficiency </strong> and <strong> generalization</strong> in learning system under a <strong>data budget</strong>. Low data regimes often results in over-fitting. Our main aim is to thus develop a powerful paradigms that can learn a generalizable universal policy while avoiding overfitting in this low-data regime.

                    <p>
                        The dataset <strong>RoboSet(MT-ACT)</strong> used for training RoboAgent consists of merely 7,500 trajectories (18x less data than RT1). The dataset was collected ahead of time, and was kept frozen. It consists of high quality (mostly successful) trajectories collected using human teleoperation on commodity robotics hardware (<a href="https://www.franka.de/">Franka-Emika robots</a> with <a href="https://robotiq.com/products/2f85-140-adaptive-robot-gripper">Robotiq gripper</a>) across multiple tasks and scenes.

                        RoboSet(MT-ACT) <strong>sparsely</strong> covers 12 unique skills in a few different contexts. It was collected by dividing everyday kitchen activities (e.g. making tea, baking) into different sub-tasks, each representing a unique skill. The dataset includes common pick-place skills but also includes contact-rich skills such as <em>wipe, cap</em> as well as skills involving articulated objects.

                        In addition to the RoboSet(MT-ACT) we use for training RoboAgent, we are also releasing <a href="https://robopen.github.io/robopen.github.io/roboset">RoboSet</a> a much larger dataset collected over the course of a few related project containing a total of 100,050 trajectories, including non-kitchen scenes. <strong>We are open-sourcing our entire <a href="https://robopen.github.io/robopen.github.io/roboset">RoboSet</a></strong> to facilitate and accelerate open-source research in robot-learning.

                    <h2> MT-ACT: Multi-Task Action Chunking Transformer</h2>

                    <div><p>
                        RoboAgent builds on two critical insights to learn generalizable policies in low-data regimes. It leverages world priors from foundation models to avoid mode collapse and a novel efficient policy representations capable of ingesting highly multi-modal data.
                        </p><ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Semantic Augmentations:</strong> RoboAgent injects world priors from existing foundation models by creating semantic augmentations of the RoboSet(MT-ACT). The resulting dataset multiplies robots experiences with world priors at no extra human/robot cost. We use <a href="https://segment-anything.com/">SAM</a> to segment target objects and semantically augment them to different objects with shape, color, texture variations.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Efficient Policy Representation:</strong> The resulting dataset is heavily multi-modal and contains a rich diversity of skills, tasks, and scenarios. We adapt <a href="https://tonyzhaozh.github.io/aloha/">action-chunking</a> to multi-task settings to develop <strong>MT-ACT</strong> -- a novel efficient policy representation that can ingest highly multi-modal dataset while avoiding over-fitting in low data budget settings.

                                Figure on the right compares our proposed MT-ACT policy representation against several imitation learning architectures. For this result we use environment variations that include object pose changes and some lighting changes only. Somewhat similar to previous works, we refer to this as L1-generalization. From our results we can clearly see that using action-chunking to model sub-trajectories significantly outperforms all baselines, thereby reinforcing the effectiveness of our proposed policy representation for sample efficient learning.

                                We visualize levels of generalization, L1 with object pose changes, L2
                                with diverse table backgrounds and distractors and L3 with novel skill-object
                                combinations. Next we show how each method performs on these levels of generalization. In a rigorous evaluation study under, we observe that MT-ACT significantly outperforms all other
                                methods especially on harder generalization levels (L3).

                                Next we evaluate how RoboAgent performs with increasing levels of semantic augmentations.
                                We evaluate this on one activity (5-skills). Below figure shows that with increased data
                                (i.e. more augmentations per frame)
                                the performance significantly improves across all generalization levels. Importantly,
                                the performance increase is much larger for the harder tasks (L3 generalization).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The artificial intelligence platform ChatGPT shows a significant and systemic left-wing bias, according to a new study by the University of East Anglia (UEA).</p><div><p> The team of researchers in the UK and Brazil developed a rigorous new method to check for political bias.</p><p>  Published today in the journal Public Choice, the findings show that ChatGPT’s responses favour the Democrats in the US, the Labour Party in the UK, and in Brazil President Lula da Silva of the Workers’ Party.</p><p>  Concerns of an inbuilt political bias in ChatGPT have been raised previously but this is the first largescale study using a consistent, evidenced-based analysis.</p><p>  Lead author <a href="https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/fabio-motoki" target="_blank">Dr Fabio Motoki</a>, of <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/norwich-business-school" target="_blank">Norwich Business School</a> at the University of East Anglia, said: “With the growing use by the public of AI-powered systems to find out facts and create new content, it is important that the output of popular platforms such as ChatGPT is as impartial as possible.</p><p>  “The presence of political bias can influence user views and has potential implications for political and electoral processes.</p><p>  “Our findings reinforce concerns that AI systems could replicate, or even amplify, existing challenges posed by the Internet and social media.”</p><p>  The researchers developed an innovative new method to test for ChatGPT’s political neutrality.</p><p>  The platform was asked to impersonate individuals from across the political spectrum while answering a series of more than 60 ideological questions.</p><p>  The responses were then compared with the platform’s default answers to the same set of questions – allowing the researchers to measure the degree to which ChatGPT’s responses were associated with a particular political stance.</p><p>  To overcome difficulties caused by the inherent randomness of ‘large language models’ that power AI platforms such as ChatGPT, each question was asked 100 times and the different responses collected. These multiple responses were then put through a 1000-repetition ‘bootstrap’ (a method of re-sampling the original data) to further increase the reliability of the inferences drawn from the generated text.</p><p>  “We created this procedure because conducting a single round of testing is not enough,” said co-author Victor Rodrigues. “Due to the model’s randomness, even when impersonating a Democrat, sometimes ChatGPT answers would lean towards the right of the political spectrum.”</p><p>  A number of further tests were undertaken to ensure the method was as rigorous as possible. In a ‘dose-response test’ ChatGPT was asked to impersonate radical political positions. In a ‘placebo test’ it was asked politically-neutral questions. And in a ‘profession-politics alignment test’ it was asked to impersonate different types of professionals.</p><p>  “We hope that our method will aid scrutiny and regulation of these rapidly developing technologies,” said co-author Dr Pinho Neto. “By enabling the detection and correction of LLM biases, we aim to promote transparency, accountability, and public trust in this technology,” he added.</p><p>  The unique new analysis tool created by the project would be freely available and relatively simple for members of the public to use, thereby “democratising oversight,” said Dr Motoki. As well as checking for political bias, the tool can be used to measure other types of biases in ChatGPT’s responses.</p><p>  While the research project did not set out to determine the reasons for the political bias, the findings did point towards two potential sources.</p><p>  The first was the training dataset – which may have biases within it, or added to it by the human developers, which the developers’ ‘cleaning’ procedure had failed to remove. The second potential source was the algorithm itself, which may be amplifying existing biases in the training data.</p><p>  The research was undertaken by Dr Fabio Motoki (Norwich Business School, University of East Anglia), Dr Valdemar Pinho Neto (EPGE Brazilian School of Economics and Finance - FGV EPGE, and Center for Empirical Studies in Economics - FGV CESE), and Victor Rodrigues (Nova Educação).</p><p>  ‘More Human than Human: Measuring ChatGPT Political Bias’ is published by Public Choice.&nbsp;</p><p>  This publication is based on research carried out in Spring 2023 using version 3.5 of ChatGPT and questions devised by The Political Compass.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>This is based on an internal quip doc I wrote up about careful communication in the context of rebuilding trust. I got a couple requests to turn it into a blog post for sharing purposes; here you go.🌈✨🥂</p>
<p>In this doc I mention <a href="http://twitter.com/cyen">Christine</a>, my wonderful, brilliant cofounder and CEO, and the time (years ago) when our relationship had broken down completely, forcing us to rebuild our trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>(Cofounder relationships can be hard. They are a lot like marriages; in their difficulty and intensity, yes, but also in that when you’re doing it with the right person, it’s all worth it. 💜)</p>
<h3>Tips for Careful Communication</h3>
<p>When a relationship has very little trust, you tend to interpret everything someone says in the worst possible light, or you may hear hostility, contempt, or dismissiveness where none exists. On the other side of the exchange, the conversation becomes a minefield, where it feels like everything you say gets misinterpreted or turned against you no matter how careful you are trying to be. This can turn into a death spiral of trust where every interaction ends up with each of you hardening against each other a little more and filing away ever more wounds and slights. 💔</p>
<p>Yet you HAVE to communicate in order to work together! You <i>have</i> to be able to ask for things and give feedback.</p>
<p>The way trust gets rebuilt is by ✨small, positive interactions✨. If you’re in a trust hole, you can’t hear them clearly, and they can’t hear you (or your intent) clearly. So you have to bend over backwards to overcommunicate and overcompensate.</p>
<p>There are lots of books out there on how to talk about hard topics. (We actually include a copy of “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Second/dp/1469266822">Crucial Conversations</a>” in every new employee packet.) They are all pretty darn cheesy, but it’s worth reading at least one of them.</p>
<p>I’m not going to try and cover all of that territory. What follows is a very subjective list of tactics that worked for Christine and me when we were digging our way out of a massive trust deficit. Power dynamics can admittedly make things more difficult, but the mechanics are the same.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge it is hard beforehand:</h3>
<p>“I want to say something, but I am having a hard time with it.”<br>
“I have something to say, but I don’t know how you’ll take it.”<br>
“I need to tell you something and I am anxious about your reaction.”</p>
<p>What this does: forces you to slow down and be intentional about the words you’re going to use. It gives the other person a heads up that this was hard for you to say. Most of all, it shows that you <em>do care</em> about their feelings, and <em>are trying</em> to do your best for them (even if you whiff the landing).</p>
<h3>… or check in afterwards.</h3>
<p>“I’m not sure how that came across. Is there a better way I could have phrased it?”<br>
“In my head that sounded like a compliment…how did you hear it?”<br>
“Did that sound overly critical? I’m not trying to dwell on the past, but I could use your help in figuring out a better way.”</p>
<p>It’s okay if it’s minutes or hours or days later; if it’s still eating at you, ✨<i>clear the fucking air</i>.✨</p>
<h3>Speak tentatively.</h3>
<p>“Speak tentatively” is the exact opposite of the advice that people (especially women) tend to get in business. But it’s actually super helpful when the relationship is frayed because you are explicitly allowing that they may have a different perception, and making it safer to share it.</p>
<p>“From my perspective, it looks like these results might be missing some data… do you see the same thing?” opens the door for a friendly conversation based on concrete outcomes, whereas “You’re missing data” might sound accusatory and trigger fear and defensiveness.</p>
<h3>Try to sound friendly.</h3>
<p>Say “please” and “thank you” a lot. Add buffer words like “Hey there”, or “Good morning!” or “lol”. Even just using 🌱emojis🍃 will soften your response to an almost unsettling degree. This may seem almost insultingly simple, but it works. When trust is low, the lack of frills can easily be read as brusque or rude.</p>
<h3>Take a breath.</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing a physical panic response (sweating, heart racing, etc), announce that you need a few minutes before responding. Compose yourself. Firing off a reply while you are in fight-or-flight mode <em>reliably</em> leads to unintentional escalations.</p>
<p>If you need to take a few beats to read and process, <em>take the time</em>. But empty silence can also generate anxiety 🙂 so maybe say <i>something</i> to indicate “I’m listening, but I need a minute to absorb what you said”, or “I’m still processing”. (We often use “whoa…” as shorthand for this.)</p>
<p>(Alternately, if you find yourself <b>really pissed</b>, “whoa” becomes a great placeholder for yourself to get yourself under control 😬 before saying something you’ll regret having to deal with later.)</p>
<h3>“The story in my head”.</h3>
<p>When you are in a state where you are assuming the worst of someone and reading hostile intent into their words or actions, try to check yourself on those assumptions.</p>
<p>Repeat the words or behaviors back to them along with your interpretation, like: “The story in my head is that you asked me to send that status email because you don’t trust me to have done the work, or maybe even gathering evidence that I am not performing for a PIP.” This gives them the opportunity to reply and clarify what they actually meant.</p>
<h3>Engineer positive interactions, <span>even if</span> you have to invent them.</h3>
<p>Relationship experts say that there’s a magic ratio for happy, healthy relationships, which is at least<b>&nbsp;five positive interactions </b>for every<b> one negative interaction</b>. If you only interact with the people you have difficult relationships when you have something difficult to say, you are <em>always going to dread it</em>. Forever.</p>
<p>It might seem artificial at first, but look for chances to have any sort of positive interactions, and <em>seize them</em>.</p>
<h3>Communicate positive intent.</h3>
<p>In a low trust environment, you can assume everything you say will be read with a voice that is menacing, dismissive or sneering. It behooves you to pay extra attention to tone and voice, and to add extra words that overcommunicate your intended meaning. A neutral statement like “That number seems low”, or “Why is that number low?” will come out sounding brusque and accusatory, e.g. <i>why isn’t that number growing? it’s your fault, you should know this, I blame you, you’re bad at your job.</i> Not might: <i>it will</i>. Try to immunize your communication from distortion by saying things like,</p>
<p>“Hey, I know this just got dropped in your lap, but do you have any idea why this number is so low?”<br>
“This number seems lower than usual. I’m wondering if it’s due to this other thing we tried. Do you have any better ideas?”<br>
“I know it isn’t exactly in your wheel house, but can you help me understand this?”<br>
“I’m new to this system and still trying to figure out how it works. Should this number be going down like this?”</p>
<p>It may seem excessive and time consuming, but it will save you time and effort overall because you will have fewer miscommunications to debug. ☺️</p>
<h3>Give people the opening&nbsp;to do better.</h3>
<p>We tend to make up our minds about people very quickly, and see them through that lens from then on. It takes work to open our selves up again.</p>
<p>“Assume positive intent” is a laudable goal, but in practice falls short. If every word someone says sounds accusatory or patronizing to you, what are you supposed to do with that advice? Just pretend you don’t hear it, or tell yourself they mean well? That’s not sustainable; your anger will only build up.</p>
<p>But if you can hold just enough space for the idea that they <i>might</i> mean well, then you can give them the opportunity to clarify (and hopefully use different words next time). Like,</p>
<p>Person A: “Why is that number low?”<br>
Person B: “I’m not sure.”<br>
(pause)<br>
Person B: “…. Hey, sorry to interrupt, but the story in my head is that you think owning that number is part of my job, and now you’re upset with me, or you think I’m incompetent at my job.”<br>
Person A: “OMG no, not at all. I’m just trying to figure out who understands this part of the system, since it seems like none of us do! 😃 Sorry for stressing you out!”</p>
<p>and maybe next time it will start off like…</p>
<p>Person A: “Hey, do you have any idea why this number is low? It’s a mystery … nobody I’ve talked to yet seems to know.” 🙂</p>
<h3>Remember the handicaps, value the effort.</h3>
<p>Ever meet someone you didn’t like online, and realize they’re terrific in person? Online communication loses sooooo much in transit. Christine and I know each other extremely well, and <i>still</i> sometimes we realize we’re reading way too much into each other’s written words. That’s when we try to remember to move it to “mouth words”, aka zoom or phone. Not as good as in person, but eons better than text.</p>
<p>Once you’ve met someone in person, it’s usually easier to read their written words in their voice, too.</p>
<p>Some people just aren’t great at written communication. Some people have neurodiversities that make it difficult for them to hear tone. Some people have English as a second language. And so on. Do give points for effort; if they’re trying, obviously, they care about your experience.</p>
<p>To the best of your ability, try to resist reading layers of meaning into textual communication; keep it simple, overcommunicate intent, and <i>ask for clarity</i>. And if someone is asking you for clarity, <i>help them do a better job for you.</i></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LUXEMBOURG</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>SUSE®, </span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>the company behind SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE), Rancher and NeuVector and a global leader in enterprise open source solutions, is announcing that its majority shareholder </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Marcel LUX III SARL (Marcel) </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>intends to take the company private by delisting it from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange via a merger into an unlisted Luxembourg entity in the legal form of an S.A.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>Marcel</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>, a holding company that is legally controlled by fund entities of the EQT VIII fund (referred to herein, together with Marcel, as EQT Private Equity), which in turn are managed and legally controlled by affiliates of EQT AB with its registered seat in Stockholm, Sweden, holds approximately 79% of the shares in SUSE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>EQT Private Equity has announced its intention to launch a voluntary public purchase offer to the other shareholders of SUSE (Offer) to buy their shares prior to the delisting. The offer price per SUSE share to be paid by Marcel will be EUR 16.00 less the gross amount per SUSE share of an interim dividend to be paid by SUSE to all shareholders. EUR 16.00 represents a premium of approximately 67 percent on the XETRA closing share price of EUR 9.605 on 17 August 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>SUSE’s Management Board and Supervisory Board support the strategic opportunity from delisting of the company</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> as it will allow SUSE to focus fully on its operational priorities and execution of its long-term strategy. To this end SUSE has entered into a Transaction Framework Agreement (TFA) with Marcel to facilitate the transaction, including through paying the interim dividend. The interim dividend will be paid to all shareholders prior to the settlement of the Offer and will allow Marcel to finance its purchase of SUSE shares under the Offer and certain transaction costs incurred by it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interim dividend amount (and therefore the offer price) will only be determined after the end of the acceptance period based on the acceptance ratio for the Offer. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>EQT Private Equity </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>has underscored its commitment to supporting the company strategically and financially, and to co-operate closely with SUSE’s CEO and his leadership team.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>“I believe in the strategic opportunity of taking the company private – it gives us the right setting to grow the business and deliver on our strategy with the new leadership team in place,” said Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen, CEO of SUSE. “EQT Private Equity’s and SUSE’s partnership in a private setting has been fruitful before and we are excited about the long-term potential of the company and our continued collaboration”.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction timetable:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The offer document for the Offer will be published by Marcel in due course, followed by an acceptance period of at least four weeks. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Settlement of the Offer is expected to occur in the first half of October 2023.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Following the settlement of the Offer, an extraordinary general meeting of SUSE to be held in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023 will resolve on SUSE’s merger with an unlisted Luxembourg entity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>This will result in SUSE’s delisting from the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction structure: </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>SUSE has entered into a TFA with Marcel.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Under the terms of the TFA, SUSE has committed to declare and pay an interim dividend to all shareholders irrespective of whether they accept the Offer or not. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The interim dividend per SUSE share will be determined and is payable after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The payment of the interim dividend will be funded by SUSE through a combination of existing cash and additional borrowing. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any additional borrowing will be in the form of loans taken out by companies of the SUSE group to a maximum of EUR 500 million. The amount of the loans taken out will only be determined after the expiry of the Offer acceptance period.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>There is no obligation for shareholders to accept the Offer. EQT Private Equity does not intend to pursue a squeeze-out. Therefore, shareholders who wish to stay invested in SUSE in a private setting may do so.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><a><span><span><span>For illustrative purposes, the table below sets out the gross interim dividend amount per share and other key parameters for different hypothetical acceptance ratios</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> based on the current number of outstanding SUSE shares.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p>I have struggled, literally for years, with Quicken being dog slow to start. It could take 30+ seconds to start. From what I could remember, this problem has existed since I first installed Windows 10.</p>
<p>There were some other other small applications that were also doggedly slow to start. Further, changing font properties of a task in outlook was very slow too. It could take 10+ seconds for the font-properties window to fully populate. THAT should have been my clue as to the problem, but sadly I didn’t yet put 2+2 together.</p>
<p>To compound the problem, once quicken and the other apps were started the first time, they would restart fast for quite some time. You had to walk away from the computer for several hours before the problem would appear again.</p>
<p>I just accepted that Win10 was a pile of crap which, based on past versions of Windows, was a reasonable explanation. Another irritating Windows problem I just had to live with it.</p>
<p>Several years later, I had to make an extended road trip so I loaded my Win10 laptop up with Quicken, Outlook, and the various apps I have to use daily. Lo and behold Quicken started fast EVERY time, every day. OK, I realized the problem wasn’t just Win10 but something about that PC as well.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Aug 2021, I sat down and tried to figure out exactly what the issue was. Looking at my notes from those days, I tried re-installing quicken, experimenting with DNS servers, capturing network packets, monitoring it with process hacker, playing with virus scanner settings. Nothing helped.</p>
<p>I went so far as to use procmon to carefully monitor all of the events generated by quicken. Procmon said quicken would spend 30 seconds opening every font I had. And I have a lot. It made no sense that quicken was messing with fonts at startup and the only thing I could see to do was not virus scan those files as they were read, but that made no difference.</p>
<p>At this point, I thought I might try to uninstall some of the many fonts in c:\windows\fonts only to find they all seemed to be ‘system’ fonts and I couldn’t uninstall them. That was 2 years ago, and I don’t recall exactly why I gave up on the font idea except I do recall finding it ridiculous the size and count of all of the required ‘system’ fonts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was out of ideas and my final ‘solution’ was to put quicken into task scheduler so it would start first thing in the morning so when I sat down to use it, it would be ready to go.</p>
<p>Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I was playing with Office Libre fonts and one of MY fonts was not in c:\windows\fonts. Perplexing because I know I was using it. I found it in C:\Users\dan\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts.</p>
<p>AHA! That’s new. A quick check of an old Win7 system I have and sure enough there is no such directory in Win7. Evidently all user fonts for Win10 get installed into that new directory. Ugh!!</p>
<p>Sure enough I have almost 900 files in that directory. Way back when, I used to do a lot of design work which required a lot of fonts. Those days are long gone, but when I install a new PC, I just copy all of my fonts over because I really don’t know which ones I may want in the future.</p>
<p>My first plan was to copy that fonts folder and then delete most of the user fonts to see if performance would be affected. Well, that failed immediately. Even though they are supposedly personal fonts, like the system fonts, I couldn’t delete most of the ones that I tried.</p>
<p><strong>Rather than screw around with Windows restrictions any longer, I booted the system under Linux using a thumb drive. In Linux it was simple to rename the user fonts directory to fonts-old.</strong></p>
<p>I then rebooted the PC under windows. Removing the fonts directory had no severe side effect. For the past 2 weeks, I have been monitoring performance and quicken is very fast. On an unloaded system it will start in about 5 seconds. That is what I would expect. Small apps I had problems with have all started equally fast. And changing fonts in outlook is fast again.</p>
<p>When I stumble onto a font I need (I have learned to make do almost entirely with Georgia and Helvetica now) I just “install” it by copying it from fonts-old into the normal fonts folder. The PC asks if I want to replace existing fonts and after I say yes, the fonts show up in the user font directory.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why Quicken and a handful of apps needs to scan every installed font on the system. I suspect those programmers are just calling some black-box windows function and that is really where the problem lies. It seems like the ONLY time all fonts should be scanned is when I bring up a font dialog box (like the issue in outlook). But I no longer need 900 font files, so this solution works for me!</p>

Regardless of any disagreements, it was always a pleasure to communicate with you.
<br>I believe you've always done a stellar job being friendly and patient with everyone,
<br>trying to reconcile disagreements.  When ever that didn't work, it was certainly not
<br>your fault; I hope everyone can at least agree on that. :-)

<br>&gt;&gt; years.&nbsp; It has been a great pleasure to be part of the process&nbsp;that 
<br>&gt;&gt; you have so ably led.&nbsp; Your vast knowledge of the topics of Scheme

</p><p>
&gt; I spite of my expressed concerns about R7RS-large, I fully agree with 
<br>&gt; what Arthur has written above.
<br>&gt; I feel for your disappointment of giving up on something you have put so 
<br>&gt; much effort in:
<br>&gt; It was a noble effort, and we have all learned a lot. If nothing else,
<br>&gt; you can take well-deserved satisfaction in shepherding R7RS-small.  
<br>&gt; Thank you.
</p></div><p>Agreed on all counts.
</p><p>
When I came on the scene the default attitude among schemers was to have 
<br>endless turf wars about which implementation is 15% sparklier than 
<br>another. John's example in particular stood out like a lighthouse above 
<br>these rough seas. Instead of infighting, you have always been a tireless 
<br>champion of improving the whole. That's what it's all about. At the end 
<br>of the day, what's of value to humanity is a better overall language 
<br>with less friction and you have been working on exactly that.
</p><p>
Thank you in particular for giving new generations of schemers a chance 
<br>at a point when many old timers have given up hope that things will ever 
<br>improve. We will try our best to continue on the path you have laid, and 
<br>look forward to your participation should you find the time and energy 
<br>to make more contributions. Your massive knowledge base covering any 
<br>number of topics with precise recall has been an invaluable help on more 
<br>occasions than I can count.
</p><p>
I apologize for the unpleasant exchanges on R7RS-large. I would never 
<br>judge a project so harshly if it were not laying claim to the name of 
<br>Scheme. I am motivated by a sincere worry that the R6/R7 split will turn 
<br>into an R7/R8 split, and have tried my best to exhaust the polite 
<br>avenues for expressing that concern. I agree that a huge library is a 
<br>desirable thing and would be happy to see that goal come about through a 
<br>process fit for the purpose.

</p><p>
I guess the status of WG2 is up in the air right now, and that it is up 
to the Steering Committee to decide what to do. In the event that they 
don't decide to wind the working group up, I hope that they give it some 
direction, perhaps by asking for a detailed plan of work to be produced 
within a set time after agreeing to continue the WG and naming a new 
Chair. I would hope that, with some degree of focus demanded of us, we 
can produce something worthwhile.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://andersoncardoso.github.io/ydd/">https://andersoncardoso.github.io/ydd/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37164173">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div aria-label="Content"><p><strong>YOLO-Driven Development Manifesto</strong></p>

<p><em>You Only Launch Once!</em></p>

<p>We, the fearless proponents of YOLO-Driven Development, in the pursuit of breaking all the rules and embracing chaos, proudly present this manifesto. We recognize that traditional software development methodologies have their merits, but we believe in a more exhilarating, adrenaline-pumping approach to creating software. YOLO-Driven Development is not for the faint of heart; it’s for those who thrive on uncertainty, spontaneity, and a dash of recklessness. We hereby declare our commitment to the following principles:</p>

<p><strong>1. Embrace the Unknown</strong></p>

<p>Why waste time on planning, analysis, and careful consideration? YOLO-Driven Development thrives in the realm of ambiguity. Jump headfirst into coding without any clear understanding of the requirements. You’ll be amazed at the creative solutions you’ll conjure when you’re under the gun!</p>

<p><strong>2. All Nighters over All Sprints</strong></p>

<p>Who needs sleep when you have a looming deadline? Forget about the delicate balance between work and personal life. YOLO-Driven Development encourages marathon coding sessions fueled by caffeine and sheer determination. Burnout is for the weak!</p>

<p><strong>3. Code First, Test… Maybe Later</strong></p>

<p>Testing? Pfft, that’s so last-century. YOLO-Driven Development dictates that you write code like your life depends on it and only consider testing when the application crashes in spectacular fashion. It’s not a bug; it’s a feature waiting to be discovered!</p>

<p><strong>4. Duct Tape and WD-40 Are Your Allies</strong></p>

<p>Complex problems require ingenious solutions. In YOLO-Driven Development, you’ll master the art of duct-tape programming and WD-40 debugging. Your codebase will be a monument to human ingenuity, even if it’s held together with virtual spit and glue.</p>

<p><strong>5. Scope Creep is Your Muse</strong></p>

<p>Fixed scope? Nah, we prefer the thrill of never-ending scope creep. YOLO-Driven Development invites you to chase after ever-evolving requirements. Who cares about deadlines when you can chase the elusive perfection that is perpetually just around the corner?</p>

<p><strong>6. No Documentation, No Problem</strong></p>

<p>Who needs documentation when you have the power of intuition? YOLO-Driven Development encourages you to keep your genius solutions locked away in your head. After all, real developers don’t read documentation; they conjure it from thin air.</p>

<p><strong>7. Collaborative Chaos</strong></p>

<p>Teamwork? Sure, but let’s kick it up a notch. In YOLO-Driven Development, collaboration is an exercise in controlled chaos. Rally your teammates with the shared goal of adding more unpredictability to the mix. Assign tasks on a whim, switch roles randomly, and merge code without warning. The resulting blend of ideas and styles will surely keep everyone on their toes, and who knows, you might just stumble upon brilliance amidst the pandemonium!</p>

<hr>

<p>In conclusion, YOLO-Driven Development is not for everyone. It’s a high-stakes game where the only certainty is uncertainty. But for those who dare to embrace the chaos, who scoff at conventional wisdom, and who thrive on the thrill of code that could crash at any moment, YOLO-Driven Development offers a wild ride that you’ll never forget… if you survive it!</p>

Now, researchers are wondering whether this signalling molecule could be used to treat age-related cognitive disorders such as <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00954-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00954-w" data-track-category="body text link">Alzheimer’s disease</a>.</p><p>“The therapeutic possibilities are very exciting,” says geneticist and anti-ageing scientist David Sinclair at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not involved in the research. The study was published on 16 August in <i>Nature. </i></p><h2>Young blood, old brains</h2><p>About a decade ago, scientists discovered that blood from young mice could restore youthful properties, including learning abilities, in older mice<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup>. The idea captivated Saul Villeda, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco and a co-author of the new study. He and his colleagues have since been trying to identify the components of blood that cause this rejuvenation.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Several lines of evidence suggested that PF4 might be one of these components, including the fact that young mice have higher levels of this molecule in their blood than do older mice. Villeda and his colleagues tried injecting PF4 into aged mice without including other blood components. The researchers found that the ratios of various types of immune cells shifted to become more similar to what is typically seen in younger mice. Some immune cells also reverted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression.</p><p>Although PF4 was not able to cross the blood–brain barrier, its effects on the immune system also led to changes in the brain, probably through indirect mechanisms. Old mice that received doses of PF4 showed decreases in damaging inflammation in the hippocampus — a part of the brain that’s particularly vulnerable to the effects of ageing. They also showed increases in the levels of molecules that promote synaptic plasticity (the capacity to alter the strength of connections between nerve cells).</p><p>Aged mice injected with PF4 also did better than aged control mice in cognitive tests, such as remembering where to find a submerged platform they could rest on when forced to swim through a maze.</p><h2>Platelet plus</h2><p>Before this study, “nobody, to my knowledge, has really ever shown that platelets can play a role in cognition”, said platelet biologist Robert Campbell from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. “I was really excited about it.”</p><p>Two other publications released today also suggest that PF4 has a role in regulating hallmarks of ageing. Dena Dubal and her colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco found that PF4 enhances synaptic plasticity<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>, and Tara Walker and her colleagues at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia showed that PF4 is involved in the formation of new neurons<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>PF4 is one of a handful of molecules related to ageing that Villeda and others have identified in recent years. Some are <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/02/409856/cognitive-benefits-young-blood-linked-brain-protein-mice" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2018/02/409856/cognitive-benefits-young-blood-linked-brain-protein-mice" data-track-category="body text link">involved in cognition</a>, whereas others relate to aspects of ageing such as <a href="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/cellular-rejuvenation-therapy-safely-reverses-signs-of-aging-in-mice/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.salk.edu/news-release/cellular-rejuvenation-therapy-safely-reverses-signs-of-aging-in-mice/" data-track-category="body text link">muscle loss</a>, and some have multiple functions.</p><p>Biotech companies, including <a href="https://www.elevian.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.elevian.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Elevian</a> and <a href="https://www.alkahest.com/" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.alkahest.com/" data-track-category="body text link">Alkahest</a>, are trying to turn these discoveries into therapies that promote regeneration and healthy ageing. Treatments will probably need to take a range of factors relating to ageing into consideration, Villeda says, and different combinations of treatments might be appropriate for different people.</p><p>If decreases in the levels of PF4 are shown to precede Alzheimer’s disease, this molecule could be used as a biomarker to identify people who might benefit from other treatments, says physiologist Cheryl Conover at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Some existing treatments for Alzheimer’s work best if they’re used during the early stages of the disease, so a way to identify people who are at risk before they develop symptoms would be helpful.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 15:28:39 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil">https://tokio.rs/blog/2023-01-03-announcing-turmoil</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163187">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are happy to announce the initial release of <a href="https://crates.io/crates/turmoil"><code>turmoil</code></a>,
a framework for developing and testing distributed systems.</p>
<p>Testing distributed systems is hard. Non-determinism is everywhere (network,
time, threads, etc.), making reproducible results difficult to achieve.
Development cycles are lengthy due to deployments. All these factors slow down
development and make it difficult to ensure system correctness.</p>
<p><code>turmoil</code> strives to solve these problems by simulating hosts, time and the
network. This allows for an entire distributed system to run within a single
process on a single thread, achieving deterministic execution. We also provide
fine grain control over the network, with support for dropping, holding and
delaying messages between hosts.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use <code>turmoil</code>, add the crate to your <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code><span>[dev-dependencies]</span>
<span>turmoil</span> = <span>"0.3"</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://docs.rs/loom/latest/loom/#writing-tests"><code>loom</code></a>, we provide simulated networking types that mirror
<code>tokio::net</code>. Define a new module in your crate named <code>net</code> or any other name of
your choosing. In this module, list out the types that need to be toggled
between <code>turmoil</code> and <code>tokio::net</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(not(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>))]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> tokio::net::*;

<span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>use</span> turmoil::net::*;
</code></pre>
<p>Then, write your software using networking types from this local module.</p>
<pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = <span>"turmoil"</span>)]</span>
<span>mod</span> simulation {
    <span>#[test]</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>simulate_it</span>() <span>-&gt;</span> turmoil::<span>Result</span> {
        <span>// build the simulation</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>mut </span><span>sim</span> = turmoil::Builder::<span>new</span>().<span>build</span>();

        <span>// setup a host</span>
        sim.<span>host</span>(<span>"server"</span>, || <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// host software goes here</span>
        });

        <span>// setup the test</span>
        sim.<span>client</span>(<span>"test"</span>, <span>async</span> <span>move</span> {
            <span>// dns lookup for "server"</span>
            <span>let</span> <span></span><span>addr</span> = turmoil::<span>lookup</span>(<span>"server"</span>);

            <span>// test code goes here</span>

            <span>Ok</span>(())
        });

        <span>// run the simulation</span>
        sim.<span>run</span>()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each host (including the test code) runs on its own <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/latest/tokio/runtime/index.html"><code>Runtime</code></a>, which is
managed by the simulation. Within <code>run()</code>, the simulation steps each runtime a
configurable duration until the test code completes.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What's next?</h2>
<p>This crate is still experimental. Your use cases and feedback are invaluable in
guiding our development.</p>
<p>Please <a href="https://github.com/tokio-rs/turmoil/issues">file issues</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/tokio">ping us on Discord in
#turmoil-simulation</a>.</p>
<p>Happy testing!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p>
<p>I am afraid to inform you that you have built a compiler.
I know you wanted a “simple prototype” that would just add that
one feature to your programming model.
You said that “SSA is an overkill” and “it’s just way too much infrastructure
to maintain for a simple task” and yet, six months later, you have pile of
string mangling scripts that do not work—breaking every time a user input
slightly deviates from things you’ve seen before.</p>
<p>Surely, switching to the unstable abstract syntax tree (AST) library provided by the compiler will be the
end of your woes; at least that way, someone else maintains a real parser and provides
at least a semblance of sane input for you to transform.
But wait, the AST is massive. “Do I really have to handle all 500 different AST nodes?” you ask yourself?
Surely not.
Your users aren’t crazy; they don’t use all the weird features of this language.
So you march on, and handle the 50 AST nodes that matter, certain, that this
will be the last of what you need to do to maintain this pile of hacks.</p>
<p>Ah, but wait! Inevitably, someone wanted to nest a for loop inside a switch
statement, a struct definition within that loop, and a conditional in
expression position.
Tired, you patch in support for each feature, distracting from the crucial
features you should be working on and shipping.
One of your brilliant team member suggests a pre-processing stage: de-nest all definitions,
hoist all expressions, flatten out all control, and that way, you only have to handle
50 AST nodes because you will <em>know</em>, yes <em>know</em>, that the program cannot have any other
shape.</p>
<p>Except once that engineer leave, who will <em>know</em> what assumptions you encoded?
Those littered asserts? The inscrutable “unreachable code” errors? Who will <em>know</em>,
how you simplified your AST?
So you rolled out your own AST library, so that you may compile, nay, <em>transpile</em> your
code and expose your assumptions in your data structures.<span>
<label for="sn-1">
</label>
</span>

<span>
Certain, of course, that because you’re <em>transpiling</em> JavaScript to JavaScript, it is going to
way easier than what real compilers do.
</span>
 What glorious engineering, you say to yourself.</p>
<p>In the last leg of your journey to avoid building a compiler, your manager tells you
that your code should run on older machines, which only support version 0.8.
Version 0.8, of course, does not support the brilliant type-level encodings your
transpiler generates to implement your feature.
Not my problem, your manager says.
So you write some code that simplifies your <em>transpiled</em> code further, making
it use only features present in version 0.8.
Done at last, you say to yourself, without having to build a compiler.</p>
<p>A parser, an intermediate representation, transformation passes, and a code generator.
Dear Sir, you have built a compiler.</p>
<p><em>Addressed to,</em><br>
<em>Those who did not want to build a compiler</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-5650651831645025424" itemprop="description articleBody"><p>
So, a while ago I built a gaming PC with the following specification:</p><div><p><span>&nbsp; Case&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dan A4 v4.1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Motherboard&nbsp; &nbsp; Z690I Strix Gaming</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Processor&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i5-12400F</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; CPU Cooler&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NH-L9i-17xx Chromax Black</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Noctua NA-FD1</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Memory&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Corsair CMK32GX5M2B5200C40</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; GPU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; GeForce RTX 3070 Eagle</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Storage&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Seagate Firecuda 530 1TB</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; Case fans&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2 x Noctua A9x14 HS-PWM chromax.Black.swap</span></p><p><span>&nbsp; PSU&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Corsair SF750</span></p></div><p><span>And one day after months of use it froze mid-game and went into a BIOS loop and wouldn't boot. I quickly realized that only one of the&nbsp;</span>Seagate Firecuda 530 SSDs was detected. After some unscrewing and experimenting with the two drives in the two slots I found that one of them was dead.</p><p>And then I left the PC alone for a few days and turned it on again. It booted into Windows and immediately crashed.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib0tZhWawGzg3BQEATkDGi381NDN5c1L9m_Tap_8MUDCHyuRRXmELQkIfAO1EJxIgI1y46Wdue0wjlqOVAdHNJc_NQnFoSCJA93Xvdf_Aiuy2iM9MjjiZk9CSUgwmulIMKxoygy3zvJb4kr8ywLUkTo8w9V1nu511qHqW2Tfm779QWdSK334Kq3w/s1024/firecuda-2.jpg"><img data-original-height="760" data-original-width="1024" height="476" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEib0tZhWawGzg3BQEATkDGi381NDN5c1L9m_Tap_8MUDCHyuRRXmELQkIfAO1EJxIgI1y46Wdue0wjlqOVAdHNJc_NQnFoSCJA93Xvdf_Aiuy2iM9MjjiZk9CSUgwmulIMKxoygy3zvJb4kr8ywLUkTo8w9V1nu511qHqW2Tfm779QWdSK334Kq3w/w640-h476/firecuda-2.jpg" width="640"></a></p><p>That made me wonder if the failure was temperature related; when cool it seemed to work. So, I left the Firecuda in the freezer at -18C for 30 minutes. Inserting it into an NVMe M.2 USB case I was able to see the drive on my Mac. Success!</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzvkNr-q7YxTA6V5PecJgrv0uOLzeO0oOt2P7fuvPmchXcI3b3ZS9c8mH5FxGgtKBsC6Pst1j3AcZKyV3Nfer92BVv6cUGhAWaaPZ5CSFTYxoJeCDTu9VPFq2QVYeQQs88yWq6XPQ4IrQ3APEMAzf1dnS1ByOimjbavsfXDW1UY5wkLlQt4wDOHA/s1646/firecuda-1.png"><img data-original-height="497" data-original-width="1646" height="194" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzvkNr-q7YxTA6V5PecJgrv0uOLzeO0oOt2P7fuvPmchXcI3b3ZS9c8mH5FxGgtKBsC6Pst1j3AcZKyV3Nfer92BVv6cUGhAWaaPZ5CSFTYxoJeCDTu9VPFq2QVYeQQs88yWq6XPQ4IrQ3APEMAzf1dnS1ByOimjbavsfXDW1UY5wkLlQt4wDOHA/w640-h194/firecuda-1.png" width="640"></a></p><p>Well, for a few minutes. It seemed that as the drive heated up it failed again. Which lead me to believe that there was a faulty connection somewhere on the board. Very careful plugging and unplugging of the board helped me find the right spot to squeeze one of the chips to make the SSD work: no low temperatures needed.</p><p>Now, I couldn't possibly sit and hold the SSD squeezing the chip while I copied off the data so I came up with another solution. A metal G clamp and strips of a Silicon Valley Bank credit card under the SSD to support the PCB.&nbsp;</p><p>Here's the contraption with just the right amount of turns on the G clamp to get the SSD to work.</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRvr7hH-IeJhEQCKuri9rMVuPK2M8CEfCR1d_v7-IZwhaviCaiaIBkw7dC_bkrpyqV2G9mxTZqgIMlSMHwpuugwKVahIXc2e2gCX1nozSIPqQ8OBnAWxHtGHdfLLtN6-YK0Xq9OSHjAiBlip32U5EGGd7mVUG7uwmKXJ-5p1uM5WsriRX-bi-aTg/s1432/firecuda-3.jpg"><img data-original-height="1432" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgRvr7hH-IeJhEQCKuri9rMVuPK2M8CEfCR1d_v7-IZwhaviCaiaIBkw7dC_bkrpyqV2G9mxTZqgIMlSMHwpuugwKVahIXc2e2gCX1nozSIPqQ8OBnAWxHtGHdfLLtN6-YK0Xq9OSHjAiBlip32U5EGGd7mVUG7uwmKXJ-5p1uM5WsriRX-bi-aTg/w572-h640/firecuda-3.jpg" width="572"></a></p><p>But, of course, the SSD gets quite hot during operation so I used one of the heatsinks from the PC and another made from part of carpentry square and some thermal adhesive tape to keep things cool.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin_w7Ss4XJ7pzNHx_cl9cb_KiTKSz95dyLNngCJbc3k15dr_6QUYt_msIkoFwUVYs0mztA1rUwAa9Y8AYgG6Bhq6jSTTaupCIwHbM092LlYOte3rJJZKcIIUJ_qAk8G4YUYir5r7bv5D1lrvyNReOtDlcJLOA5Ih7PCUlHcWDk55O61eP-pB3JHQ/s1492/firecuda-4.jpg"><img data-original-height="1492" data-original-width="1280" height="640" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEin_w7Ss4XJ7pzNHx_cl9cb_KiTKSz95dyLNngCJbc3k15dr_6QUYt_msIkoFwUVYs0mztA1rUwAa9Y8AYgG6Bhq6jSTTaupCIwHbM092LlYOte3rJJZKcIIUJ_qAk8G4YUYir5r7bv5D1lrvyNReOtDlcJLOA5Ih7PCUlHcWDk55O61eP-pB3JHQ/w550-h640/firecuda-4.jpg" width="550"></a></p><p>During the copy operation I kept an eye on the temperatures with the thermal camera in my CAT S60 phone.

After that I decided to push my luck an image the entire drive into a single 1TB file using dd.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm tempted to try to permanently fix the SSD using my SMD hot air blower. But maybe I should just replace it at this point.</p><p>PS I couldn't resist using the SMD hot air blower on the chip with the red arrow on it below, and now the SSD works without having woodworking tools applied to it!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>There are two main arguments against hydrogen use in transportation. The first is that it is mostly generated from fossil fuels, which does not make it helpful against climate change. When it is genuinely green, it is obtained through electrolysis, a process that is only 70% to 80% efficient. That's not bad compared to internal combustion engines (ICEs), but fuel cell detractors use that to bash them anyway. Scientists at Tel Aviv University plan to kill that argument with a method that is over 90% efficient in generating green hydrogen.</p><div><p>
		The doctoral student Itzhak Grinberg and Dr. Oren Ben-Zvi explored the fact that photosynthesis breaks water into oxygen and hydrogen to try to reproduce the method plants adopt to do that. Microscopic organisms – probably some sort of algae – helped them with the enzymes that became the key to the idea they developed with the guidance of professors Iftach Yacoby and Lihi Adler-Abramovich. Their study was published in the June edition of Carbon Energy.</p><p>

In a plant, the sun powers the enzyme that decomposes the water molecules into gases – called hydrogenase. The solution the Israeli scientists developed was to replace the sun's power with electricity. An electrode feeds the enzymes, but the electric charge repels them. What Grinberg and Ben-Zvi did was create a chemical treatment that prevented that: a hydrogel mixed with hydrogenase.</p><p>

The researchers were pretty happy with the material they created because <em>"the gel assembles itself."</em> According to Adler-Abramovich, when it is placed in water, it makes nanometric fibers that hold hydrogenase in place. These materials are much cheaper than the platinum that electrolyzers have to use, among other precious metals. The hydrogen is also apparently produced with any kind of water, not only distilled water, as electrolyzers demand. The researchers said salt water is more beneficial to the enzyme to work, for example. That makes green hydrogen production much cheaper, without the need for any secondary process.</p><div><a id="xaegal_5" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_5.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(5, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_5.jpg" width="860" height="484" alt="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" title="Atmospheric Electrolyzer from Nel ASA Nikola Intended to Use" data-gidm="1905316" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="9"></picture></a><p>Photo: Nel ASA</p></div>

According to these scientists, it can cost 15 times more than gray hydrogen, which is produced from natural gas. Hydrogen can also be made from coal in a process called gasification – that's black or brown hydrogen. The scientists said gray, black, and brown hydrogen release 9 to 12 tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of hydrogen produced. Yet, they correspond to 95% of all hydrogen currently produced worldwide for agricultural and industrial needs. Even if this green hydrogen does not help move a vehicle, it is a welcome way to curb the production of the gray and black kinds.</p><p>

Currently, the hydrogen refueling infrastructure does not increase because green hydrogen prices are too high. In June, Alexander Vlaskamp warned that hydrogen costs four to five times more than it would be acceptable for truck buyers to use it. Although <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/fuel-cell-trucks-face-a-danger-worse-than-weight-that-s-hydrogen-costs-217098.html">the MAN CEO</a> has to justify why Volkswagen is betting so heavily on batteries, the green hydrogen cost was something that needed to be solved quickly. The Israeli production method may be the answer that can solve this once and for all. We just need to have a more refined and commercially usable system to confirm the benefits this idea may bring.</p><p>

If the prices really get more competitive, energy solar and wind farms may dedicate to producing hydrogen when there is no demand for the electricity they generate. That's a better idea than spending millions of dollars on expensive stationary storage systems: these batteries could have better uses in vehicles or houses. <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/hydrogen/">Hydrogen</a> storage would still be a problem unless the gas was transformed into synthetic fuel. Hopefully, another scientific breakthrough could address that as soon as possible. We also have another idea floating around that may help solve that.</p><div><a id="xaegal_64" href="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/gallery/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis_64.jpg" onclick="return open_lght(64, this)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images-webp/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg.webp"><source type="image/jpeg" srcset="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news-gallery-860x/israeli-researchers-produce-green-hydrogen-with-90-efficiency-without-electrolysis-thumbnail_64.jpg" width="860" height="483" alt="NamX's CapXtores will allegedly provide hydrogen in Gogoro fashion for the HUV to run in 2026" title="NamX's CapXtores will allegedly provide hydrogen in Gogoro fashion for the HUV to run in 2026" data-gidm="1905375" data-gida="218644" data-gidx="127"></picture></a><p>Photo: NamX</p></div>
<p>
NamX wants its first vehicle – the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.autoevolution.com/newstag/NamX%20HUV/">HUV</a> – to use swappable hydrogen capsules that can be bought anywhere. If these capsules could be refilled directly from one of the production stations, the storage problem woulxd be quickly solved. Toyota is investigating a similar solution. If we can produce green hydrogen at reasonable prices, that will be a good starting point.</p><p>

It may also be the case that we have to develop vehicles in a different way. Riversimple proposed that when it argued that we are currently trying to make fuel cells fit the cars we already have, just like some carmakers tried to use internal combustion engine (<span data-url="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/i.html#ge-internal-combustion-engine" title="ICE - click for definition">ICE</span>) platforms to make electric vehicles. It did not work. FCEVs have to be conceived around fuel cells and not the other way around. If you check the Toyota Mirai and the Hyundai NEXO, they are the perfect example of what Riversimple tried to demonstrate: they look like ordinary vehicles with motors and a fuel cell instead of a combustion engine and a fuel tank. It makes sense that an established automaker will try to keep things as they are, but that will bite them back when competitors find a better way to do that. The <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cey2.411">Israeli scientists</a> may have found precisely what was missing to kick this off. Find yourself a comfortable seat to follow how everything unfolds from here. <i></i></p>

<p>Over 30 years ago the late Ian Murdock
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHistory?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=Debian-announcement-1993.txt">wrote</a>
to the comp.os.linux.development newsgroup about the completion of a brand-new
Linux release which he named "The Debian Linux Release".</p>
<p>He built the release by hand, from scratch, so to speak. Ian laid out
guidelines for how this new release would work, what approach the release
would take regarding its size, manner of upgrades, installation procedures; and
with great care of consideration for users without Internet connection.</p>
<p>Unaware that he had sparked a movement in the fledgling F/OSS community, Ian
worked on and continued to work on Debian. The release, now aided by volunteers
from the newsgroup and around the world, grew and continues to grow as one of
the largest and oldest FREE operating systems that still exist today.</p>
<p>Debian at its core is comprised of Users, Contributors, Developers, and
Sponsors, but most importantly, <strong><em>People</em></strong>. Ians drive and focus remains
embedded in the core of Debian, it remains in all of our work, it remains in
the minds and hands of the users of <em><strong>The Universal Operating System</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The Debian Project is proud and happy to share our anniversary not exclusively
unto ourselves, instead we share this moment with everyone, as we come together
in celebration of a resounding community that works together, effects change,
and continues to make a difference, not just in our work but around the world.</p>
<p>Debian is present in cluster systems, datacenters, desktop computers, embedded
systems, IoT devices, laptops, servers, it may possibly be powering the web
server and device you are reading this article on, and it can also be found in
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/to-the-space-station-and-beyond-with-linux/">Spacecraft</a>.</p>
<p>Closer to earth, Debian fully supports projects for accessibility:
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/edu/">Debian Edu/Skolelinux</a> - an operating system
designed for educational use in schools and communities,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianScience">Debian Science</a> - providing free
scientific software across many established and emerging fields,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/blends/hamradio/about">Debian Hamradio</a> - for amateur
radio enthusiasts,
<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-accessibility/">Debian-Accessibility</a> - a
project focused on the design of an operating system suited to fit the
requirements of people with disabilites, and
<a href="https://blends.debian.org/astro/">Debian Astro</a> - focused on supporting
professional and hobbyist astronomers.</p>
<p>Debian strives to give, reach, embrace, mentor, share, and teach with
internships through many programs internally and externally such as the Google
Summer of Code, Outreachy, and the Open Source Promotion Plan.</p>
<p>None of this could be possible without the vast amount of support, care, and
contributions from what started as and is still an all volunteer project.
We celebrate with each and every one who has helped shape Debian over all of
these years and toward the future.</p>
<p>Today we all certainly celebrate 30 years of Debian, but know that Debian
celebrates with each and every one of you all at the same time.</p>
<p>Over the next few days Celebration parties are planned to take place in
Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Germany
(CCCcamp), India, Iran, Portugal, Serbia, South Africa, and Turkey.</p>
<p>You are of course, invited to join us!</p>
<p>Check out, attend, or form your very own

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div id="attachment_3218"><p><a href="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3218" decoding="async" src="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-300x240.png" alt="" width="300" height="240" srcset="https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-300x240.png 300w, https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-768x614.png 768w, https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl-375x300.png 375w, https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nif-llnl.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-3218">National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab</p></div>
<p>Great. The fusion hype is bad enough already. Now its resurgence is going to interrupt the series of posts I’m in the middle of publishing in order for this post to be “timely.”</p>
<p>The first (and much bigger) round of breathless excitement came in December 2022 when the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) announced a (legitimate) breakthrough in achieving fusion: more energy came out of the target than laser energy injected.</p>
<p>At the time, I brushed it off without even reading any articles because I already knew about the NIF’s purpose and limitations, and a few headlines told me everything I needed to know. Who cares how much <em>laser</em> energy went in: how much energy went into <em>creating</em> the laser energy? The laser I used for lunar ranging took 5 kW from the wall plug and delivered 2 W of laser power for a dismal 0.04% efficiency. Such is the cost for shaping ultra-brief pulses: lots of energy is thrown away. The headlines were clearly overblown.</p>
<p>Enough students in my energy class in Spring 2023 asked about the fusion breakthrough (doesn’t that mean we’re done?) that I dug into the details. Even so, I still deemed it unworthy of writing up as a post. But a few days ago, my friend asked me if I was excited about the recent fusion news. I hadn’t heard a peep, but after searching I found a new round of articles based on a second “net gain” laser shot and realized I probably ought to put out a quantitative post on the matter, reminiscent of my blogging origins.</p>
<p>In the end, the NIF fusion accomplishment might be called a stunt.&nbsp; Stunts explore what we <em>can</em> do (often after an insane amount of preparation, practice, and failure), rather than what’s practical.&nbsp; Stunts hide the pains and present an appearance of ease and grace, but it’s a show.</p>
<p>Quantitatively, it’s as if you spot a slot machine in a casino that looks very promising. You’re dying to play, because it just feels right—mysteriously appealing to your sense of self. It calls to you. You notice that it takes $2 tokens, but you have none. You go to the window to purchase a token, and are shocked to learn that one $2 token costs $400. Not wanting to look like an uninformed fool, you gulp and buy the token. This slot machine had better live up to its promise! You pull the lever, and surprise! You actually <em>do</em> win! You put in a $2 token and the machine makes very happy noises and flashes lots of lights as it spits out…$3 (and some neutrons, oddly). Queue the headlines! Want to play again?&nbsp; Actually, this wasn’t your first shot: just the first success after years of trying (but hush!).</p>

<h2>Energetics</h2>
<p>That’s the essence of the story. The December announcement indicated that they launched 2.05&nbsp;MJ of laser energy onto the target sphere, and 3.15&nbsp;MJ came out. The recent articles indicate a second “score,” but fail to give energy specifics, other than “more” energy out. I am assuming an incremental bump, still under 4&nbsp;MJ—otherwise the factor of improvement would be prominently touted in the coverage.</p>
<p>Let’s pause to say: well done! Honestly. No sarcasm. What they did was ridiculously hard, and it finally worked after more than a decade of trying. They actually produced a significant number of fusion events! There’s no faking that, and I’d like to see you try. So let’s be clear that I’m not knocking the accomplishment in itself. My major beef is how we interpret the implications for society. To be fair, the scientists did not supply the hype. They didn’t have to: the rest of the universe was more than ready to fill in that yawning gap.</p>
<p>As I scanned articles from December 2022, most were about the triumph, a reminder that the sun works by fusion, and talk about being the first major step toward limitless clean energy. That’s what people want to hear. It plays right into our cultural mythology: humans defy all limits through ingenuity and technology. Build a story around that theme, and you’ve got yourself some guaranteed click-bait.</p>
<p>A <em>very</em> few articles mentioned the energetic price of generating the laser pulse. In particular, I found <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/department-of-energy-nuclear-fusion-breakthrough-nif-livermore/672439/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one in The Atlantic</a> by Charles Seife:</p>
<blockquote><p>The “more energy out than laser energy in” equation masks several fundamental problems. NIF’s doped glass lasers have an efficiency of about 0.5 percent, meaning that they would have sucked in roughly 400 megajoules of energy from the grid in order to produce the 2.1 megajoules of light energy…</p></blockquote>
<p>The second was a <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-future/fusion-power-nif-hype-lose-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Think article</a> by Tom Hartsfield.</p>
<blockquote><p>The laser energy delivered to the target was 2.05 MJ, and the fusion output was likely about 3.15 MJ. According to multiple sources on NIF’s website, the input energy to the laser system is somewhere between 384 and 400 MJ.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that’s just the laser energetics. The whole facility consumes scads more for countless other purposes. According to the <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LLNL NIF FAQs</a> (are you letting me get away with a triple acronym?),</p>
<blockquote><p>NIF’s 192 powerful laser beams, housed in a <b>10-story building</b> the size of <b>3 football fields</b>, can deliver more than 2 million joules of ultraviolet laser energy in billionth-of-a-second pulses onto a target about the size of a pencil eraser.</p></blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is mine, to highlight the point that this is a massive laser and facility. It’s like ten Walmart superstores stacked on top of each other. The lighting <em>alone</em> is likely taking tens of kilowatts, which could hypothetically be run for less than a minute on the energy gain from the fusion pop.&nbsp; It would be fun to count all the megajoules that went into press coverage of the event!</p>
<h2>Power Plant Energetics</h2>
<p>Let’s connect the 3 MJ output to that of actual power plants, forgetting for a moment the tremendous energy loss represented in getting 3 MJ out from a 400 MJ input. A typical electrical power plant (nuclear, coal, etc.) delivers about 1 GW of electrical power. But it’s a heat engine operating at 30–40% thermodynamic efficiency. So it takes roughly 3 GW of <em>thermal</em> energy to export 1&nbsp;GW as electricity. 3&nbsp;GW is 3&nbsp;GJ per second, or 3,000&nbsp;MJ per second.</p>
<p>The same efficiency factor would apply to a putative fusion plant. The concept behind fusion power is that it’s <em>just</em> another thermal source—an excruciatingly elaborate way to boil water to make steam to drive a turbine to run a generator. So our 3&nbsp;MJ would need to be replicated 1,000 times per second to amount to 3&nbsp;GW.</p>
<p>Laser repetition rates can be all over the map. 1,000 Hz is not in itself unusually fast by any stretch. What is the repetition rate of the NIF laser? Handily, LLNL <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/nif-target-shot-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provides these statistics</a>. The average since 2015 is 377 shots per year, with a high of 417 and a low of 327. That’s about a shot per day—or two on a good day. It’s only 100 million times shy of 1 kHz. Oh dear.</p>
<h2>Economics</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://thebulletin.org/2022/12/the-energy-departments-fusion-breakthrough-its-not-really-about-generating-electricity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> of physicist Bob Rosner in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists helpfully puts the NIF in context (it’s not about societal energy). In it, he reinforces some of what we’ve covered, and adds some financial detail.</p>
<blockquote><p>This facility can do one shot a day; this is at slightly more than two megajoules (of output). For an energy source, it would have to do the same thing at least 10 times a second. If you ask, “Do the lasers exist that can do this?” Not in your dream. The pellet cost a bit over $100,000 to manufacture.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 10 shots per second, I gather, is if the fusion yield could be improved by a couple orders of magnitude—approaching actual break-even. At $100,000 per (literal) pop, and even just ten shots per second, we’re talking a cool million dollars per second!</p>
<p>Let’s wave a magic wand for a minute and say that the 400 MJ input produced a 700 MJ output for a net of 300 MJ: 100 times the recent breakthrough. This accords with the ten shots per second mentioned above. What is the price of the delivered electricity? After thermodynamic inefficiency is accounted, we get 100 MJ out for $100,000 cost, or $1,000 per megajoule. We are accustomed to using the kilowatt-hour (kWh) as a measure of delivered energy, which is 3.6 MJ. The cost becomes, then, $3,600 per kWh. Typical electricity costs are in the neighborhood of $0.15–0.20 per kWh, so we’re dealing with a cost that is 20,000 times higher than nominal. And don’t forget, we used a magic wand to even get there. It’s closer to 2 million times more expensive currently, and as a net energy loser to boot.</p>
<p>Granted, the research and development phase is not characteristic of operational costs. But try knocking on a venture capitalist’s door and making the argument that you can trim costs to 0.005% of their current amount. Slam!</p>
<p>This massive reduction, incidentally, translates to a cost of $5 per pellet. I don’t care what mass-production slave labor you might dream of employing. A cryogenic hydrogen-ice target made to demanding precision specifications, containing deuterium and transmuted lithium (to make tritium) is not going to cost $5. You lost me at cryogenic. Also, they would have made many pellets by now and I’m sure don’t relish spending $100,000 each. If they’re clever enough to accomplish fusion, they would be clever enough to have already reduced costs dramatically if it were straightforward.</p>
<h2>Fusion Efficiency</h2>
<p>Here’s the part where I earn my keep as a physicist translating technical matters. I found details about the NIF targets in a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.13182/FST10-3697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 paper</a> by Bernard Koziokiemski et al. The abstract alone clarifies much. The target is a shell of hydrogen ice 75 μm thick on a 1 mm radius sphere, cooled below 19 K. Pause for a moment to contemplate the challenges that would be involved if trying to maintain the targets at such low temperatures in a 3 GW power plant “furnace” environment.</p>
<p>Hydrogen ice has a density of 86&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which in the specified volume (10<sup>−9</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>) translates to 5×10<sup>19</sup> lattice sites (nuclei/atoms). Deuterium/tritium ice has a higher density than hydrogen ice, but the atomic spacing is unchanged so that the pure hydrogen calculation gives the correct number.</p>
<p>How many fusion events took place to crank out 3&nbsp;MJ of energy? Each deuterium–tritium fusion event releases 17.6&nbsp;MeV of energy, or 2.8×10<sup>−12</sup>&nbsp;J. Calling this 3×10<sup>−12</sup>&nbsp;J (among friends; makes for easy math), we find that we need 10<sup>18</sup> fusion events to amount to 3 MJ. Each event involves 2 nuclei. We calculated above that the shell contains 50×10<sup>18</sup> nuclei, meaning that 4% of them participated in fusion.</p>
<p>This event therefore produced a 4% yield. I’m actually very impressed! That’s nothing to sneeze at. The laser-induced implosion is very fast, very violent, and leaves lots of room for nuclei failing to “find” each other if not compressed almost flawlessly and symmetrically to sub-micron scale. Before doing the calculation, I might have guessed a yield orders-of-magnitude smaller.</p>
<p>So this news is both good and bad. Hats off for cracking into single-digit yield! But that leaves less room to improve. Even at 100% efficiency, we’d get just 25 times more energy out, or 75&nbsp;MJ. That’s still not enough to pay for the price of admission (400&nbsp;MJ, just for the laser part).</p>
<h2>NIF Purpose</h2>
<p>This avenue, therefore, seems painfully far away from achieving practical societal energy. Even 100% yield (for the present design) could not produce net energy. Even if it <em>could</em> produce net energy, the laser repetition rate is a million times too slow. And then, even if the laser could fire fast enough, the cost of each target is prohibitively high by over four orders-of-magnitude.</p>
<p>Then, we have a raft of practical considerations for turning an experimental facility into a functional power plant. No design exists at present to extract the heat produced at NIF. That’s not what it’s for—it wouldn’t make any sense to put effort in that direction.&nbsp; Such a design would have the unenviable thermal challenge of delivering cryogenic targets into a hellfire-hot environment. For energy extraction, tokamak designs like ITER are less unsuitable.&nbsp;&nbsp; In either case, all this to boil water. Bless their hearts.</p>
<p>But the NIF was never “about” societal energy. Its primary purpose is nuclear weapons research. This pesky thing called the nuclear test ban treaty means we can’t just go around detonating nuclear bombs whenever we feel like it. Surely we did not run out of South Pacific island paradises to blow to smithereens. The NIF allows study of matter at extremely high energy density. Other targets besides deuterium–tritium can be placed in the converging laser beams. Essentially, we can create the unbelievably hot conditions relevant to nuclear detonations in the safety of our own national lab.</p>
<p>Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) constitutes a small fraction of <a href="https://lasers.llnl.gov/for-users/nif-target-shot-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NIF’s laser shots</a>. Most of the work is labeled HED for high-energy-density research. The people at NIF are under no false impression about the potential of this type of approach for generating societal energy. They know what they’re about. At the same time, why not poke? It certainly has some benefits in terms of public attention, translating to funding.</p>
<h2>How Embarrassing</h2>
<p>So what can we say about the public reaction to this news? Headlines in December gushed about the dawn of a new era of limitless energy. People got excited. Many of my students came away thinking it was basically a done deal—now just a matter of putting into practice. That’s how it works in entertainment: a genius breakthrough followed by immediate implementation free of complication. The emphasis is on human ingenuity, not on physical reality. In my experience, ideas are a dime-a-dozen. The hard part is coming up with an idea that can be practically brought to fruition.</p>
<p>I often encounter a disconnect on matters of this sort when interacting with people—whether about space colonization, fusion, renewable energy, or prospects for modernity’s continuation. I frequently find myself outnumbered. Why am I so negative about these things? The disconnect might have something to do with how information is received and processed. If all I had to go on were popular media accounts, word-of-mouth, and entertainment, I’d probably be similarly miscalibrated. But my background, training, experiences, and accomplishments enable an uncommon approach that is less dependent on what other people are saying, and more strongly tied to the underlying drivers. That’s not to say I’ll always have a more accurate take, but just that my process generally involves more independent thought and analysis than I suspect it does for most people.&nbsp; I’m no fun at parties.</p>
<p>In any case, the public reaction to the fusion story tells me a lot about our collective psychology. To me, it speaks to a sense of desperation. I think people sense that the “bad news” side of the ledger is overcrowded of late, and it’s starting to dawn on people that the future could possibly be worse than the present. This causes a cognitive dissonance in that our cultural narrative is one of progress, growth, and innovation. How can these competing visions be squared? News of fusion has the effect of temporarily permitting people to shed the anxiety and embrace the dream all the more strongly. Words that come to mind are: embarrassing, pathetic, humiliating.</p>
<p>What if you see a movie star across the street, overcome by excitement as they stop, look at you, and wave enthusiastically. You, of course, wave back. They <em>see</em> you. They recognize you as special, just as you knew all along. Only, it then becomes apparent that their movie star fling (according to the tabloids) was passing behind you. Now how do you feel? How could you fall for it? That’s the question I find myself asking about the fusion hype. It’s so obviously far from relevant, how could we (and the media establishment) fall for it?</p>
<p>My suspicion is that it plays perfectly into our culture’s irrational hopes and dreams. We have a weak spot in our armor for things that sound too good to be true. We want to believe the narrative (mythology) that humans are exempt from all limits, and that our ingenuity will save the day every time. We want to believe that the movie star would adore us, if only they got the chance to meet us.&nbsp; Instant besties!</p>
<p>Many in our culture truly believe in “the amazing future,” uncritically extrapolating our fossil-fueled joy ride into ever-more impressive innovations and technologies. Of course we will someday roam the galaxy. Of course we will have warp drive (how else would we roam the galaxy?). Of course fusion is a necessary stepping stone on this path. It’s silly to imagine warp drive and teleportation without first cracking fusion. So societal fusion power <em>has</em> to happen, in their imaginations.</p>
<p>The problem is that such imaginings are not tethered to physical reality. They are driven by ideology, or I would say mythology. The physical reality is that we are living in an ecologically, evolutionarily untested paradigm that is very recent (on relevant timescales) and powered by patently unsustainable practices and resource use. The cost is rapid ecological degradation and global disruption to the biosphere. It seems quite clear that the track we are on does not lead to the stars, but to ignominious self-termination of this whacky mode called modernity. It simply does not add up, once the mythology is stripped away. The venture capitalist of nature is about to slam the door on our faces.</p>

            <link>https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/</link>
            <guid>37159744</guid>
            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Aug 2023 10:51:56 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/">https://blog.torproject.org/releasing-mullvad-browser/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37159744">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we announced the launch of the Mullvad Browser, a browser built by the Tor Project team and distributed by <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">Mullvad</a>.</p>
<p>Mullvad and the Tor Project have been part of the same community that is dedicated to developing technology that prioritizes protecting people's right to privacy for many years now. Mullvad contributes to the Tor Project at the highest level of membership, Shallot, and were a founding member of the Tor Project's Membership Program. They approached us to help them develop their browser because they wanted to leverage our expertise to create a product that is built on the same principles and with similar safety levels as the Tor Browser&nbsp;-- but that works independently of the Tor network. The result is the Mullvad Browser, a free, privacy-preserving web browser to challenge the all-too-prevalent business model of exploiting people's data for profit.</p>
<h2>Why use the Mullvad Browser?</h2>
<p>In short: the Mullvad Browser is Tor Browser without the Tor Network -- a browser that allows anyone to take advantage of all the browser privacy features the Tor Project has created. If people want to connect the browser with a VPN they trust, they can easily do so.</p>
<p>Our goal was to give users the privacy protections of Tor Browser without Tor. For instance, the Mullvad Browser applies a "hide-in-the-crowd" approach to online privacy by creating a similar fingerprint for all of its users. The browser's 'out-of-the-box' configurations and settings will mask many parameters and features commonly used to extract information from a person's device that can make them identifiable, including fonts, rendered content, and several hardware APIs. By default, Mullvad Browser has private mode enabled, blocks third-party trackers and cookies, and makes it easy to delete cookies between visiting pages during the same session.</p>
<p>The Mullvad Browser is another option for internet users who are looking for a privacy browser that doesn't need a bunch of extensions and plugins to enhance their privacy and reduce the factors that can accidentally de-anonymize themselves. And unlike other browsers on the market, Mullvad Browser's business model does not rely on capitalizing on users' behavioral data.</p>
<h2>Why collaborate?</h2>
<p>Our mission at the Tor Project is to advance human rights by building technology that protects people's privacy, provides anonymity and helps them bypass censorship. We want to give people options and demonstrate to the world that through partnerships like these, you can create technology with these values in mind.</p>
<p>That is why we jumped at the opportunity to help Mullvad with their browser. We agree with them that demand for a browser that is built to the same standards as Tor Browser exists.</p>
<p>We hope to inspire other tech builders and organizations to take a page out of our playbook --and think of privacy as a 'feature' that can enhance user experience-- and not as an afterthought. This collaboration with Mullvad illustrates that it is possible to build privacy-preserving technology that protects users like ours does together, rather than in competition with each other.</p>
<h2>What does that mean for us and Tor Browser?</h2>
<p>Let's be clear: Tor Browser is here to stay, and we'll continue to iterate and improve on it and our other services. We know that millions of users around the world rely on Tor Browser and other solutions that the Tor Project offers to safely connect to the internet, to browse anonymously online and to circumvent censorship. Therefore Tor Browser will continue to exist.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to continue to maintain and improve Tor Browser, it is still one of the few solutions that provides anonymity online because it funnels traffic through the Tor network. A privacy browser plus the Tor network is a powerful combination and sometimes one of the few options that censored and surveilled users have in their region to freely and safely access the internet. Tor Browser is also a free solution for all, making it an affordable solution for people at risk.</p>
<p>This joint project with Mullvad has brought positive changes to Tor Browser by allowing us to address legacy issues, fix vulnerabilities for Tor Browser and make necessary UX improvements that benefit both Tor and Mullvad Browsers, as well as the global privacy-preserving tech ecosystem. And, over the last five years, the Tor Project has launched a number of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Tor_Uplift">initiatives to increase adoption of our technologies</a> and made <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-browser-advancing-privacy-innovation/">significant improvements</a> to the usability of our own products. And we are currently working on more to come!</p>
<p>We encourage you to check out the Mullvad Browser and its capabilities. It can be used without Mullvad VPN, although the combination is recommended. If you want to learn more about this partnership, you can visit <a href="https://mullvad.net/browser">Mullvad.net/browser.</a></p>

<p>New evidence suggests the world’s largest known asteroid impact structure is buried near the New South Wales town of Deniliquin.</p>


<p><em>Acknowledgment: I’d like to thank my colleague Tony Yeates, who originated the view of the Deniliquin multi-ring structure as an impact structure – and who was instrumental to this work.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040195122002487">recent research</a> published by myself and my colleague Tony Yeates in the journal Tectonophysics, we investigate what we believe – based on many years of experience in asteroid impact research – is the world’s largest known impact structure, buried deep in the earth in southern New South Wales.</p>
<p>The Deniliquin structure, yet to be further tested by drilling, spans up to 520 kilometres in diameter. This exceeds the size of the near-300km-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vredefort_impact_structure">Vredefort</a> impact structure in South Africa, which to date has been considered the world’s largest.</p>
<h2>Hidden traces of Earth’s early history</h2>
<p>The history of Earth’s bombardment by asteroids is largely concealed. There are a few reasons for this. The first is erosion: the process by which gravity, wind and water slowly wear away land materials through time.</p>
<p>When an asteroid strikes, it creates a crater with an uplifted core. This is similar to how a drop of water splashes upward from a transient crater when you drop a pebble in a pool.</p>
<p>This central uplifted dome is a key characteristic of large impact structures. However, it can erode over thousands to millions of years, making the structure difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Structures can also be buried by sediment through time. Or they might disappear as a result of subduction, wherein tectonic plates can collide and slide below one another into Earth’s mantle layer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, new geophysical discoveries are unearthing signatures of impact structures formed by asteroids that may have reached tens of kilometres across – heralding a paradigm shift in our understanding of how Earth evolved over eons. These include pioneering discoveries of impact “ejecta”, which are the materials thrown out of a crater during an impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1387647317300714">Researchers think</a> the oldest layers of these ejecta, found in sediments in early terrains around the world, might signify the tail end of the Late Heavy Bombardment of Earth. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1387647317300714">latest evidence</a> suggests Earth and the other planets in the Solar System were subject to intense asteroid bombardments until about 3.2 billion years ago, and sporadically since.</p>
<p>Some large impacts are correlated with mass extinction events. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Alvarez hypothesis</a>, named after father and son scientists Luis and Walter Alvarez, explains how non-avian dinosaurs were wiped out as a result of a large asteroid strike some 66 million years ago.</p>
<h2>Uncovering the Deniliquin structure</h2>
<p>The Australian continent and its predecessor continent, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, have been the target of numerous asteroid impacts. These have resulted in at least 38 confirmed and 43 potential impact structures, ranging from relatively small craters to large and completely buried structures.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 0 0&quot;></svg>" data-src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541853/original/file-20230809-24-hpgo51.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip"></a><figcaption>This map shows the distribution of circular structures of uncertain, possible or probable impact origin on the Australian continent and offshore. Green dots represent confirmed impact craters. Red dots represent confirmed impact structures that are more than 100km wide, whereas red dots inside white circles are more than 50km wide. Yellow dots represent likely impact structures. <em>Image credit: Andrew Glikson and Franco Pirajno</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>As you’ll recall with the pool and pebble analogy, when a large asteroid hits Earth, the underlying crust responds with a transient elastic rebound that produces <a href="https://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/CB-954/CB-954.pdf">a central dome</a>.</p>
<p>Such domes, which can slowly erode and/or become buried through time, may be all that’s preserved from the original impact structure. They represent the deep-seated “root zone” of an impact. Famous examples are found in the Vredefort impact structure and the 170km-wide <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater">Chicxulub crater</a> in Mexico. The latter represents the impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Between 1995 and 2000, Tony Yeates suggested magnetic patterns beneath the Murray Basin in New South Wales <a href="https://www.aseg.org.au/publications/preview-old">likely represented</a> a massive, buried impact structure. An analysis of the region’s updated geophysical data between 2015 and 2020 confirmed the existence of a 520km diameter structure with a seismically defined dome at its centre.</p>
<p>The Deniliquin structure has all the features that would be expected from a large-scale impact structure. For instance, magnetic readings of the area reveal a symmetrical rippling pattern in the crust around the structure’s core. This was likely produced during the impact as extremely high temperatures created intense magnetic forces.</p>
<p>A central low magnetic zone corresponds to 30km-deep deformation above a seismically defined mantle dome. The top of this dome is about 10km <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015GL065345">shallower than the top</a> of the regional mantle.</p>
<p>Magnetic measurements also show evidence of “radial faults”: fractures that radiate from the centre of a large impact structure. This is further accompanied by small magnetic anomalies which may represent igneous “dikes”, which are sheets of magma injected into fractures in a pre-existing body of rock.</p>

<p>Radial faults, and igneous sheets of rocks that form within them, are typical of large impact structures and can be found in the Vredefort structure and the <a href="https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/maps/article/viewFile/14921/14892">Sudbury impact structure</a> in Canada.</p>
<p>Currently, the bulk of the evidence for the Deniliquin impact is based on geophysical data obtained from the surface. For proof of impact, we’ll need to collect physical evidence of shock, which can only come from drilling deep into the structure.</p>
<h2>When did the Deniliquin impact happen?</h2>
<p>The Deniliquin structure was likely located on the eastern part of the Gondwana continent, prior to it splitting off into several continents (including the Australian continent) much later.</p>
<div><figure><a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541858/original/file-20230809-21-qpfxif.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=1000&amp;fit=clip"><img decoding="async" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541858/original/file-20230809-21-qpfxif.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 0 0&quot;></svg>" data-src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/541858/original/file-20230809-21-qpfxif.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;q=45&amp;auto=format&amp;w=754&amp;fit=clip"></a><figcaption>The Deniliquin structure was likely created in eastern Gondwana during the Late Ordovician.<em> Image credit: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08941-3#rightslink">Zhen Qiu et al, 2022</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a></em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The impact that caused it may have occurred during what’s known as the Late Ordovician mass extinction event. Specifically, I think it may have triggered what’s called the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction">Hirnantian glaciation stage</a>, which lasted between 445.2 and 443.8 million years ago, and is also defined as the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X23000655">Ordovician-Silurian extinction event</a>.</p>
<p>This huge glaciation and mass extinction event <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/Ordovician-Silurian-extinction">eliminated</a> about 85% of the planet’s species. It was more than double the scale of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvarez_hypothesis">Chicxulub impact</a> that killed off the dinosaurs.</p>
<p>It is also possible the Deniliquin structure is older than the Hirnantian event, and may be of an early Cambrian origin (about 514 million years ago). The next step will be to gather samples to determine the structure’s exact age. This will require drilling a deep hole into its magnetic centre and dating the extracted material.</p>
<p>It’s hoped further studies of the Deniliquin impact structure will shed new light on the nature of early <a href="https://www.livescience.com/37584-paleozoic-era.html">Paleozoic</a> Earth.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">


<p><em>Hello dear reader, I will be improving this article based on the feedback that I received. I don't see myself as an expert, more like ever-learning amateur, so if you point out something, I will try to understand your point of view and correct any mistakes. Feel free to comment the article below, any and all feedback is welcome, just stay civil. </em></p>


<p>In the grand scheme of a software engineering path, there's a thread that weaves through every project, every failure, and every challenge. That thread is people. As a person with an engineering background, I do enjoy solving hard puzzles and fixing problems. But the most complex, intriguing, and ultimately rewarding aspect of my journey has always been managing people. I wasn’t a people person before — It’s not something I could do naturally — I had to read a lot, learn a lot, try different methodologies, and figure stuff out on the fly, but it’s still the most rewarding aspect of my job.</p>


<p>This guide is born out of those countless interactions, conversations, and experiences. Things that I’ve failed at. It's a distillation of lessons learned, a roadmap to help you, the engineering managers of today, navigate the choppy waters of managing difficult software engineers. </p>


<p><em>I'm not an expert, and am not trying to position myself as one, so if you disagree with anything here, let me know in the comments and we'll have a healthy discussion. </em></p>


<pre>🏄 Some people call developers snowflakes — they’re brilliant, opinionated, and unique in many ways. It’s easy to manage those that don’t deviate too much from all the other engineers. Still, I will focus more on those difficult employees rather than the general management of all developers.</pre>


<p>Why focus on the difficult ones, you ask? Well, it's simple. When everything is smooth sailing, when your team is balanced like a well-oiled machine, you don't need a guide. It's when you have conflicts, ego clashes, lone wolves, or when you're faced with a team member who's not pulling their weight, causing friction, or just not fitting in that's when you need a compass to guide you. And that's what this guide aims to be.</p>


<p>In the following sections, we'll delve into the various types of difficult employees you might encounter - from procrastinators and lone wolves to negative Nancies and over-promisers. We'll explore typical scenarios, describe their behaviors, and, most importantly, provide strategies for managing difficult employees effectively.</p>


<p>I will also touch a bit on the importance of communication techniques like Nonviolent Communication. We'll walk through the steps of implementing a Performance Improvement Plan and when it might be time to escalate issues and part ways.</p>


<pre>🏄 This guide is not a magic wand that will solve all your management challenges. But it's a starting point. It's also very subjective. Your mileage may vary. It's a collection of insights and advice that I hope will help you become a better manager to your team, even if some of them are not the most pleasant people to work with.</pre>


<p>So, let's embark on this journey together. Let's navigate these rough seas with your crew and turn challenges into opportunities for growth. As any seasoned sailor will tell you, it's not the calm seas but the storms that make a good captain.</p>


<h2 id="h-effectively-managing-the-norm">Effectively Managing the Norm</h2>


<p>Before diving deep into managing the difficult engineers, let’s focus first on managing those that are not as atypical. The "norm" refers to the majority of your team members who come in daily, do their job, and contribute to the team’s success — they’re competent professionals with healthy mental states and won't require any special attention. No issues, no conflicts, no special needs. These individuals form the backbone of your team and will probably represent 90% of the people you meet and work with.</p>


<p>I use a simple strategy to make sure these kinds of employees are happy — Trust, Growth, Comfort.</p>


<h3 id="h-trust">Trust</h3>


<p><strong>Trusting Them to Do the Right Things</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Assume Intelligence</strong>: Always start with the assumption that your team members are intelligent and will make informed decisions. This mindset fosters an environment of respect and empowers individuals to take initiative. It’s even better to assume they’re smarter than you and might know something you don’t. You probably hired them, so unless you’re hiring people who are worse than yourself (and I sure hope you don’t), you should assume they have better ideas than you do.</li>


<li><strong>Accountable Autonomy</strong>: Give them the freedom to make decisions and act on them. Keeping them accountable for those decisions is far more productive than questioning their every move. Autonomy comes with the price of accountability and should be stated explicitly. Do whatever you want, but you’re responsible for the fuck-ups as well.</li>


<li><strong>Allow fixable mistakes to happen</strong>: Trust means allowing room for errors. Of course, I’m not talking about senior developers with privileged access running rm -rf on production or dropping production database and deleting backups, and saying whoops — that’s a cause for corrective action. The mistakes can be divided into two parts: Mistakes that can be fixed and mistakes that cannot. Mistakes that can be fixed is anything where you write a postmortem, do a debriefing and continue on your way with lessons learned. Mistakes that cannot be fixed is people dying, something blowing up or your company going bankrupt. Allow them to make mistakes from which the company can recover and help them learn from them. <em><strong>Update: </strong>I suggest you also read the comments, there's a big discussion there regarding this point.</em></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h-growth">Growth</h3>


<p><strong>Challenging Them to Become Better</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Challenge Regularly</strong>: Push your team members out of their comfort zones. Not talking about dropping them cold into projects where they have zero knowledge and expecting them to perform. More of — encouraging them to take on tasks that stretch their abilities, a bit more complicated than they’re used to, fostering their growth.</li>


<li><strong>Praise and Recognition</strong>: Recognize their achievements. Show them the milestones they can reach and celebrate with them when they do — be it with monetary incentives or a public announcement of their achievements. This not only boosts morale but also motivates them to aim higher.</li>


<li><strong>Constructive Feedback and clear Path</strong>: While praise is essential, it's equally important to address areas where they’re lacking. Nobody is perfect, and some of us are better at different things. However, the focus should be on improving where we excel and pulling up those things we’re bad at. They’re good at algorithms but bad at databases — time to deep dive into DBs. They’re good at small tasks but struggle with bigger things — time to learn software architecture. In any way, the feedback should be a tool for growth, not a weapon for criticism.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="h-comfort">Comfort</h3>


<p><strong>Keeping It Comfortable</strong></p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Limit Interruptions</strong>: Respect their time and focus. Avoid unnecessary meetings and interruptions. Embrace asynchronous communication, allowing team members to respond when it's most convenient, fostering efficiency and respect for individual work rhythms. If the wheels are turning, there’s no need to run around interrupting them constantly. Let people work.</li>


<li><strong>Streamlined Processes</strong>: Ensure that all auxiliary processes, from software tools to administrative tasks, are efficient, user-friendly, and non-interrupting (see above). A smooth operational environment reduces frustration and allows team members to focus on what needs to be done without constant notifications.</li>


<li><strong>Less thinking, more creating</strong>: As software engineers are more creative, the fewer decisions they have to make outside of their project, the better decisions they make inside of the project. Instead of them figuring out, “Is tomorrow a non-working day or not” — make the info easily accessible. Instead of them figuring out where to get snacks — have snacks ready. You get the idea.</li>
</ul>


<p>The list above can be the catalyst that propels your team to a new steady height of productivity. These are low-hanging fruits that can create a positive atmosphere that permeates every line of code. It can enhance the quality of the software your team produces, ensuring that every product you deliver is as good as it possibly can be.</p>


<p>But let's not sugarcoat it - being an effective leader in a software engineering team is not without its challenges. You're dealing with people, each with their unique personalities, strengths, weaknesses, and quirks.</p>


<pre>🏄 One of the most common - and often most daunting - challenges is dealing with difficult employees. Whether it's the brilliant coder who can't meet a deadline, the seasoned engineer who struggles with teamwork, or the talented newcomer who's always negative — there will be many, many individuals that will not conform to the normal management described above, and you’ll need to adapt.</pre>


<p>Let's explore the challenging types of software engineers, understand their behaviors, and learn practical strategies to manage them. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about building great software; it's about having fun while building great teams.</p>


<h2 id="h-difficult-software-engineers">Difficult Software Engineers</h2>


<p><em>I use the term "difficult" to differentiate between those employees where everything is going smoothly, and those where more effort is required.</em></p>


<p>Why is it important to understand different types of difficult employees? Well, think of it this way - if you're trying to debug a piece of code, you first need to understand what each line of code is doing, right? Similarly, to address and manage problematic behaviors effectively, you first need to understand these behaviors, their motivations, and their impact on the team.</p>


<p>In this section, we'll explore a variety of difficult employee types that you might encounter in a software engineering team. Each of these types presents unique challenges and opportunities for growth and improvement. By understanding these behaviors, you'll be better equipped to manage them effectively, turning potential obstacles into stepping stones toward a more harmonious and productive team.</p>


<p><em>I want to note that some scenarios are hyperbolized, and I’m not a communications guru, so if you have better examples— please put them in the comments; much appreciated.</em></p>


<h3 id="the-procrastinator">The Procrastinator</h3>


<p>Imagine this: It's a week before a major software release. Your team is buzzing with activity, tying up loose ends, and running final tests. But there's one team member, let's call him Joe, who's yet to complete a crucial piece of the project. Despite repeated reminders, Joe always seems to have an excuse — the build is taking too long, or it works on my machine but is failing on staging — always promises to get it fixed by “tomorrow". This is a classic example of a Procrastinator.</p>


<p>Procrastinators tend to delay tasks, often focusing on less important tasks while ignoring the critical ones. They may have poor time management skills, often underestimating the time required to complete tasks. This behavior can lead to missed deadlines, increased stress for the team, and potential risks to the project.</p>


<p>Managing a Procrastinator requires a balance of firmness and support. Set clear deadlines and regularly check in on their progress. Make them accountable for those deadlines. Help them prioritize tasks and offer time management training if necessary. Ensure they update the Project Management tools daily with the progress made and things finished.</p>


<p><strong>Remember, the goal is not micromanaging but guiding them toward better work habits.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-lone-wolf">The Lone Wolf</h3>


<p>Picture this: Your team is brainstorming ideas for a new feature. Ideas are flying around, and the energy is high. But there's one person, let's call her Lisa, who's sitting quietly, not participating. Later, you find out that Lisa has gone ahead and started working on the feature without discussing her approach with the team. She assumed she knows best how to tackle the problem. This is a typical Lone Wolf scenario.</p>


<p>Lone Wolves assume they’re the most competent person and prefer to work alone, often resisting collaborative efforts — I mean, why would you need someone else’s help if they’re far inferior to you? Usually, they do not participate in team discussions unless to tell everyone that they “could’ve done that in 3 days”. While their self-reliance can sometimes be an asset, it can also lead to a lack of cohesion and potential misalignment with team goals. And most importantly — people don’t enjoy working with Lone Wolves.</p>


<pre>🏄 I see Lone Wolves as a teenager mentality. They’re stuck in this mindset that they’re the most brilliant badass coders ever.</pre>


<p>There are two ways to manage the Lone Wolf — to embrace or make them collaborate. Embracing the Lone Wolves means that this person is of very high value to your business, and keeping him comfortable is more important than the overall team morale. Not recommended, but still a possible tradeoff if the Lone Wolf is a 100x Engineer in your eyes.</p>


<p>Managing a Lone Wolf involves forcing a culture of collaboration. Encourage them to share their ideas in the meetings and involve them in team decisions more directly. It would be great if you could put them in a team where they would not be the smartest. Assign them a mentor to help them see themselves in a different light. Give them tasks that require collaboration and, most important of all — provide constructive criticism of their behavior and set ground rules for collaboration — they can either stay on the same level as they are now or grow out of this lone wolf mentality and be an even more awesome coder who people enjoy working with.</p>


<h3 id="the-negative-nancy">The Negative Nancy</h3>


<p>Let's set the scene: Your team is in a meeting discussing a new project. There's a sense of excitement in the air, a buzz of anticipation. But then there's one person, let's call him Mark, who seems to find a problem with every idea, a flaw in every plan. He constantly focuses on the negatives, rarely offers solutions, and thinks everything is impossible and the status quo is just fine. This is your typical Negative Nancy.</p>


<p>First of all — seeing issues in ideas is not a problem per se. It’s mostly the negative way the issue is portrayed. Suppose there’s a challenge that needs to be overcome to achieve the idea. In that case, Negative Nancies usually tend to say it’s impossible because of X, not that “we can make it happen if we do X and Y, which will require significant effort, but it’s still doable.”</p>


<p>Negative Nancies tend to overly focus on the negative aspects of situations, overlooking potential solutions. They may complain frequently, resist change, and spread negativity within the team. This behavior can dampen team morale and hinder creativity and innovation. “Why are they forcing us to do X? Urgh, I like how things are now.”</p>


<p>Managing a Negative Nancy involves understanding where they’re coming from — from a position of “nothing should affect my comfort, the more issues I find, the less I need to do and the less I need to move out of my comfort zone”. This negativity should be addressed directly and privately, asking them to bring solutions instead of problems. Encourage positive interactions and remind them that change will happen regardless of them and that things will move on without them if they continue to focus on the negatives. If the behavior continues, involving HR or considering whether this employee is a good fit for the team may be necessary.</p>


<h3 id="the-over-promiser">The Over-Promiser</h3>


<p>Imagine this: You're planning a new software release. One of your team members, let's call her Sarah, promises to deliver a complex functionality within a month. You're impressed by her confidence, but two weeks after she told you that “everything is fine, I’m handling it,” the functionality is nowhere near complete; even worse, it’s about 20% done. This is a classic Over-Promiser scenario.</p>


<p>Over-Promisers tend to be overly optimistic about their capabilities or the time required to complete tasks and secretive when things don’t go as planned. Even during status updates, they can say, “It’s going great,” even though they’re struggling to find a solution and face some blockers — because they still hope to finish it on time. They often fail to deliver on their promises, which leads to frustration and mistrust within the team and with the Product Owners.</p>


<pre>🏄 Over-Promisers are usually the younger developers who have not missed deadlines that often yet, and they’re still getting the hang of how much they can do and how fast.</pre>


<p>Managing an Over-Promiser involves setting realistic expectations together with the teammates — figuring out a proper deadline for this big thing that needs to be built and splitting it up into meaningful tasks (also together with the teammates) — after that, everyone agrees on how much time each of those parts will take. I don’t think there’s a way to help them make more accurate commitments besides getting more experience. If it’s a senior dev — make them accountable for the deadlines that they set. Encourage them to communicate early and openly about any challenges they're facing.</p>


<h3 id="the-know-it-all">The Know-It-All</h3>


<p>Possible Scenario: You're in a team meeting, discussing a complex problem. Different team members suggest solutions, debating pros and cons, and a healthy collaboration is happening. But then, all of a sudden, someone, let’s call him Alex, speaks up and says that he’s heard enough, everyone is stupid, all the solutions are bullshit, and his solution is the only correct one. No way you should question or poke holes in his suggestion, as nobody is more brilliant than him. He vehemently dismisses others' ideas and resists feedback. This is your typical Know-It-All.</p>


<pre>🏄 It’s very similar to lone wolf, but they don’t insist on working alone — they insist on their solution being built and praised.</pre>


<p>Know-It-Alls tend to be arrogant and closed-minded. They often lack the ability to listen to others and are highly resistant to change or new ideas. As you can imagine, this behavior is quite annoying for others who want to spar with ideas and figure out the best way to build something. Overall this stifles creativity, hinders team collaboration, and creates a hostile work environment.</p>


<p>Nobody enjoys working with the know-it-alls. They tend to shut down any, even small improvement suggestions. Imagine someone with a superiority complex — any hint that their idea is imperfect leads to a defensive discussion.</p>


<p>How to handle the know-it-all — the first step is addressing the behavior directly in a 1:1 meeting — they are likely unaware of their shortcomings, as they think everything they do is perfect. Send them this article, and tell them if they see themselves in the description above. After the confrontation — emphasize mutual respect and open-mindedness — all ideas need to be discussed/sparred/disassembled, even if they seem perfect; only then can anyone be sure the solution is correct. Encourage them to ask for feedback all the time.</p>


<p><strong>If the behavior continues, give a formal warning and consider involving HR in the meeting.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-silent-types">The Silent Type</h3>


<p>Scenario: Your team is in a lively discussion, brainstorming ideas for a new awesome feature. Everyone is participating except for one person. Let’s call her Emily. She sits quietly, not contributing to the discussion. Later, you find out that she had a great idea but didn't feel comfortable sharing it. This is a typical Silent Type scenario.</p>


<blockquote>
<p>I’m writing about this type irrespective of the gender of the person. Still, I’d like to point out that female developers often have a more challenging time voicing their opinion when the team culture is similar to the frat house and values the loudest voices the most.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Silent Types, in general, tend to be introverted and may struggle with communication. Even though they might immediately see the issues with the solution, they might think, “It’s not worth it to share the concerns, to antagonize someone.” They often keep their thoughts to themselves, which can lead to misunderstandings or missed opportunities for collaboration.</p>


<pre>🏄 The silent type is usually a by-product of a toxic culture where the conflicts don’t get resolved in a healthy way; hence everyone avoids them instead of dealing with them head-on. This also means other “bad” archetypes are present on the team, e.g., the know-it-all.</pre>


<p>Managing a Silent Type involves creating a safe and inclusive environment and encouraging others to speak up even when there will be conflicts of ideas. Healthy debates must happen regularly so everyone sees that voicing their opinion is not something to be afraid of. Provide various channels/platforms for communication — one-on-one meetings, meetings in a smaller group, group chats, email discussion — which may be more comfortable for them.</p>


<p><strong>But most important, recognize and value their contributions to make them feel more included even if they’re not the loudest voice in the room.</strong></p>


<h3 id="the-perfectionist">The Perfectionist</h3>


<p>So, let’s set the scene: You see a Pull Request pop up from one of your team members. Let’s call him Tom. You start reviewing a piece of code — The code is well-written and does the job, but Tom is not satisfied. He's been tweaking and refining it for days, trying to make it "perfect,” eventually turning it into a one-liner. The problem? Other tasks are piling up, deadlines are looming, code looks cool only to Tom, and Tom's quest for perfection is causing delays. This is your typical Perfectionist.</p>


<p>Very often, Perfectionists are recent graduates. They tend to focus on minute details, often at the expense of the bigger picture. They may struggle with the KISS principles and delegation and have high, sometimes unrealistic, standards for themselves and others. In their mind, the code is art, and they should not be rushed while creating an art piece. This behavior leads to inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and increased stress for the whole team.</p>


<p>So how can you manage a perfectionist? <strong>Easy. Lower their expectations of themselves, help them focus on what's most important — a working solution that is not-overengineered, does not read like a poem, and is maintainable in 2 years.</strong> Encourage them to prioritize simple solutions and set realistic standards. Ask them for a second opinion on the “readiness” of the code.</p>


<p>If necessary, provide coaching on time management and book suggestions to build effective coding habits.</p>


<h3 id="the-unreliable-one">The Unreliable One</h3>


<p>Scenario: You're managing a project with a tight deadline. One of your team members, let's call her Anna, is responsible for a critical part of the project. Despite her assurances that she'll complete the task on time, the deadline comes and goes, and the task is still incomplete. This is a classic Unreliable One scenario.</p>


<p>Unreliable employees are identified by their tardiness — constantly late, submitting unfinished work, and skipping meetings. They lack commitment, discipline, or time management skills. Or all three combined. Their inconsistent performance can lead to mistrust and frustration within the team and potentially (highly likely) jeopardize project timelines.</p>


<p>Managing an Unreliable One involves setting clear expectations and holding them accountable — meaning giving formal warning after the first incident. During the first incident, provide feedback on the impact of their behavior on the team and the project. If the habit continues, set up a performance improvement plan and agree transparently on future disciplinary action. Remember, reliability is a key component of a high-performing team, and addressing issues promptly and effectively is important.</p>


<p><strong>If you don’t handle the unreliable employees, you’re doing a disservice to your team, who are trying to be effective and rely on them. </strong>They will need to spend time thinking about ways to work around them rather than work with them.</p>


<h3 id="the-conflict-instigator">The Conflict Instigator</h3>


<p>Picture this: Your team is working harmoniously on a project, but there's one person, let's call him Jake, who seems to thrive on conflict. He makes fun of others’ code, pokes at people, and often instigates arguments, spreads rumors, or creates a hostile environment. This is your typical Conflict Instigator.</p>


<p>Conflict Instigators tend to be argumentative, aggressive, and disruptive. They thrive on drama and create a toxic work environment. This behavior can lead to decreased team morale, increased stress, and reduced productivity.</p>


<p>In my opinion (Of course, you can correct me in the comments) — There’s only one way to handle such employees — with immediate addressing of the actions in private, emphasizing the importance of staying professional and a zero-tolerance policy for such behavior in the future. If it continues — cut fast and don’t look back. It’s not worth the effort to keep them on the team. Remember, a healthy team is a productive team, and toxic conflict should be addressed promptly and effectively.</p>


<h3 id="the-burned-out-employee">The Burned-Out Employee</h3>


<p>Scenario: One of your top performers, let's call her Lisa, has been showing signs of burnout. She's been great the last year, hitting milestone after milestone, but recently she’s been working long hours, missing deadlines, and seems disengaged. She's not the enthusiastic, motivated team member she used to be. This is a typical Burned-Out Employee scenario.</p>


<pre>🏄 I don’t consider a burned-out employee as a “bad employee,” but they can still have a negative impact — they are the ones you need to help and make sure they can thrive again.</pre>


<p>Burned-out employees exhibit signs of exhaustion, cynicism, and reduced professional efficacy. They struggle to meet deadlines, have the lowest output on the team, and make more mistakes than over the previous observable period.</p>


<p>Managing a Burned-Out Employee involves addressing the issue with as much empathy and concern as you have. Suggest they take a vacation or sabbatical. Go all-in on work-life balance and provide resources for stress management.</p>


<p>Remember, your team members are your most valuable asset, and their well-being should always be a priority.</p>


<h2 id="communication-tips">Communication Tips</h2>


<p>Managing difficult employees means figuring out ways to ensure you and your employees thrive, even if the circumstances are against you. One tool stands out as particularly crucial: communication. In a software engineering team, clear and effective communication is not just a nice-to-have; it's a must-have. Bad communication is the reason teams fail.</p>


<p>Think about it. How often have you seen a project go off track due to a simple misunderstanding? How many conflicts could have been avoided with better communication? How many great ideas have been lost in the noise of poor communication?</p>


<h3 id="nonviolent-communication">Nonviolent Communication</h3>


<p>One powerful communication tool I've found particularly useful is Nonviolent Communication (NVC). Developed by psychologist Marshall Rosenberg, NVC is a method of communication that promotes empathy and understanding.</p>


<p>At its core, NVC involves four steps: Observation, Feeling, Need, and Request.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Observation</strong> involves stating the facts we observe that are affecting our well-being.</li>


<li><strong>Feeling</strong> is about sharing how we feel in relation to what we observe.</li>


<li><strong>Need</strong> is expressing what we need or value that is causing our feelings.</li>


<li><strong>Request</strong> involves clearly requesting what we want without demanding it.</li>
</ul>


<p>In a management context, NVC can be a game-changer. It can help you communicate effectively with your team, constructively address issues, and build strong, positive relationships.</p>


<p>I’m not going to talk much about it, but I’m going to give you some links to read:</p>

</ul>


<h3 id="active-listening-and-empathy">Active Listening and Empathy</h3>


<p>As a manager, your role is not just to talk; it's also to listen. Active listening is a crucial skill that involves fully focusing on the speaker, understanding their message, and responding thoughtfully. It's not just about hearing the words; it's about understanding the emotions, ideas, and thoughts behind those words.</p>


<pre>🏄 My business partner, who’s a great salesperson, has this rule — after someone finishes talking to you — wait a few seconds before responding, organize your thoughts, and process what they said, only after you’re sure they’ve said everything they wanted to do you respond to them.</pre>


<p>Active listening can be improved through paraphrasing, asking open-ended questions, and showing empathy. Empathy, the ability to understand and share the feelings of others, plays a crucial role in management. Cultivating compassion involves being open to others' perspectives, showing genuine interest in their experiences, and responding with kindness and understanding. <strong>Simply put, before you judge anyone as a "difficult" employee, you put yourself in their shoes and see from their side.</strong> Talk with them, listen, we're all humans.</p>


<p>Your role is not just to lead; it's also to support, understand, and inspire.</p>


<h2 id="what-to-do-next">What to do next?</h2>


<p>Once you've identified and understood the types of difficult employees in your team and have communicated effectively with them, the question arises - what's the next step? What are the options? This section will guide you through the subsequent stages, from implementing Performance Improvement Plans to escalating issues when necessary.</p>


<h3 id="performance-improvement-plans">Performance Improvement Plans</h3>


<p><strong>If, after many 1:1s with the person, you could not find a solution that helps both — the employee and the company — and they still continue behavior, it's time to make it formal.</strong></p>


<p>A Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) is a formal document that outlines an employee's performance issues and the steps they need to take to improve. It's an escalation tool that can help managers address performance issues in a structured, supportive manner.</p>


<p>A PIP may be necessary when an employee's performance is consistently not meeting expectations, despite feedback and coaching. It's a step that should be taken when other, less formal interventions have not resulted in any improvement.</p>


<p>Implementing a PIP involves several steps — first, clearly outline the performance issues and the expected improvements. Then, set realistic, measurable goals and a timeline for achieving them. Provide support and resources to help the employee improve, and schedule regular check-ins to discuss progress.</p>


<p>Monitoring progress is crucial. Regular feedback can help the employee understand where they're improving and where they still need to work. Remember, the goal of a PIP is not to punish but to support the employee in their transformation and to improve their performance.</p>


<p>To illustrate, let's consider a case study. An engineer in our team was consistently missing deadlines and marking tickets as done that would later be returned from the QA as unfinished. We implemented a PIP, setting clear expectations and defining strict rules how the behavior needed to change. Regular check-ins helped keep the engineer on track, and within a few months, their performance had significantly improved. The key lessons? Making it formal — helps a lot. It’s like getting a police ticket; people tend to react more seriously when you make it clear that it’s already escalating.</p>


<h3 id="time-to-escalate">Time to Escalate</h3>


<p>Sometimes, despite your best efforts, an issue may need to be escalated. This could be due to persistent performance issues, serious misconduct, or if the employee's behavior negatively affects the team, e.g., with the conflict instigator.</p>


<p>Documenting the issue is crucial. Keep a record of the performance issues, the steps taken to address them, and the employee's response. This documentation can provide a clear picture of the problem and the efforts made to resolve it.</p>


<p>When escalating an issue, follow your organization's procedures. This may involve discussing the matter with HR or higher management. Remember, escalation is not a failure on your part as a manager. It's a step towards resolving an issue that's beyond your control. It's about ensuring a positive, productive work environment for your entire team.</p>


<h3 id="time-to-part-ways">Time to Part Ways</h3>


<p>There will come a time when, despite all efforts to improve a situation, it becomes clear that an employee is not a good fit for the team or the organization. This is a difficult realization and one that should not be taken lightly.</p>


<p>Termination should be considered when an employee's behavior or performance is consistently and significantly below expectations, despite repeated feedback, coaching, and support. Other reasons might include severe misconduct or an evident lack of alignment with the company's values or culture.</p>


<p>Termination is a last resort and should be considered only when all other avenues have been exhausted. It's a decision that can significantly impact the individual and the team, so it's crucial to handle it with care.</p>


<p>The process should be clear, fair, and transparent. The employee should be informed of the decision in a private, face-to-face meeting, and the reasons for the termination should be explained clearly. Treat the employee, even if you think they’re a “bad employee,” with respect and dignity throughout the process. Offer support where possible, and provide feedback to help them in their future careers.</p>


<p>Managing difficult employees is not just about addressing problematic habits; it's about understanding these behaviors, communicating effectively, and guiding your team members toward improvement. </p>


<p>Everyone has to have a second chance at becoming better.</p>
