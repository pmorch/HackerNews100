<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        
        <small>2023-08-25</small>
        <p>Elixir is the thing I do most of my public writing and speaking about. It is my default programming language for the last 5-6 years. It suits my brain. Performs well for the kind of work I typically do. And using it I have experienced very few drawbacks. Rather than writing yet another post trying to widely summarize what I think is beneficial about the language I want to try and go a bit deeper on one particular aspect I like. Not incredibly technically deep, but unpack the concepts more thoroughly. I hope this will be a series of stand-alone posts. We will see. This time we unpack Elixir concurrency (and parallelism).</p>
<p>My origin story is steeped in PHP. In PHP the concurrency model is pretty much whatever your web server (mod_php) or app server (php-fpm?) decides it should be. PHP generally assumes a shared-nothing model and each request is clear of whatever work is done in the others. In this regard work can run concurrently but they can also not share anything without reaching for external files, databases, queues or similar.</p>
<p>Then I went to Python. Over in Python .. it depends. It is really bad at concurrency. Ordinary threading is available but enormously constrained by the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock). The best solution seems to be just running more interpreters or using Python multiprocess which I believe forks new processes. I liked Python. I didn’t enjoy trying to do performant concurrency in Python though.</p>
<p>Elixir builds on Erlang. Fundamentally everything I’m writing about here is thanks to the Erlang virtual machine, aka. the BEAM, which has this stuff at its core. I will write in the context of Elixir. The things that are great here are also great about Erlang. Except possibly the Task module, which is kind of neat. That could also be done with Erlang but I don’t know if anyone has.</p>
<p>The BEAM is made to run a ton of lightweight processes. A type of green thread if you will. They take very little time to spawn, they take very little memory. A system can have millions of them. And if you need many millions of them you can bump the default limit. They are fundamentally a different thing from OS processes and threads. The BEAM itself is scheduled by the OS but on startup the BEAM creates threads for its schedulers. One per available CPU core by default. These in turn take care of scheduling processes. This is the source of concurrency and parallelism.</p>
<p>We won’t go into detail on the Actor model and how that works here but that is built on top of the fundamental primitive of a process. A process runs a function, the function only has access to its own local variables and private copies of whatever arguments were passed in. This is Functional Programming so everything is immutable. A process cannot change the values in another function. This function running in a process has two cool special bits of API it can use. It can receive messages and it can send messages. If the function runs to completion the Process goes bye-bye. If the process runs in an eternal loop checking for messages and only acts if a message comes in? Then we end up talking about the Actor model again which I said we won’t do. So lets move on.</p>
<p>A process runs on one of the schedulers. If many processes taking a long time creates a queue on one scheduler the other schedulers can start stealing work to balance it out. If a particular process goes through a lot of function calls (internally called reductions), say 4000 for example, without completing then the scheduler will pre-empt it. That means freeze it, mid-run, and send it back to the end of the work queue. This is called pre-emptive multitasking and it is what Linux does to the OS processes. In the BEAM nothing gets to hold up the line for very long. This is how it ensures low latency which is another topic I hope to unpack at a different time.</p>
<p>The immutable FP nature of Elixir and Erlang are pragmatic choices that were made to achieve a bunch of goals. It predates multi-core machines by a fair bit and they were targeting a different kind of concurrency, distributed systems made up of multiple machines, a cluster. The end result was accidentally convenient for achieving incredibly concurrency and parallelism on multi-core machines. Processes do not share state, they can only communicate asynchronously through message passing. This ensures it is safe to run them at the same time. Same time as in concurrent, executing the tasks during the same period of time. Also parallel, executing the tasks at the same time. All APIs that touch files or other constrained resources, stdin/stdout and such, have mechanisms for ensuring that contention is under control. The Erlang folks have spent a lot of time getting this right.</p>
<p>When I write my code I generally don’t need to care about this very much. Most web requests take place inside a single process. They might communicate on through to a database connection pool which involves more processes but overall I don’t need to care about the underlying primitives. I also don’t need to think about the Node.js way of racing to IO. Node.js can be highly concurrent. CPU-bound work is fine on the BEAM. It won’t disrupt the ability of other processes to get work done, both because multiple cores can do the work but also because if I spend many CPU cycles I will be pre-empted and other work can slip by. This is all handled by the web server I use, more than by me.</p>
<p>If I do want to do concurrent work there is the usual async/await mechanisms, implemented in the Task module. Not as weird as in JS. They just return a Task reference which is a helpful abstraction on top of the Process ID or PID. Then you can await on it to get a result or await on multiple to get multiple results. There is also a wicked function called Task.async_stream which will take an enumerable (list, map, stream or similar) and run a Task for each entry as a lazy stream. By default it has a concurrency matching the number of available cores (just like the schedulers). This is essentially a fancy shortcut for using all your machine has to offer in the service of getting the work done for tasks that are embarrassingly concurrent. It is very fun to use when bodging together scripts that you want to go fast.</p>
<p>Compared to PHP I have many more tools for interacting across the work that happens in my system. Process registries and groups, PubSub mechanisms for message passing, memory-based shared state accessed through safe mechanisms (ETS for example).</p>
<p>Compared to Python I can do multiple things at once in simple and useful ways. In a language that is as expressive and as dynamic (in the places I care about).</p>
<p>Compared to Javascript I can do multiple things at once easily without worrying about CPU-bound work holding up other requests and such. I get actual immutability instead of working really hard to pretend I do.</p>
<p>These comparisons are of course based on my understandings and experiences with the languages. I’ve stuck with languages I have some experience with but I don’t hang out with them on a regular basis currently. If I have misrepresented any of them, do let me know.</p>
<p>In summary; great options for concurrency and parallelism are not an afterthought in Elixir and Erlang. They are built into the very foundation of the runtime and the languages surface it to us. This matters for performance and practicality. Doing concurrency on the BEAM is not punishing, it is not risky. It is just what you end up doing by using it.</p>

<h5><strong>85 web pages and 52 videos entirely devoted<br>to helping you drill your own well</strong></h5>







<p>You can drill your own shallow water well using PVC and household water hoses.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a cheap and effective way to dig your own shallow water well.&nbsp; Water well drilling isn’t just for the pros with huge commercial drilling rigs.&nbsp; Digging a water well yourself is both interesting and fun.</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_page_title - under_page_title --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_page_title - under_page_title --><div><figure><img src="http://drillyourownwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ready-to-Start-low-res.jpg" alt="How to Drill Your Own Water Well" width="583" height="778" srcset="https://drillyourownwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ready-to-Start-low-res.jpg 500w, https://drillyourownwell.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Ready-to-Start-low-res-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px"></figure></div>







<p>The water well drilling methods described here work well in digging/drilling through dirt, and clay, including really hard clay.&nbsp; They will not work if you need to drill through rock but, if the area you live in is flat or relatively flat, it is definitely worth a try.&nbsp; Many folks think they have to dig or drill their well into an aquifer.&nbsp; For irrigation and lawn watering, reaching an aquifer isn’t necessary.&nbsp; You only have to drill under the standing water level. It is very likely that you can drill your own well.&nbsp; Many successful wells have been drilled using this well drilling method.&nbsp; It is cheap.  You can expect the “drilling” portion of the project to cost about $200. <span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_first_paragraph - under_first_paragraph -->

<p>In these pages the “do it yourself water well drilling” technique is referred to as well drilling, but many call this technique “washing” or “jetting” a well.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is somewhat similar to the rotary bit method which most real water well drillers use for water bore drilling.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<p>The DIY technique involves water pumped down the center of a PVC schedule 40 pipe used as both a drill stem and a drill bit.&nbsp; At the bottom end of the PVC pipe a “drill bit” is fashioned by cutting teeth into the end of the PVC pipe.&nbsp; The pipe is rotated back and forth as the PVC pipe is slowly worked into the ground while the cuttings are brought to the surface by the upward flow of water in the annular space around the pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you want to dig your own well, try this technique.&nbsp;</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph --><!-- Ezoic - gen_under_second_paragraph - under_second_paragraph -->



<p>Installing a well and a pump can save a lot of money, especially if you are now paying the local utility for irrigation water.&nbsp; You have probably noticed that just watering the lawn can get expensive.&nbsp; You can spend less money watering the lawn.&nbsp; Actually, you can spend almost no money watering the lawn.&nbsp; It is great for gardeners, too.<span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p>



<p>If you are a first time visitor to the site you will probably want to start out with either the “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/background/"><span>Background</span></a>” or the “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/basic-well-drilling-steps/"><span>Basic Well Drilling Steps</span></a>” pages.&nbsp; The bulk of the site is dedicated to drilling water wells using just two hoses for drilling fluid.&nbsp; Inexpensive PVC is used for the drill pipe, the drill bit, and the well screen.&nbsp; This DIY water well drilling technique is very cheap and many successful shallow wells have been installed using this technique.&nbsp;</p><p>When drilling a well by hand, it can be very helpful to at least be familiar with the techniques used by real well drillers – the kind with big powerful trucks and huge water tanks.&nbsp; What we do is extremely similar, almost identical.&nbsp; We can’t dig holes as wide or as deep but it is the same process.&nbsp; A local well drilling company was kind enough to let me video their process.&nbsp; Check it out at “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/real-well-drilling/">Real Well Drilling</a>.”</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- Ezoic - gen_mid_content - mid_content --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-640x360-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-426x240-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-clearholder --><!-- ezoic_video_placeholder-under_second_paragraph-384x216-999997-nonexxxclearxxxblock -->



<p>There are several enhancements you can make to the basic DIY well drilling technique.&nbsp; To make the technique even more effective you can use the techniques described on the pages, “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/drilling-deeper-with-bentonite/">Drilling Deeper with BENTONITE</a>” and “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/drill-10-feet-deeper/">Drill 10 Feet Deeper</a>.”&nbsp; Additionally, converting to a metal drill bit will make your drilling more productive.&nbsp; These are all techniques that were sent in by users of the site and discovered as they drilled their wells.<span data-ez-name="drillyourownwell_com-box-4"></span></p>



<p>A gravel pack can increase a well’s production so there is a section on them.&nbsp; I don’t recommend you include a gravel pack on your first well but after you get the hang of the technique this is something you will probably want to check out the pages on <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/about-well-screens-and-gravel-packs/">gravel packs</a>.</p>



<p>Don’t go shopping for a pump without reading this page:  <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/which-pump/">Which Pump?</a>  You want a shallow well pump, also known as a suction pump.  Pool pumps and other types of transfer pumps will not work.</p>



<p>In the “Videos” section, you will find videos that show techniques used world wide.&nbsp; Some of these techniques, like the <a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/the-baptist-method/">Baptist Method</a>, require very little drilling fluid and have been used for centuries.</p><!-- End Ezoic - gen_long_content - long_content --><!-- Ezoic - gen_long_content - long_content --><p>We’ve been fortunate enough to receive some input from Bob Tabor, a real well driller who has been drilling wells all of his life.&nbsp; Please be sure and check out the page –&nbsp;<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/advice-from-a-real-well-driller/">“Advice from a REAL Well Driller.”</a></p>



<p>Bill Granade in Tampa, Florida has developed a very similar DIY water well drilling technique.&nbsp; He has been wildly successful.&nbsp; Bill has helped his neighbors drill a bunch of wells his protocols may be useful to you.&nbsp; Look under “<a href="https://drillyourownwell.com/another-home-driller/">Another Home Driller</a>.”</p>

<p>Somewhere, ol' Beelzebub is putting on his thickest coat because Apple has endorsed a right-to-repair bill, suggesting hell has frozen over. In a letter dated August 22, Apple showed its support for California's right-to-repair bill, <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202320240SB244">SB 244</a>, after spending years combatting DIY repair efforts.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/">TechCrunch</a>, the letter, written to California state Senator Susan Eggman, declared that Apple supports SB 244 and urged the legislature to pass it.</p>
<p>The bill requires vendors of consumer electronics and appliances to make sufficient documentation, parts, and tools for repairs available to customers and independent repair shops. The big exceptions are video game consoles and alarm systems.</p>
<p>The bill has been praised by right-to-repair activists like iFixit, who says the bill goes further than right-to-repair laws passed in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/minnesota-enacts-right-to-repair-law-that-covers-more-devices-than-any-other-state/">Minnesota</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/ny-passes-right-to-repair-will-require-tech-oems-to-share-tools-diagnostic-info/">New York</a>. Minnesota's law was considered the most all-encompassing right-to-repair legislation yet. Some activists, though, lamented that companies aren't required to sell parts and tools for devices not actively sold. California's bill, however, keeps vendors on the hook for three years after the last date of manufacture if the product is $50 to $99.99 and seven years if it's over $99.99.</p>
<p>The bill also allows a city, county, or state to bring a related case to superior court rather than only a state attorney general, as noted by iFixit's <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/79902/apples-u-turn-tech-giant-finally-backs-repair-in-california">blog post </a>Wednesday.</p>
<h2>Apple’s stipulations</h2>
<p>According to what appears to be a PDF of Apple's letter shared by sites including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843506/apple-california-right-to-repair-sb-244">The Verge</a>, Apple decided to support the SB 244 bill since it has requirements around "individual users’ safety and security, as well as product manufacturers’ intellectual property." It's signed by D. Michael Foulkes<strong>,</strong> director of state and local government affairs at Apple.</p>
<p>The letter notes that Apple was able to "engage" with the senators and staff on the bill.</p>
<p>It goes on to list the tech giant's conditions for continued support of the bill. Those conditions include that the bill not feature a requirement for manufacturers to enable repair providers to disable device security features.</p>
<p>Apple's letter also asked that the bill "focus on requiring manufacturers obligations to provide the documentation tools, and parts to enable the repairs performed by authorized repair channels, as opposed to a broader undefined scope of repairs." Apple also wants repair providers to mention when they're using "non-genuine or used" components.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The bill, as written, also requires non-authorized repairers to provide written notice of their lack of official vendor approval.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Chamberlain, director of sustainability at iFixit, told Ars Technica that while disclosing the use of third-party parts is reasonable, she's concerned that it "supports unnecessary fear-mongering around used and third-party parts."</p>
<p>"I also worry that lumping used and third-party parts together will contribute to further confusion. Apple's 'unable to verify' warnings already blur the line between those categories," she added.</p>
<p>California's final bill "should balance device integrity, usability, and physical safety" with the right to repair, Apple's letter reportedly says.</p>
<h2>Apple flip-flops</h2>
<p>Apple's letter is a reverse-course on the battle against right-to-repair efforts that it's been fighting for a decade, as noted via Repair.org Executive Director Gay Gordon-Byrne through a US PIRG press release Wednesday. That includes in California, where in 2019, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia">The Verge</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wjvdb4/apple-is-telling-lawmakers-people-will-hurt-themselves-if-they-try-to-fix-iphones">Motherboard</a> reported that an Apple representative met with legislators, encouraging them to kill a right-to-repair bill over alleged consumer safety concerns. That bill was pulled soon after.</p>
<p>In 2017, then-Nebraska state Senator Lydia Brasch was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pgxgpg/apple-tells-lawmaker-that-right-to-repair-iphones-will-turn-nebraska-into-a-mecca-for-hackers">quoted</a> as saying an Apple representative told her that if Nebraska passed its right-to-repair bill, it would be the only state to do such a thing and become a "mecca" for hackers. In 2016, there were concerns of anti-repair behavior via "<a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/411395/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ios-crippling-error-53/">Error 53</a>," which could befall iOS devices that underwent an unauthorized repair.</p>
<p>Despite its past, Apple is sharing support for a California right-to-repair bill that it, apparently, deems fit. Ironically, Apple's letter attempts to frame itself as a bit of a right-to-repair leader, pointing to its Authorized Repair Provider Program launched in 2016, the Independent Repair Provider Program it debuted in 2019, and its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-will-soon-send-parts-and-tools-to-users-who-want-to-repair-their-phones/">Self-Service Repair Program</a> introduced in 2022. The latter, however, is far from covering all of the consumer electronics Apple makes and has its own <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/macbook-self-repair-program-highlights-apples-flawed-repairability-progress/">criticisms</a>.</p>
<p>As noted by TechCrunch, this week it's rare to see a vendor speak out on the right to repair rather than speaking through an industry group. No other big name in tech has shared public support for SB 244.</p>
<p>So why now?</p>
<p>Nathan Proctor, senior director of US Public Interest Research Group's (PIRG's) Right to Repair Campaign, wagered a guess to Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>My best guess is that it's because we were able to pass a bill in Minnesota, and it has become clear that we have the ability to pass these bills. At that point, you can either try to have some input, maybe get some good PR while you are at it ... because you can't stop us. We are glad that the company has decided to do the right thing, whatever the reason.</p></blockquote>

Améliorer l'article sur sympy jacobian pour parler du fait que scipy fait l'estimation de la dérivée alors qu'on peut des fois la calculer sans problème avec sympy.

Au delà des réseaux de neurones, beaucoup d'algorithmes d'optimisation demande le calcul du gradient, c'est à dire du vecteur qui va contenir toutes les dérivées partielles. La fonction `scipy.optimize.optimize` de la bibliothèque Numpy/Scipy va estimer le gradient en un point $x$ avec la formule suivante :   
$$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} $$  
On peut obtenir un résultat numérique de la dérivée de $f$ au point $x$, mais ce sera une approximation, et il faudra appeler deux fois la fonction $f$, ce qui peut être coûteux. -->

<p>---&gt; <a href="https://vmartin.fr/comprendre-la-differenciation-automatique-en-30-lignes-de-python-fr.html">French version of this article</a></p>
<p>I'm a Machine Learning engineer and I use libraries like Tensorflow and Pytorch in my work to train my neural networks. And it's been a while since I wanted to write the simplest piece of code to perform what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation">automatic differentiation</a> which is at the heart of neural network training.<br>
In this article, I will try to iteratively build the simplest code to calculate derivatives automatically on scalars.</p>
<p>In the following Python code, the sum between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will be performed and the result (<code>8</code>) will be assigned to the variable <code>z</code>. After the assignment, the <code>z</code> variable keeps no track of the variables used, so there is no way to automatically update the value of <code>z</code> if the value of <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> changes. Even less possible to understand the link between each variable to calculate a derivative automatically.</p>



<h2>The <code>Tensor</code> class</h2>
<p>The idea is to create a new type, a <code>Tensor</code>, which will allow us to do <strong>symbolic calculation</strong> on our variables.<br>
Let's start by creating a <code>Tensor</code> class where the addition operation is redefined.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>numpy</span> <span>as</span> <span>np</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__repr__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>f</span><span>"T:</span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>}</span><span>"</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__add__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>other</span><span>):</span>
        <span>t</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>+</span> <span>other</span><span>.</span><span>value</span><span>)</span>

<span># T:3 T:5</span>
<span># T:8</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>In this example, we create a <code>Tensor</code> class that can store a value, and we redefine addition to create a new <code>Tensor</code> when we perform an addition between two <code>Tensors</code>. There is no symbolic computation mechanism yet that will allow <code>z</code> to have a trace that it is the result of the addition between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.<br>
We will add this behavior by using <strong>a binary tree</strong>. Each tensor will be able to contain the other two tensors and the operation that produced it. To do this, we introduce the Children tuple which will contain these three pieces of information.</p>

<p>Now a tensor, in addition to containing a numerical value, will contain the tuple <code>children</code> allowing it to keep track of the calculation. In this example, in addition to introducing the <code>Children</code> type, we have added the multiplication method to tensors. The <code>forward</code> method to the <code>Tensor</code> class has also been added to be able to <strong>execute the computation graph</strong> and compute the actual value of the tensors. The tensor <code>z2</code> can be modeled by the following computation graph.</p>
<!-- ![Pelican](imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyzz1.png =100x20) -->

<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyz1z2.png" alt="Computation graph of the tensor z2" width="300"></p>
<p>We can check that it works as expected by first creating the graph without specifying any values:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>None</span><span>)</span>
<span>z1</span> <span>=</span> <span>x</span> <span>+</span> <span>y</span>
<span>z2</span> <span>=</span> <span>z1</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z2</span><span>)</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:None T:None</span>
<span># T:None</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Then the values of the leaves of the tree (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) can be changed and the value of <code>z2</code> calculated. The call to <code>z2.forward()</code> will cause the <code>forward</code> method of <code>z</code> and <code>y</code> to be called, and these calls will browse the graph to recursively calculate the value of <code>z2</code>.  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span>
<span>y</span><span>.</span><span>value</span> <span>=</span> <span>5</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z2</span><span>.</span><span>forward</span><span>())</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:40</span>
</code></pre></div>



<h2>Adding Automatic Differenciation</h2>
<p>To add automatic differentiation to an arbitrary computation graph, we simply add the derivative for the basic operations supported by our <code>Tensor</code> class. Recursive calls to the <code>grad</code> function will traverse the computation graph and decompose a complex function to be derived into a combination of simple functions.</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>def</span> <span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>,</span> <span>deriv_to</span><span>):</span>
    <span># Derivative of a tensor with itself is 1</span>

        <span>return</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

    <span># Derivative of a scalar with another tensor is 0</span>

        <span>raise</span> <span>NotImplementedError</span><span>(</span><span>f</span><span>"This op is not implemented. </span><span>{</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>children</span><span>.</span><span>op</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>t</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>We can now derive <code>z2</code> as a function of the variable of our choice:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>g</span> <span>=</span> <span>z2</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>g</span><span>)</span>

<span># Out</span>
<span># T:3 T:5</span>
<span># T:13</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>Here, <code>g</code> is not just a value, <strong>it is a new computational graph</strong> that represents the partial derivative of <code>z2</code> as a function of <code>y</code>. Since the value of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> was defined when <code>grad</code> was called, the value of <code>g</code> could be calculated. The calculation graph of <code>g</code> can be represented by this diagram:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_xyz1z2_grad.png" alt="Computation graph of the partial derivative of z2 in function of y" width="300"></p>
<p>Literally $g = \frac{\partial z_2}{\partial y} = x + 2*y$, and when <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are 3 and 5 respectively, then <code>g</code> is 13.</p>
<h3>Enabling the <code>Tensor</code> class to handle more complex formulas</h3>
<p>To be able to use more complex formulas, we will add more operations to the <code>Tensor</code> class. We add subtraction, division, exponential and negation (<code>-x</code>).<br>
Here is the <code>Tensor</code> class in its final form:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>class</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>:</span>

<p>For each operation added to the <code>Tensor</code> class, the corresponding derivative has been included in the <code>grad</code> method. Also, we have modified <code>forward</code> to handle more cases, especially to handle operations that require only one term like exponential or negation.    </p>
<p>Now let's create a more complex formula and derive it!<br>
Let's try to derive $z$ :</p>
<p>$$z = \frac{12 - (x * e^{y})}{45 + x * y * e^{-x}}$$
<!-- $$z = (12 - (x * exp(y))) / (45 + x * y * exp(-x) )$$ --></p>
<p>We just have to write this equation using our <code>Tensor</code> class:  </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>z</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>12</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>()))</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>Tensor</span><span>(</span><span>45</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>x</span> <span>*</span> <span>y</span> <span>*</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>x</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will generate for the tensor <code>z</code>, the following computation graph:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe.png" alt="Computation graph of z" width="300"></p>
<p>We can now easily calculate the partial derivative of <code>z</code> as a function of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> with the following code: </p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>))</span> <span># T:-3.34729777301069</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>z</span><span>.</span><span>grad</span><span>(</span><span>y</span><span>))</span> <span># T:-9.70176956641438</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>This will generate the following two graphs:</p>
<p><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe_grad_x.png" alt="Computation graph of derivative of z in function of x"><img src="https://vmartin.fr/imgs/auto-diff/graph_complexe_grad_y.png" alt="Computation graph of derivative of z in function of y"></p>
<p>Finally, to check that our automatic derivation system works, we can compare the numerical calculation of our derivatives with the calculation done by the Sympy library:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>import</span> <span>sympy</span> <span>as</span> <span>sym</span>

<span>xs</span> <span>=</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>'xs'</span><span>)</span>
<span>ys</span> <span>=</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>Symbol</span><span>(</span><span>'ys'</span><span>)</span>
<span>zs</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>12</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>xs</span> <span>*</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)))</span> <span>/</span> <span>(</span><span>45</span> <span>+</span> <span>((</span><span>xs</span> <span>*</span> <span>ys</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>sym</span><span>.</span><span>exp</span><span>(</span><span>-</span><span>xs</span><span>))</span> <span>)</span>

<span>d</span> <span>=</span> <span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>xs</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>evalf</span><span>(</span><span>subs</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>}))</span> <span># -3.34729777301069</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>zs</span><span>.</span><span>diff</span><span>(</span><span>ys</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>evalf</span><span>(</span><span>subs</span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>xs</span><span>:</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>ys</span><span>:</span><span>5</span><span>}))</span> <span># -9.70176956641438</span>
</code></pre></div>


<p>The result obtained with the Sympy library is strictly the same as with our <code>Tensor</code> class !</p>

<h2>Possible Improvements &amp; Optimizations</h2>
<p>We have just created the simplest automatic differentiation system that exists, and probably also the slowest. We can add more complex operations if we want, as long as we know how to derive them. As it is, this class can only handle scalars; for such a library to be most useful, one would have to add <strong>operations on arrays</strong> of arbitrary sizes. <br>
<!-- Un grand atout des bibliothèques de différenciation automatique telles que <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TensorFlow">TensorFlow</a> ou <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch">PyTorch</a>  -->
Also, looking at the graphs, we can see that some optimizations are possible:
</p><ul>
<li>If we are in a multiplication node and one of the two <code>children</code> is 0, we <strong>should not explore further</strong>. Because we know that whatever is multiplied by 0, will always be 0.   </li>
<li>When traversing the tree to perform a derivative with respect to a tensor <code>x</code>, if we are in a node that does not depend on <code>x</code> and whose children do not depend on <code>x</code>, we could stop the traversal at this step and <strong>consider the current node as a constant</strong>. This type of optimization could greatly improve the computational speed for graphs with many nodes and different variables.  </li>
<li>By looking at the graph we can see that some operations are repeated. We can imagine <strong>to set up a cache</strong> to avoid repeating the computations several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this article has helped you understand how automatic differentiation is performed for neural network optimization and learning.<br>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>It has been five months since my <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/03/24/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-march-2023.html">last
general
update</a>
on the Rust compiler’s performance. Let’s see what has happened in that time.</p>

<h2 id="big-wins">Big wins</h2>

<p>Let’s start with some big improvements. The information about metrics at the
top of <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2022/10/27/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-october-2022.html">this
post</a>
still applies.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/107925">#107925</a>: Incremental
compilation uses a hashing algorithm to detect when code fragments have changed
and need recompilation. In this PR, <a href="https://github.com/thomcc">@thomcc</a>
changed the algorithm from SipHash-2-4 to SipHash-1-3, which is faster and
lower quality, but still good enough for the purposes of incremental
compilation. (The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash">Wikipedia page</a> says
“The recommended parameters are SipHash-2-4 for best performance, and
SipHash-4-8 for conservative security. A few languages use Siphash-1-3 for
performance at the risk of yet-unknown DoS attacks.” Incremental compilation
seems like an unlikely target for such attacks.) This gave a mean wall-time
reduction of 1.63% across all benchmark results, with the improvements mostly
coming in incremental builds.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/109474">#109474</a>: In this PR,
<a href="https://github.com/nikic">@nikic</a> upgraded the LLVM version used by the
compiler to LLVM 16. This gave a mean wall-time reduction of 1.19% across all
benchmark results. It’s unclear how much of the improvement is because LLVM
itself is faster (which would make rustc’s back-end faster) and how much is
because LLVM is producing higher quality code (which would make all of rustc
faster). Either way, it’s great work by the LLVM developers!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113734">#113734</a>: In this PR,
<a href="https://github.com/cjgillot">@cjgillot</a> tweaked how some lints are run. This
gave a mean wall-time reduction of 1.05% across all benchmark results, with
the improvements mostly coming in incremental builds.</p>

<p>Any change that results in a 1% across-the-board win is a big improvement, so
it’s great to see three of them. (I pay close attention but it’s possible that
I have overlooked other big improvements.)</p>

<h2 id="codegen-units">Codegen units</h2>

<p>I spent a lot of time trying to improve the parallelization done by the Rust
compiler’s back-end, without much success. A lot of the work related to how the
compiler breaks code into chunks for parallel processing, and how it must
predict how long these chunks will take to compile. I did get two wins of note.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/112448/">#112448</a>: In this PR I
introduced a minimum CGU size in non-incremental builds. This reduced peak
memory usage across several benchmarks by up to 19%, with most of the
improvements in the 2-9% range. It also reduced binary sizes by 48% in one
extreme example, and up to 8% across numerous other benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113777">#113777</a>: In this PR I adjusted
the CGU merging algorithm to minimize the duplication of inlined functions,
giving icount, peak memory, and binary size wins of a few percent on several
benchmarks.</p>

<p>I wrote in more detail about my efforts in a <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/11/back-end-parallelism-in-the-rust-compiler.html">blog
post</a>
in July. In the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/14wcezs/backend_parallelism_in_the_rust_compiler/">Reddit
discussion</a>
several people suggested data analysis to improve the estimates. So I collected
data, put it in <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/07/25/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-data-analysis-assistance-requested.html">another blog
post</a>,
and requested assistance because I am no data scientist. I got some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/158tcel/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/">excellent
responses</a>,
many of which suggested that larger data sets would be helpful. I then
published a <a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/08/01/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-data-analysis-update.html">follow-up blog
post</a>
with larger data sets, and received some more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15f3cob/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/">good
responses</a>.
For people interested in compilers and data science there will be plenty of
interesting reading there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to improve the compiler further, despite trying a
number of different estimation functions from the analyses. Normally when you
implement a parallel algorithm, the exact way you divide the problem into
pieces doesn’t affect the answer. But that isn’t true for codegen unit
formation! The functionality of the generated code doesn’t change, but the
quality of that code (and its size) can very much change. This makes it really
challenging to improve, because there are multiple metrics in conflict. Almost
any change that improves one metric regresses another. It’s quite possible that
there are potential improvements remaining, but I don’t know how to attain
them, and I’m not planning on working on this area any further.</p>

<h2 id="other-presentations">Other presentations</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Kobzol">Jakub Beránek</a> has been extremely productive
recently, and published multiple interesting blog posts describing his work.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One about his <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/07/30/optimizing-rust-ci-2023.html">improvements to the CI used for
rustc</a>,
some of which sped up the compiler.</li>
  <li>One about <a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/rustc/2023/08/18/rustc-benchmark-suite.html">the rustc-perf benchmark
suite</a>
that we use to measure the compiler’s performance.</li>
  <li>One about
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/cargo/2023/08/12/rust-llvm-optimization-remarks.html">cargo-remark</a>,
an experimental tool to help you understand how your Rust code is being
optimized by LLVM.</li>
  <li>One about
<a href="https://kobzol.github.io/rust/cargo/2023/07/28/rust-cargo-pgo.html">cargo-pgo</a>,
which makes it easier to use PGO and BOLT to speed up your Rust programs.</li>
</ul>

<p>He also got a new <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/runtime-benchmarks">runtime benchmarking
suite</a>
up and running within rustc-perf, to complement the existing compile-time
benchmarking suite. This is a long-desired feature that is now running on
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=03a119b0b0e310d22d94399b24ed030056050f13&amp;end=443c3161dd04f4c1b656a626f9079921bee9c326&amp;stat=instructions%3Au&amp;tab=runtime">every merge</a>.
It’s still experimental and the benchmarks could be improved, but it’s a huge
step towards reliable detection of changes to codegen quality. I believe Jakub
will write a new blog post about this soon.</p>

<p>Finally, I gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2vJ8Faundw">a short talk</a> at
<a href="https://2023.rustnl.org/">RustNL 2023</a> about parallelism in the compiler. It’s
a nice overview, but please note that my estimate of “next month” for the
parallel front-end was too optimistic. I have learned my lesson, and I won’t
give a new prediction for when that feature will ship.</p>

<h2 id="my-improvements">My improvements</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/110527">#110527</a>: In this PR I avoided
constructing a data structure when it wasn’t necessary, for a few sub-1% icount
wins.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111088">#111088</a>: The compiler has a
<code>FileEncoder</code> type used for writing various things to file. It has an internal
buffer that had a variable size, but in practice the buffer size was always 8
KiB. In this PR I fixed the size to 8 KiB, which meant some checks could be
hardwired in the generated code, giving sub-1% icount wins on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/111963">#111963</a>: The compiler can
derive impls for various built-in traits: <code>Clone</code>, <code>Default</code>, <code>Debug</code>,
<code>PartialEq</code>/<code>Eq</code>, <code>PartialOrd</code>/<code>Ord</code>, and <code>Hash</code>. The derived functions were
marked <code>#[inline]</code>, except for <code>Debug::fmt</code> (which makes sense given that it is
typically not used on hot code paths) and <code>Hash::hash</code>. This PR added an inline
marking to <code>Hash::hash</code>, giving sub-1% icount wins on a number of benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113116">#113116</a>: In this PR I made a
series of micro-optimizations in and around codegen unit formation, giving
sub-3% icount wins on a few benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113609">#113609</a>: In this PR I added a
cache that avoids the need for some repetitive HIR traversals during linting.
It gave icount wins of up to 6% across a number of benchmarks.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114611">#114611</a>: This is a fun one.
<a href="https://github.com/Dragon-Hatcher">@Dragon-Hatcher</a> created a very unusual
Rust program: a chess engine that computes things at compile time only using
Rust’s Turing-complete trait system. (They also have a TypeScript version of
the same program.) This causes vast numbers of trait obligations to be
generated for the compiler’s trait solver. In this PR I made some small changes
to a de-duplication step that runs on collections of these obligations, which
reduced both the compile time and peak memory usage of this crate by almost 7x!
It also gave icount wins of up to 4% across a number of secondary benchmarks.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s worth noting that some recent improvements I made to Cachegrind,
were very helpful with all of the above PRs. I wrote about these changes in a
<a href="https://nnethercote.github.io/2023/05/03/valgrind-3.21-is-out.html">previous
post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="general-progress">General Progress</h2>

<p>For the period 2023-03-22 to 2023-08-24 we had some excellent overall
performance results.</p>

<p>First,
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=wall-time&amp;nonRelevant=true">wall-time</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were 513 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>454 of these were improvements, and 59 were regressions. The mean change was
a reduction of 7.13%, and many of the reductions were in the double digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=max-rss&amp;nonRelevant=true">peak memory usage</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Again, there were 513 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>492 of these were improvements, and 21 were regressions. The mean change was
a 10.53% reduction, and many of the reductions were again in the double
digits.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true">binary
size</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There were 316 results measured across 42 benchmarks.</li>
  <li>178 of these were improvements, and 138 were regressions. The mean change was
a 0.02% reduction, i.e. the wins and losses balanced out. Most of the changes
were in the single digits.</li>
  <li>If we restrict things to <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=dadbc672cd31440987083fa20e202910f8a2f2d7&amp;end=97fff1f2ed01f6f7c0c204530b693c74d88c2105&amp;stat=size%3Alinked_artifact&amp;nonRelevant=true&amp;incrFull=false&amp;incrUnchanged=false&amp;incrPatched=false&amp;debug=false&amp;doc=false">non-incremental release
builds</a>,
which is probably the most interesting case for binary size, there were 24
improvements, 18 regressions, and the mean change was a reduction of 2.65%.</li>
</ul>

<p>For all three metrics, all but a handful of results met the significance
threshold. I haven’t bothered separating those results because they made little
difference to the headline numbers. As always, these measurements are done on
Linux.</p>

<p>Overall these are excellent results which will translate into meaningful speed
and memory usage improvements for many Rust users, and continue a long line of
steady improvements over a number of years. Thank you to everyone who
contributed!</p>

<h2 id="bigger-improvements">Bigger improvements?</h2>

<p>In a Reddit discussion one person
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/158tcel/how_to_speed_up_the_rust_compiler_data_analysis/jtcrlwi/">questioned</a>
the value of incremental improvements.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to ask: are optimizations like these the right path forward?</p>

  <p>I don’t mean to diminish your work, i’ve been reading your posts for a long
time and i know a lot of effort goes into improving rustc and how many
experiments don’t pan out but i always get the impression that even when they
do, it’s a couple percent at most and often only on specific benchmarks.</p>

  <p>This doesn’t seem to be the path towards the 10x improvements which many
people wish for. Is something like that even possible and what architectural
changes would be necessary?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit this question tested my patience. (Have I thought of making big
improvements instead of small improvements? Yes. Yes, I have.) But I will
assume it was asked in good faith, and provide some thoughts in response.</p>

<p>Anyone waiting for 10x improvements is likely to be disappointed. I don’t see
that happening, except for the occasional unusual program (such as the chess
engine case mentioned above).</p>

<p>The compiler is a large, mature project. It’s well over 10 years old, and
hundreds of thousands of lines. Projects like that tend to not get quantum
leaps in performance. Many small improvements is more typical.</p>

<p>Rust is a difficult language to compile quickly. Brian Anderson has a whole
series of blog posts about this:
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/rust-compilation-model-calamity/">1</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/generics-and-compile-time-in-rust/">2</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/rust-huge-compilation-units/">3</a>,
<a href="https://www.pingcap.com/blog/reasons-rust-compiles-slowly/">4</a>. Some of the
points made are now out of date, and I find the overall a tone a little
sensationalistic, but there is some truth to it. In short, there were numerous
design trade-offs made during Rust’s design, and compile times got the short
end of the stick almost every time.</p>

<p>There have been a number of large improvements in the past, and there may be
some more coming. There have also been some failed attempts at large
improvements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Incremental compilation can make a huge difference, perhaps not 10x, but
certainly 3-5x in many cases. The implementation has its issues (it has
been temporarily disabled a couple of times due to bugs) but many people
are benefiting from it every day.</li>
  <li>The parallel back-end makes a huge difference. Try compiling with
<code>codegen-units=1</code> and you’ll get slightly higher code quality but it might
take 2x or more longer. There are many trade-offs with this kind of thing,
though, as I touched on earlier.</li>
  <li><a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/evaluating-pipelined-rustc-compilation/10199">Pipelined
compilation</a>
greatly increased inter-procedural parallelism, giving speedups of up to
1.8x.</li>
  <li>The parallel front-end is under active development, and will hopefully be
shipped soon. We have seen 2x speedups in some cases. Getting it working
has been a multi-year effort; it’s a difficult project.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift">Cranelift backend</a>
has been in development for a number of years. A primary goal is to improve
compile times. It is a large piece of work, and is still experimental.</li>
  <li><a href="https://davidtw.co/media/masters_dissertation.pdf">Polymorphization</a> is an
optimization that aims to reduce the cost of monomorphization of generic
code. There is a partial implementation that provide modest speed
improvements and is not stable enough to be on by default. I think this is
basically because compilers are complex and sometimes reasonable ideas are
just really hard to get working.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compilers involve giant tree structures, with lots of allocations, pointer
chasing, and data-dependent multi-way branches. All the things that modern
microarchitectures handle poorly. There is research into different designs that
avoid these problems, but they involve data structures that can be highly
non-ergonomic. And it’s hard to radically change the data structures used in a
mature compiler.</p>

<p>All of this ignores what might be called performance “dark matter”: the many
bug fixes and functional improvements that have gone into the compiler without
regressing performance. (Or that did slightly regress performance, but which
have been balanced out by other improvements.) A great example of this is the
NLL borrow checker that shippped in 2018, which I think is the single biggest
improvement to Rust since 1.0. It was performance neutral, but only because a
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/nnethercote/2018/11/06/how-to-speed-up-the-rust-compiler-in-2018-nll-edition/">great deal of
work</a>
went into its performance before shipping, which resulted in some cases
reducing compile times and peak memory use by <strong>50x</strong>. Another good example is
the excellent error messages that the compiler is famous for; a lot of care
goes into keeping those as cheap as possible.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer that small improvements add up, in just about any part of
life, and compiler performance is no difference. I have a knack for finding
these improvements and the persistence to keep at it. I’ve been writing these
posts for a long time, and I typically report 3-10% improvements every 3-6
months, due to my work and that of many others. Visit the <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html">performance
dashboard</a> and you’ll see things
like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://nnethercote.github.io/images/2023/08/25/dashboard-debug.png" alt="Graph showing improving debug compile times since Rust 1.28"></p>

<p>The improvements over time have been consistent enough that there has been
<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance/topic/log.20scale.20for.20the.20dashboard">discussion</a>
about whether the y-axis scale on these graphs should be linear or logarithmic.
I’d love to have 10x wins, but in their absence, a steady grind of small
improvements is absolutely worthwhile.</p>

Chromosome X and Y components of the assembly string graph built from HiFi reads, detected based on node sequence alignments to T2T-CHM13 and GRCh38 references. Each node is colored according to the excess of paternal-specific (blue) and maternal-specific (red) k-mers, obtained from parental Illumina reads, indicating if they exclusively belong to chromosome Y or X, respectively. Most complicated tangles are localized within the heterochromatic satellite region on the Y q-arm. The X and Y subgraphs are connected in PAR1 and PAR2. Graph discontinuities are due to a lack of HiFi sequence coverage in these regions caused by contextual sequencing bias, with 9 out of 11 observed breaks falling within PAR1 on either chromosome (5 out of 5 for chromosome Y). Note that for visualization purposes the length of shorter nodes is artificially increased making the extent of the tangles appear larger than reality. <b>b</b>. The effects of manual pruning and semi-automated ONT read integration is illustrated from top to bottom. Top, zoomed in view of a tangle encoding the P1–P3 palindromic region in Y (approx. 22.86–27.08 Mb, see Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y#Fig4">4</a>). Middle, corresponding subgraph following the manual pruning and recompaction. Nodes excluded from the curated “single-copy” list for automated ONT-based repeat resolution are shown in yellow. Three hairpin structures are highlighted, which form almost-perfect inverted tandem repeats encompassing the entire P3 and two P2 (red) palindromes. Node outlines in the palindromes are colored according to the palindromic arms as in Fig. <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06457-y#Fig4">4</a>.

Remaining ambiguities were resolved by evaluating ONT read alignments to all candidate reconstructions of the corresponding sub-regions. <b>c</b>. PAR1 subgraph labeled with HiFi read coverage on each node. Gaps (green edges) and uneven node coverage estimates indicate biases in HiFi sequencing across the region.

Multiple spikes in reverse direction (black asterisks) in GRCh38-Y indicate inversion polymorphisms relative to HG002, likely due to differences between the haplogroups. Such spikes in coverage are not observed on T2T-X and T2T-Y, which confirm the structural and directional accuracy of the HG002 assemblies.

Five out of 15 individuals have the inverted variant as present in HG002 at the P3 palindrome (white arrow). Although inversions across P1–P2 (yellow and red arrows) are difficult to confirm with Strand-seq because of the high sequence similarity between the palindromic arms, different orientations are observable in these samples. <b>b</b>. Strand states for 65 Strand-seq libraries of HG002. Depending on the mappings of directional Strand-seq reads (+ reads: ‘Crick’, C, – reads: ‘Watson’, W), reference sequence was assigned in three states: WC, WW, and CC. WC, roughly equal mixture of plus and minus reads; WW, all reads mapped in minus orientation; CC, all reads mapped in plus orientation. Changes in strand state along a single chromosome are normally caused by a double-strand-break (DSBs) that occurred during DNA replication<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 160" title="Falconer, E. et al.

Recurrent change in strand state over the same region in multiple Strand-seq cells indicates misassembly. Similarly, collapsed or incomplete assembly of a certain genomic region will result in a recurrent strand state change as observed for GRCh38-Y (black arrowheads).

Light gray rectangles highlight regions where SCEs were detected in the heterochromatic Yq12 despite a lower coverage of Strand-seq reads.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>On a recent cross-country trip—I (Paul) drove from California to Illinois and back again. On the drive, I saw a sign I had never seen before: In a McDonald’s window it said </span><strong>$1,000 SIGNING BONUS</strong><span>. That was not a thing when I was a teenager doing minimum-wage jobs. No one paid you $1,000 signing bonuses to work for fast-food restaurants.&nbsp;</span></p><p>These bonuses have been around for a few years now, having started during Covid when the U.S. workforce fell into a wormhole and disappeared. But instead of going away, they persist, and bonuses have seemingly gotten even larger.&nbsp;</p><p>This got us thinking, unsurprisingly. It ties into a theme we have been rolling around, one we’re passionate about. Explaining what is going on, why it is important, and its relevance for investing will require some groundwork, so bear with us for a few paragraphs.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a persistent structural imbalance in the U.S. workforce: too few people for all the jobs, for the most part. It resists all efforts to reduce it, driven by a host of factors, including demand growth, an aging society, retirements, lower immigration, and skill mismatches, all of which conspire to create an unprecedented shortage of workers.</p><p>You can see some of this in the participation rate among U.S. workers.

While the U.S. civilian labor force is larger than it was pre-Covid, so is the U.S. economy.

The missing jobs are not in all areas. Arguably, we still have too many people in technology company middle management. For example, all eight of the Google-based authors of the seminal “transformers” paper that helped spark the current wave of large language models have now left Google to start various AI companies. As a friend and long-ago former Google employee reminded us, that is more people than there were senior vice presidents at Google in 2004. Technology is not, with a few exceptions, where jobs are going wanting.&nbsp;</p><p>But almost everywhere else needs people. Badly. Across retail, restaurants, manufacturing, trades, and on and on, companies are struggling to hire. And this brings us back to the cross-country trip observation and that “signing bonus” sign in a McDonald’s window.</p><p><span>The absence of human workers has become a limiting factor on economic growth in the U.S. Absent a wave of immigration, which creates its own problems, politically and otherwise, and doesn’t necessarily fill the observed skill gaps, something needs to change. Historically, when this has happened—labor became more expensive than capital—economies have responded with automation, so we </span><em>should</em><span> expect that again today.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So, as promised, let’s circle back from demography and economics to technology, investments, and automation. As we’ve </span><a href="https://skventures.substack.com/p/societys-technical-debt-and-softwares" rel="">written previously</a><span>, what’s important about this wave of automation is how it is more skewed toward jobs that can be described as requiring “tacit knowledge,” where we know what to do but can’t always create programmatic ways of doing things. These jobs are not assembly lines, so simply throwing capital (orthodox automation) at the problem doesn’t work.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>That is why, in a sense, the current wave of AI has come along at the </span><em>perfect</em><span> time. It is the first automation technology to be applicable to tacit knowledge, to tasks where we can’t describe in a linear ABC way how inputs turn into outputs. To that way of thinking, we should </span><em>embrace</em><span> and not fear the current wave of technological change, in that it can help with the observed shortages in U.S. workers, and do so in a replicable and continuous way, not unlike traditional automation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The trouble is—not to put too fine a point on it—current-generation AI is mostly crap. Sure, it is terrific at using its statistical models to come up with textual passages that read better than the average human’s writing, but that’s not a particularly high hurdle. Most humans are terrible writers and have no interest in getting better. Similarly, current LLM-based AI is very good at comparing input text to rules-based models, impairing the livelihood of cascading stylesheet pedants who mostly shouted at people (fine, at Paul) on StackExchange and Reddit. Now you can just ask LLMs to write that code for you or check crap code you’ve created yourself.</p><p>But that’s not enough. We are quickly reaching the limits of current AI, whether because of its tendency to hallucinations, inadequate training data in narrow fields, sunsetted training corpora from years ago, or myriad other reasons. We are pushing against the limits of what current AI can do, and that has unintended consequences, which we will return to in a moment. Most observers haven’t realized this yet, but they will.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Our view is that we are at the tail end of the first wave of large language model-based AI. That wave started in 2017, with the release of the transformers paper (“</span><a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub46201/" rel="">Attention is All You Need</a><span>”) by those Google researchers, and ends somewhere in the next year or two with the kinds of limits people are running up against. It ends partly because of constraints inherent in the current approach, but also because of technological and cost limits related to training models, whether wide or narrow. This wave has been terrific for a few companies, especially Nvidia, but it will be thought of in the future as mostly about piping the AI house, at most. The key component of this current wave is that it is characterized by scarcity—training data, models, chips, and AI engineers—and the accompanying high costs that scarcity brings.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Before explaining which waves come next, and what that will mean, we will now digress into why it’s so important we rethink how we think about automation. Because there is a huge risk that we don’t, and this opportunity goes wanting. And that is to take nothing away from legitimate concerns, like existential risk, but we have a near-term problem: The workforce wormhole is eating the economy.&nbsp;</p><p><span>In an important 2019 paper (“</span><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.33.2.3" rel="">Automation and New Tasks: How Technology Displaces and Reinstates Labor</a><span>”) by Acemoglu and Restrepo, the authors develop and test important ideas about the nature of automation. While the models are highly quantitative, they can be summarized in simpler terms. In essence, the authors show that for automation to have widespread benefits it must deliver high productivity gains to more than compensate for the high displacement of workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here are the authors from the paper itself: ”...automation always reduces the labor share in value-added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises productivity”. Of course, there are opposing forces, as they say: “The effects of automation are counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage”. In other words, and this is a trope often delivered nuance-free by technology boosters, </span><em>technology’s displacement effects can be outweighed if new tasks are created where labor has an advantage over automation</em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This is a huge “if.” Not all waves of automation create jobs as speedily as they displace them. And, even more importantly for our purposes, not all waves of automation deliver bursts of productivity that compensate for the displacement. Acemoglu and Restrepo coined the phrase “so-so automation” for a particularly insidious and increasingly common form of tech-enabled automation, where there is high worker displacement without commensurate productivity gains impact—where minimal human flourishing is created.&nbsp;</p><p>Has this happened? All the time, Acemogul and Restrepo show. And, worryingly, it is happening increasingly frequently in recent decades, blinding us to the effects of so-so automation on productivity gains:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Our empirical decomposition suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.</p></blockquote><p><span>You can see their idea in schematic terms in the following 2x2 grid. So-so automation is in the top right; the kind of automation we want, which we think of as flourishing, is in the bottom right quadrant. We should never confuse these two forms of automation, given that high worker displacement must be more than compensated for by high productivity gains if we are to avoid massive economic disruption, especially in an economy where workers are scarce and inflexible, as we have already discussed. The box in the lower right should be our goal, call it, by way of contrast with so-so, </span><em>“Zoso” automation</em><span> (Yes, that is a Led Zeppelin pun; yes, Led Zeppelin’s best song is still “Kashmir”), where we get worker displacement, but we also get even more explosive productivity growth.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png" width="1456" height="821" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:821,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2d1569e0-0d84-41ca-9728-9910b7ba51f3_1600x902.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>How do we know if something is so-so vs Zoso automation? One way is to ask a few test questions:</p><p>1. Does it just shift costs to consumers?</p><p>2. Are the productivity gains small compared to worker displacement?</p><p>3. Does it cause weird and unintended side effects?</p><p>Here are some examples of the preceding, in no particular order. AI-related automation of contract law is making it cheaper to produce contracts, sometimes with designed-in gotchas, thus causing even more litigation. Automation of software is mostly producing more crap and unmaintainable software, not rethinking and democratizing software production itself.&nbsp; Automation of call centers is coming fast, but it is like self-checkout in grocery stores, where people are implicitly being forced to support themselves by finding the right question to ask.&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is a problem. These are all examples of so-so automation. They are happening all over, and they are typical of much of what many investors are investing in and many entrepreneurs are creating. These products and services will, inevitably, displace a huge number of people, but they </span><em>will not</em><span> drive human flourishing.&nbsp;</span></p><p>So, what does this mean? It means we need much better AI. Or we need much worse AI. The second point first: Much worse AI would have minimal worker displacement effects, making it less economically fraught in its effects, and given that the U.S. economy can work within those limits. We are in a middle zone, however, with AI able to displace huge numbers of workers quickly, but not provide compensatory and broader productivity benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>This brings us back to our wave theory of what is happening in AI. As we wrote above, we think, contrary to hyperbole, we are already at the tail end of the current wave of AI. We are bumping against many of its limits, which is, in turn, constraining the state space of what can be done with AI that drives explosive productivity growth versus so-so automation.&nbsp;</p><p>What comes next? In our view, the next wave will last until perhaps 2030, with a diversity of new models (like tree of thoughts models), ubiquitous/cheap GPUs, and an inevitable commoditization of LLMs with an accompanying explosion of open source. At the same time, the current era of massive, intermittently-updated models will seem quaint, like mainframe computers. The next generation will be lighter weight and much more specific, a good example of which is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), where the old LLM mainframe becomes mostly a syntax and grammar generator. All the action is local and informed by proprietary data, whether real-time or historical, or both.</p><p>To get from here to there a bunch of things have to change. For starters, we need far better tools. For example, our current generation of developer tools are perfectly adapted for a world that no longer exists, and they are mostly being kludged with new features that make them more narrowly useful, rather than redesigned altogether. Without a change in the tooling, we cannot see past recency bias into the kinds of service that might drive explosive productivity growth. We will be trapped in that box of so-so automation.</p><p><span>We also need to stop thinking in such siloed terms about technology. It is possible that, with the right tools, the most explosive growth in flourishing-promoting automation will be in areas other than those where the last few waves played out, that is, outside white-collar office work. For example, there are early signs that, with minor advances, huge gains are possible in life sciences. We are already seeing new drugs and targets, new ways of </span><a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news/a-new-ai-tool-predicts-gene-expression-in-a-single-cell-71295?utm_campaign=TS_DAILY_NEWSLETTER_2023&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=271255795&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9XITrAwTC_XX04YVnkpOAQpHWO2bKW2dZHyUrguBKPQQScHKlSSg76z1Iooq9ZaKvWWH9TnzGFVCcrJZ69RvwqqLmCHA&amp;utm_content=271255795&amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="">analyzing cell types and gene expression</a><span>, and so on. Our blinkers must not prevent us from being open to the idea that true Zoso automation will come mostly in unexpected areas, like biology.&nbsp;</span></p><p>At an even higher level, however, we need to break free from decades of recent thinking about what automation is for. As Acemoglu and Restrepo show in their 2019 paper, the productivity benefits of recent technology-related automation have been declining, with more and more of it being directed at low productivity displacement.&nbsp;</p><p>Decades ago, business theorist Michael Hammer made bank promoting the idea of using technology to reengineer society. It didn’t happen, partly because there was no way to do it with then-current technology, but mostly because reengineering became a consultant code word for cost-cutting and layoffs.&nbsp;</p><p>This time can be different. By realizing where we are in AI waves, and by recognizing the limits of current technology, we can see why the limits of current LLMs already dictate what, how, and when we automate. Whether we do so will dictate whether this next wave leads to explosive improvements or just incremental so-so automation.&nbsp; We need to look past the limits of current AI technology if we are to break free from the past few decades of so-so automation and compensate for the gravitational forces dragging the U.S. workforce into that wormhole.&nbsp;</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

Accordingly, it is likely that the three colonies where rapid loss of fast ice occurred prior to this date will have experienced total or near total breeding failure, as emperor penguin chicks do not develop waterproof feathers until fledging. Some chicks may have survived on grounded icebergs (as may have occurred on Smyley Island; see below), but the percentage of the chicks that&nbsp;may have survived on these refugia is impossible to say from satellite images, which are of insufficient resolution to discriminate chicks from adults. However, as staining from three of the colonies disappeared entirely before December it is likely adult emperors abandoned these sites shortly after unsuccessful breeding.</p><p>Between the initial collection of Sentinel2 data in Antarctica in 2018 until 2022 the archive of imagery shows only one of the five colonies had witnessed sea ice break up earlier than December (Bryant Peninsula; 2010).

In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the sea ice in the bay did not break up until the New Year. A population estimate from WorldView3 imagery on 20th November 2021 (image ID 21NOV20142220) gave an estimate of ~3000 pairs. In September 2022 the colony was once again visible in Sentinel2 imagery, but very small—consisting of just 4 brown pixels. Between the 31st of October and the 4th of November the land-fast sea ice in the bay broke up. This ice had entirely dissipated by early December and no sign of any staining from guano could be found in the local area.</p><h3 id="Sec4">Smyley Island colony</h3><p>Smyley Island colony was discovered in 2009 by Landsat satellite imagery. Very High-Resolution satellite imagery has been taken of it during most years since then to reveal that numbers vary between 1000 and 6500 breeding pairs with a 10 years average of 3500 pairs (British Antarctic Survey data unpublished, in prep). These satellite records shows that the land-fast sea ice at the colony location remained intact until at least early December except in 2022, when the fast ice broke up some time in mid-November. In this year, the colony had split into two groups approximately four kilometres apart. In Sentinel2 imagery from early December, the sea ice had clearly broken up leaving only loose pack ice and a few large bergs. It appears that at least some of the penguins had moved onto the foot of a large berg which was grounded near the coast. Whether any of the chicks survived on the berg is unknown.</p><h3 id="Sec5">Bryant Coast colony</h3><p>The Bryant Coast colony was discovered in Landsat imagery in 2014. It has had a number of population estimates by VHR satellite imagery with numbers ranging from ~2000 in 2014 to 0 in 2010, which was the only year that birds were absent from the site. From 2010 to 2021, inclusive, multi-year fast ice persisted at the site, providing a stable platform for emperor penguins throughout the year. In 2022 the colony was visible in mid-November in Sentinel2 imagery but appeared smaller than normal. By the 25th of November, the sea-ice edge was approaching the colony location and by the 29th the fast ice had broken into pack. There was still evidence of brown staining on some of the broken pack ice. However, a few days later on the 2nd of December this brown staining had disappeared from the pack ice, suggesting the abandonment of the colony. No other evidence of the colony could be found in the local area.</p><h3 id="Sec6">Pfrogner Point colony</h3><p>Pfrogner Point colony was discovered in 2019 and only one VHR satellite population estimate has been conducted, estimating the population at 1200 pairs. It is one of the few emperor colonies that is situated on an ice shelf<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 16" title="Fretwell, P. T., Trathan, P. N., Wienecke, B. &amp; Kooyman, G. L. Emperor penguins breeding on iceshelves. PLoS ONE 9, e85285 (2014)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00927-x#ref-CR16" id="ref-link-section-d95482762e605">16</a></sup>, as in all years of the Sentinel2 record (2018–2022), the colony has been located for at least some of the year in a creek on the ice tongue or on the shelf itself. In 2022, the brown stain of the colony was visible by Sentinel2 in the ice creek on at least three dates in October (9th, 22nd, 29th), although in all instances the staining was small and only encompassed between 7–10 pixels.</p><p>However, by 8th November the stain had disappeared and did not return in Sentinel2 later images. The abandonment of the colony was confirmed by VHR imagery captured later in the month (26th November). By the 12th December 2022, all the sea ice had dissipated. This confirmed that no penguins were visible, either on the shelf or the surrounding sea ice by this time. The reason for abandonment of the colony site if difficult to say with certainty.</p><p>The VHR imagery also revealed that the ice cliff leading onto the shelf was ~4.5 metres high (estimated from sun angle and shadow length) and that a snow ramp between the sea ice and the ice shelf existed at the foot of the ice creek. Earlier Sentinel2 images, in early October, show that the sea ice beneath the ramp appeared to have broken up to the ice cliff or just short of it. This would have removed the snow ramp and with it access colony. After this, the emperors would have to abandon the colony as they would not have been able to get back to their chicks. This did not happen in previous years as, due to the geometry of the ice shelf, the edge of the ice cliff was father back inside the creek which protected it from sea ice loss.</p><h3 id="Sec7">Rothschild Island colony</h3><p>Rothschild Island colony is the furthest north of the five sites, located in a bay between Alexander Island and Rothschild Island. It is a small colony, averaging ~700 breeding pairs. As of 5th of December fast ice beneath the colony remained intact, although several open water patches opened up close to the colony. Counts from aerial imagery taken from helicopters from the cruise ship Commandant Charcot on 20th November, showed that there were 820 chicks and 228 adults at the site. Subsequent Sentinel2 imagery confirmed that fast ice persisted at the site until 17th December and only began to break up on the 30th December. This confirms that some fledging was successful at this location in 2022 despite being in the in the centre of the negative sea ice anomaly. The location of the colony is in an embayment between Rothschild and Alexander islands and the presence of many icebergs suggest shallow water. The geometry of the bay and the presence of icebergs may have helped to stabilise the sea ice at this location and afforded protection from breakout until after the chicks had fledged.</p></div></div><div id="Sec8-section" data-title="Discussion"><h2 id="Sec8">Discussion</h2><div id="Sec8-content"><p>Since the use of satellite imagery to monitor emperor penguins first started in 2009, there have been isolated cases of catastrophic breeding failure due to fast ice loss across Antarctica. For a few marginal colonies, such as the colony at Leda Bay in Marie Byrd Land, this happens regularly<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 17" title="LaRue, M.

However, as yet, there has been no record of a widespread failure of breeding emperor penguins due to a regional sea ice loss affecting multiple sites before fledging in early December. Moreover, only one of the sites in our study region had experienced catastrophic breeding failure prior to 2022 (Bryant in 2010). Our finding of probable breeding failure across multiple, non-blinking, sites in a single season is without precedent.</p><p>Emperor penguins are known to adapt to breeding failures caused by localised sea ice loss by moving to alternative, more stable, sites in the following year. For example, at Halley Bay in Weddell Sea, the loss of local sea ice from 2016 onward resulted in the emperor penguins relocating their colony to Dawson Lambton Glacier, 85 km to the south, where the sea ice had remained stable<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 9" title="Fretwell, P.

However, such a strategy will not be possible if breeding habitat becomes unsuitable at a regional scale, unless local refugia such as the one identified at Rothschild Island persist.</p><p>How sea ice, and in particular land-fast sea ice, will react to future anthropogenic induced climate warming is unclear and difficult to predict. Although it is difficult to link specific extreme seasons to climate change, a longer-term decline in sea ice extent is expected from the current generation of climate models<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Roach, L.

Since 2016, Antarctica has experienced the four lowest sea ice extents observed in the 45 year satellite record, with the two lowest years in 2021/22 and 2022/23. Whether these continent-wide conditions are symptomatic of an ongoing trend or a more episodic phenomenon is as yet unknown, and this question is currently a priority for climate and sea ice scientists. The regional anomaly in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas is likely to have been influenced by the Triple-Dip La Niña that is affecting many areas of the southern Pacific<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 19" title="WMO.

It is expected that as the La Niña weakens and SAM turns positive, sea ice extent in the region may grow. Nonetheless, our findings show a clear link between negative sea ice anomalies and emperor penguin breeding failures that may represent a snapshot of a future, warming Antarctica where such events become more frequent and widespread, with grave consequences for emperor penguin population viability.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><p>The locations and presence of emperor penguins was assessed using two satellite imagery platforms. The primary source was ESAs Sentinel2 platform, part of the Copernicus programme. These data were accessed through the Copernicus Sentinel Hub, viewed in Sentinel Playground [apps.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-playground/] and downloaded using the Sentinel Hub EO browser [<a href="https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/">https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/</a>]. Sentinel2 imagery has been taken continuously in Antarctica since 2018 and collection can vary between several times per week to several times per month. All imagery taken between August and the end of December 2022 was assessed manually for the presence of emperor penguins at each of their five colony locations in the Bellingshausen Sea. Sentinel2 imagery has a spatial resolution of 10 m in the visible bands and groups of emperor penguins can easily be distinguished on the sea ice as they leave distinctive brown guano stains on the ice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 11" title="Fretwell, P.

Here we assume that the presence of brown pixels is indicative of penguin guano staining and hence the location of their colony. This staining may exist for several days after abandonment until the next snowfall, so it possible that there is some lag in the dates reported here. To ensure the best contrast when using the Sentinel Playground browser, the custom parameters [B08*0.8,B04*0.8,B03*0.8] were used. These data were supplemented using Very High-Resolution WorldView3 data from MAXAR, with a spatial resolution of 0.31 m at two sites; Pfrogner Point and Rothschild Island. At Pfrogner Point (image ID 10300100DE30A800 26th November 2022) this image was used to confirm that no penguins were present. At Rothschild Island, the WorldView3 image could confirm the presence of emperors and enable a rough count of individuals. This count was later confirmed and re-counted by oblique hand-held aerial survey from the helicopters of the ship Commandant Charcot. Previous population estimates have been calculated from supervised classification of MAXAR very high-resolution imagery using machine -learning&nbsp;supervised classification using a similar method to Fretwell et al.<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 12" title="Fretwell, P.

				The Ig Nobel Prizes are often treated as a joke, but their recipients are often working on surprisingly illuminating scientific fields. Japanese researcher Higashiyama Atsuki, who won his Ig Nobel in 2016 for his work on the effect of viewing objects between one’s own legs, continues to explore areas that clarify the connections between the body and the brain. 
				</p><div>
  				 <h2>The “Between-Legs Effect” Wins Ig Nobel Prize</h2>
<p>In 2016 Higashiyama Atsuki received an English-language letter in the mail informing him that his study on the effect of viewing things upside down between one’s legs (the so-called “between-legs effect”), which had originally been published 10 years earlier, had been selected as a candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>He ignored it, thinking it must have been a prank of some kind. Then he received another letter, this time in Japanese. The contents of the letter asked him to indicate if he would accept the prize if it were awarded to him. “Imagine that,” he remembers thinking. “It was true!”</p>
<p>The Ig Nobel Prize awards ceremony was held in the Sanders Theatre at Harvard University between acts of an opera. The prize he was awarded was a large clock that was equipped with a hand that indicated the sixty-first second — the “leap second”—and minute and hour hands that puzzlingly indicated seconds. The prize money was $10 trillion, although the unit of currency was not US dollars but rather Zimbabwe dollars, which had been discontinued at the time he received the prize. In fact, the prize money was worth about ¥170.</p>
<p>“It was an extremely humorous awards ceremony,” remarks Higashiyama, “which was fitting to the occasion.”</p>

<p>Higashiyama began his “between-legs effect” research in 1996. Since he was younger he sensed that there were numerous constraints in the world of psychological research in Japan, and as a result he intentionally submitted his work to English-language publications to increase his chances of publication. “Although my work was quite dull,” he comments, “if I published it in English there were people who would read it. This more than anything else made me happy.”</p>
<p>What exactly was this research that he modestly describes as “dull”?</p>
<h2>Optical Illusion Disappears When Positioned Sideways</h2>
<p>“Viewing things between one’s legs,” Higashiyama explains, “entails bending at the waist and looking at one’s surroundings upside down from between the legs. When one does this, distances and colors appear differently.”</p>
<p>At Higashiyama’s urging, I bend forward and take a look at a forest through my legs. Viewed in this way, the entire scene seems farther away, the trunks, branches, and leaves of the trees seem to be smaller, and the distances between all the various objects in sight seem to shrink in size as well. It also seems that the shapes and colors are clearer than when viewed in the normal way.</p>
<p>When I express surprise at the wonders of the human sense of sight, Higashiyama counters: “It isn’t sight per se, but rather the influence of the body.”</p>
<p>“In our research,” he continues, “we refer to things we can see as ‘visual information,’ while we refer to phenomena that occur as a result of changing the position of the body as ‘physical information.’ The ‘between-legs effect’ is strongly affected by this physical information. This is what I have found through a process of collecting data and repeated experimentation.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443771/2443771.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443771"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443771/2443771.jpg" data-libid="2443771" alt="Higashiyama demonstrating between-the-legs viewing. (©&nbsp;Power News)"></a><br><span>Higashiyama demonstrating between-the-legs viewing. (©&nbsp;Power News)</span></p>
<p>While still in his early thirties, Higashiyama began studying the “horizontal-vertical illusion” in an attempt to identify the relationship between physical and visual information. The horizontal-vertical illusion is a phenomenon in which the vertical line appears longer when a horizontal line and a vertical line of the same length are drawn. For example, it has been shown that when a building that is in fact 10 meters both along its frontage and in height is viewed, it seems to the viewer that the height is 1.4 times the width, making the building look 14 meters tall.</p>
<p>This has been included in textbooks and has led to the widespread belief that visual information causes optical illusions. But Higashiyama thought that they may be caused by physical information as well, so he had multiple students view a building and asked them how it appeared to them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443772/2443772.png" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443772"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443772/2443772.png" data-libid="2443772" alt="The vertical and horizontal bars are of the same length, but the horizontal-vertical illusion makes the vertical bar look 1.4 times longer."></a><br><span>The vertical and horizontal bars are of the same length, but the horizontal-vertical illusion makes the vertical bar look 1.4 times longer.</span></p>
<p>The results he obtained came as a shock.</p>
<p>“When they viewed the building from a normal standing position, its appearance to them was exactly as explained in textbooks,” Higashiyama explained. “That is, the vertical measurement appeared longer than it is in reality. But when I had them view it while lying on their side, some of them reported that the vertical and the horizontal lengths looked the same. In other words, we discovered that when lying on one’s side, the horizontal-vertical vertical illusion does not occur.”</p>
<p>No textbook includes mention of one’s visual perception changing when one is in a different physical position. What was shocking about his discovery was that even this small deviation from reality might call all textbooks into question.</p>
<p>This was how Higashiyama arrived at the conclusion that it was necessary to study whether the horizontal-vertical illusion was due to visual or physical information by supplementing his initial results with experiments in which volunteers viewed objects upside down from between their legs.</p>
<h2>Myth Arose in Nineteenth Century Textbooks</h2>
<p>When most people hear “viewing between one’s legs” they probably think of <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/guide-to-japan/gu900078/">Amanohashidate</a>, a tourist spot overlooking Miyazu Bay in northern Kyoto Prefecture. Ancient texts state that Izanagi, the deity that created Japan, linked heaven and the earth with a ladder known as the <em>ama no hashidate</em>. Based on this ancient legend, people look at the scenery there upside down from between their legs in order to experience the illusion that the land bridge across the bay presents a stairway to the heavens. There are also regions of Japan where the folklore says that one can see ghosts, the world of spirits and demons, or the future by looking upside down through one’s legs. This fascination with looking through one’s legs comes from the fact that it allows people to see the world in a way that is different from normal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443773/2443773.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443773"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443773/2443773.jpg" data-libid="2443773" alt="Between-the-legs viewing at Amanohashidate. (🄫 Pixta)"></a><br><span>Between-the-legs viewing at Amanohashidate. (🄫 Pixta)</span></p>
<p>The fact that this phenomenon was known in antiquity led to attention from researchers in the past. Papers written on the subject of between-the-legs viewing were published in Japan prior to World War II. Even outside Japan, there is a textbook on experimental psychology published toward the end of the nineteenth century that mentioned the “between-legs effect.”</p>
<p>But as far as Higashiyama was concerned, these older works lacked sufficient objective data and contained poor evidence.</p>
<p>Thinking that he had to take the time to research the issue for himself, Higashiyama had over 200 students participate in an experiment, many from Ritsumeikan University.</p>
<p>The experiment consisted of the following: In step 1, he had them view a scene standing up in the normal way. In step 2, he had them view the same scene through “prism goggles” that made the scene look upside down. The third step had them take off the prism goggles and look at the scene again, this time through their legs. Finally, in the fourth step, the students looked at the scene through their legs while wearing the prism goggles. A minimum of 50 students performed each of the four steps. Then, he interviewed the students to discover how the scenes appeared to them.</p>
<p>The key to this experiment was the use of the prism eyeglasses. The results showed that in step 2 the scenes appeared similar to how they appeared in step 1, but that in steps 3 and 4 objects that seemed to be far away appeared smaller than they did in step 1. In other words, the between-legs effect was found to be mainly due to physical information rather than visual information.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with 200 Student Volunteers</h3>

<p>“We clearly established that the physical factor is strongly linked to the between-legs effect,” says Higashiyama.</p>
<p>Speaking from the perspective of a psychologist specializing in spatial perception, Higashiyama further states that “The physical factor must not be ignored in the field of psychology. I believe that finding evidence of this factor is of extreme importance in the world of psychology, where the physical is often overlooked.”</p>
<h2>Psychology Without Evidence</h2>
<p>Higashiyama has misgivings about current-day psychology.</p>
<p>Many studies place importance on overt, conscious actions like seeing and listening. And some psychologists conclude that people are of one personality type or another based on questionnaires that lack evidence, and which are therefore indistinguishable from fortune-telling.</p>
<p>“So, people have biases in their understanding,” explains Higashiyama. “The same importance as placed on sight and hearing has to be placed on physical information as well, and conclusions must be based on evidence. Researchers need to be aware of the fact that the field of psychology runs the risk of changing people’s lives.”</p>
<p>Looking back to that day in 2016, in spite of the fact that Higashiyama finally realized that being selected as a candidate for the Ig Nobel Prize was not a joke, he hesitated to accept the prize. What convinced him was young people.</p>
<p>“My research is dull and is rarely praised,” says Higashiyama. “But I wanted to let the next generation of researchers and students know that someone was paying attention. If accepting the Ig Nobel Prize could achieve this goal, I thought, then so be it.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443774/2443774.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443774"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443774/2443774.jpg" data-libid="2443774" alt="The Ig Nobel Prize certificate presented to Higashiyama. (Courtesy of Higashiyama Atsuki)"></a><br><span>The Ig Nobel Prize certificate presented to Higashiyama. (Courtesy of Higashiyama Atsuki)</span></p>
<p>After receiving the prize, the Alumni Association at Ritsumeikan University began talking about between-the-legs viewing, and Higashiyama suddenly found that he had far more invitations to lecture on his findings at conferences held by academic associations in fields like medicine and economics. And he was the subject of increased media interest as well.</p>
<p>“I was happy that I had so many opportunities to discuss the details of the research I’d been conducting for so long,” he says.</p>
<p>What Higashiyama always keeps in mind while conducting his research is identifying evidence, as well as avoiding becoming totally immersed in a single research topic by involving himself in multiple projects at the same time. If he reaches an impasse in one study, he can shift his attention to something else, which often leads to new ideas, he says. Although this method means that it may take longer for him to complete each project, he says that his sense of satisfaction far outweighs the extra burden.</p>
<p>Currently, Higashiyama is working on a project called “The perception of the direction of the arms and body and the effect of adapting to that direction.”</p>
<p>Higashiyama explains: “The subject lifts upward his forward outstretched arms with his eyes open. He holds that pose for a short while and then returns his arms to the horizontal position. This is simple for subjects to do. Then he performs the same movements but now with his eyes closed. This time, his arms do not return to the horizontal position but rather are angled slightly upward. This showed that vision cancels out physical adaptation.”</p>
<p>Higashiyama’s lifelong research interest is the relationship between the visual and the physical. When asked what his greatest joy in his research is, he responds as follows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443775/2443775.jpg" rel="gallery" data-libid="2443775"><img src="https://www.nippon.com/en/ncommon/contents/japan-topics/2443775/2443775.jpg" data-libid="2443775" alt="Professor Emeritus Higashiyama Atsuki. (©&nbsp;Power News)"></a><br><span>Professor Emeritus Higashiyama Atsuki. (©&nbsp;Power News)</span></p>
<p>“I’m most happy when I talk about my research and the person I am talking to seems interested in it. When I won the Ig Nobel Prize, it was a pleasure to know that people from around the world thought my research into the between-legs effect was interesting.”</p>
<p>The term “pleasure” is one that is without a doubt highly significant to most researchers. To this day, Higashiyama continues to collect data and repeat experiments in an effort to feel that “pleasure” once again.</p>

            <pubDate>Thu, 24 Aug 2023 21:57:25 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/">https://blog.torproject.org/introducing-proof-of-work-defense-for-onion-services/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37255079">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we are officially introducing a proof-of-work (PoW) defense for onion services designed to prioritize verified network traffic as a deterrent against denial of service (DoS) attacks with the release of Tor 0.4.8.</p>
<p>Tor's PoW defense is a dynamic and reactive mechanism, remaining dormant under normal use conditions to ensure a seamless user experience, but when an onion service is under stress, the mechanism will prompt incoming client connections to perform a number of successively more complex operations. The onion service will then prioritize these connections based on the effort level demonstrated by the client. We believe that the introduction of a proof-of-work mechanism will disincentivize attackers by making large-scale attacks costly and impractical while giving priority to legitimate traffic. Onion Services are encouraged to update to version <a href="https://forum.torproject.org/t/stable-release-0-4-8-4/8884">0.4.8.</a></p>
<h2>Why the need?</h2>
<p>The inherent design of onion services, which prioritizes user privacy by obfuscating IP addresses, has made it vulnerable to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-network-ddos-attack/">DoS attacks</a> and traditional IP-based rate limits have been imperfect protections in these scenarios. In need of alternative solutions, we devised a proof-of-work mechanism involving a client puzzle to thwart DoS attacks without compromising user privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Proof of work acts as a ticket system that is turned off by default, but adapts to network stress by creating a priority queue. Before accessing an onion service, a small puzzle must be solved, proving that some "work" has been done by the client. The harder the puzzle, the more work is being performed, proving a user is genuine and not a bot trying to flood the service. Ultimately the proof-of-work mechanism blocks attackers while giving real users a chance to reach their destination.</p>
<h2>What does this mean for attackers and users?</h2>
<p>If attackers attempt to flood an onion service with requests, the PoW defense will kick into action and increase the computational effort required to access a .onion site. This ticketing system aims to disadvantage attackers who make a huge number of connection attempts to an onion service. Sustaining these kinds of attacks will require a lot of computational effort on their part with diminishing returns, as the effort increases.</p>
<p>For everyday users, however, who tend to submit only a few requests at a time, the added computational effort of solving the puzzle is manageable for most devices, with initial times per solve ranging from 5 milliseconds for faster computers and up to 30 milliseconds for slower hardware. If the attack traffic increases, the effort of the work will increase, up to roughly 1 minute of work. While this process is invisible to the users and makes waiting on a proof-of-work solution comparable to waiting on a slow network connection, it has the distinct advantage of providing them with a chance to access the Tor network even when it is under stress by proving their humanity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>Over the past year, we have put a lot of work into mitigating attacks on our network and enhancing our defense for onion services. The introduction of Tor's PoW defense not only positions onion services among the few communication protocols with built-in DoS protections but also, when adopted by major sites, promises to reduce the negative impact of targeted attacks on network speeds. The dynamic nature of this system helps balance the load during sudden surges in traffic ensuring more consistent and reliable access to onion services.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="block-system-main">

  
      
  
  <div>
    <div><div><p>Experiences porting FreeBSD 14 to run on the Firecracker VMM</p></div>
<div><div><p>A large amount of fantastic open source software originates from “scratching an itch”. Such was the case with <a href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" target="_blank" title="Firecracker on github" rel="nofollow">Firecracker</a>.&nbsp;In 2014, Amazon launched AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" title="AWS Lambda" rel="nofollow">Lambda</a> as a “serverless” compute platform: Users can provide a function — say, ten lines of Python code — and Lambda provides all of the infrastructure between an HTTP request arriving and the function being invoked to process the request and generate the response.</p><p><span>To provide this service efficiently and securely, Amazon needed to be able to launch virtual machines with minimal overhead. Thus was born Firecracker: A Virtual Machine Monitor which works with Linux KVM to create and manage “microVMs” with minimal overhead.</span></p></div><div>
    <div><p>Why FreeBSD on Firecracker?</p></div><div><p><span>In June 2022, I started work on porting FreeBSD to run on Firecracker. My interest was driven by a few factors. </span></p><p><span>First, I had been doing a lot of work on speeding up the FreeBSD boot process and wanted to know the limits that could be reached with a minimal hypervisor. </span></p><p><span>Second, porting FreeBSD to new platforms always helps to reveal bugs — both in FreeBSD and on those platforms. </span></p><p><span>Third, AWS Lambda only supports Linux at present; I’m always eager to make FreeBSD more available in AWS (although adoption in Lambda is out of my control, Firecracker support would be a necessary precondition). </span></p><p><span>The largest reason, however, was simply because it’s there. Firecracker is an interesting platform, and I wanted to see if I could make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div>  </div><div>
    <div><p>Launching the FreeBSD Kernel</p></div><div><p><span>While Firecracker was designed for Lambda’s needs — launching Linux kernels — there were patches available from 2020 that added support for the PVH boot mode in addition to “linuxboot”. FreeBSD had support for PVH booting under Xen, so I decided to see if that would work. </span></p><p><span>Here I ran into the first problem: Firecracker could load the FreeBSD kernel into memory but couldn’t find the address at which to start running the kernel (the “kernel entry point”). According to the PVH boot protocol, this value is specified in an ELF Note — a piece of special metadata stored in ELF (Executable and Linker Format) files. It turned out that there are two types of ELF Notes: PT_NOTEs and SHT_NOTEs, and FreeBSD wasn’t providing the one Firecracker was looking for. A small change to the FreeBSD kernel linker script fixed this, and now Firecracker was able to start executing the FreeBSD kernel.</span></p><p><span>That lasted for about 1 microsecond.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></div>  </div><div><p><span>FreeBSD has wonderful debugging functionality, but if your kernel crashes before the debugger is initialized or the serial console is set up, you’re not going to get much help. In this case, the Firecracker process exited, telling me that the FreeBSD guest hit a triple-fault — but that’s all I knew.</span></p><p><span>It turned out, however, that this was enough information to get me started, given a bit of creativity. If the FreeBSD kernel execution reached a hlt instruction, the Firecracker process would keep running but use 0% of the host’s CPU time (since it was virtualizing a halted CPU). As such, I could distinguish between “FreeBSD is crashing before this point” and “FreeBSD is crashing after this point” by inserting a hlt instruction — if Firecracker exited, I knew that it was crashing before reaching that instruction. Thus started a process I referred to as “kernel bisection” — rather than bisecting a list of commits to find one which introduced a bug (as in <strong>git bisect</strong>) I would do a binary search through the kernel startup code to find the line of code that was making FreeBSD crash.</span></p></div><div><p><span>The first thing I discovered in this process was Xen hypercalls. The PVH boot mode originated as the Xen/PVH boot mode, and FreeBSD’s PVH entry point was, in fact, an entry point specifically for booting under Xen — and the code made the quite reasonable assumption that it was, indeed, running inside Xen and could thus make Xen hypercalls. KVM (which provides the kernel functionality used by Firecracker) is not Xen, of course, so it doesn’t provide those hypercalls; attempting to use any of them resulted in the virtual machine crashing. As an initial workaround, I simply commented out all the Xen hypercalls; later, I added code to check <strong>CPUID</strong> for a Xen signature before making calls e.g., to write debugging output to the Xen debug console.</span></p><p><span>There was one Xen hypercall that provided essential functionality, however: Retrieving the physical memory map. (Of course, inside a hypervisor, the “physical” memory is only virtually physical. It’s turtles all the way down.) Here, we’re saved by the fact that Xen/PVH was retroactively declared to be version 0 of PVH boot mode: From version 1 onwards, a pointer to the memory map is passed via the PVH <strong>start_info</strong> page (a pointer to which is provided in a register when the virtual CPU starts executing). I had to write code to make use of the PVH version 1 memory map instead of relying on a Xen hypercall to get the same information, but that was easy enough. </span></p><p><span>Another related issue arose from how Xen and Firecracker arrange structures in memory: Whereas Xen loads the kernel first and then places the <strong>start_info</strong> page at the end, Firecracker placed the <strong>start_info</strong> page at a fixed low address and then loaded the kernel afterwards. This would have been fine but that FreeBSD’s PVH code – having been written with Xen in mind — assumed that the memory immediately after the <strong>start_info</strong> page would be free for use as scratch space. Under Firecracker, that very quickly meant overwriting the initial kernel stack — not an optimal outcome! A change to FreeBSD’s PVH code to assign scratch space after all the memory regions initialized by the hypervisor fixed this problem.&nbsp;</span></p></div><div><p><span>On x86 platforms, FreeBSD normally makes use of ACPI to learn about (and in some cases control) the hardware on which it is running. In addition to discovering things via ACPI which we might commonly think of as “devices” — disks, network adapters, etc. — FreeBSD also learns about fundamental things like CPUs and interrupt controllers via ACPI.</span></p><p><span>Firecracker, being deliberately minimalist, does not implement ACPI, and FreeBSD gets upset when it can’t figure out how many CPUs it has or where to find their interrupt controllers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Fortunately, FreeBSD has support for the historic Intel MultiProcessor Specification, which provides this critical information via an “MPTable” structure; it’s not part of the GENERIC kernel configuration, but for running in Firecracker, we want to use a stripped-down kernel configuration anyway, so it was easy to add <strong>device mptable</strong> to make use of what Firecracker provides.</span></p><p><span>Except… it didn’t work. FreeBSD still couldn’t find the information it needed! It turned out that Linux has bugs in how it finds and parses the MPTable structure — and Firecracker, being designed to boot Linux, provided the MPTable in a way that Linux supported but was not in fact compliant with the standard. FreeBSD, having an implementation independently written to follow the standard, failed both to find the (incorrectly located) MPTable and to parse the (invalid) MPTable once it was found.</span></p><p><span>So now FreeBSD has a new kernel option: You can add <strong>options MPTABLE_LINUX_BUG_COMPAT</strong> to your kernel configuration if you need bug-for-bug compatibility with Linux’s MPTable handling — and with that, FreeBSD managed to boot a bit further in Firecracker.</span></p></div><div><p><span>One of the few emulated devices — as opposed to virtualized devices like the Virtio block and network devices — provided by Firecracker is the serial port. In fact, in a common configuration, when you launch Firecracker, the standard input and output of the Firecracker process become the serial port input and output of the VM, making it seem like the guest OS is just another process running inside your shell (which, in a certain sense, it is). At least, that’s how it’s supposed to work.</span></p><div><p><span>By this point in the process of bringing up FreeBSD inside Firecracker I was able to boot a FreeBSD kernel with a root disk compiled into the kernel image — I didn’t have the virtualized disk driver working yet — and read all the console output from the kernel. After all the kernel console output, however, FreeBSD entered the userland portion of the boot process, and I got 16 characters of console output — and then it stopped.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Funnily enough, I’d seen that exact symptom over ten years earlier, when I was first getting FreeBSD working on EC2 instances. A bug in QEMU resulted in the UART not sending an interrupt when the transmit FIFO emptied; FreeBSD wrote 16 bytes to the UART and then wouldn’t write anymore because it was waiting for an interrupt which never arrived. Modern EC2 instances run on Amazon’s “Nitro” platform, but in the early days they used Xen and devices were emulated using code from QEMU. Somehow, a decade after this bug was fixed in QEMU, exactly the same bug was implemented in Firecracker; but luckily for me, the workaround I put into the FreeBSD kernel —&nbsp;<strong>hw.broken_txfifo=”1”</strong></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;— was still available, and adding that loader tunable (which, since Firecracker loads the kernel directly without going through the boot loader, meant compiling the value into the kernel as an environment variable) fixed the console output.</p></div><p><span>I then found that the console input was also broken: FreeBSD didn’t respond to anything I typed into the console. In fact, tracing the Firecracker process, I found that Firecracker wasn’t even reading from the console — because Firecracker thought that the receive FIFO on the emulated UART was full. This turned out to be another bug in Firecracker: While initializing the UART, FreeBSD fills the receive FIFO with garbage to measure its size and then flushes the FIFO by writing to the FIFO Control Register. Firecracker didn’t implement the FIFO Control Register, so it was left with a full FIFO and quite sensibly didn’t try to read any more characters to put into it. Here, I added another workaround to FreeBSD: If <strong>LSR_RXRDY</strong> is still asserted after we try to flush the FIFO via the FIFO Control Register — which is to say, if the FIFO didn’t empty as requested — we now proceed to read and discard characters one by one until the FIFO empties. With this, Firecracker now recognized that FreeBSD was ready to read more input from the serial port, and I had a working bidirectional serial console.</span></p></div><div><p><span>While a system without disks or network could be useful for some purposes, before we can do very much with FreeBSD, we’re going to want those devices. Firecracker supports Virtio block and network devices and exposes them to virtual machines as mmio (memory-mapped I/O) devices. First step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Add <strong>device virtio_mmio</strong> to the Firecracker kernel configuration.</span></p><p><span>Next up, we need to tell FreeBSD how to find the virtualized devices. FreeBSD expected <strong>mmio</strong> devices to be discovered via FDT (Flattened Device Tree), which is a mechanism commonly used on embedded systems; but Firecracker passes device parameters via the kernel command line with directives such as <strong>virtio_mmio.device=4K@0x1001e000:5</strong>. Second step to getting these working in FreeBSD: Write code for parsing such directives and creating <strong>virtio_mmio</strong> device nodes. (Once we create the device node, FreeBSD’s regular process for device probing kicks in and the kernel will automatically determine the type of Virtio device and hook up the appropriate driver.)</span></p><p>If we have multiple devices however — say, a disk device and a network device — another problem arises: Firecracker passes directives the way Linux expects — as a series of key=value pairs on the kernel command line — while FreeBSD parses the kernel command line as environment variables… meaning that if there were two <strong>virtio_mmio.device=</strong> directives passed on the command line, only one was retained. To fix this, I rewrote the early kernel environment parsing code to handle duplicate variables by appending a numbered suffix: We end up with <strong>virtio_mmio.device=</strong> for one device and <strong>virtio_mmio.device_1=</strong> for the second device.</p><div><p><span>With this, I finally had FreeBSD booting and discovering all of its devices — but one more problem arose with disk devices: If I shut down the virtual machine uncleanly, on the next boot the system would run fsck on the filesystem, and the kernel would panic. It turned out that fsck is one of very few things in FreeBSD that will cause non-page-aligned disk I/Os, and FreeBSD’s Virtio block driver was causing a kernel panic when trying to pass unaligned I/Os to Firecracker.</span></p></div><p>When an I/O crosses a page boundary — as will happen with page-sized I/Os which aren’t aligned to page boundaries — the physical I/O segments will typically not be contiguous; most devices can handle I/O requests which specify a series of segments of memory to be accessed. Firecracker, being extremely minimalist, does not do this: Instead, it accepts only a single data buffer — meaning that a buffer that crosses a page boundary can’t simply be split into pieces the way it would with other Virtio implementations. Fortunately, FreeBSD has a system in place specifically for taking care of device complications like this: <strong>busdma</strong>.</p><p><span>This was probably the hardest part of getting FreeBSD running in Firecracker, but after several attempts, I think I finally got it right: I modified FreeBSD’s Virtio block driver to use <strong>busdma</strong>, and now unaligned requests are “bounced” (aka. copied via a temporary buffer) in order to comply with the limitations of the Firecracker Virtio implementation.</span></p></div><div><p><span>Once I had FreeBSD up and running in Firecracker, it rapidly became clear that there were some improvements to be made. One of the first things I noticed was that, despite having 128 MB of RAM in the virtual machine I was testing, the system was barely usable, with processes being frequently killed due to the system running out of memory. The <strong>top(1)</strong> utility showed that almost half of system memory was in the “wired” state, which seemed odd to me; so I investigated further, and found that busdma had reserved 32 MB of memory for bounce pages. This was clearly far more than needed — given Firecracker’s limitations and the fact that bounce pages are generally not allocated contiguously, each disk I/O should use at most a single 4 kB bounce page — and I was able to reduce this memory consumption to 512 kB with a patch to <strong>busdma</strong> which limited its bounce page reservations for devices which supported only a small number of I/O segments.</span></p><ul><li><span>FreeBSD’s kernel random number generator usually obtains entropy from hardware devices, but in virtual machines this may not be an effective source. As a backup source of entropy, on x86 systems we make use of the <strong>RDRAND</strong> instruction to obtain random values from the CPU; but we were only obtaining a very small amount of entropy on each request and were only requesting entropy once every 100 ms. Changing the entropy gathering system to request enough entropy to fully seed the Fortuna random number generator shaved 2.3 seconds off the boot time.</span></li><li><span>When FreeBSD first boots, it records a Host ID for the system. This is typically obtained from hardware via the <strong>smbios.system.uuid</strong> environment variable, which the boot loader sets based on information from BIOS or UEFI. Under Firecracker, however, there is no boot loader — and thus no ID being provided. We had a fallback system in place that would generate a random ID in software on systems that didn’t have a valid hardware ID; but we also printed a warning and waited 2 seconds to allow the user to read it. I changed this code to print the warning and wait 2 seconds if the hardware provided an invalid ID, but proceed silently and quickly if the hardware simply didn’t provide an ID.</span></li><li>IPv6 mandates that systems wait for “Duplicate Address Detection” before using an IPv6 address. In <strong>rc.d/netif</strong>, after bringing up interfaces, we were waiting for IPv6 DAD if any of our network interfaces had IPv6 enabled. There’s just one problem with that: We <em>always</em> have IPv6 enabled on the loopback interface! I changed the logic to only waiting for DAD if we had IPv6 enabled on an interface other than the loopback interface and sped up the boot process by 2 seconds — if another system is trying to use the same IPv6 address as us on our lo0, we have bigger problems than an address collision!</li><li><span>&nbsp;When rebooting, FreeBSD printed a message (“<strong>Rebooting...</strong>”) and then waited 1 second “for printf’s to complete and be read”. This seemed minimally useful, since people can usually tell that the system is rebooting — there is now a <strong>kern.reboot_wait_time sysctl</strong> which defaults to zero.</span></li><li><span>When shutting down or rebooting, the FreeBSD BSP (CPU #0) waits for the other CPUs to signal that they have stopped… and then waited an extra 1 second to make sure that they had a chance to stop. I removed the extra second of wait time.</span></li></ul><p>Once the low-hanging fruit was out of the way, I pulled out <a href="https://www.daemonology.net/papers/bootprofiling.pdf?utm_source=emailmarketing&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=here_is_your_julyaugust_2023_issue_of_the_freebsd_journal&amp;utm_content=2023-08-21&amp;utm_campaign=here_is_your_julyaugust_2023_issue_of_the_freebsd_journal&amp;utm_content=2023-08-21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=emailmarketing" target="_blank" title="Profiling the FreeBSD kernel boot" rel="nofollow">TSLOG</a> and started looking at flamecharts of the boot process. Firecracker is a great environment for doing this, for two reasons: First, the minimalist environment eliminates a lot of noise, making it much easier to see what’s left behind; and second, having Firecracker launch virtual machines extremely quickly made it possible to test changes to the FreeBSD kernel very rapidly — often well under 30 seconds to build a new kernel, launch it, and generate a new flamechart.</p></div><div><p><span>Investigation with TSLOG revealed a number of available optimizations:</span></p><ul><li><span><strong>lapic_init</strong> had a 100000-iteration loop to calibrate how long <strong>lapic_read_icr_lo</strong> took to execute; cutting this down to 1000 iterations shaved off 10 ms.</span></li><li><span><strong>ns8250_drain</strong> called DELAY after each character was read; changing this to check for <strong>LSR_RXRDY</strong> and only DELAYing if nothing was already available to be read shaved off 27 ms.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD makes use of a CPUID leaf which most hypervisors use to advertise the TSC and local APIC clock frequencies; Firecracker, unlike VMWare, QEMU, and EC2, did not implement this. Adding support for this CPUID leaf to Firecracker shaved 20 ms off the FreeBSD boot time.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD was setting <strong>kern.nswbuf</strong> (which controls the number of buffers allocated for a variety of temporary purposes) to 256 regardless of the size of the system; changing this to 32 * mp_ncpus shaved 5 ms off the boot time on a small (1 CPU) virtual machine.</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD’s <strong>mi_startup</strong> function, which kicks off machine-independent system initialization routines, was using a bubblesort to order the functions it called; while this was reasonable in the 90s given the small number of routines needing to be ordered at that point, there are now over 1000 such routines and the bubblesort was getting slow. Replacing it with a quicksort will save 2 ms. (Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023).</span></li><li><span>FreeBSD’s <strong>vm_mem</strong> initialization routine was initializing <strong>vm_page</strong> structures for all available physical memory. Even on a relatively small VM with 128 MB of RAM, this meant initializing 32768 such structures — and took a few ms. Changing this code to initialize <strong>vm_page</strong> structures “lazily” as the memory is allocated for use will save 2 ms. (<span>Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023</span>.)</span></li><li><span>Firecracker was allocating VM guest memory via an anonymous mmap, but Linux was not setting up the paging structures for the entire VM guest address space. As a result, the first time any page was read, a fault would occur taking roughly 20,000 CPU cycles to be resolved while Linux mapped in a page of memory. Adding the <strong>MAP_POPULATE</strong> flag to Firecracker’s <strong>mmap</strong> call will save 2 ms. (<span>Not yet committed as of 22 August 2023</span>.)</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span>FreeBSD boots under Firecracker — and does so extremely quickly. Including uncommitted patches (to FreeBSD and also to Firecracker), on a virtual machine with 1 CPU and 128 MB of RAM, the FreeBSD kernel can boot in under 20 ms; a flame chart of the boot process appears in Figure 1.</span></p></div><div>

Due to the history of PVH boot mode originating from Xen, the code used for PVH booting is still mixed up with Xen support; separating those will simplify things significantly. Similarly, it’s currently impossible to build a FreeBSD arm64 kernel without PCI or ACPI support; finding the bogus dependencies and removing them will allow for a smaller FreeBSD/Firecracker kernel (and also shave off a few more microseconds from the boot time – we spend 25 us checking to see if we need to reserve memory for Intel GPUs).</span></p><p><span>More aspirationally, it would be great to see if Firecracker could be ported to run on FreeBSD — at a certain point, a virtual machine is a virtual machine, and while Firecracker was written to use Linux KVM, there’s no fundamental reason why it shouldn’t be possible to make it use the kernel portion of FreeBSD’s bhyve hypervisor instead.</span></p><p><span>Anyone wanting to experiment with FreeBSD in Firecracker can build a FreeBSD 14.0 kernel with the amd64 <strong>FIRECRACKER</strong> kernel configuration, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/tree/feature/pvh" target="_blank" title="feature/pvh branch of firecracker" rel="nofollow">feature/pvh branch</a>&nbsp;from the Firecracker project; or if that branch no longer exists it means the code has been merged into the mainline Firecracker tree.</span></p><p><span>If you try out FreeBSD on Firecracker — especially if you end up using it in production — please let me know! I started this project mainly out of interest, but I’d love to hear if it ends up being useful.</span></p></div><div><p><em>This article originally appeared in the July/August issue of the <a href="https://freebsdfoundation.org/past-issues/containers-and-cloud/" target="_blank" title="FreeBSD Journal" rel="nofollow">FreeBSD</a> Journal.</em></p></div></div>

When participating in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_game)" title="Boss (video game)">boss battle</a> at the end of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raid_(gaming)" title="Raid (gaming)">raid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_character" title="Player character">player characters</a> would become infected with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debuff" title="Debuff">debuff</a> that was transmitted between characters in close proximity. While developers intended to keep the effects of the debuff in the boss's game region, a programming oversight soon led to an in-game pandemic throughout the fictional world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft#Azeroth" title="Warcraft">Azeroth</a>.
</p><p><i>World of Warcraft</i> introduced the game region of Zul'Gurub on September 13. The boss of the region, Hakkar the Soulflayer, cast Corrupted Blood on raid participants; the debuff's effects expired when players defeated Hakkar. Corrupted Blood soon spread beyond Zul'Gurub as players reacted to the infection with panic, either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_travel" title="Fast travel">fast traveling</a> to heavily-populated game regions or deactivating their animal companions.

<p>Blizzard released the first <i>World of Warcraft</i> raid on September 13, 2005, when the jungle region of Zul'Gurub was added to the game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world" title="Open world">open world</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-katwala_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-katwala-7">[7]</a></sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_game)" title="Boss (video game)">boss</a> of this region was Hakkar the Soulflayer, who would cast a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debuff" title="Debuff">debuff</a> on players called "Corrupted Blood". After Hakkar cast Corrupted Blood on one player in a raid group, the debuff would be transmitted to other player characters in close proximity. The effects of Corrupted Blood were intended to last for 10 seconds, or until the players defeated Hakkar, whichever came first.<sup id="cite_ref-elker_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-elker-2">[2]</a></sup> One of Hakkar's healing mechanisms was to temporarily stun a raid party and drain their blood. Blizzard developers intended for players to defeat Hakkar by first weakening him with attacks and then exposing themselves to Corrupted Blood. When Hakkar attempted to heal himself, he would become exposed to the debuff and die from the effects of Corrupted Blood.<sup id="cite_ref-ziebart_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-ziebart-8">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ouellette_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-ouellette-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>Developers had intended to limit the effects of the debuff to the Zul'Gurub region, but several factors led to its spread throughout the in-game universe.<sup id="cite_ref-ouellette_9-1"><a href="#cite_note-ouellette-9">[9]</a></sup> First, <i>World of Warcraft</i> enabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_travel" title="Fast travel">fast travel</a>, which allowed player characters to quickly move to large population centers from more remote regions like Zul'Gurub, sometimes while still under the effects of Corrupted Blood.<sup id="cite_ref-katwala_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-katwala-7">[7]</a></sup> Some players, unaware that the effects of the debuff would expire upon defeating Hakkar, reacted to their character's infection with panic and would fast travel out of the dungeon while still carrying the contagious debuff.<sup id="cite_ref-ouellette_9-2"><a href="#cite_note-ouellette-9">[9]</a></sup>
</p><p>A programming oversight further contributed to the spread of the in-game pandemic. Players with animal companions could protect their pets during boss battles by placing them into a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a> mid-fight.<sup id="cite_ref-katwala_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-katwala-7">[7]</a></sup> Pet companions could contract Corrupted Blood, and after noticing that their pet had become infected, many players would place the animal into its suspended state to protect them from death. These pets were subsequently re-activated after the completion of the boss battle, but developers had forgotten to include an "off-switch" that would recognize the conclusion of the raid and remove the debuff from companions.<sup id="cite_ref-messner_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-messner-10">[10]</a></sup> Players who defeated Hakkar would subsequently fast travel to markets in urban centers in order to repair their damaged armor and weaponry. They then re-activated their infected pets, who became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_vector" title="Disease vector">disease vectors</a>, allowing Corrupted Blood to spread beyond players involved in the raid.<sup id="cite_ref-earle_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-earle-11">[11]</a></sup> Other NPCs could become infected with the disease, but they were incapable of dying, and instead became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic_carrier" title="Asymptomatic carrier">asymptomatic carriers</a> for player characters.<sup id="cite_ref-elker_2-2"><a href="#cite_note-elker-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Once it spread beyond the Zul'Gurub region, Corrupted Blood quickly became <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a> in Azeroth. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_case" title="Index case">index case</a> was never identified, but an early epicenter for the pandemic was in the Archimonde <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">server</a>, where a player summoned their infected pet in one of Azeroth's capital cities.<sup id="cite_ref-messner_10-1"><a href="#cite_note-messner-10">[10]</a></sup> Another outbreak soon occurred in Orgrimmar, the capital city of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc" title="Orc">Orcs</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-ward_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-ward-12">[12]</a></sup> and in the dwarf city of Ironforge.<sup id="cite_ref-elker_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-elker-2">[2]</a></sup> There was no in-game cure for Corrupted Blood, which inflicted between 263 and 317 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_points" title="Hit points">hit points</a> of damage every two seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-mcnamara_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-mcnamara-13">[13]</a></sup> This level of damage would kill a character of average experience level between 60 and 90 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-rossi_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-rossi-14">[14]</a></sup> While <i>World of Warcraft</i> player characters are resurrected after death,<sup id="cite_ref-ward_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-ward-12">[12]</a></sup> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Item_(game_terminology)" title="Item (game terminology)">items</a> that the characters had acquired would become damaged upon each revival, making character death inconvenient for players.<sup id="cite_ref-mcnamara_13-1"><a href="#cite_note-mcnamara-13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>The sudden arrival and spread of the Corrupted Blood pandemic created widespread panic among <i>World of Warcraft</i><span>'</span>s user base.

</p><p>Once players realized the scope of the pandemic, individual reactions to the infection varied. Some players whose characters possessed healing abilities headed to major cities as impromptu <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_responder" title="First responder">first responders</a>, but these characters often contracted and died from the disease as well.<sup id="cite_ref-katwala_7-5"><a href="#cite_note-katwala-7">[7]</a></sup> Healing measures were largely ineffective, as only one character class, Paladins, were capable of removing debuffs of Corrupted Blood's nature, and players risked reinfection almost immediately upon healing.<sup id="cite_ref-hruska_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-hruska-17">[17]</a></sup> More often, rather than removing the Corrupted Blood infection, healing characters merely kept characters alive and contagious, thereby prolonging the spread of the infection.<sup id="cite_ref-ouellette_9-3"><a href="#cite_note-ouellette-9">[9]</a></sup> Less powerful player characters, meanwhile, would stand at the edges of infected towns, warning other player characters not to enter.<sup id="cite_ref-orland_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-orland-18">[18]</a></sup> Players transmitted information from afar by using the game's farthest-reaching chat function, "yell".<sup id="cite_ref-earle_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-earle-11">[11]</a></sup> At least one player became an unofficial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_crier" title="Town crier">town crier</a>, making announcements about new pandemic developments in the open world's public spaces.<sup id="cite_ref-ouellette_9-4"><a href="#cite_note-ouellette-9">[9]</a></sup> Other players enacted self-quarantine methods, remaining in less-populated wilderness areas of Azeroth rather than entering towns or cities where they risked infection.<sup id="cite_ref-messner_10-2"><a href="#cite_note-messner-10">[10]</a></sup> Although the pandemic did not extend to the real world, epidemiologist Nina Fefferman noted that "players seemed to really feel they were at risk and took the threat of infection seriously".<sup id="cite_ref-model_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-model-19">[19]</a></sup>

<p>At approximately 1:15&nbsp;p.m. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Time_Zone" title="Eastern Time Zone">EST</a>) on the afternoon of September 16, a Blizzard staff member reported that the team was "aware of the issue and working on it".<sup id="cite_ref-earle_11-2"><a href="#cite_note-earle-11">[11]</a></sup> While the company quickly became aware that Corrupted Blood had spread beyond its intended reach, identifying and fixing the issue that led to the pandemic proved difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-messner_10-3"><a href="#cite_note-messner-10">[10]</a></sup> One of the first steps that Blizzard took to attempt containment of the virus was to institute quarantine zones, placing barriers around heavily infected areas. The effect that this quarantine had was limited, as some players managed to bypass Blizzard's containment measures.<sup id="cite_ref-marshall_15-3"><a href="#cite_note-marshall-15">[15]</a></sup> Developers, meanwhile, faced difficulties in isolating and removing the virus from the pet companions that were driving its spread.

<p>While Blizzard had not intended to create a pandemic event with the Corrupted Blood incident, the company noted the popularity that the pandemic had received. In 2008, Blizzard released an intentional plague in <i>World of Warcraft</i> to echo the success of the Corrupted Blood pandemic.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> On October 22, shortly before the release of a <i>World of Warcraft</i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_set" title="Expansion set">expansion set</a> titled <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Wrath_of_the_Lich_King" title="World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King">Wrath of the Lich King</a></i>, several mysterious crates appeared in one Azeroth town. Player characters who inspected these crates became infected with an unknown disease, and if they did not find a cure within 10 minutes, they would be transformed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie" title="Zombie">zombies</a>. Unlike Corrupted Blood, it was possible to cure the zombie infection through healing spells or NPC aid. As the number of infected characters grew, however, the time frame for healing became shorter and the virus became resistant to cleansing.<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> Blizzard put a stop to the Lich King plague on October 28 after receiving complaints from players that the zombie infection was detracting from other parts of the game.<sup id="cite_ref-ahmed_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-ahmed-24">[24]</a></sup>
</p><p>Another zombie pandemic known as the Scourge invasion was featured in 2020's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Shadowlands" title="World of Warcraft: Shadowlands">World of Warcraft: Shadowlands</a></i> expansion.<sup id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> To limit griefing attacks, the 2020 Scourge invasion was designed to make opting into the event more of a conscious choice by players who wanted to fight against the zombie hordes.<sup id="cite_ref-26"><a href="#cite_note-26">[26]</a></sup> The Scourge invasion received criticism, however, for its handling of new players. <i>Shadowlands</i> created a new starting area for players, Exile's Reach, in which new characters were separated from the rest of the game until they reached level 10. While this alternative starting area was isolated from the zombie pandemic, players whose characters began in other starting areas remained susceptible to infection and death.<sup id="cite_ref-27"><a href="#cite_note-27">[27]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2012, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic" title="Star Wars: The Old Republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></i>, a MMORPG by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWare" title="BioWare">BioWare</a>, released an online disease resembling the Corrupted Blood plague. Characters infected with the Rakghoul Plague would develop a signature cough that became progressively louder before they transformed into a zombie-like creature. Because the plague was transmitted more easily in heavily populated centers, player characters conducted business in more remote business areas to avoid infection.<sup id="cite_ref-chaddock_28-0"><a href="#cite_note-chaddock-28">[28]</a></sup> Unlike the Corrupted Blood incident, BioWare intentionally released the Rakghoul Plague, and player characters who succumbed to the disease received special items.<sup id="cite_ref-29"><a href="#cite_note-29">[29]</a></sup> Lead designer Daniel Erickson told reporters that the Rakghoul Plague was inspired by the Corrupted Blood incident, but that developers wanted to steer players away from griefing and towards positive interactions with the pandemic.<sup id="cite_ref-30"><a href="#cite_note-30">[30]</a></sup>
</p><p>Blizzard closed the Zul'Gurub raid in 2010 as part of a larger update which transformed the region into a five-person dungeon with new bosses.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup> The region was added to <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Classic" title="World of Warcraft Classic">World of Warcraft Classic</a></i> in 2020.

<p>The impact that the Corrupted Blood pandemic had on <i>World of Warcraft</i> players gained the attention of epidemiologists. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention" title="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC) contacted Blizzard after the incident, asking if they could use data from what they perceived as a planned disease simulation to inform their disease modeling research. Blizzard informed the facility that the Corrupted Blood outbreak was the unintentional result of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug" title="Software bug">software bug</a> and they thus had no usable data.<sup id="cite_ref-andrei_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-andrei-1">[1]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-32"><a href="#cite_note-32">[32]</a></sup> Despite its accidental nature, the Corrupted Blood incident bore several resemblances to real-world pandemics, leading researchers to explore the event as a disease model. In an article for the journal <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology_(journal)" title="Epidemiology (journal)">Epidemiology</a></i>, Ran Balicer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Gurion_University_of_the_Negev" title="Ben-Gurion University of the Negev">Ben-Gurion University of the Negev</a> compared the role that pet companions played in the spread of Corrupted Blood to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_influenza" title="Avian influenza">avian influenza</a>, which spread through asymptomatic ducks. The use of fast travel to quickly spread the disease between distant locations was also compared to the role that air travel played in the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%932004_SARS_outbreak" title="2002–2004 SARS outbreak">2002–2004 SARS outbreak</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-33"><a href="#cite_note-33">[33]</a></sup>
</p><p>Of particular interest to researchers in the use of MMORPGs for epidemiology is that character responses to a virtual pandemic are the result of individual player reactions, adding "a level of authenticity that doesn't exist in other simulations".<sup id="cite_ref-34"><a href="#cite_note-34">[34]</a></sup> Disease researchers typically study disease spread and control through the use of three general models, all of which make significant assumptions about human behavior. As behavior is difficult to predict, the effectiveness of these models is limited.<sup id="cite_ref-orland_18-2"><a href="#cite_note-orland-18">[18]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> The use of MMORPG environments like <i>World of Warcraft</i> introduces human behavior into disease models: while player characters are virtual, players are attached to the health and success of their characters and others, creating an immersive social environment.<sup id="cite_ref-lofgren_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-lofgren-36">[36]</a></sup> Video game models necessarily include player behaviors that would not be included in a general model. For instance, characters may purposely enter infected areas in the hope that a healing character would protect them, just as individuals may expose themselves to infection under the belief that a vaccine may be in the region.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup>
</p><p>Some researchers have responded skeptically to the notion that games like <i>World of Warcraft</i> may accurately model real-world infectious disease patterns. Although Gary Smith, a professor at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania" title="University of Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, admitted that mathematical disease models fail to take into account the spectrum of human behavior, he questioned the ability of a video game to remedy this error, saying that "the study is just as 'observational' as disease outbreak studies in the real world".<sup id="cite_ref-model_19-1"><a href="#cite_note-model-19">[19]</a></sup> Dmitri Williams, an associate professor at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_California" title="University of Southern California">University of Southern California</a> and a <i>World of Warcraft</i> player, questioned whether a player's behavior in a game "where you are encouraged to behave in a way that you would never behave offline" would be applicable to the real world.<sup id="cite_ref-elker_2-5"><a href="#cite_note-elker-2">[2]</a></sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Ferguson_(epidemiologist)" title="Neil Ferguson (epidemiologist)">Neil Ferguson</a>, director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC_Centre_for_Global_Infectious_Disease_Analysis" title="MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis">MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis</a>, noted that because characters could regenerate, there was not as much risk in becoming infected with a virtual disease, limiting the applicability of player behavior to the real world.<sup id="cite_ref-ahmed_24-1"><a href="#cite_note-ahmed-24">[24]</a></sup>
</p><p>While the Corrupted Blood incident created a focus on video games as tools of disease research, there were some specific aspects of the debuff that limited its applicability to other pandemics. For instance, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number" title="Basic reproduction number">basic reproduction number</a> of Corrupted Blood was significantly higher than any observed real-world pathogen, which in turn affected the rate of spread and player reactions.<sup id="cite_ref-lofgren_36-1"><a href="#cite_note-lofgren-36">[36]</a></sup> Additionally, players who had been infected with Corrupted Blood did not gain immunity to the debuff, which kept the infection circulating in perpetuity.<sup id="cite_ref-oultram_38-0"><a href="#cite_note-oultram-38">[38]</a></sup>
</p><p>Outside of disease research, some have speculated that the griefing attacks that took place during the Corrupted Blood pandemic may provide a model for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism" title="Bioterrorism">bioterrorism</a> research. Charles Blair of the Center for Terrorism and Intelligence Studies told <i>Wired</i> that, just as the human behavior in <i>World of Warcraft</i> supplemented general disease models, the behavior of griefers could augment the computer-modeled tactical decision-making enacted by terrorist researchers.<sup id="cite_ref-thier_20-1"><a href="#cite_note-thier-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-oultram_38-1"><a href="#cite_note-oultram-38">[38]</a></sup>

<p>The sudden impact of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic" title="COVID-19 pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a> in 2020 led several researchers to turn to the Corrupted Blood incident as a potential model for understanding the virus's sociological impact.<sup id="cite_ref-earle_11-3"><a href="#cite_note-earle-11">[11]</a></sup> The Elysium Project, an independent fan-led organization maintaining early versions of <i>World of Warcraft</i>, ran an experiment titled "Pandemic In Azeroth" which mimicked both the Corrupted Blood incident and the COVID-19 pandemic.

Both had an immediate impact on dense urban areas, which limited the effectiveness of containment procedures in stopping the spread of disease, while air travel, like fast travel, allowed infections to spread across large parts of the world with ease.<sup id="cite_ref-andrei_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-andrei-1">[1]</a></sup> Lofgren compared the in-game "first responders", many of whom contracted Corrupted Blood when they attempted to heal others, to healthcare workers that were overrun with COVID-19 patients and became infected themselves.<sup id="cite_ref-katwala_7-6"><a href="#cite_note-katwala-7">[7]</a></sup> While a direct analogue was not made to griefers, meanwhile, Lofgren also acknowledged individuals who contracted the COVID-19 virus but chose not to quarantine, thus infecting others through negligence.<sup id="cite_ref-41"><a href="#cite_note-41">[41]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="w-node-aee7d72d-1986-96c0-42f8-92db39229870-4f1cb9b1"><h3>Background: Shimmer’s ADHD Coaching System</h3><p>Shimmer was born from my personal frustration when I was <a href="https://www.shimmer.care/blog/shimmer-adhd-coaching-launch">diagnosed last year</a> &amp; wasn’t able to find an affordable, quality ADHD coach. True hyperfocus mode, I joined up with the top ADHD experts, the ADHD community, and an incredible team to build <strong>the first Affordable ADHD Coaching Platform</strong>, built by and for people with ADHD.</p><p>‍</p><div><p>Our vision: a world where every person with ADHD reaches their full potential, <span data-token-index="1">t</span><span data-token-index="2">he</span><span data-token-index="3">i</span><span data-token-index="4">r</span><span data-token-index="5"> </span><span data-token-index="6">w</span><span data-token-index="7">a</span><span data-token-index="8">y</span><span data-token-index="9">.</span></p></div><p>‍</p><p>This last year has been a whirlwind of an adventure to say the least. Since then, we’ve built an incredible ADHD community of 60K+, onboarded 20+ coaches, launched our <a href="https://www.shimmer.care/about">ADHD Coaching Programme</a>, and served over <a href="https://www.shimmer.care/blog/1000-members-celebration">1,000 members</a> through it. </p><p>‍</p><p>A bit on how Shimmer works:</p><ul role="list"><li>The science:</li><li>~Shimmer’s program is rooted in Health &amp; Wellness Coaching and closely linked to it's sister discipline of positive psychology</li><li>~Your coach will help you focus on your horizons and the opportunities ahead, and not solely on diagnostics and deficits. You’ll work together to build skills, develop awareness, and institute habits and routines that work for your life</li><li>The day-to-day:</li><li>~Get matched w/ an expert ADHD coach, meet weekly</li><li>~Set goals &amp; experiment with skills, strategies, and routines each week</li><li>~Stay accountable to progress, learning and growing through the Shimmer platform</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The Why: Driving Force Behind the Web Platform</h3><p>Contrary to the prevailing notion of pushing mobile usage and competing for attention, our core purpose has always centered around addressing the unique needs of people with ADHD and prioritizing coaching outcomes. So we ask ourselves the question: What are the key obstacles or voids preventing our members from fully realizing their coaching goals? We then reverse-engineer solutions from these challenges. Here are a few primary hurdles we tackled and how the web platform elegantly resolves them:</p><p>‍</p><h4>🙈 Out of Sight, Out of Mind</h4><p>For those of us with ADHD, when things are not in our view or realm of attention, it’s very difficult to retrieve this information. Our members, predominantly spending their time on laptops, often find that Goals, Actions, and even their Coach fade into the background until they later pick up their phones.</p><p>‍</p><p>The new mobile-web system introduces <strong>diverse entry points</strong>, empowering users to engage with their coaching journey across an array of devices, extending beyond the confines of smartphones.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🤿 Desire to Go Deeper</h4><p>Shimmer is a lot more than an app, it’s a holistic Coaching Experience that requires deep thought and reflection. Our members have been itching for the web app to be able to better engage in the in-app Experiences that require a deeper level of thinking, typing, and consuming information.</p><p>‍</p><p>The web platform is purposefully crafted to enable deep exploration. Not only does it offer <strong>expanded typing space</strong> for introspection and the convenience of keyboard input, but it also enhances the capability to <strong>bookmark and retrieve</strong> relevant insights.</p><p>‍</p><h4>🧠 Forgetting Coaching Goals &amp; Insights</h4><p>Members often walk away with “a-ha” moments, especially after initially setting holistic goals for their ADHD Coaching Journey. Unfortunately these are sometimes lost either on the way from their laptop to their phone, or simply because it was not displayed in the right way at the right time.</p><p>‍</p><p>The web platform provides a <strong>visual cue</strong> for Coaching Goals, maintaining their prominent position to sustain motivation. Furthermore, coaching insights can now be easily captured within pre- and post-session workflows.</p><p>‍</p><h4>📱 Phone Addiction</h4><p>Many of our members either struggle with phone addiction, or are simply looking to reduce their use of their phone. Several members have their main goal as reducing phone time. For these members, knowing they need to go to their phone to work on their ADHD goals can cause distraction: e.g. checking their Shimmer app but ending up on Instagram.</p><p>‍</p><p>The web-based platform offers a <strong>focused environment</strong> for engagement, minimizing the potential distractions often associated with mobile apps.</p><p>‍</p><h3>The How: An Iterative Community Effort</h3><p>If you’ve touched even just an edge of the Shimmer Orbit, you’ve likely noticed we’re absolutely obsessed with <strong>building with the community</strong>. Every single day, the team holds lively feedback calls with members, coaches, ADHD creators, and ADHD experts.</p><p>‍</p><p>Here is a look into a few key components of our web design process. We’re happy to elaborate if you message us! We’ve…</p><ul role="list"><li>Held hundreds of <strong>1:1 interviews</strong> with potential members, current members, cancelled members</li><li>Ran <strong>focus groups</strong> and “<strong>CTO open houses</strong>”</li><li>Implemented a <strong>direct chat line</strong> through the app to our CTO</li><li>Ran an extremely <strong>iterative 360 UX design</strong>: interviewing coaches, members</li><li>Pressure tested our Web App &amp; design with the <strong>wider ADHD community</strong> including ADHD creators</li><li>…And the table-stakes testing phases with members (Alpha, Beta…)</li></ul><p>‍</p><h3>The What: Web App Unveiled</h3><h4>🎨 Design Guidelines</h4><p>Getting to design for people with ADHD is a privilege and a brain teaser all at once—most products built for neurotypical audiences don’t have as strong of a focus on accessibility, but for us it’s one of the most rewarding things to think about and get right. Here are our 3 guiding design philosophies:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Accessibility</strong> is a prerequisite: visual coherence, sans-serif typography, thoughtfully spaced elements, and appropriately sized fonts.</li><li>However, <strong>stimulation</strong> is necessary: careful use of visual elements like color, images, movement (and confetti)</li><li>All flows are <strong>ADHD-elevated:</strong> For example, making sure multi-step forms where previous steps need to be referenced are properly shown. Another one is the inclusion of examples for key questions from other members to reduce cognitive load and decision making paralysis.</li></ol><p>‍</p><h4>🌐 The Web App!</h4><p>If you’re still reading, kudos—we hope you’re as invested and excited as we are now! If you skipped and scrolled right to here, we see you 👀.</p><p>‍</p><p>Each flow has been carefully thought out, tested, and designed to elevate the ADHD coaching experience. Check it out:</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>1. Onboarding</strong>: Sit down and get comfy. You’ll start off by setting your long-term vision and assess your starting state, setting the foundation for your coaching goals.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d440cb0eec1ae8e9684005_small_mastery.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>2. Setting your first goal</strong>: The new goal setting wizard allows you to solidify the importance of your goal, link actions, and print it to keep it on your desk!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d440d5f09e4c0aa5e446ce_small_goals.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>3. Completing actions, reflecting, and celebrating</strong>: Experiment with weekly actions with your coach, reflect on what’s working (or not!), and celebrate your wins.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d43f3c4eefd6c69228fd69_small_actions.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>4. Coach support</strong>: Between sessions, your coach will be notified of your progress and cheer you on! You can also ping your coach for troubleshooting or advanced learning resources.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d44107c71dc866a97d7ffc_small_chat.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>5. Continued learning</strong>: Embark on bite-sized learning modules on key ADHD topics or access resources assigned by your coach.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5ffbd248b8c48c3bbdf4e481/64d440f4be2a4ff921778317_small_learning.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p>Curious to learn more? Take a deeper look into our Web App on our <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/shimmer-web-app">Product Hunt launch</a> (we’d appreciate the support!) or by signing up for a coach at <a href="https://app.shimmer.care/">app.shimmer.care</a>.</p><p>‍</p><div><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/shimmer-web-app?utm_source=badge-featured&amp;utm_medium=badge&amp;utm_souce=badge-shimmer-web-app" target="_blank"><img src="https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=408154&amp;theme=light" alt="Shimmer Web App - ADHD Coaching | Reach your full potential, your way | Product Hunt" width="250" height="54"></a></p></div><p>‍</p><h3>The Future: A World Where Difference is Our Strength</h3><p>I can no longer count the amount of times I sat on my floor and cried after hearing mind-boggling, heart-warming, awe-inspiring success stories from our incredible members. Promotions to positions they never thought they’d achieve, mending and strengthening of close-to-breaking relationships, the first feeling of pride as a parent in <strong><em>years</em></strong>, and thriving in new, purposeful jobs… the list goes on.</p><p>‍</p><p>What this shows me (what I already knew in my heart), is that people with ADHD have an immense amount of talent, intelligence, creativity, beauty, and love to contribute to the world that is often being blocked or held down.</p><p>‍</p><p>What this also screams to me is the need farther reaching accommodations, support, and understanding from the wider community to help unleash the strengths of difference. Employers, family members, partners, teachers, friends—this is an invitation to join us in our mission, because <em>“When we shape the world for difference, we all thrive. (</em><a href="https://understood.org/"><em>Understood.org</em></a><em>)”.</em></p><p>‍</p><p>With love,</p><p>Chris Wang + The entire Shimmer team</p></div><div id="w-node-e5d44626-1498-7cca-42cd-0efaf7a86547-4f1cb9b1"><div><p>You have been successfully subscribed to our newsletter!</p></div><div><p>Oops!

    <div><p><strong>At the age of 30, Ann suffered a brainstem stroke that left her severely paralyzed. She lost control of all the muscles in her body and was unable even to breathe. It came on suddenly one afternoon, for reasons that are still mysterious.</strong></p>

<p>For the next five years, Ann went to bed each night afraid she would die in her sleep. It took years of physical therapy before she could move her facial muscles enough to laugh or cry. Still, the muscles that would have allowed her to speak remained immobile.</p>

<p>“Overnight, everything was taken from me,” Ann wrote, using a device that enables her to type slowly on a computer screen with small movements of her head. “I had a 13-month-old daughter, an 8-year-old stepson and 26-month-old marriage.”</p>

<p>It is the first time that either speech or facial expressions have been synthesized from brain signals. The system can also decode these signals into text at nearly 80 words per minute, a vast improvement over the 14 words per minute that her current communication device delivers.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/edward.chang">Edward Chang</a>, MD, chair of neurological surgery at UCSF, who has worked on the technology, known as a brain-computer interface, or BCI, for more than a decade, hopes this latest research breakthrough, published Aug. 23, 2023, in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06443-4"><em>Nature</em></a>, will lead to an FDA-approved system that enables speech from brain signals in the near future.</p>

<p>“Our goal is to restore a full, embodied way of communicating, which is the most natural way for us to talk with others,” said Chang, who is a member of the <a href="https://weill.ucsf.edu/">UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences</a> and the Jeanne Robertson Distinguished Professor. “These advancements bring us much closer to making this a real solution for patients.”</p>

              <h2><br>
Decoding the signals of speech</h2>

<p>Ann was a high school math teacher in Canada before her stroke in 2005. In 2020, she described her life since in a paper she wrote, painstakingly typing letter-by-letter, for a psychology class.</p>

<p>“Locked-in syndrome, or LIS, is just like it sounds,” she wrote. “You’re fully cognizant, you have full sensation, all five senses work, but you are locked inside a body where no muscles work. I learned to breathe on my own again, I now have full neck movement, my laugh returned, I can cry and read and over the years my smile has returned, and I am able to wink and say a few words.”</p>

<p>As she recovered, she realized she could use her own experiences to help others, and she now aspires to become a counselor in a physical rehabilitation facility.</p>

<p>“I want patients there to see me and know their lives are not over now,” she wrote. “I want to show them that disabilities don’t need to stop us or slow us down.”</p>

<p>She learned about Chang’s study in 2021 after reading about a paralyzed man named Pancho, who helped the team <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a412e3d6-6159-4bb8-a5f1-0db7c1e6cf3f" href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/420946/neuroprosthesis-restores-words-man-paralysis" title="“Neuroprosthesis” Restores Words to Man with Paralysis">translate his brain signals into text as he attempted to speak</a>. He had also experienced a brainstem stroke many years earlier, and it wasn’t clear if his brain could still signal the movements for speech. It’s not enough just to think about something; a person has to actually attempt to speak for the system to pick it up. Pancho became the first person living with paralysis to demonstrate that it was possible to decode speech-brain signals into full words.</p>

</dom-twocolumn-layout><hr><p>With Ann, Chang’s team attempted something even more ambitious: decoding her brain signals into the richness of speech, along with the movements that animate a person’s face during conversation.</p>

<p>To do this, the team implanted a paper-thin rectangle of 253 electrodes onto the surface of her brain over areas they previously discovered were critical for speech. The electrodes intercepted the brain signals that, if not for the stroke, would have gone to muscles in Ann’s lips, tongue, jaw and larynx, as well as her face. A cable, plugged into a port fixed to Ann’s head, connected the electrodes to a bank of computers.</p>

<p>For weeks, Ann worked with the team to train the system’s artificial intelligence algorithms to recognize her unique brain signals for speech. This involved repeating different phrases from a 1,024-word conversational vocabulary over and over again until the computer recognized the brain activity patterns associated with all the basic sounds of speech.</p>

              <p>“It was exciting to see her go from, ‘We’re going to just try doing this,’ and then seeing it happen quicker than probably anyone thought,” said Ann’s husband, Bill, who travelled with her from Canada to be with her during the study. “It seems like they’re pushing each other to see how far they can go with this.”</p>

<p>Rather than train the AI to recognize whole words, the researchers created a system that decodes words from smaller components called phonemes. These are the sub-units of speech that form spoken words in the same way that letters form written words. “Hello,” for example, contains four phonemes: “HH,” “AH,” “L” and “OW.”</p>

<p>Using this approach, the computer only needed to learn 39 phonemes to decipher any word in English. This both enhanced the system’s accuracy and made it three times faster.</p>

<p>“The accuracy, speed and vocabulary are crucial,” said Sean Metzger, who developed the text decoder with Alex Silva, both graduate students in the joint Bioengineering Program at UC Berkeley and UCSF. “It’s what gives Ann the potential, in time, to communicate almost as fast as we do, and to have much more naturalistic and normal conversations.”</p>

	<p><strong>Giving Mom her voice back</strong></p>

	<p>Ann’s 18-year-old daughter knows “mom’s voice” as a computerized voice with a British accent.</p>

	<p>The BRAVO3 team recreated Ann’s voice using language learning AI, and footage of Ann’s laugh-inducing wedding speech from 2005.</p>

              <h2><br>
Adding a face and a voice</h2>

<p>To synthesize Ann’s speech, the team devised an algorithm for synthesizing speech, which they personalized to sound like her voice before the injury by using a recording of Ann speaking at her wedding.</p>

<p>“My brain feels funny when it hears my synthesized voice,” she wrote in answer to a question. “It’s like hearing an old friend.”</p>

<p>She looks forward to the day when her daughter – who only knows the impersonal, British-accented voice of her current communication device – can hear it too.</p>

<p>“My daughter was 1 when I had my injury, it’s like she doesn’t know Ann … She has no idea what Ann sounds like.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want patients ... to see me and know that their lives are not over now. I want to show them that disabilities don’t need to stop us or slow us down.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The team animated Ann’s avatar with the help of software that simulates and animates muscle movements of the face, developed by Speech Graphics, a company that makes AI-driven facial animation. The researchers created customized machine-learning processes that allowed the company’s software to mesh with signals being sent from Ann’s brain as she was trying to speak and convert them into the movements on her avatar’s face, making the jaw open and close, the lips protrude and purse and the tongue go up and down, as well as the facial movements for happiness, sadness and surprise.</p>

<p>“We’re making up for the connections between her brain and vocal tract that have been severed by the stroke,” said Kaylo Littlejohn, a graduate student working with Chang and Gopala Anumanchipalli, PhD, a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. “When Ann first used this system to speak and move the avatar’s face in tandem, I knew that this was going to be something that would have a real impact.”</p>

<p>An important next step for the team is to create a wireless version that would not require Ann to be physically connected to the BCI.</p>

<p>“Giving people like Ann the ability to freely control their own computers and phones with this technology would have profound effects on their independence and social interactions,” said co-first author <a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/david.moses">David Moses</a>, PhD, an adjunct professor in neurological surgery.</p>

<p>For Ann, helping to develop the technology has been life changing.</p>

<p>“When I was at the rehab hospital, the speech therapist didn’t know what to do with me,” she wrote in answer to a question. “Being a part of this study has given me a sense of purpose, I feel like I am contributing to society. It feels like I have a job again. It’s amazing I have lived this long; this study has allowed me to really live while I’m still alive!”</p>

<p>
<b>Hacker News Guidelines</b></p><p>
<b>What to Submit</b></p><p>
On-Topic: Anything that good hackers would find interesting. That includes
more than hacking and startups. If you had to reduce it to a sentence,
the answer might be: anything that gratifies one's intellectual
curiosity.
</p><p>
Off-Topic: Most stories about politics, or crime, or sports, or
celebrities, unless they're evidence of some interesting new
phenomenon. Videos of pratfalls or disasters, or cute animal pictures.
If they'd cover it on TV news, it's probably off-topic.
</p><p>
<b>In Submissions</b>
</p><p>
Please don't do things to make titles stand out, like using uppercase
or exclamation points, or saying how great an article is. It's
implicit in submitting something that you think it's important.
</p><p>
Please submit the original source.  If a post reports on
something found on another site, submit the latter.
</p><p>
Please don't use HN primarily for promotion. It's ok to post
your own stuff part of the time, but the primary use of the site
should be for curiosity.
</p><p>
If the title includes the name of the site, please take it out,
because the site name will be displayed after the link.
</p><p>
If the title contains a gratuitous number or number + adjective,
we'd appreciate it if you'd crop it.  E.g. translate "10 Ways
To Do X" to "How To Do X," and "14 Amazing Ys" to "Ys."  Exception:
when the number is meaningful, e.g. "The 5 Platonic Solids."
</p><p>
Otherwise please use the original title, unless it
is misleading or linkbait; don't editorialize.
</p><p>
If you submit a video or pdf, please warn us by appending
[video] or [pdf] to the title.
</p><p>
Please don't post on HN to ask or tell us something. Send it
to hn@ycombinator.com.
</p><p>
Please don't delete and repost. Deletion is for things
that shouldn't have been submitted in the first place.
</p><p>
Don't solicit upvotes, comments, or submissions. Users should vote and
comment when they run across something they personally find
interesting—not for promotion.
</p><p>
Be kind. Don't be snarky. Converse curiously; don't cross-examine.
Edit out swipes.
</p><p>
Comments should get more thoughtful and substantive,
not less, as a topic gets more divisive.
</p><p>
When disagreeing, please reply to the argument instead of calling
names. "That is idiotic; 1 + 1 is 2, not 3" can be shortened to "1 + 1
is 2, not 3."
</p><p>
Please don't fulminate. Please don't sneer, including at the rest of
the community.
</p><p>
Please respond to the strongest plausible interpretation of what
someone says, not a weaker one that's easier to criticize. Assume good
faith.
</p><p>
Eschew flamebait. Avoid generic tangents. Omit internet tropes.
</p><p>
Please don't post shallow dismissals, especially of other people's
work. A good critical comment teaches us something.
</p><p>
Please don't use Hacker News for political or ideological battle. That
tramples curiosity.
</p><p>
Please don't comment on whether someone read an article. "Did you
even read the article? It mentions that" can be shortened to "The
article mentions that".
</p><p>
Please don't pick the most provocative thing in an article or post to
complain about in the thread. Find something interesting to respond to
instead.
</p><p>
Throwaway accounts are ok for sensitive information, but please don't
create accounts routinely. HN is a community—users should have an
identity that others can relate to.
</p><p>
Please don't use uppercase for emphasis.  If you want to emphasize
a word or phrase, put *asterisks* around it and it will get
italicized.
</p><p>
Please don't post insinuations about astroturfing, shilling,
brigading, foreign agents, and the like. It degrades discussion
and is usually mistaken. If you're worried about abuse, email
hn@ycombinator.com and we'll look at the data.
</p><p>
Please don't complain that a submission is inappropriate. If a story
is spam or off-topic, flag it. Don't feed egregious comments by
replying; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/newsfaq.html#cflag">flag</a> them instead. If you
flag, please don't also comment that you did.
</p><p>
Please don't complain about tangential annoyances—e.g.
article or website formats, name collisions, or back-button breakage.
They're too common to be interesting.
</p><p>
Please don't comment about the voting on comments. It never does any
good, and it makes boring reading.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-spacex-discriminating-against-asylees-and-refugees-hiring</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37250388">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/media/1311656/dl?inline" rel="noopener" target="_blank">filed</a> a lawsuit today against Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) for discriminating against asylees and refugees in hiring. The lawsuit alleges that, from at least September 2018 to May 2022, SpaceX routinely discouraged asylees and refugees from applying and refused to hire or consider them, because of their citizenship status, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>

<p>In job postings and public statements over several years, SpaceX wrongly claimed that under federal regulations known as “export control laws,” SpaceX could hire only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, sometimes referred to as “green card holders.” Export control laws impose no such hiring restrictions. Moreover, asylees’ and refugees’ permission to live and work in the United States does not expire, and they stand on equal footing with U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents under export control laws. Under these laws, companies like SpaceX can hire asylees and refugees for the same positions they would hire U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents. And once hired, asylees and refugees can access export-controlled information and materials without additional government approval, just like U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents.</p>

<p>“Our investigation found that SpaceX failed to fairly consider or hire asylees and refugees because of their citizenship status and imposed what amounted to a ban on their hire regardless of their qualification, in violation of federal law,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. “Our investigation also found that SpaceX recruiters and high-level officials took actions that actively discouraged asylees and refugees from seeking work opportunities at the company. Asylees and refugees have overcome many obstacles in their lives, and unlawful employment discrimination based on their citizenship status should not be one of them. Through this lawsuit we will hold SpaceX accountable for its illegal employment practices and seek relief that allows asylees and refugees to fairly compete for job opportunities and contribute their talents to SpaceX’s workforce.”</p>

<p>The department’s lawsuit alleges that SpaceX discriminated against asylees and refugees based on citizenship status at multiple stages of the hiring process. For example:</p>

<ul><li>SpaceX discouraged asylees and refugees from applying for open positions, through public announcements, job applications and other online recruiting communications that excluded asylees and refugees.</li>
<li>SpaceX failed to fairly consider applications submitted by asylees and refugees.</li>
<li>SpaceX refused to hire qualified asylee and refugee applicants and repeatedly rejected asylee and refugee applicants because of their citizenship status.</li>
<li>SpaceX hired only U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, from September 2018 to September 2020.</li>
</ul><p>SpaceX recruits and hires for a variety of positions, including welders, cooks, crane operators, baristas and dishwashers, as well as information technology specialists, software engineers, business analysts, rocket engineers and marketing professionals. The jobs at issue in the lawsuit are not limited to those that require advanced degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asylees and refugees are migrants to the United States who have fled persecution. To obtain their status, they undergo thorough vetting by the United States government. Under the INA, employers cannot discriminate against them in hiring, unless a law, regulation, executive order or government contract requires the employer to do so. In this instance, no law, regulation, executive order or government contract required or permitted SpaceX to engage in the widespread discrimination against asylees or refugees that the department’s investigation found, as explained in the complaint.</p>

<p>Because SpaceX works with certain goods, software, technology and technical data (referred to here as export-controlled items), SpaceX must comply with export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Export Administration Regulations. Under these regulations, asylees, refugees, lawful permanent residents, U.S. citizens and U.S. nationals working at U.S. companies can access export-controlled items without authorization from the U.S. government. Therefore, these laws do not require SpaceX to treat asylees and refugees differently than U.S. citizens or green card holders. Find more information <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/page/file/1579981/dl">here</a> on how employers can avoid discrimination when complying with export control requirements.</p>

<p>The United States seeks fair consideration and back pay for asylees and refugees who were deterred or denied employment at SpaceX due to the alleged discrimination. The United States also seeks civil penalties in an amount to be determined by the court and policy changes to ensure it complies with the INA’s nondiscrimination mandate going forward.</p>

<p>Please contact the department’s Civil Rights Division’s Immigrant and Employee Rights Section (IER) at <a href="mailto:IERSpaceXcase@usdoj.gov">IERSpaceXcase@usdoj.gov</a> or 1-888-473-3845 if you are or were an asylee or refugee who experienced any one of the following at any point in time:</p>

        <p>Have you ever been told that the company’s data on laptops is protected thanks to BitLocker? Well it turns out that this depends on BitLocker’s configuration…</p>

<h2 id="architecture-of-a-passwordless-bitlocker-with-a-discrete-tpm">Architecture of a passwordless BitLocker with a discrete TPM</h2>
<p>The BitLocker partition is encrypted using the Full Volume Encryption Key (FVEK). The FVEK itself is encrypted using the Volume Master Key (VMK) and stored on the disk, next to the encrypted data. This permits key rotations without re-encrypting the whole disk.</p>

<p>The VMK is stored in the TPM. Thus the disk can only be decrypted when booted from this computer (there is a recovery mechanism in Active Directory though).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/arch.png" alt="TPM key architecture"></p>

<p>In order to decrypt the disk, the CPU will ask that the TPM sends the VMK over the SPI bus.</p>

<p>The vulnerability should be obvious: at some point in the boot process, the VMK transits unencrypted between the TPM and the CPU. This means that it can be captured and used to decrypt the disk.</p>

<h2 id="capturing-the-tpm-exchange">Capturing the TPM exchange</h2>
<p>We’ll be using a dirt cheap logic analyzer, <a href="https://www.dreamsourcelab.com/product/dslogic-series/">DSLogic Plus</a>. I bought this for under $100 in 2021 (tax and shipping included).</p>

<p>A note on signal capture: to comfortably acquire a signal the sampling frequency should be 3 to 4 times the bus frequency. This means that for our SPI 33MHz bus we should sample at the very least at 100MHz. Notice that the specs of the analyzer state that it can do <em>up to</em> 400MHz on <em>up to</em> 16 channels. I’ll help you read between the lines here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the more channels you capture at a time (by sets of 3), the lower the sampling frequency</li>
  <li>you have to distinguish stream mode and buffer mode. The first one will send results directly to the host computer and permits capture of large sets, up to a minute but it’s limited to 100MHz on 3 channels. The buffer mode allows sampling at 400MHz but it will only work for a few milliseconds, so there’s no practical use for it here.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that this hardware can <em>barely</em> do the job we’re asking it to do. For a more professional option both hardware and software-wise (but also 10x pricier) have a look at <a href="https://usd.saleae.com/products/saleae-logic-pro-16">Saleae</a>. Otherwise there’s <a href="https://sigrok.org/wiki/Supported_hardware#Logic_analyzers">sigrok’s list of supported hardware</a>.</p>

<p>As for plugging the analyzer to the board, remember that SPI is a shared bus. This means that there’s no need to capture the signal right at the tiny TPM pins if there is a larger SPI component on the board that the hooks can be latched on to. From experience I identified a neighbouring SPI flash, but fortunately all components are marked so it’s rather easy to identify their use by looking up their datasheet.
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/SPI_pin.jpg" alt="Lenovo board"></p>

<p>SPI has several lines but only 3 can be captured using the DSLogic because otherwise the sampling frequency drops. The 3 most important ones are the clock CLK and the two data lines MOSI and MISO.</p>

<p>The threshold voltage (level at which the analyzer decides that the line has changed states) should be around half of the signal’s voltage, here the latter was measured at 3.3V so an appropriate threshold is around 1.6V.</p>

<p>The VMK key we’re looking for is used late in the POST stage. For the Lenovo L13 I worked with it was just after the splash screen, about 14 seconds into the boot process out of a total boot time of about 25 seconds. There are SPI operations before that (mostly to read and verify the early boot stages) but they’re not TPM. You could either start the capture when booting the computer, or safely wait about 7 or so seconds to avoid capturing unnecessary data.</p>

<h2 id="decoding-the-captured-signal">Decoding the captured signal</h2>
<p>There are 3 layers to decode:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SPI, which is the physical layer</li>
  <li>TIS</li>
  <li>TPM2.0, which contains the VMK</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="spi">SPI</h2>
<p>As far as SPI is concerned any logic analyzer should do this properly, it’s a rather simple protocol:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/spi_frame.PNG" alt="SPI byte"></p>

<p>The blue square wave is the clock, the other two lines (yellow and red) are data lines, respectively used for communications from slave to master (MISO) and master to slave (MOSI).</p>

<p>When the clock signal is going up (transitioning from 0 to 1), the bit value is whatever state the data lines are in at this specific time. In our case the red line sits at 0 for 8 clock cycles, so the byte is 0. The yellow line only has the first bit set, so the decoded value is b10000000 = 0x80.</p>

<p>The logic analyzer correctly decodes SPI so we’ll just trust its output.</p>

<h2 id="tis">TIS</h2>
<p>TIS, which stands for TPM Interface Specification, is another beast entirely and that’s where I had most of my troubles. I couldn’t find a decoder that worked for my capture and decided to do it “manually”. Short of correctly decoding the data, the <a href="https://github.com/sigrokproject/libsigrokdecode/pull/88">libsigrock decoders</a> did at least indicate a rough window for the TPM exchanges which was a welcome tip since each capture has several million bytes of data. Maybe the decoders fail be because the capture is missing Chip Select (CS#) which is required in the TPM specification, maybe because the clock is incorrect, maybe because some bytes are occasionally missing, maybe for some other reason, who knows.</p>

<p>Master to slave request:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tis_frame_request.PNG" alt="Master to slave request"></p>

<p>Sending a request seems to happen in this order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the slave sends byte 80 to signal that it’s ready</li>
  <li>the master sends a header we don’t care about (<code>D4 00 24</code>) and then sends the TPM byte in a loop (<code>80</code>)</li>
  <li>the slave acknowledges that it has read the byte by sending 01 FF</li>
  <li>at this point the cycle starts anew with the next byte</li>
</ul>

<p>So this whole frame is just to send the byte 0x80 from the master to the slave!</p>

<p>Slave to master response:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tis_frame_response.PNG" alt="Slave to master response"></p>

<p>This is a completely different process that relies on setting and reading registers. The frame is the result of reading one byte from a set address (<code>D4 00 24</code>, meaning register 24). Again the slave seems to start the transaction with byte 80, then writes the size of the followong data which is only 1 byte (or it could be an ACK value to the read request, who knows) and finally the value we care about, here 0x80. The next TPM byte is 0x02.</p>

<h2 id="tpm-20">TPM 2.0</h2>
<p>The TPM command that requests the key be sent back is the <code>TPM2_Unseal</code> command. It is described in <a href="https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/resource/tpm-library-specification/">part 3 of the TPM 2.0 specification</a>.</p>

<p>You might ask how I isolated the frames below since no decoder would work. We don’t actually care about the requests happening on MOSI, we’re mostly interested in the responses on the MISO line. As we’ve seen previously the TIS encoding around TPM bytes is rather simple, so the simplest way to isolate all TPM transactions is to filter the raw SPI data using the mask “80 00 00 00 01 ..” and only keep this wildcard last byte. The start of a TPM transaction can then be identified by its own <code>80 01</code> or <code>80 02</code> header. There should only be a few dozens TPM responses, the one with the key inside should be the longer authenticated one (starts with <code>80 02</code>).</p>

<p><img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/unseal_response.PNG" alt="unseal cmd and response">
There is a 10 milliseconds delay between the unseal command and the response, which is huge. This is probably because the request is authenticated (see below the <code>80 02</code> header indicating a password session as opposed to most requests using the plain <code>80 01</code> header) using a HMAC so the slave has to verify the signature and then reply using a HMAC of its own, which induces a notable delay.</p>

<p>The TPM command and its response are obtained by reassembling bytes one by one using the method previously explained.</p>

<p>Reconstituted Unseal command:</p>
<div><pre><code>80 02 00 00 00 5B 00 00 01 5E 80 00 00 00 00 00 00 49 03 00 00 00 00 20 9D F7 05 43 7A 77 AE E4 20 92 66 17 EC DA BB A7 79 D2 47 0D 42 E5 D1 1C EB 4A 6B C1 C8 44 42 BC 00 00 20 D9 AF C7 DF 10 7A D4 30 C1 C5 28 63 5F CE CE 8A 24 1A 19 E5 DD 08 5F 77 AA 28 BE 75 16 16 91 F1
</code></pre></div>

<p>Decoded frame using <a href="https://joholl.github.io/tpmstream-web/">this awesome tool</a>:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tpm_command.PNG" alt="Decode TPM unseal command"></p>

<p>Response (I’ve stripped continuation bytes <code>1F 00</code>, they become apparent if you capture several long frames):</p>
<div><pre><code>80 02 00 00 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 2E 00 2C 2C 00 05 00 01 00 00 00 03 20 00 00 57 61 A3 91 DF E1 B3 85 28 28 C6 DD A6 F9 A5 FE AC E9 71 A4 AA AE 44 25 18 F7 4A A7 FE D6 E0 FC 00 20 8D DD A1 AE 93 5D 98 E9 DA A8 18 6F D5 64 A8 66 E6 DE AA 56 9E 2F 50 A7 41 E1 27 BF A1 2C 4D 92 00 00 20 00 20 BA C9 8F 34 60 5F 4F D4 76 9B 6B AA 68 C7 6C 79 EF 36 7D 1D D3 19 33 78 55 47 B2 E1 40 D4
</code></pre></div>

<p>Decoded response:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/tpm_response.PNG" alt="Decoded TPM response"></p>

<p>In the buffer lies our key, it starts with <code>5761</code> and is 32 bytes long.</p>

<h2 id="mounting-and-backdooring-the-disk">Mounting and backdooring the disk</h2>
<p>Mounting the disk live in read/write mode (if you’d rather work offline do a disk copy with dd and then mount this copy using a loop device):</p>
<div><pre><code>echo 5761A391DF1F00E1B3852828C6DDA6F9A5FEACE971A4AAAE442518F74AA7FED6E0FC | xxd -r -p &gt; key
dislocker-fuse -K key /dev/sdd3 ./mnt/
mount ./mnt/dislocker-file ./mnt2/
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then the simplest backdoor is to just overwrite the sticky keys program with cmd:</p>
<div><pre><code>cp ./mnt2/Windows/System32/cmd.exe ./mnt2/Windows/System32/sethc.exe
</code></pre></div>

<p>Place the disk back in the laptop, boot and press shift 5 times to get a SYSTEM shell:
<img src="https://www.errno.fr/BypassingBitlocker/system.jpg" alt="sethc"></p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>I cannot recommend using the DSLogic for this task:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a lot of captures were duds and had to be thrown away</li>
  <li>sampling at 3 times the bus speed was barely enough to have a coherent clock and some bytes were missing</li>
</ul>

<p>This forced me to spend way too much time to understand the protocols in order to decode the capture. In the end time is money, if you’re an employer reading this just buy a professional logic analyzer for your employees.</p>

<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>The use of a discrete (physical) TPM actually decreases the security of the system, using a fTPM would solve the problem.</p>

<p>If the discrete TPM has to be used, then a PIN or passphrase on BitLocker is necessary.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p>Recently, I was invited to speak at a <a href="https://www.paleisamsterdam.nl/en/symposia/">symposium organized by the Amsterdam Royal Palace Foundation</a>, who, twice a year, brings in experts to discuss some big topic like the COVID pandemic or the future of work. This summer’s meeting was about the search for extraterrestrial life. While I focused on the search in our own Solar System, <a href="https://www.saraseager.com/">Sara Seager</a> of MIT presented her ideas on <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43043384?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">how to look for life on planets circling other stars</a>.</p>
<p>During our talks and the discussions that followed, I dropped a suggestion that some people surely will find provocative: that we <em>already did </em>find <a href="https://bigthink.com/starts-with-a-bang/is-life-possible-on-mars/">life on Mars</a> nearly 50 years ago—but that we inadvertently killed it.</p>
<h2>The Viking Lander Experiments</h2>
<p>In the mid-1970s, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1742875?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">NASA sent two Viking landers to the surface of Mars</a> equipped with instruments that conducted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viking_lander_biological_experiments">the only life detection experiments ever conducted on another planet</a>. The results of those tests were very confusing at the time and remain so today. While some of them—particularly the labelled release experiment (which tested for microbial metabolism) and the pyrolytic release experiments (which tested for organic synthesis)—were initially positive for life, the gas exchange experiment was not.</p>

	<div>

	</div>
	
<p>The Viking landers also included <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1742564?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">an instrument to detect organic compounds</a>. It saw trace amounts of chlorinated organics, which were interpreted at the time to be the result of contamination from Earth. This led Viking project scientist Gerald Soffen to utter his famous words, “No bodies, no life.” In other words, there couldn’t be Martian life without organic compounds. So Soffen concluded, as did most other scientists at the time, that the Viking project was negative as to the presence of life, or at best inconclusive.</p>
<p>In the half century since, the picture has changed a lot. Eight more landers and rovers have explored the Martian surface in greater detail. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/27859448?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">Thanks to the 2008 <em>Phoenix</em> lander</a>, and to later confirmation by the <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/the-meaning-of-methane-on-mars/"><em>Curiosity</em></a> and <em>Perseverance</em> rovers, we know that <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aas9185">indigenous organic compounds do, in fact, exist on Mars</a>. They’re in a chlorinated form, however—not what the Viking-era scientists expected—and we don’t know whether they derive from biological processes or from some <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2019.2139">abiotic chemical reactions</a> that have nothing to do with life. Still, one might wonder how Soffen would react today: Would he still say categorically that the Viking results were negative?</p>
<h2>Death by Water</h2>
<p>At the time of those landings, scientists had very little understanding of the Martian environment. Since Earth is a water planet, it seemed reasonable that adding water might coax life to show itself in the extremely dry Martian environment. In hindsight, it is possible that approach was too much of a good thing. What I and other researchers have learned in extremely dry places on Earth, such as Chile’s Atacama Desert, is that there is a gradual progression of life forms as the habitat gets more arid.</p>
<p>At the very end of that progression, you find <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/ast.2015.1380">microbes that live entirely within salt rocks</a>. These hardy organisms take advantage of a process we call hygroscopicity, by which certain salts attract water directly from the relative humidity of the air. (This is the same process that makes table salt clumpy when you leave it exposed to air.) For that reason, the microbes living inside salt rocks in the Atacama do not need any rain at all—just a certain amount of moisture in the atmosphere.</p>
		
		
<p>Now let’s ask what would happen if you poured water over these dry-adapted microbes. Might that overwhelm them? In technical terms, we would say that we were hyperhydrating them, but in simple terms, it would be more like drowning them. It would be as if an alien spaceship were to find you wandering half-dead in the desert, and your would-be saviors decide, “Humans need water. Let’s put the human in the middle of the ocean to save it!” That wouldn’t work either.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1742572?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">Many of the Viking experiments</a> involved applying water to the soil samples, which may explain the puzzling results. Perhaps the putative Martian microbes collected for the labelled release experiments couldn’t deal with that amount of water and died off after a while. Most of the runs for the pyrolytic release experiment were conducted under dry conditions, contrary to the other experiments. The first run was positive for life when compared to a control run conducted later, which was designed so that no biology could have been involved. Interestingly, the only run conducted under wet conditions had less of a signal than the control.</p>
<p>Following this line of thought, we should ask whether the Martian soil tested by Viking did in fact contain hygroscopic salts, and whether the relative humidity at those sites is high enough. The Vikings touched down in the equatorial region of Mars where the salt content of the soil is rather low. But there are a lot of hydrogen peroxide and perchlorates in the soil, and both of those compounds are very hygroscopic. Also, Viking did observe fog on Mars—which means 100 percent humidity. In principle, relative humidities would have been high enough in the morning and evening hours for microbes to suck up the moisture.</p>
<h2>Hope from Hydrogen Peroxide</h2>
<p>More than 15 years ago, my colleague Joop Houtkooper and I <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-astrobiology/article/possible-biogenic-origin-for-hydrogen-peroxide-on-mars-the-viking-results-reinterpreted/CFC8FE788E40D8A57388D2B35E224742">upped the level of scientific speculation on this topic</a> by taking a different perspective on the puzzling Viking results. We suggested that microbial life on Mars might have hydrogen peroxide in their cells—an evolutionary adaptation that would allow them to draw water directly from the atmosphere. The mixture would have other advantages, too, such as keeping water liquid at freezing Martian temperatures, preventing the formation of ice crystals that would rupture the cells.</p>
<p>While at a high enough concentration hydrogen peroxide is used for cleaning and sterilization, <em>many</em> microbes in your mouth, like <em>Streptococcus</em> and <em>Lactobacillus,</em> produce hydrogen peroxide naturally, alongside others, like <em>Neisseria sicca and Haemophilus segnis</em>, that use it. The bombardier beetle sprays a 25 percent hydrogen peroxide solution at anything that bothers it. My point is that hydrogen peroxide is not incompatible with life.</p>
<p>If we assume that indigenous Martian life might have adapted to its environment by incorporating hydrogen peroxide into its cells, this could explain the Viking results. The instrument used for detecting organic compounds (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25435929?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">called a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer</a>) heated up soil samples prior to analysis. If the Martian cells contained hydrogen peroxide, that would have killed them. Moreover, it would have caused the hydrogen peroxide to react with any organic molecules in the vicinity to form large amounts of carbon dioxide—which is exactly what the instrument detected.</p>
<h2>A New Mission to Mars</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/26017975?mag=we-might-have-accidentally-killed-the-only-life-we-ever-found-on-mars">As I have argued before</a>, we need a new mission to Mars <em>dedicated primarily to life detection</em> to test this hypothesis and others. It should explore potential habitats on Mars like the Southern Highlands, where life could persist in salt rocks close to the surface. We might even be able to access these rocks without drilling—a huge advantage in terms of engineering complication and cost. I cannot wait for such a mission to get under way.</p>

If you are not tech-savvy you are toast. It is so exclusionary.”</p><p>The real cause of Vickery’s ire, however, was a breast cancer clinic she attended that, in her words, turned away “some old ladies … because they did not have an SMS message from an app. They didn’t even have a phone!

Natasha Bright-Wray, the foundation’s associate director of communications, says that “digitally excluded people are largely forgotten” by a government that boasts of making the UK a digital superpower but is apathetic about those left behind and lacks any meaningful digital inclusion strategy.</p><p>The effects are conspicuous in the NHS, where improved digitalisation can bring greater efficiencies but often leaves those, like the women Vickery witnessed, failing to benefit from the services.</p><p>After all, as Bright-Wray says, one in 20 UK households have no home internet access. And in the case of the elderly, even if they do have access, they frequently have limited ability to use it. In much the same way, the notion that everyone has a bank account and a card or phone with money on it does not withstand a visit to your local supermarket, where it’s noticeable how many people avoid the checkouts that are “card only”.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><figure id="bfe6da6f-5cbf-4210-bfc2-f535423fa019" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:14,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/18/the-big-idea-should-we-embrace-a-cashless-society&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;The big idea: should we embrace a cashless society? &quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;bfe6da6f-5cbf-4210-bfc2-f535423fa019&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:10}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The cashless society is effectively already a reality for most of us, but there remains a minority for whom it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/14/fears-uks-cashless-society-will-leave-more-than-just-the-vulnerable-behind" data-link-name="in body link">represents a continuing headache</a>. The government last week told high street banks that they must offer access to cash machines <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2023/aug/17/uk-banks-will-have-to-ensure-access-to-cash-within-three-miles-ministers-say" data-link-name="in body link">within three miles of customers</a> after the closure of thousands of branches had reduced the number of ATMs.</p><p>There are also an estimated to be 1.3 million adults in this country who are “unbanked” – ie do not have a bank account. For them, something as mundane as parking a car is increasingly fraught – a quarter of London councils have removed pay and display parking machines in favour of smartphone-centred apps.</p><p>This silent trend towards the removal of cash has provided another front for conspiratorial thinking. Go to a demonstration by the sort of people who believe that 5G mobile towers and Covid are linked and the chances are you’ll see placards warning of the evils of electronic money.</p><p>It’s easy to mock such thinking, but it feeds on a sense of disempowerment. Recently in Nottinghamshire I spoke to a woman called Audrey who told me she had worked in the caring profession for 50 years. She and her husband were full of melodramatic warnings about China and “shadowy” powers who controlled politics, but she also said that when it came to removing cash transactions “it’s the poor and marginalised who are forgotten”. She had a point.</p><p>The shiny, bright future of full computerisation looks very much like a dystopia to someone who either doesn’t understand it or have the means to access it. And almost by definition, the people who can’t access the digitalised world are seldom visible, because absence is not easy to see.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>On 23rd of August 2023 Airlock Digital received reports from customers seeing a sudden increase in file executions that had ‘Invalid Certificate Chains’.</p>
<p>Airlock Digital investigated these reports and found that all occurrences of this certificate status chained trust up to the Verisign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority – G5 Root Certificate (serial: 18dad19e267de8bb4a2158cdcc6b3b4a). Over the coming hours, it was identified that many internet connected Windows 10 &amp; 11 computers within the Airlock Digital environment also began reporting files chained to this root as having ‘Invalid Certificate Chains’.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>This particular root certificate is responsible for chained trust in a significant number of issued digital certificates globally between 2006 – 2018. As PCWorld reports “According to a Netcraft survey from 2015, Symantec is responsible for about one in every three SSL certificates used on the web, making it the largest commercial certificate issuer in the world.” Source: https://www.pcworld.com/article/406198/to-punish-symantec-google-may-distrust-a-third-of-the-webs-ssl-certificates.html</p>
<p>Its downfall however came when browser vendors revoked trust in Verisign’s root certificates in 2018, due to repeated occurrences where Symantec (who owned Verisign at the time) improperly issued SSL certificates from this and other roots to customers and its re-sellers.</p>
<p>As a result of this browser revocation, it effectively pulled the pin on Symantec’s certificate business. Around this time, the business was acquired by DigiCert.</p>
<p><strong>Revocation Event<br>
</strong></p>
<p>Airlock Digital worked throughout the 23rd of August to determine why this revocation was occurring on Microsoft Windows systems. There was little information publicly and no word from Microsoft or DigiCert. The only other information that could be found online, was a discussion by the great folks over at /r/sysadmin stating they were having trouble loading Quickbooks due to an invalid certificate. Analysis of the QuickBooks binary in question showed that it chained to the same Verisign root. Kudos to Intuit (vendor of Quickbooks) for having an application which validates Digital Certificates of its libraries before launching them.</p>
<blockquote><p> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/15ym2jr/quickbooks_application_with_revoked_certificate/">QuickBooks – Application with Revoked Certificate</a><br> by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WhyPartyPizza">u/WhyPartyPizza</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/">sysadmin</a> </p></blockquote>

<p>This revocation can be easily recreated on any Windows 10 or 11 machine by downloading the PEM certificate from the following site https://crt.sh/?id=93&amp;opt=ocsp and viewing the Certificate in Windows Explorer. In Airlock Digital’s testing, unsupported versions of Windows such as Windows 8 and below are unaffected.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-300x300.png 300w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-150x150.png 150w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://airlockdigital.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image-1-2048x2048.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></p>
<p>At this point, the question we were unable to answer was how did this certificate become revoked? Its serial was not listed on any online Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL’s) and the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OSCP) still lists the certificate as valid. So where is this coming from?</p>
<p>The only possibility left was Microsoft, as Windows was indicating that the certificate had a ‘disable’ flag applied as per Microsoft’s ‘Deprecation Definitions’ https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/deprecation this explains why this did not show on any publicly available lists.</p>
<p>At the time of writing there is no notice from Microsoft on their trusted root certificate program of this change: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/trusted-root/release-notes</p>
<p><strong>Confirmation</strong></p>
<p>On the 24th of August, DigiCert responded to an Airlock Digital support request confirming the revocation by Microsoft:</p>
<p>“Yes, we have received a few reports in regard to the same issue.</p>
<p>After escalating it to our engineering team and they have confirmed with Microsoft that these legacy root certificates were supposed to be distrusted back to 2019 – 2021.</p>
<p>And for VeriSign Class 3 Public Primary Certification Authority – G5 was supposed to be distrusted by Microsoft on May 21st 2019.</p>
<p>Here is the DigiCert link for your reference: https://knowledge.digicert.com/alerts/symantec_root_distrust.html</p>
<p>However, Microsoft remains trusting this Root certificate until Aug 23rd 2023. And distrusted this root certificate yesterday.</p>
<p>So that our customers who are currently using this root certificate and others listed on that page have experienced the same situation.”</p>
<p>Airlock Digital has reached out to Microsoft Security for confirmation of this change and will update this blog post with more information if it becomes available.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>There are many lenses through which this change can be viewed. When it comes to SSL certificates this change entirely makes sense, however for file trust this is problematic, as previously signed files can’t simply have the certificate updated on them in the same way websites can. This is likely why Microsoft trusted this root certificate for much longer in Microsoft Windows than browser vendors did.</p>
<p>I’m also surprised at how little noise this change made even within the information security community. It speaks volumes at how little digital signatures are used to proactively enforce the integrity of software at load time within the majority of the ecosystem (again kudos to Intuit).</p>
<p>Microsoft moved quickly on this one without public notification, was there current threat activity associated with this certificate requiring a whole of ecosystem response? or was this just something Microsoft considered to be a non-event? we can only speculate.</p>
<p><strong>Airlock Digital Customer Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>Over the coming months Airlock Digital customers may notice an elevated occurrence of files reporting ‘(invalid certificate chains)’ over the coming months, for software that was signed between 2006 – 2017 with revoked certificate chain.</p>
<p>It is recommended that if customers have a need to continue running these files, that in the short term that affected ‘(invalid certificate chain)’ publishers are be trusted within policy to minimise business impact and then convert the trust for affected applications to hash based trust using Airlock Digital’s ‘trusted logging’ feature. The good news here is that modern version of applications will be signed with newer certificates and this will minimise these occurrences long term.</p>
<p>Additionally, many Airlock Digital customers with existing agents may not immediately notice impact from this issue, due to the certificate caching behavior of the Airlock Digital client to improve runtime performance.</p>

It’s the most important paradigm shift of the decade and, compared to the software shift, it’s going to be bigger because of new capabilities and faster because software paved the way,” co-founder and CEO Clément Delangue told TechCrunch via email. “<span>Hugging Face intends to be the open platform that empowers this paradigm shift.”</span></p>
<p>Delangue, a French entrepreneur, launched Brooklyn-based Hugging Face in 2016 alongside Julien Chaumond and Thomas Wolf. The trio originally built a chatbot app targeted at teenagers. But after open sourcing the algorithm behind the app, Hugging Face pivoted to focus on creating a platform for creating, testing and deploying machine learning.</p>
<p>Today, Hugging Face offers a number of data science hosting and development tools, including a GitHub-like hub for AI code repositories, models and data sets as well as web apps to demo AI-powered applications. Hugging Face also provides libraries for tasks like data set processing and evaluating models in addition to an enterprise version of the hub that supports software-as-a-service and on-premises deployments.</p>
<p>Hugging Face’s paid functionality includes AutoTrain, which helps to automate the task of training AI models; Inference API, which allows developers to host models without managing the underlying infrastructure; and Infinity, which is designed to increase the speed with which an in-production model processes data.</p>
<p>Hugging Face has 10,000 customers today, it claims, and more than 50,000 organizations on the platform. And its model hub hosts over 1 million repositories.</p>
<p>Contributing to the growth is the strong, sustained interest in AI from the enterprise. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/the-hustle/how-ai-will-impact-businesses-in-2023">According</a> to a HubSpot poll, 43% of business leaders say that they plan to increase their investment in AI and automation tools over the course of 2023, while 31% say AI and automation tools are very important to their overall business strategy.</p>
<p>Much of what Hugging Face delivers falls into MLOps, a category of tools for streamlining the process of taking AI models to production and then maintaining and monitoring them. The MLOps market is substantial in its own right, with one <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-mlops-market">report</a> estimating that it’ll reach $16.61 billion by 2030.</p>
<p>But Hugging Face dabbles in other areas, too.</p>
<p>In 2021, Hugging Face launched BigScience, a volunteer-led project to produce an open source language model as powerful as OpenAI’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/22/openai-brings-fine-tuning-to-gpt-3-5-turbo/">GPT-3</a>, but free and open for anyone to use. It culminated in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/12/a-year-in-the-making-bigsciences-ai-language-model-is-finally-available/">Bloom</a>, a multilingual model that for more than a year has been available to tinker with on Hugging Face’s model hub.</p>
<p>Bloom is but one of several open source models to which Hugging Face has contributed development resources.</p>
<p>Hugging Face <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/hugging-face-and-servicenow-release-a-free-code-generating-model/">collaborated</a> with ServiceNow, the enterprise software company, to release a free code-generating AI model called StarCoder (a follow-up model, <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/safecoder">SafeCoder</a>, debuted this week). And the startup <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/hugging-face-releases-its-own-version-of-chatgpt/">made available</a>&nbsp;its own free version of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a>, OpenAI’s viral AI-powered chatbot, in partnership with the German nonprofit LAION.</p>
<p>Hugging Face’s team-ups extend to major cloud providers, some of which are strategic investors.</p>
<p>Hugging Face recently worked with <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/08/nvidia-teams-up-with-hugging-face-to-offer-cloud-based-ai-training/">Nvidia</a> to expand access to cloud compute via Nvidia’s DGX computing platform. It has a partnership with Amazon to extend its products to AWS customers and everage Amazon’s custom Trainium chips to train the next generation of Bloom. And Hugging Face collaborated with Microsoft on <a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/huggingfaceinc1651727610968.huggingface?tab=Overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugging Face Endpoints</a> on Azure, a way to turn Hugging Face-developed AI models into scalable production solutions hosted through Azure.</p>
<p>With this latest investment, Delangue says that Hugging Face plans to “<span>double down” on its supportive efforts in many domains, including research, enterprise and startups. It has 170 employees, but plans on recruiting new talent over the coming months.</span></p>

It's early afternoon on a blazing July day, and the sky is a perfect canvas of cobalt blue. Though the river is sheltered on either side by towering cliffs and limestone escarpments up to 300m (980ft) high, the sheer irradiating power of the sun has never been more visible to me. Its rays have turned the surface of the water into a winding path of scintillating light, so bright it blinds you to look at it. And I am taking no chances; I have chosen my outfit with the seriousness of an explorer trekking off into the Sahara.</p>
<p>The ensemble, my boyfriend remarks, is "extraordinary" – and he doesn't mean it as a compliment. My arms, hands and torso are completely covered with a long-sleeved top with built-in SPF protection – ordered over the internet from <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220321-what-happened-to-the-worlds-ozone-hole">ozone-depleted-Australia</a>, no less – while my head is shaded beneath a floppy fishing hat complete with its own fabric face shield. The final touches are several coatings of high-factor suncream, so my exposed skin has the pallid, sickly glow of titanium-white, and a pair of sunglasses. As my companion delights in telling me at 10-minute intervals, I am dressed like a large baby.</p>
<p>However, my vanity knows no bounds, and I am determined to avoid further sun-related ageing. But could there be other, hidden benefits to these extreme measures? In fact, is it possible that my obsession with maintaining healthy skin is a stroke of accidental genius? The answer to both these questions, it turns out, is yes.</p>
<p>The latest research suggests that our skin is not just a mirror for our lifestyles – reflecting the effects of years of smoking, drinking, sun and stress – and hinting at our inner health. No, in this new upside-down-world, the body's largest organ is an active participant in our physical wellbeing. This is a strange new reality where wrinkles, dry skin and sunspots cause ageing, instead of the other way around.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A strange revelation</strong></p>
<p>In 1958, the same year the US <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/spaceact.html">passed the law</a> that led to the moon landings and the creation of Nasa, another major project was <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/63/12/1416/620761">quietly conceived</a>. The Baltimore Longitudinal Study was to be a scientific investigation of ageing with a <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/labs/blsa/history">daring and rather unorthodox premise</a>.</p>
<p>Before then, it had been standard scientific practice to attempt to glean insights into the physiology of living people from donated cadavers – a practise with roots in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/body-snatching">19th Century tradition of graverobbing</a>. But this time, subjects would be scrutinised somewhat earlier, while their hearts were still beating and their bodies were very much alive. The research followed thousands of adult men (and later, women) for decades, to see how their health developed – and how this was affected by their genes and the environment.</p>
<p>Just two decades in, scientists had already made some intriguing breakthroughs, from the discovery that less emotionally stable men were more likely to be <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610738208258393">diagnosed with heart disease</a> to the revelation that our problem-solving abilities <a href="https://academic.oup.com/geronj/article-abstract/29/6/650/561698">decline only slightly with age</a>.</p>
<p>But one of the most striking findings confirmed what people had long suspected: how youthful you look is an impressively accurate expression <a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0277953682900235">of your inner health</a>. By 1982, those men who had been assessed as looking particularly old for their age at the beginning of the study, 20 years earlier, were more likely to be dead.&nbsp; This is backed up by more recent research, which found that, of patients who were judged to look at least 10 years older than they should, 99% had <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-010-1537-0">health problems</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out skin health can be used to predict a number of seemingly unconnected factors, from your <a href="https://eor.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/eor/3/8/2058-5241.3.160088.xml">bone density</a> to your risk of developing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31585299">neurodegenerative diseases</a> or dying from <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/39/suppl_1/ehy565.P1548/5080322">cardiovascular disease</a>. However, as the evidence has begun to add up, the story has taken a surprise twist. Is the skin simply a living tally of the damage we have accumulated, or is it more complicated? Could it, in fact, be keeping healthy people healthy – and dragging unhealthy ones down further?</p></div></div><div id="future/article/20230823-the-curious-ways-your-skin-shapes-your-health-p0g8cjlw"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjlw.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjlw.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="While UVB rays tend to damage the skin's surface, UVA goes much deeper – and both can lead to systemic inflammation (Credit: Alamy)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjlw.jpg" alt="While UVB rays tend to damage the skin's surface, UVA goes much deeper – and both can lead to systemic inflammation (Credit: Alamy)" id=""></picture><div><p>While UVB rays tend to damage the skin's surface, UVA goes much deeper – and both can lead to systemic inflammation (Credit: Alamy)</p></div></div><div><p><strong>Another kind of birthday </strong></p>
<p>There are two main ways to measure a person's age. The first is the standard method, known as chronological age – the kind tracked by revolutions of the sun. But there is also your biological age, which indicates the rate at which you are ageing physically – the maturity of your organs and cells. It can vary wildly between different people and even within the same body.</p>
<p>As we rack up the years, it's common wisdom that our chronological age will eventually catch up with our looks: skin becomes thinner and less even-toned, with lower elasticity, as the cells responsible for producing pigment and collagen die off or become "senescent" – meaning they stop renewing themselves and continue to exist in a kind of dormant state.</p>
<p>But it is the environment that tends to do the real damage. Though ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation can damage our DNA – leading to sunburn, mutations and skin cancer – 95% of the total UV radiation that makes it to the Earth's surface is ultraviolet A (UVA). This portion of the sun's rays has a longer wavelength, which allows it to <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01138.x">penetrate deep into the dermis</a> – where it breaks down collagen and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-1097.2012.01138.x">stimulates cells to produce melanin</a>.</p>
<p>At the microscopic level, photoaged skin – skin that has been aged by the sun – is thicker, with tangles of misshapen elastin and collagen fibres. At the visible level, it is often irregularly pigmented and significantly more wrinkled. This is true whether you have very light skin which is incapable of tanning, known as type one on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK481857/table/chapter6.t1/" target="_blank">Fitzpatrick scale</a>, or very <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-66072249">dark skin</a>, type six, which the scale <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9060139/" target="_blank">inaccurately describes as never burning</a>. Even deeply pigmented skin can burn and is susceptible to photoaging, though it will <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpp.12688" target="_blank">take longer for wrinkles to kick in</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, it's thought that intrinsic factors are responsible for the tiniest fraction of the classic "aged" look, while UV light is responsible for over <a href="https://www.dovepress.com/effect-of-the-sun-on-visible-clinical-signs-of-aging-in-caucasian-skin-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-CCID">80% of visible skin changes</a>. If you spent your whole life indoors with the curtains drawn, it's possible that you might not see significant alterations to this organ <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09m2l58">until you reach your 80s</a>.</p>
<p>Crucially though, along with these effects the skin also undergoes a chemical transformation. And it is this that might be having a profound impact on our overall health.</p>
<p><strong>A chemical cocktail</strong></p>
<p>In 2000, at the birth of a new century, a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12016-021-08899-6">radical new concept</a> emerged. By observing the way most organisms respond to stress, a group of scientists at the University of&nbsp;Bologna, Italy suggested a new way to think about ageing.</p>
<p>In a young, healthy person, the immune system is routinely deployed to maintain order – patching up damage and shooing off infections. But as we get older, or when we are in poor health, these inflammatory responses can pass a certain critical threshold – a point beyond which they go into overdrive, releasing a cascade of potent chemicals that rampage around the body, destroying healthy cells and mutilating our DNA. Enter "inflammaging" – the simmering backdrop of inflammation that accompanies the ageing process.</p>
<p>This is where the skin comes in. The latest research suggests that wrinkly, diseased, or damaged skin becomes part of this system of inflammation, releasing a chemical cocktail that leads to yet further damage and inflammation. "Chronologically aged skin exhibits higher expression levels of a whole panel of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines," says Mao-Qiang Man, a research scientist at University of California&nbsp;San Francisco, who says that the same is also true for photoaged skin.</p>
<p>Locally, these chemicals degrade collagen and elastin, causing further skin thinning, wrinkles, and reduced elasticity, explains Tuba Musarrat Ansary, a postdoctoral researcher at Jichi Medical University, Japan. "They [also] disrupt the skin's barrier, increasing water loss and susceptibility to stressors," she says. The feedback loop is further compounded by senescent cells in the skin – either created by natural ageing or UV damage – which also release their own inflammatory chemicals.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning. As the largest organ in the body, the skin can have a profound impact. The chemicals released by diseased and dysfunctional skin soon enter the bloodstream, where they wash around, damaging other tissues. Amid the ensuing systemic inflammation, chemicals from the skin can reach and harm organs that seem entirely unrelated, including your <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211340/#:~:text=CONCLUSION%3A%20Our%20study%20suggests%20that,should%20undergo%20periodic%20follow%2Dup.">heart</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18360#:~:text=Both%20epidermal%20dysfunction%20and%20inflammatory,the%20development%20of%20cognitive%20dysfunction.">brain</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><div id="future/article/20230823-the-curious-ways-your-skin-shapes-your-health-p0g8cjsk"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjsk.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjsk.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="People have been marketing dubious skin ointments for centuries, but even the most basic moisturisers can help to prevent inflammaging (Credit: Getty Images" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjsk.jpg" alt="People have been marketing dubious skin ointments for centuries, but even the most basic moisturisers can help to prevent inflammaging (Credit: Getty Images" id=""></picture><div><p>People have been marketing dubious skin ointments for centuries, but even the most basic moisturisers can help to prevent inflammaging (Credit: Getty Images</p></div></div><div><p>The result is accelerated ageing, and a higher risk of developing the majority of – <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/pdfExtended/S2211-1247(22)00806-3">or possibly even all</a> – related disorders. So far, aged or diseased skin has been linked to the onset of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8211340/#:~:text=CONCLUSION%3A%20Our%20study%20suggests%20that,should%20undergo%20periodic%20follow%2Dup.">cardiovascular disease</a>, <a href="https://bmcendocrdisord.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12902-022-00997-6">type 2 diabetes</a> and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jdv.18360#:~:text=Both%20epidermal%20dysfunction%20and%20inflammatory,the%20development%20of%20cognitive%20dysfunction.">cognitive impairment</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8554316/">Alzheimer's</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5352163/">Parkinson's</a> disease.</p>
<p>Though we're all familiar with the risks of smoking, drinking, overeating and a lack of exercise, you might argue that poor skin health is the elephant in the room – the one factor that we all routinely overlook. The good news is that there is a lot you can do to improve it.</p>
<p><strong>A matter of moisture</strong></p>
<p>The first step to protecting skin – and therefore, this new theory suggests, overall health – is to stay out of the sun. The most famous method is the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20220321-what-happened-to-the-worlds-ozone-hole">"Slip, Slop, Slap," protocol, first launched in Australia in 1981.</a> Today it has been expanded to include five central tenets: slip on a t-shirt [and ideally, other protective clothing], slop on high-factor suncream, slap on a wide-brimmed hat, slide on some sunglasses, and seek shade from the sun.</p>
<p>Plus, if the relationship between skin damage and age-related diseases isn't compelling enough to convince people to whip out their fishing hats and suncream, there are two very good reasons to try it. The first is that protecting your skin from the sun is extremely effective at preventing the visible signs of ageing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one early study, those who wore a broad-spectrum SPF15 suncream every day for four and a half years did not show any signs of further skin <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732711/">ageing during this period</a>. That's despite the fact that this low factor typically protects you from sunburn for just <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32749634">15 times longer than it would take to happen without it</a> –&nbsp; so if your skin would usually start to redden in 10 minutes, you should be able to stay in the sun <a href="https://www.americanskin.org/resource/safety.php">for just 150 minutes</a> (two and a half hours).</p>
<p>Moreover, the suncream in the experiment did not specify the level of protection against UVA radiation, the kind that leads to skin ageing. In most parts of the world, to be classified as broad-spectrum, products must demonstrate that they not only absorb or reflect UVB radiation (indicated by the SPF rating), but also UVA. However, the degree to which they achieve this varies substantially. Dermatologists recommend that you always check the label for the UVA rating too, which is usually indicated by <a href="https://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(17)30812-5/fulltext">UV-PF or PPD</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The second reason is that there is strong evidence suncream can prevent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6852040/">most of the inflammation</a> that occurs when the skin is exposed to the sun – the first step towards developing age-related diseases.</p>
<p>But this is not the only way to keep your skin in good condition. In fact, by far the easiest way to improve the health of this organ is to moisturise. And there is direct evidence that this does <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.15540">reduce inflammation</a> – and that it <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.15540">may help to prevent dementia</a>.</p>
<p>Along with an uneven skin tone and wrinkles, both chronologically and photoaged skin is significantly drier. The humidity levels of human skin peak in the <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/102946/text">40th year of life</a>, after which they plummet, producing lower and lower quantities of its natural moisturisers – lipids, filaggrin, sebum and glycerol. This is a problem, because dehydrated skin is less effective as a barrier between the insides of our bodies and the outside world. When our skin is desiccated and flaky, its usual tasks – of keeping out infectious agents, environmental toxins, and allergens, while keeping in moisture – become significantly more challenging.</p></div><div id="future/article/20230823-the-curious-ways-your-skin-shapes-your-health-p0g8cjgr"><picture><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:1200px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1600x900/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:880px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/1280x720/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:576px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjgr.webp" type="image/webp"><source media="(min-width:224px)" srcset="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/624x351/p0g8cjgr.jpg" type="image/jpeg"><img loading="lazy" draggable="false" title="Sun-damaged skin releases chemicals that contribute to systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of almost every age-related disease (Credit: Getty Images)" src="https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p0g8cjgr.jpg" alt="Sun-damaged skin releases chemicals that contribute to systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of almost every age-related disease (Credit: Getty Images)" id=""></picture><div><p>Sun-damaged skin releases chemicals that contribute to systemic inflammation, increasing the risk of almost every age-related disease (Credit: Getty Images)</p></div></div><div><p>However, adding moisture back is not particularly complicated, whatever <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/moisturizers-do-they-work">cosmetics adverts seem to suggest</a>. And in the field of ageing, this simple intervention is showing remarkable results.</p>
<p>In one study, an international team of researchers – including Man – asked older volunteers to apply a topical moisturiser twice a day for one month. Compared to older participants who had not received any treatment, the subjects' skin was significantly restored, with <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jdv.15540">lower levels of three different classes of inflammatory chemicals</a>.</p>
<p>These promising results were quickly followed up with another study by the same team, which involved treating adults over 65 years old with a moisturising cream twice a day for three years. The participants' cognitive functioning was measured at the beginning and end of the study – and after three years, though the control group had declined significantly, those who had been hydrating their skin <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35442543/">had not deteriorated</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Decreased stratum corneum hydration levels [those in the outer layer of the epidermis] are likely the major contributor to inflammaging," says Man, who explains that because dry skin tends to have higher levels of inflammation, it can feel itchy. And if you yield to the scratching impulse – you guessed it – the inflammation gets worse.</p>
<p>But, Man says, many natural ingredients can help. These include glycerol, petrolatum, hyaluronic acid and lipids that would usually be found in this layer of the skin – normal constituents of even the most basic moisturisers.</p>
<p>It's possible that simply drinking more water might also help to hydrate the skin, though the evidence is murky – some studies suggest there is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20620753/">not yet any support for this</a>, while others <a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA445751725&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=11787015&amp;p=HRCA&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E79b13aff&amp;aty=open-web-entry">claim it can help</a>. It also hasn't been directly studied as a way to prevent inflammation or related diseases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To visualise the extent to which the skin is able to affect the rest of your body, it helps to think about just how much of it you have – then remember that, as you would expect, all the skin you can see on the outside of your body is matched by the exact same <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9655929/">surface area on the inside</a>. And when your skin is damaged, every inch is capable of releasing toxic chemicals.</p>
<p>So, protecting your skin from the sun really does pay off – but don't forget the moisturiser either. Please excuse me while I fetch my SPF50+, sunglasses, sun umbrella and most outrageously silly fishing hat… I have some gardening to do.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
								
<article id="post-39152">
	<div>
		<p>Today, we’re releasing Code Llama, a large language model (LLM) that can use text prompts to generate and discuss code. Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on coding tasks. It has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.</p>
<p>We believe an open approach to AI is best for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe and responsible, so we’re releasing Code Llama for both research and commercial use under the same <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE">community license as Llama 2</a>.</p>
<p>Code Llama is a code-specialized version of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">Llama 2</a> that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities. It can generate code and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence”). It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular programming languages used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, Bash and more.</p>
<p>We are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.</p>
<p>The three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.</p>
<p>We also further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama – Python and Code Llama – Instruct.</p>
<p>Code Llama – Python is a language specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation, and because Python and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/">PyTorch</a> play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.</p>
<p>Code Llama – Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a natural language instruction input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what people expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama – Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama – Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.</p>
<p>Programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient so that they can focus on the most human-centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks. We believe that AI models, and LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples’ lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues and fix vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Code Llama is designed to support software engineers in all sectors — including research, industry, open source projects, NGOs and businesses. But there are still many more use cases to support. We hope Code Llama will inspire others to leverage Llama 2 to create new innovative tools for research and commercial products.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html">https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/08/24/Rust-1.72.0.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37248781">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>The Rust team is happy to announce a new version of Rust, 1.72.0. Rust is a programming language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software.</p>
<p>If you have a previous version of Rust installed via rustup, you can get 1.72.0 with:</p>
<pre><code>rustup update stable
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't have it already, you can <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html">get <code>rustup</code></a> from the appropriate page on our website, and check out the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.72.0">detailed release notes for 1.72.0</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you'd like to help us out by testing future releases, you might consider updating locally to use the beta channel (<code>rustup default beta</code>) or the nightly channel (<code>rustup default nightly</code>). Please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose">report</a> any bugs you might come across!</p>
<h2>What's in 1.72.0 stable</h2>
<h3>Rust reports potentially useful <code>cfg</code>-disabled items in errors</h3>
<p>You can conditionally enable Rust code using <code>cfg</code>, such as to provide certain
functions only with certain crate features, or only on particular platforms.
Previously, items disabled in this way would be effectively invisible to the
compiler. Now, though, the compiler will remember the name and <code>cfg</code> conditions
of those items, so it can report (for example) if a function you tried to call
is unavailable because you need to enable a crate feature.</p>
<pre><code>   Compiling my-project v0.1.0 (/tmp/my-project)
error[E0432]: unresolved import `rustix::io_uring`
   --&gt; src/main.rs:1:5
    |
1   | use rustix::io_uring;
    |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no `io_uring` in the root
    |
note: found an item that was configured out
   --&gt; /home/username/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-6f17d22bba15001f/rustix-0.38.8/src/lib.rs:213:9
    |
213 | pub mod io_uring;
    |         ^^^^^^^^
    = note: the item is gated behind the `io_uring` feature

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0432`.
error: could not compile `my-project` (bin "my-project") due to previous error
</code></pre>
<h3>Const evaluation time is now unlimited</h3>
<p>To prevent user-provided const evaluation from getting into a compile-time
infinite loop or otherwise taking unbounded time at compile time, Rust
previously limited the maximum number of <em>statements</em> run as part of any given
constant evaluation. However, especially creative Rust code could hit these
limits and produce a compiler error. Worse, whether code hit the limit could
vary wildly based on libraries invoked by the user; if a library you invoked
split a statement into two within one of its functions, your code could then
fail to compile.</p>
<p>Now, you can do an unlimited amount of const evaluation at compile time. To
avoid having long compilations without feedback, the compiler will always emit
a message after your compile-time code has been running for a while, and repeat
that message after a period that doubles each time. By default, the compiler
will also emit a deny-by-default lint (<code>const_eval_long_running</code>) after a large
number of steps to catch infinite loops, but you can
<code>allow(const_eval_long_running)</code> to permit especially long const evaluation.</p>
<h3>Uplifted lints from Clippy</h3>
<p>Several lints from Clippy have been pulled into <code>rustc</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#undropped_manually_drops"><code>clippy::undropped_manually_drops</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#undropped-manually-drops"><code>undropped_manually_drops</code></a> (deny)</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ManuallyDrop</code> does not drop its inner value, so calling <code>std::mem::drop</code> on it does nothing. Instead, the lint will suggest <code>ManuallyDrop::into_inner</code> first, or you may use the unsafe <code>ManuallyDrop::drop</code> to run the destructor in-place. This lint is denied by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#invalid_utf8_in_unchecked"><code>clippy::invalid_utf8_in_unchecked</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/deny-by-default.html#invalid-from-utf8-unchecked"><code>invalid_from_utf8_unchecked</code></a> (deny) and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#invalid-from-utf8"><code>invalid_from_utf8</code></a> (warn)</p>
<ul>
<li>The first checks for calls to <code>std::str::from_utf8_unchecked</code> and <code>std::str::from_utf8_unchecked_mut</code> with an invalid UTF-8 literal, which violates their safety pre-conditions, resulting in undefined behavior. This lint is denied by default.</li>
<li>The second checks for calls to <code>std::str::from_utf8</code> and <code>std::str::from_utf8_mut</code> with an invalid UTF-8 literal, which will always return an error. This lint is a warning by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#cmp_nan"><code>clippy::cmp_nan</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#invalid-nan-comparisons"><code>invalid_nan_comparisons</code></a> (warn)</p>
<ul>
<li>This checks for comparisons with <code>f32::NAN</code> or <code>f64::NAN</code> as one of the operands. NaN does not compare meaningfully to anything – not even itself – so those comparisons are always false. This lint is a warning by default, and will suggest calling the <code>is_nan()</code> method instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/rust-1.71.0/index.html#cast_ref_to_mut"><code>clippy::cast_ref_to_mut</code></a> to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.72.0/rustc/lints/listing/allowed-by-default.html#invalid-reference-casting"><code>invalid_reference_casting</code></a> (allow)</p>
<ul>
<li>This checks for casts of <code>&amp;T</code> to <code>&amp;mut T</code> without using interior mutability, which is immediate undefined behavior, even if the reference is unused. This lint is currently allowed by default due to potential false positives, but it is planned to be denied by default in 1.73 after implementation improvements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stabilized APIs</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/mpsc/struct.Sender.html#impl-Sync-for-Sender%3CT%3E"><code>impl&lt;T: Send&gt; Sync for mpsc::Sender&lt;T&gt;</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.str.html#impl-TryFrom%3C%26'a+OsStr%3E-for-%26'a+str"><code>impl TryFrom&lt;&amp;OsStr&gt; for &amp;str</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/alloc/string/struct.String.html#method.leak"><code>String::leak</code></a></li>
</ul>
<p>These APIs are now stable in const contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.from_bytes_with_nul"><code>CStr::from_bytes_with_nul</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_bytes"><code>CStr::to_bytes</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_bytes_with_nul"><code>CStr::to_bytes_with_nul</code></a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/ffi/struct.CStr.html#method.to_str"><code>CStr::to_str</code></a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other changes</h3>
<p>Check out everything that changed in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/releases/tag/1.72.0">Rust</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#cargo-172-2023-08-24">Cargo</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#rust-172">Clippy</a>.</p>
<h3>Future Windows compatibility</h3>
<p>In a future release we're planning to increase the minimum supported Windows version to 10. The accepted proposal in compiler <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/651">MCP 651</a> is that Rust 1.75 will be the last to officially support Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. When Rust 1.76 is released in February 2024, only Windows 10 and later will be supported as tier-1 targets. This change will apply both as a host compiler and as a compilation target.</p>
<h2>Contributors to 1.72.0</h2>
<p>Many people came together to create Rust 1.72.0. We couldn't have done it without all of you. <a href="https://thanks.rust-lang.org/rust/1.72.0/">Thanks!</a></p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>  We introduce Graph of Thoughts (GoT): a framework that advances prompting
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) beyond those offered by paradigms
such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT). The key idea and primary
advantage of GoT is the ability to model the information generated by an LLM as
an arbitrary graph, where units of information ("LLM thoughts") are vertices,
and edges correspond to dependencies between these vertices. This approach
enables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic outcomes, distilling
the essence of whole networks of thoughts, or enhancing thoughts using feedback
loops. We illustrate that GoT offers advantages over state of the art on
different tasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62% over ToT,
while simultaneously reducing costs by &gt;31%. We ensure that GoT is extensible
with new thought transformations and thus can be used to spearhead new
prompting schemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to human thinking
or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both of which form complex networks.

Code Llama is state-of-the-art for publicly available LLMs on code tasks, and has the potential to make workflows faster and more efficient for current developers and lower the barrier to entry for people who are learning to code. Code Llama has the potential to be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust, well-documented software.</p><p>The generative AI space is evolving rapidly, and we believe an open approach to today’s AI is the best one for developing new AI tools that are innovative, safe, and responsible. We are releasing Code Llama <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">under the same community license as Llama 2</a>.</p></div></div></div><div><p>How Code Llama works</p><div><p>Code Llama is a code-specialized version of <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Llama 2</a> that was created by further training Llama 2 on its code-specific datasets, sampling more data from that same dataset for longer. Essentially, Code Llama features enhanced coding capabilities, built on top of Llama 2. It can generate code, and natural language about code, from both code and natural language prompts (e.g., “Write me a function that outputs the fibonacci sequence.”) It can also be used for code completion and debugging. It supports many of the most popular languages being used today, including Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, and Bash (see our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">research paper</a> for a full list).</p><br></div><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369652058_690162392972818_1173984281354057457_n.gif?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=UFuYmatCAJsAX8yovDh&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfALpbcW05Wqbhwosmlid229VVNSd2_PJuhvW3U9OCKp_A&amp;oe=64EC4B53" alt="" id="u_0_d_xm"></p></div><div><p>We are releasing three sizes of Code Llama with 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters respectively. Each of these models is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B base and instruct models have also been trained with fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability, allowing them to insert code into existing code, meaning they can support tasks like code completion right out of the box.</p><p>The three models address different serving and latency requirements. The 7B model, for example, can be served on a single GPU. The 34B model returns the best results and allows for better coding assistance, but the smaller 7B and 13B models are faster and more suitable for tasks that require low latency, like real-time code completion.</p><br></div><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369628374_974402950309179_3355223640107296330_n.gif?_nc_cat=108&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=A-qWWtKKzL4AX_oOxM_&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfABownM2MT-UMjaMYDaSVl3FTyacEnyJyNjiU66d9FDSw&amp;oe=64ECA3CD" alt="" id="u_0_e_rn"></p></div><div><p>The Code Llama models provide stable generations with up to 100,000 tokens of context. All models are trained on sequences of 16,000 tokens and show improvements on inputs with up to 100,000 tokens.</p><p>Aside from being a prerequisite for generating longer programs, having longer input sequences unlocks exciting new use cases for a code LLM. For example, users can provide the model with more context from their codebase to make the generations more relevant. It also helps in debugging scenarios in larger codebases, where staying on top of all code related to a concrete issue can be challenging for developers. When developers are faced with debugging a large chunk of code they can pass the entire length of the code into the model.</p><br></div><div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369634634_298372716122486_560769700771259146_n.gif?_nc_cat=110&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=A7xtUs6ybWgAX_8hEcb&amp;_nc_oc=AQnxvzRZhxLtzLc6idATxr2z_oz24NxZc1fwagRajF63ewHg-tFQJu49FPw1nIV8d1E&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDl0JuHS8zkFkvnqWmlTdCQpyet_Fn2CwjodeCJZZTcxA&amp;oe=64ECDA4B" alt="" id="u_0_f_jw"></p></div><div><p>Additionally, we have further fine-tuned two additional variations of Code Llama: Code Llama - Python and Code Llama - Instruct.</p><p>Code Llama - Python is a language-specialized variation of Code Llama, further fine-tuned on 100B tokens of Python code. Because Python is the most benchmarked language for code generation – and because Python and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/pytorch-builds-the-future-of-ai-and-machine-learning-at-facebook/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">PyTorch</a> play an important role in the AI community – we believe a specialized model provides additional utility.</p><p>Code Llama - Instruct is an instruction fine-tuned and aligned variation of Code Llama. Instruction tuning continues the training process, but with a different objective. The model is fed a “natural language instruction” input and the expected output. This makes it better at understanding what humans expect out of their prompts. We recommend using Code Llama - Instruct variants whenever using Code Llama for code generation since Code Llama - Instruct has been fine-tuned to generate helpful and safe answers in natural language.</p><p>We do not recommend using Code Llama or Code Llama - Python to perform general natural language tasks since neither of these models are designed to follow natural language instructions. Code Llama is specialized for code-specific tasks and isn’t appropriate as a foundation model for other tasks.</p><p>When using the Code Llama models, users must abide by our license and acceptable use policy.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369637790_316524720760615_7953912471035352291_n.jpg?_nc_cat=1&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=Cf6CASObRMAAX9zGhod&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfDYqs0HPqm8b8U5YaT7T6CXKWBZC_lF_rBjJvLLxBYYeg&amp;oe=64ED1DBB" alt="" id="u_0_g_5p"></p><p>Evaluating Code Llama’s performance</p><div><p>To test Code Llama’s performance against existing solutions, we used two popular coding benchmarks: <a href="https://github.com/openai/human-eval" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">HumanEval</a> and Mostly Basic Python Programming (<a href="https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">MBPP</a>). HumanEval tests the model’s ability to complete code based on docstrings and MBPP tests the model’s ability to write code based on a description.</p><p>Our benchmark testing showed that Code Llama performed better than open-source, code-specific LLMs and outperformed Llama 2. Code Llama 34B, for example, scored 53.7% on HumanEval and 56.2% on MBPP, the highest compared with other state-of-the-art open solutions, and on par with ChatGPT.</p><br></div><p><img src="https://scontent.fzrh3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.8562-6/369682932_681515836750953_6337320211215231153_n.jpg?_nc_cat=103&amp;ccb=1-7&amp;_nc_sid=6825c5&amp;_nc_ohc=ySlliu2C--QAX8yjDPM&amp;_nc_oc=AQkqR8IwnCfw2ThomqZCGvJFPgtE-VQEQ3WcNcTU08iQtcW0HbYPFnYvNtrcuEHI_Xw&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.fzrh3-1.fna&amp;oh=00_AfA_by6dLH0oojnJAfYQ44RJjBQjw9m1t9iyap4PMEooDA&amp;oe=64EC98CF" alt="" id="u_0_h_WH"></p><div><p>As with all cutting edge technology, Code Llama comes with risks. Building AI models responsibly is crucial, and we undertook numerous safety measures before releasing Code Llama. As part of our red teaming efforts, we ran a quantitative evaluation of Code Llama’s risk of generating malicious code. We created prompts that attempted to solicit malicious code with clear intent and scored Code Llama’s responses to those prompts against ChatGPT’s (GPT3.5 Turbo). Our results found that Code Llama answered with safer responses.</p><p>Details about our red teaming efforts from domain experts in responsible AI, offensive security engineering, malware development, and software engineering are available in our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">research paper</a>.</p></div><p>Releasing Code Llama</p><div><p>Programmers are already using LLMs to assist in a variety of tasks, ranging from writing new software to debugging existing code. The goal is to make developer workflows more efficient, so they can focus on the most human centric aspects of their job, rather than repetitive tasks.</p><p>At Meta, we believe that AI models, but LLMs for coding in particular, benefit most from an open approach, both in terms of innovation and safety. Publicly available, code-specific models can facilitate the development of new technologies that improve peoples' lives. By releasing code models like Code Llama, the entire community can evaluate their capabilities, identify issues, and fix vulnerabilities.</p><p>Code Llama’s training recipes are available on our <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/codellama" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Github repository</a>.</p><p><a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Model weights</a> are also available.</p></div><p>Responsible use</p><div><p>Our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">research paper</a> discloses details of Code Llama’s development as well as how we conducted our benchmarking tests. It also provides more information into the model’s limitations, known challenges we encountered, mitigations we’ve taken, and future challenges we intend to investigate.</p><p>We’ve also updated our <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/" target="_blank" data-lnfb-mode="ie">Responsible Use Guide</a> and it includes guidance on developing downstream models responsibly, including:</p><ul><li>Defining content policies and mitigations.</li><li>Preparing data.</li><li>Fine-tuning the model.</li><li>Evaluating and improving performance.</li><li>Addressing input- and output-level risks.</li><li>Building transparency and reporting mechanisms in user interactions.</li></ul><p>Developers should evaluate their models using code-specific evaluation benchmarks and perform safety studies on code-specific use cases such as generating malware, computer viruses, or malicious code.

Even well structured codebases are mostly composed of code which is not worth reading.<p>The difference in a well structured codebase is that some of the code prevents you from having to read huge amounts of other code.  All code is bad, it starts out bad just by existing, it's only redeeming quality is preventing you from having to deal with more bad code.</p><p>Everyone thinks they write good "clean" code, and it's never true.  Good programmers are good because of the architecture of their code, not because a single excerpt of code in isolation looks a certain way.</p><p>What you really want to read about are good designs.  Read APIs, models, concepts, schemas, etc.</p><p>Another comment mentioned the Go standard library, and I totally agree.  But stop at the APIs, if you look inside, you'll see that it's also mostly garbage. It's good because the APIs are good, and you don't have to read the rest.

I'm sure people vary, but I've got loads more out of open source contributions to sometimes small projects, and not very much out of trying to do something like read the code for the Glasgow Haskel Compiler or something.</p><p>So for code to read, I think <i>having an in</i> is crucial, at least for me. So I'd say, find a cool, maybe small open source project, look at the issue tracker if it has one, and try to implement something. You'll only really know if it's good code (or why) after you start trying to change it.

It usually just looks like code I'd already write.<p>I typically find the recommendations people make like "here's an example of particularly good code for this particular language / style / architecture" to be more enlightening.

For instance,  instead of learning a new programming language,  you should learn how programming languages are made.  Most of the secrets that computer science majors know that you probably don't were learned in compilers class.<p>(Unfortunately many people are chasing the Holy Grail of "functional programming" and never finding it because "functional programming" is a pale shadow of what's possible when you understand how compilers work:  this is how Common LISP and scheme are so much more profound then,  say,  Haskell)</p><p>It's a little out of date but I was lately thinking up about the Scott Adams adventure games of the early 1980s that were written with a specialized interpreter which could be implemented in BASIC but was also implemented in assembly language for better performance.

The thing is that GOTO becomes quite benign and even useful when it is used to implement interpreters.</p><p>So back in the day you would study systems like that to stretch your skills,  today I would look at compilers and related technology,  like the Jena rules engine.

I switched over to the Jena Rules engine</p><p><a href="https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://jena.apache.org/documentation/inference/</a></p><p>which still emits lousy error messages but I quickly was able to understand everything about the Jena Rules Engine,  get really good at writing extensions,  and use it for things the developers said were unsupported such as using it as the control plane of a data processing engine that bridged stream and batch processing:  I'd use Jena rules to control the process of setting up and tearing down reactive streams that would do a data processing job.  That is,  I got good at the Jena Rules Engine that I kept discovering new things I could do with it.</p><p>Clara is very similar to the legendary CLIPS rule engine from the golden age of ai</p><p><a href="https://www.clipsrules.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.clipsrules.net/</a></p><p>and if you find Clara is too small to understand,  CLIPS is even smaller.  The massive reduction in code size comes from being able to lean on the affordances of LISP to develop a DSL for writing rules,  if you have to write a parser and all the stuff that comes with defining an external DSL rules language your code starts to get much more complex.</p><p>Jena Rules Engine is written in Java and I think it is very nice code and you'll learn a lot about RETE engines and other advanced programming concepts by studying it,  you might even get more out of it than you get out of Clara.  It was common at the tail end of the golden age of A.I. for people to write a first draft of a system in Common Lisp and then end up re-writing in it C++ for performance.  Many of the ideas you get out of Lisp programming apply just well to other programming languages but require a huge amount of elbow grease and in-depth understanding of compiler technology whereas you can frequently use macros and similar affordances in Lisp to implement very sophisticated ideas with postage stamp size coded (that granted many people find challenging to understand.)

I stupidly decided to do it in TeX. The stupidity here was that (a) the only laser printer on campus was in another building and (b) the TeXBook didn't exist yet. All I had was a listing of a late prerelease of the Web source of TeX, along with some of Knuth's writings about TeX77, which was a substantially different system. I managed to do it, including formatting much of the manual in the style of Unix man pages (the environment itself lasted for several years, until mainframe timesharing for students went away for good). When I finally got my hands on the TeXBook, I found that I had learned much about TeX, including a few things that weren't so :).<p>Knuth's programming style is highly idiosyncratic, and there are many points with which I'd disagree. Furthermore, the choice of Pascal required all sorts of strange compromises. That said, I highly commend reading the source of TeX, to see how a brilliant computer scientist attacked a problem that is not nicely structured, using very restricted programming tools. You will not get much that you can copy into your programs, but it is an excellent, well-documented attack on an interesting and complex problem. (By the way, Knuth's TeX was written long before modern typesetting things like Unicode, PDF, and OTF fonts; you don't want to use Knuth's TeX for modern work; I use LuaTeX. But Knuth's version remains as a useful subject of study.)</p><p>Another good thing to study is Lions's commentary on Unix V6. This is interesting  because it shows many of Unix's key abstractions implemented in a few thousand lines of code.

The worst code bases I have seen have been the ones with no code plans at all, and the ones that use Clean Code and Gang of Four like a bible, both are equally mazes of spaghetti. Clean Code I really just don't agree with, and I think this author lays it out well. Special design patterns and tons of polymorphism usually end up creating multiples of complexity in the effort to reduce DRY at any cost (and often are abstractions that are only ever used one or two times anyways).<p>Ultimately I think the single most important rule for clean code is: skinny controller, fat model. If you are doing batch data, then this applies still I think. You should have all of the logic you can in the model, avoid data objects. And the code paths that alter things should be as thin as possible. I honestly think it is better to have a 5k line model if it avoids more.</p><p>The most unlcean code I have seen usually falls into the abstracted out processes in financial instutitons where they follow Clean Code advice and everything are a bunch of functions passing around some big fat objects full of getters and setters, and changing any functionality means adding changes somewhere in the process to check state and alter the state, which leads to loops and if statements everywhere to see which account type it is at each point etc.</p><p>But in OOP programming its supposed to be objects sending messages to each other. Every object should know everything about <i>itself</i>, which is what a fat model demands. Any more abstraction than that seems to get in the way.

If you just go to 'good code' how do you know what 'bad' looks like?  Also to your point what is 'good code' can be very subjective.  I have one language I use a decent amount.  There is a particular style that many use that they consider 'good code'.  I think it is a terrible bit of style to do.  I have my reasons for it.  But good/bad is not necessarily a metric you can measure.<p>I would posit that discarding github out of hand is not a great start.  Pick one of the big projects on there and follow what is pushed in.  You will notice how others interact with the code.  You will start to notice who checks in good stuff.  Follow them.  Also pick your language.  As a good style there could be a bad style in another for example C++ vs Python.  Python styles in C++ would drive the C++ guys nuts and the other way around.

<p>18th May 2023</p>
<p>The Logic Lab provides a selection of 12 logic gates that you can interconnect with patch cables to make a variety of different logic circuits, for experimenting with and learning about logic:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclabcables.jpg" alt="LogicLabCables.jpg" width="675" height="450"></p>
<p><em>The Logic Lab allows you to experiment with logic gates by interconnecting them with patch cables.</em></p>
<p>You can enter inputs using switches, and display the outputs on five coloured LEDs. The whole Logic Lab is implemented using a single AVR128DA48 (or ATmega4809) microprocessor and a few LEDs and other passive components, with a total parts cost of under £20 or $25.</p>
<p>I've included nine logic problems that you can try solving with the help of the Logic Lab.</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>I originally decided to build this for a friend's son who was interested in learning about logic gates, and I thought he would enjoy having something that he could use for practical experiments. I had a design in mind, and searched to see if anything similar already existed; the closest I found was a kit developed by the University of Southampton in the UK <sup id="cite_ref1"><a href="#cite_note1">[1]</a></sup>, but it wasn't commercially available.</p>
<p>My first idea was to use 74LVC series logic gates, which are individual logic gates in small surface-mount packages. The nice thing about this is that each drawing of a logic gate on the PCB would be implemented by a single gate.</p>
<p>However, I then thought about using the Configurable Custom Logic (CCL) in the AVR DA-series microcontrollers, which allows you to configure three-input gates that work independently of the processor. The advantage would be that you could reconfigure the selection of gates in software, without needing to resolder the board. However, even the largest 64-pin devices only provide six logic gates, and in the 48-pin packages it seems that only five of these are actually available on I/O pins.</p>
<p>My final design used an ATmega4809 or AVR128DA48 microcontroller, but simulating the gates by polling the inputs, and setting the outputs accordingly, using truth tables stored in the program. With a 48-pin package it would be possible to emulate at least 12 gates of different types, which would be ample for the design I had in mind. This approach would allow you to change the selection of gates available by uploading a new version of the software, and then making stickers to show the new gate symbols.</p>
<p>Even though the logic gates are simulated using a microcontroller, the only detectable difference is the propagation delay. You can even create an oscillator by connecting the output of one of the inverters back to its input.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Logic Lab has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 logic gates: two AND, two NAND, two OR, two NOR, two XOR, and two inverters.</li>
<li>Four slider switches, S1 to S4, with LEDs to show the status, that can provide logic inputs to the gates.</li>
<li>Five coloured LEDs, L1 to L5, that can display the state of the output from a logic circuit. The top three are red, orange, and green, allowing simulation of traffic lights.</li>
<li>Two busses, J1 and J2, that can be used to link patch cables together.</li>
<li>It is powered by two AAA batteries, with an on/off switch and power indicator LED.</li>
<li>The inputs and outputs are connected to header pins, so you can interconnect them with a set of patch cables terminated in header sockets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Logic problems</h3>
<p>Here are nine sample logic problems that you can try solving with the Logic Lab. These can each be solved using the twelve gates in the Logic Lab. I've given an approximate difficulty rating out of 100 for each problem.</p>
<p>For the answers to the problems see <a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/show?4FO5">Logic Lab Problem Answers</a>.</p>
<h4>Traffic lights (20%)</h4>
<p>Traffic lights (in the UK) go through the following sequence:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>S1</strong></td>
<td><strong>S2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lights</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Red and Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Design a logic circuit that lights the red, orange, and green LEDs according to that sequence of switches.</p>
<h4>Exclusive-OR (30%)</h4>
<p>Two of the gates in the logic lab are exclusive-OR, or XOR, gates; their output is '1' if either of the inputs is '1', but not both.</p>
<p>Design an&nbsp;exclusive-OR&nbsp;gate without using the XOR gates, by using a combination of the other gates in the Logic Lab.</p>
<h4>Safety switch (40%)</h4>
<p>A school has a fire warning light that lights up in every classroom. To avoid it being accidentally switched on it has four switches, all of which need to be turned on before the warning will light up.</p>
<p>Design a logic circuit that implements this: the red LED, representing the warning, should only turn on if all switches are set to '1'.</p>
<h4><span>Palindrome checker (40%)</span></h4>
<p>Design a circuit that lights the green LED if the four switches are set to a binary number that's a palindrome, such as '1001', and the red LED if it's not a palindrome, like '1011'.</p>
<h4>Hotel light switches (60%)</h4>
<p>In a hotel four rooms are on the same corridor, and there's one light in the middle of the corridor. There's a switch outside each room that can be used to control the light.</p>
<p>Design a circuit that allows each of the four switches S1 to S4 to turn the light L5 on or off.</p>
<h4>Binary decoder (70%)</h4>
<p>Design a circuit that lights up just one of the four LEDs L1 to L4 for each of the different possible settings of switches S1 and S2:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td><strong>S1</strong></td>
<td><strong>S2</strong></td>
<td><strong>Lights</strong></td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Red</td>

<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Orange</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4>Majority vote (80%)</h4>
<p>When the secret spy club needs to vote on an issue, the three members each have a button that they press to register their vote. If there is a majority vote, the issue is passed.</p>
<p>Use three switches to represent the votes, and design a circuit that will light the green LED if the majority vote '1', or the red LED if they don't.</p>
<h4>Combination switch (90%)</h4>
<p>You have a drawer with an electronic lock, and it can only be opened if you set the correct password on four switches. Design a logic circuit that allows you to choose any of the 16 possible passwords, such as '1011', by changing the position of four patch leads. The circuit should then only light up the green LED if you set the correct password on the switches.</p>
<h4>Binary adder (100%)</h4>
<p>Design a circuit that will add together two 2-digit binary numbers, and put the answer in binary on the three LEDs L3 to L5.</p>
<p>The first number should be on S1 (high bit) and S2 (low bit), and the second number should be on S3 (high bit) and S4 (low bit). The answer should be on L3 (high bit), L4 (middle bit), and L5 (low bit).</p>
<h3>The circuit</h3>
<p>Here's the full circuit of the Logic Lab:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclab.gif" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logiclab.gif" alt="LogicLab.gif" width="720" height="264"></a></p>
<p><em>Circuit of the Logic Lab, based on an AVR128DA48 or ATmega4809 processor.<br> Click to open a larger version in a new window.</em></p>
<p>There is quite a wide choice of pin-compatible microcontrollers you can use for this project, which should help while many of the most popular parts are still out of stock at time of writing.&nbsp;I built two prototypes, one with an AVR128DA48, and one with the older ATmega4809 which is pin compatible, and their performance was indistinguishable. The program only uses about 1500 bytes, so an ATmega809, ATmega1609, or ATmega3209 should be fine. Likewise, an AVR32DA48 or AVR64DA48 should be fine, or the equivalent AVR32DB parts.</p>
<p>I used 0.1" pitch header pins for the inputs and outputs, and patch leads terminated in header sockets. The advantage of this is that you can buy the header pins in long strips, and then cut them down to the lengths you need; the header sockets are more difficult to divide up.</p>
<p>The five output LEDs are 5mm diffused through-hole LEDs in five different colours. In my first prototype, shown in the photographs, I used a white LED, but found that because white has a higher forward voltage than the other colours, if you connect both white and one of the other LEDs to the same output the white is much dimmer. I therefore replaced white with yellow to avoid the problem.</p>
<p>The other LEDs and resistors are 0805 size SMD types.</p>
<p>The circuit is powered by two 1.5V AAA batteries in series, mounted in through-hole battery clips on the back of the board. Alternatively you could use two PCB-mount AAA battery holders&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref2"><a href="#cite_note2">[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;which fit in the same mounting holes.</p>
<h4>Short-circuit protection</h4>
<p>The board includes 100Ω current limiting resistors on every output, so if the user inadvertently connects together two outputs at different logic levels, the current will be 3/(100 + 100) or 15mA, which is well within the 50mA per output maximum given on the data sheet.</p>
<h4>Unconnected inputs</h4>
<p>Unconnected inputs are treated as being at logic-level '0'. This is implemented by a 10kΩ pull-down resistor on every input.</p>
<p>If you prefer to have unconnected inputs at logic level '1' (like TTL) you can omit these resistors, and turn on the internal pullup resistors by configuring the inputs as&nbsp;<strong>INPUT_PULLUP</strong> in <strong>setup()</strong>.</p>
<h4>Patch cables</h4>
<p>To use the Logic Lab you'll need a set of at least 20 jumper wires terminated in header sockets. I recommend 150mm long cables; either ribbon cables that you can separate to create a set of jumper wires&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref3"><a href="#cite_note3">[3]</a></sup>, or slightly more expensive separate cables&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref4"><a href="#cite_note4">[4]</a></sup>.</p>
<h4>► Parts list</h4>

<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>I designed a PCB in Eagle and ordered boards from Elecrow <sup id="cite_ref5"><a href="#cite_note5">[5]</a></sup>. The board is 100 x 140mm, using a double-sided PCB. I also created a design for a back panel and ordered this in 2mm thick transparent acrylic <sup id="cite_ref6"><a href="#cite_note6">[6]</a></sup>. I give links at the end of the article so you can order your own boards.</p>
<p>The only standard I could find for drawing the logic symbols was a USA Department of Defense document from 1962, which describes how to draw them from arcs of circles&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref7"><a href="#cite_note7">[7]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>For my first attempt at designing the PCB I assigned the logic gate inputs to the microcontroller ports in a systematic way, with all the AND and NAND gate inputs on one port, all the OR and NOR gate inputs to another port, and so on. However, the layout was a nightmare, and I needed a lot of vias to make it work. I decided to have a second attempt simply choosing the nearest I/O pin to each gate input or output, with the idea that I could sort out in software, and I managed to lay it out much more neatly with no vias.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to the assignment of I/O pins to the gate inputs and outputs:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/logicgatepins.gif" alt="LogicGatePins.gif" width="392" height="261"></p>
<p>My recommended sequence for assembling the board is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solder the microcontroller on the back of the board using a hot air gun.</li>
<li>Solder the SMD resistors and capacitors to the back of the board, and the SMD LEDs to the front of the board, using the hot air gun.</li>
<li>Fit the the header pins to the front of the board with a conventional soldering iron.</li>
<li>Mount the switches and 5mm LEDs with a soldering iron.</li>
<li>Fit the three-pin header socket on the back of the board with a soldering iron.</li>
<li>Finally, fit the battery holders with a soldering iron, using a generous amount of solder to hold them firmly in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the SMD components I used a Youyue 858D+ hot air gun set to 300°C.</p>
<p>When fitting the header pins I did them a column at a time, and found it helpful to push them into something like a 1x36 header socket <sup id="cite_ref8"><a href="#cite_note8">[8]</a></sup>, to keep them correctly aligned and vertical.</p>
<p>When mounting the battery clips I found I had to enlarge the mounting holes with a 2mm drill to get the clips to fit. You won't need to do this if you use the PCB-mount AAA battery holders&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref9"><a href="#cite_note9">[9]</a></sup>.</p>

<p><em>The back of the Logic Lab PCB, showing the ATmega4809 processor and battery holders.</em></p>
<p>I mounted the&nbsp;transparent acrylic back panel with 15mm nylon pillars <sup id="cite_ref10"><a href="#cite_note10">[10]</a></sup> and M3 6mm nylon screws <sup id="cite_ref11"><a href="#cite_note11">[11]</a></sup>.</p>
<h3>The program</h3>
<p>For each gate the program simply reads the inputs, and sets the output according to the truth table for the logic gate.</p>
<p>I thought about using interrupts, but I decided to go with the simpler approach of repeatedly stepping through the gates, processing them in sequence. The program doesn't have anything else to do, so there's no need for interrupts.</p>
<h4>Truth tables</h4>
<p>The truth table for each of the different gate types is defined by an enum:</p>
<pre>enum truthtable_t: uint8_t { AND = 0b1000, NAND = 0b0111,  OR = 0b1110, 
                             NOR = 0b0001,  XOR = 0b0110, NOT = 0b0011 };</pre>
<h4>Logic gate definitions</h4>
<p>The definition of each gate is a struct, <strong>gate_t</strong>:</p>
<pre>typedef struct {
  int inputa;
  int inputb;
  int output;
  truthtable_t truthtable;
} gate_t;</pre>
<p>This defines the pin numbers used for the two inputs and the output, the value to be output, and the type of logic gate.</p>
<p>Here are the definitions of the 12 gates in the Logic Lab:</p>
<pre>gate_t gates[12] = {
  { PIN_PC1, PIN_PC0, PIN_PC5, AND },
  { PIN_PB5, PIN_PB4, PIN_PC4, AND },
  { PIN_PB1, PIN_PB0, PIN_PA3, NAND },
  { PIN_PA6, PIN_PA7, PIN_PA2, NAND },
  { PIN_PC7, PIN_PC6, PIN_PD2, OR },
  { PIN_PC3, PIN_PC2, PIN_PD3, OR },
  { PIN_PA5, PIN_PA4, PIN_PF2, NOR },
  { PIN_PA1, PIN_PA0, PIN_PF3, NOR },
  { PIN_PD4, PIN_PD5, PIN_PE0, XOR },
  { PIN_PD6, PIN_PD7, PIN_PE1, XOR },
  { PIN_PF0, PIN_PF0, PIN_PE2, NOT },
  { PIN_PF1, PIN_PF1, PIN_PE3, NOT },
};</pre>
<p>For simplicity I define the NOT gate as a two input gate where both inputs are the same pin.</p>
<p>If you wanted to change the type of a gate simply change its <strong>truthtable</strong> value in this table. For example, you could change all the two-input gates into NAND gates by changing their definitions to <strong>NAND</strong>, or you could add some XNOR gates by also defining them in <strong>truthtable_t</strong>.</p>
<h4>Configuring the outputs</h4>
<p>In <strong>setup()</strong> the appropriate I/O pins are configured as outputs:</p>
<pre>void setup () {
  // Set outputs
  for (int i=0; i&lt;12; i++) {
    pinMode(gates[i].output, OUTPUT);
  }
}</pre>
<h4>Processing the gates</h4>
<p>Finally in&nbsp;<strong>loop()</strong>&nbsp;we repeatedly scan through each gate, read the inputs, and set the output according to the gate's truth table:</p>
<pre>void loop () {
  for (int i=0; i&lt;12; i++) {
    gate_t gate = gates[i];
    bool ina = digitalRead(gate.inputa);
    bool inb = digitalRead(gate.inputb);
    int val = ina &lt;&lt; 1 | inb;
    bool out = (gate.truthtable &gt;&gt; val) &amp; 1;
    digitalWrite(gate.output, out);
  }
}</pre>
<p>That's all there is to it.</p>
<h3>Compiling the program</h3>
<h4>AVR128DA48</h4>
<p>If you're using an AVR128DA48, or anything from the AVR32DA48 or AVR32DB48 upwards, compile the program using&nbsp;Spence Konde's <a href="https://github.com/SpenceKonde/DxCore" target="_blank">Dx Core</a> on GitHub (I used 1.5.3). Choose the&nbsp;<strong>AVR DA-series (no bootloader)</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>AVR DB-series (no bootloader)</strong>&nbsp;option as appropriate under the&nbsp;<strong>DxCore</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong> menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (ignore any other options):</p>
<p><strong>Chip: "</strong><strong>AVR128DA49</strong><strong>"</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>"</strong><strong>AVR128DB48</strong><strong>"</strong><br><strong>Clock Speed: "4 MHz internal"</strong></p>
<p>Then upload the program to the processor on the breadboard using a UPDI programmer connected to the GND, +5V, and UPDI pins.</p>
<p>The recommended option is to use a USB to Serial board, such as the SparkFun FTDI Basic board&nbsp;<sup id="cite_ref12"><a href="#cite_note12">[12]</a></sup>, or a USB to Serial cable <sup id="cite_ref13"><a href="#cite_note13">[13]</a></sup>, connected with&nbsp;a 4.7kΩ resistor as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.technoblogy.com/pictures/kvm/serialupdiprogrammer.gif" alt="SerialUPDIProgrammer.gif" width="395" height="147"></p>
<ul>
<li>Set&nbsp;<strong>Programmer</strong>&nbsp;to the first of the&nbsp;<strong>"SerialUPDI - 230400 baud"</strong> options.</li>
<li>Select the USB port corresponding to the USB to Serial board in the <strong>Port</strong> menu.</li>
<li>Choose <strong>Upload</strong> from the Arduino IDE <strong>Tools</strong> menu to upload the program.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a clock speed of 4MHz reduces the processor power consumption from 4.7mA to 1.1mA.</p>
<h4>ATmega4809</h4>
<p>If you're using an ATmega4809, or anything from the ATmega809 upwards, compile the program using&nbsp;MCUdude's&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/MCUdude/MegaCoreX" target="_blank">MegaCoreX</a>&nbsp;on GitHub. Choose the&nbsp;<strong>ATmega4809</strong>&nbsp;option as appropriate under the&nbsp;<strong>MegaCoreX</strong>&nbsp;heading on the&nbsp;<strong>Board</strong>&nbsp;menu. Check that the subsequent options are set as follows (ignore any other options):</p>
<p><strong>Clock: "Internal 4 MHz</strong><strong>"<br>BOD: "BOD disabled"</strong><br><strong>Pinout: "48 pin standard"</strong></p>
<p>On the ATmega4809, choosing a clock speed of 4MHz ensures that the processor will run down to the minimum voltage of 1.8V, for maximum battery life.</p>
<p>Then upload the program using&nbsp;a USB to Serial board, as described above.&nbsp;See the MegaCoreX documentation for further details.</p>
