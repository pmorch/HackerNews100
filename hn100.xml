            <h2>Release Notes</h2>
        <p id="markdown-area-db74b53c-e1fd-41ab-9e8c-a4d4447b8f74">- Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS Beta includes the new COSMIC Desktop Environment designed and developed by System76. COSMIC DE is largely feature complete for the first release and development focus has turned to bug fixes for the final release.

- This is a beta release and some bugs are expected.

- On occasion, the installer does not start in a virtual machine. Press Super to activate the Launcher and search for "Installer".

- Some GNOME apps are replaced by COSMIC apps
  - GNOME Files (Nautilus) &gt; COSMIC Files
  - GNOME Terminal &gt; COSMIC Terminal
  - GNOME Text Editor &gt; COSMIC Text Editor
  - GNOME Media Player (Totem) &gt; COSMIC Media Player

- Pop!_Shop is replaced by COSMIC Store

- Key components
  - COSMIC Epoch 1 Beta
  - Linux kernel 6.16.3
  - Mesa 25.1.5-1
  - NVIDIA Driver 580
  - libwayland/libwayland-client 1.23.1-3
  - libdrm 2.4.125-1

- Dragging and Dropping files from Wayland apps to X11 apps is not currently supported. For instance dragging files from COSMIC Files to Slack. Use the applications upload option as a work-around until the feature is added.
- On distributions other than Pop!_OS, Firefox may need a configuration flag set to match COSMIC theming

  - Go to **```about:config```** and set **```widget.gtk.libadwaita-colors.enabled```** to **```false```**
- Google Chrome based browsers

  - As of Google Chrome version 140, no configuration is necessary for Wayland
  - For versions prior to 140 and other Chrome based browsers that aren’t updated, setting the **```ozone-platform-hint```** is necessary. Go to chrome://flags in a tab, search for **```ozone-platform-hint```** and change the setting to “auto”. Restart the browser.

- Gaming is working well but we expect to need more fixes in our xwayland implementation for the Release Candidate.

  - Some games may start partially off screen. Press F11 or Super+F11 to full screen the game (Goat Simulator is one example)

- Display toggle hotkeys and an on-screen-display is not supported yet.

- The “Accent hint” around windows doesn’t match the roundness style setting in Appearance. This is expected for at least COSMIC apps for the Release Candidate.

- COSMIC has a built-in screenshot tool. If you require annotations, we recommend Flameshot which can be installed from Flathub via COSMIC Store. Version 13.1 or higher is required for COSMIC.

- COSMIC Store doesn’t currently display Flatpak suggested addons for apps. This is planned for the Release Candidate.

- Accessibility: The screen reader may not read all COSMIC apps widgets or may read them in an unintuitive direction. We’re working on screen reader flow and navigation for the Release Candidate.

- Some application indicators do not appear in the Notification Tray applet.

- Switching to an application using its application indicator does not currently work.

- Printing support in COSMIC Text Editor is planned for the release candidate

- Additional features and bugs expected to be fixed are triaged in the RC column on the 
[project board](https://github.com/orgs/pop-os/projects/23/views/1)

<p>I recently purchased the textbook “Aircraft Control and Simulation” by Brian L. Stevens, Frank L. Lewis, and Eric N. Johnson<sup data-fn="043b6f3b-03c5-49af-a847-588dcf74793a"><a href="#043b6f3b-03c5-49af-a847-588dcf74793a" id="043b6f3b-03c5-49af-a847-588dcf74793a-link">1</a></sup>. This book covers the control and simulation of aircraft. It’s really dense and frankly hard to understand. As far as aerodynamics texts go, it’s pretty typical.</p>

<p>One interesting item in the appendices of the book is the source code for the simulation of an F-16. It has a flight model, based on scale model wind tunnel data. The flight model consists of a dozen lookup tables and the math equations to make it fly.</p>



<p>The only problem: it’s written entirely in Fortran.</p>

<p>The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/vazgriz/FlightSim_F16">Github</a>.</p>



<p>You can play the finished project right now on itch.io</p>

<h2><span id="Introduction">Introduction</span></h2>



<p>In previous posts on this blog<sup data-fn="4bf1b8e1-c40d-43b7-b010-d8b1043a2423"><a href="#4bf1b8e1-c40d-43b7-b010-d8b1043a2423" id="4bf1b8e1-c40d-43b7-b010-d8b1043a2423-link">2</a></sup> <sup data-fn="b896ed6f-b50c-4b43-9d20-113b9f6b1497"><a href="#b896ed6f-b50c-4b43-9d20-113b9f6b1497" id="b896ed6f-b50c-4b43-9d20-113b9f6b1497-link">3</a></sup> <sup data-fn="f8f5c94c-2a47-40ee-9825-f1e6583752ae"><a href="#f8f5c94c-2a47-40ee-9825-f1e6583752ae" id="f8f5c94c-2a47-40ee-9825-f1e6583752ae-link">4</a></sup>, I covered the development of a flight simulator based on the lift equation and hand-tuned parameters. This gives the game designer direct control over a lot of flight parameters. For example, you can directly choose the turn rate and the G-limit of the aircraft, allowing the designer to easily tune the corner speed. This works well for game development, since the designer, and ultimately the player, care more about these high-level parameters.</p>



<p>But real aircraft are designed from the other direction, starting from low-level parameters such as the size, shape, and position of airfoils. Engineers tune every aspect of the aircraft in order to reach those high-level behaviors. But every design decision has trade offs and reaching the goal for one parameter means compromising another. An airliner is designed very differently from a fighter jet because of this.</p>



<p>Simulating all of the low-level parameters is difficult. It’s possible to simulate air flow over the vehicle using <em>computational fluid dynamics</em> (CFD), but this kind of software is difficult to write and even more difficult to verify.</p>



<p>The F-16 flight model from the textbook does not simulate the low-level parameters, but it also doesn’t simulate the high-level parameters either. It sits somewhere in between, so it serves as a useful stepping stone from my previous projects. This project will explore more advanced flight dynamics and explain the limitations of the old flight model as well as the new one.</p>



<h2><span id="Aerospace_Conventions">Aerospace Conventions</span></h2>



<h2><span id="Coordinate_System">Coordinate System</span></h2>



<p>Before we can write any code, we need to understand the conventions used for mathematically modeling aircraft that are used in the aerospace industry. The textbook uses aerospace conventions and to use them in this project, we must convert them to Unity conventions.</p>



<p>The first convention is the coordinate system axes. If you’ve ever visited a graphics programming forum, you might have seen people arguing over how the X, Y, and Z axes should be arranged in their game. Especially whether to use a right handed or left handed, and Y-up or Z-up coordinate system.</p>



<p>This chart by Freya Holmer<sup data-fn="149b4841-9ef4-469f-8a98-22bc8a941e7f"><a href="#149b4841-9ef4-469f-8a98-22bc8a941e7f" id="149b4841-9ef4-469f-8a98-22bc8a941e7f-link">5</a></sup> shows the axis choices made by a variety of 3D software tools.</p>

But we all know that Unreal made the worst possible choice</figcaption></figure>



<p>The aerospace industry takes a different path. The most common coordinate system for aircraft is right handed, X forward, Y right, and Z down. This is completely different from every tool shown above. The textbook defines all of it’s math using this convention.</p>

<p>Luckily, translating between two coordinate systems is easy. You just swap the components around and then add or remove minus signs until it all works. Every calculation made by the textbook’s code can be easily translated into Unity’s coordinate system and vice versa.</p>



<p>Writing functions to do this is simple:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public static Vector3 ConvertVectorToAerospace(Vector3 vector) {
    return new Vector3(vector.z, vector.x, -vector.y);
}

public static Vector3 ConvertVectorToUnity(Vector3 vector) {
    return new Vector3(vector.y, -vector.z, vector.x);
}</pre>



<p>When translating euler angles, torque, or other angular values, one additional negation is needed:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public static Vector3 ConvertAngleToAerospace(Vector3 angle) {
    // negate when switching handedness
    return -ConvertVectorToAerospace(angle);
}

public static Vector3 ConvertAngleToUnity(Vector3 angle) {
    // negate when switching handedness
    return -ConvertVectorToUnity(angle);
}</pre>



<h2><span id="Units">Units</span></h2>



<p>For completely inscrutable reasons, American aerospace texts (and the industry!) insist on using US customary units for everything. All math is defined with these units. Distance is measured in feet. Mass is measured in slugs.</p>



<p>What the hell is a slug? A slug is the unit of mass in the US system. This is the equivalent unit of the kilogram in the metric system. Remember that weight and mass are not the same thing.</p><p>



\(1 \, \text{kg} * 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 9.81 \, \text{N}\)



</p><p>



\(1 \, \text{slug} * 32.17 \, \text{ft/s}^2 = 32.17 \, \text{lb}\)



</p><p><em>Mass</em> is the measure of how much an object resists linear force. <em>Moment of inertia</em> is how much the object resists rotational force or <em>torque</em>. The unit for moment of inertia in metric is kg-m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the equivalent unit in customary is slug-ft<sup>2</sup>.</p>



<p>You want to measure how much air mass is in a given volume? That’s gonna be slugs/ft<sup>3</sup>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="459" height="183" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Slug_parts.png" alt=""><figcaption>A slug’s foot</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speed is mostly measured in feet per second, unless you want to know the speed of the aircraft. Then you use <em>knots</em>, which means nautical miles per hour. Importantly, a nautical mile is not the same as a regular mile. A regular mile is 5,280 feet. A nautical mile is ~6,076 feet or exactly 1,852 meters (???).</p>



<p>Do you want to know how fast your ship is sailing? Just throw out this piece of wood tied to a spool of rope. The rope has <em>knots</em> tied at regular intervals. Count the number of knots that unspool in a given time frame. That’s how many <em>knots</em> your ship is making.</p>

<p>Finally, temperature is measured in degrees Rankine. You know how the Kelvin scale is just the Celsius scale adjusted so that 0 Kelvin equals absolute zero? Well Rankine is the same concept applied to Fahrenheit.</p><p>



\(0 \, \text{R} = \text{absolute zero} \\ 534 \, \text{R} = 75 \, \text{F} = \text{room temperature}\)



</p><p>How the fuck did we ever build the SR-71? 💀</p>



<p>Unity by convention uses metric for all physics units. The flight model in the textbook uses US customary units, so every input and output of this system has to be converted. So we have to add functions to handle converting to and from US customary units. This is easy enough since conversion is just a multiplication or division operation.</p>



<h2><span id="Terminology">Terminology</span></h2>



<p>There are several terms used in aerospace that I need to define. I have used equivalent terms in the previous project, but I will clarify them here.</p>



<p><em>Alpha</em> (α) refers to the angle of attack.</p>



<p><em>Beta</em> (β) refers to the angle of side slip.</p>



<p><em>Longitudinal axis</em> is the X-axis, from tail to nose.</p>



<p><em>Normal axis</em> is the Z- axis, the vertical axis pointing downwards.</p>



<p><em>Lateral axis</em> is the Y-axis, or side axis, pointing right.</p>



<p><em>Phi</em> (φ) is the aircraft’s roll around the X axis.</p>



<p><em>Theta</em> (θ) is the aircraft’s pitch around the Y axis.</p>



<p><em>Psi</em> (ψ) is the aircraft’s yaw around the Z axis.</p>



<p><em>P</em>, <em>Q</em>, and <em>R</em> refer to the angular velocity around the X, Y, and Z axes respectively.</p>



<p>In general you will find that aerodynamics texts are allergic to good variable names. I suspect this is a form of gatekeeping. Or perhaps the authors have to pay by the letter to publish.</p>



<h2><span id="Air_Data">Air Data</span></h2>



<p>Airplanes need air to fly [citation needed]. Every behavior of a plane is determined by the movement of air. Therefore it is critically important, for real and simulated planes, to be able to measure the air flowing around it.</p>



<p>Real planes need to measure static and dynamic air pressure to determine how fast the plane is moving. Static pressure is measured by a static pressure port. It’s the pressure that you would measure if you just lifted a pressure meter to the same altitude as the plane. Static pressure decreases with altitude.</p>



<p>Dynamic pressure measures the pressure added by the plane’s forward motion. This requires a pitot tube to measure. As the plane moves forward it rams air into the pitot tube and increases the pressure above the static pressure. The pitot measures the total pressure of the air. By subtracting the static pressure, we can obtain the dynamic pressure.</p>



<p>The static and dynamic pressures can then be used to calculate many of the variables the pilot needs to fly. Most important are the airspeed and altitude of the aircraft. Specifically, these values can be used to calculate the indicated airspeed of the aircraft. Indicated airspeed is calculated directly from the dynamic pressure.</p>



<p>At most subsonic speeds, the dynamic pressure of air flowing over the wings is the most important variable in flight. A plane’s performance can be defined in terms of indicated airspeed. For example, a plane may have a stall speed of 100 knots indicated airspeed. This means that no matter what altitude the plane is at, the indicated airspeed will be 100 when the plane stalls.</p>



<p>This is important since it gives a consistent number for the stall speed regardless of atmospheric conditions. The pressure and density of the air can vary based on weather, temperature, and other factors. So the true airspeed when a stall occurs can be very inconsistent. But as long as the pilot knows the indicated airspeed, they know how their plane will behave.</p>



<p>For this simulator, the calculation has to work backwards. We know the true airspeed and altitude of the plane from the velocity and position of the rigidbody. From that, we can calculate the dynamic pressure. This dynamic pressure is then used for later calculations in the flight model. Additionally, the plane’s speed in mach is calculated here as well.</p>



<p>The original Fortran source code is given:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">  	SUBROUTINE ADC(VT,ALT,AMACH,QBAR)
  	DATA R0/2.377E-3/
  	TFAC = 1.0 - 0.703E-5 * ALT
  	T = 519.0 * TFAC
  	IF (ALT .GE. 35000.0) T= 390.0
  	RHO = R0 * (TFAC**4.14)
  	AMACH= VT/SQRT(1.4*1716.3*T)
  	QBAR = 0.5*RHO*VT*VT
C 	PS = 1715.0 * RHO * T
  	RETURN
  	END</pre>



<p>It turns out, Fortran is actually pretty good at translating formulas. So this code is not as difficult to read as I expected.</p>



<p>To translate this to Unity, we create a class AirDataComputer to perform these calculations. The output of the calculation is the AirData struct.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public struct AirData {
	public float altitudeMach;
	public float qBar;
}

public class AirDataComputer {
    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Density in slugs/ft^3
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public const float SeaLevelDensity = 2.377e-3f;
    public const float MaxAltitude = 35000.0f;

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Calculates air data based on velocity and altitude
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    /// &lt;param name="velocity"&gt;Velocity in ft/s&lt;/param&gt;
    /// &lt;param name="altitude"&gt;Altitude in ft&lt;/param&gt;
    /// &lt;returns&gt;Air data&lt;/returns&gt;
    public AirData CalculateAirData(float velocity, float altitude) {
        ...
    }
}</pre>



<p>Here we can see where the US customary units are used. The density of air at sea level is defined in slugs/ft<sup>3</sup>. The altitude is defined in feet. Theoretically, these values could be defined using metric. But the implementation of the function depends on even more values defined in customary.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const float baseTemperature = 519.0f;    	// sea level temp in R
const float minTemperature = 390.0f;     	// minimum temp in R
const float temperatureGradient = 0.703e-5f; // gradient in R / ft

altitude = Mathf.Clamp(altitude, 0, MaxAltitude);

// calculate temperature in Rankine
float temperatureFactor = 1.0f - (temperatureGradient * altitude);
float T = Mathf.Max(minTemperature, baseTemperature * temperatureFactor);</pre>



<p>These calculations simulate the change in atmospheric conditions at different altitudes. Particularly important is how the temperature drops at higher altitudes. The temperature gradient approximates the decreases in temperature (in Rankine) as altitude increases.</p>



<p>This flight model supports altitudes up to 35,000 ft. Altitudes above this are not supported. At any altitude above this, the plane will behave as if it were at 35,000 ft. This is because the temperatures at this altitude no longer consistently decrease, as it does in the lower atmosphere. A more advanced atmosphere model would need to be used.</p>



<p>Temperature factor does not drop below about 0.75 in this range, so the resulting temperature T does not fall below 390 R.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const float gamma = 1.4f; // ratio of specific heats
const float gasConstant = 1716.3f;
float speedOfSound = Mathf.Sqrt(gamma * gasConstant * T);
float altitudeMach = velocity / speedOfSound;</pre>



<p>Now we can calculate the speed of sound at the plane’s current altitude and use it to find the plane’s Mach number. The speed of sound varies with density, which varies with temperature. The speed of sound is equal to the square root of the ratio of specific heat, called gamma, times the gas constant, gasConstant, times the absolute temperature, T.<sup data-fn="09917b2e-68b9-4e51-880e-4cfe4f9dfc5a"><a href="#09917b2e-68b9-4e51-880e-4cfe4f9dfc5a" id="09917b2e-68b9-4e51-880e-4cfe4f9dfc5a-link">7</a></sup></p>



<p>Once the speed of sound is known, calculating the Mach number is just a simple division.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">const float densityPower = 4.14f;

float rho = SeaLevelDensity * Mathf.Pow(temperatureFactor, densityPower);
float qBar = 0.5f * rho * velocity * velocity;</pre>



<p>And finally the dynamic pressure is calculated from the temperature factor. I’ll admit, I don’t understand why exactly the formula is designed this way. It seems to calculate a density factor, called rho, based solely on the temperature factor, raised to an arbitrary value, densityPower.</p>



<p>The NASA reference provides a similar formula using metric units and using a different arbitrary power. I guess this value is just what results from using customary🤷‍♂️</p>



<p>In any case, this gives us the two air data values we need for the rest of the simulation, dynamic pressure and mach number.</p>



<h2><span id="Table_Interpolation">Table Interpolation</span></h2>



<p>Throughout this flight model, various forms of table lookups are used to determine the aircraft’s behavior. Lookup tables are commonly used in flight simulators to represent complex curves and functions. In fact, Unity’s AnimationCurve class in the previous project is used to define a few lookup tables, such as lift coefficient.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="449" height="500" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/aoa_curve.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This animation curve serves as a 1 dimensional lookup table. The input dimension is AOA and the output value is lift coefficient.</p>



<p>Fortran code doesn’t have the luxury of using AnimationCurves, but a simple table of values with an interpolation function is almost as powerful.</p>



<h2><span id="1D_Lookup_Table">1D Lookup Table</span></h2>



<p>The interpolation functions provided by the textbook look something like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">FUNCTION LOOKUP(ALPHA, RESULT)
    REAL A(-2:9)
C
    DATA A /  .770,.241,-.100,-.416,-.731,-1.053,
    &amp;     	-1.366,-1.646,-1.917,-2.120,-2.248,-2.229 /
C
    S = 0.2*ALPHA
    K = INT(S)
    IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1
    IF(K.GE.9) K=8
    DA = S - FLOAT(K)
    L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA))
    RESULT = A(K) + ABS(DA)*(A(L)-A(K))
    RETURN
END</pre>



<p>This function takes alpha (AOA) and uses it to lookup a value from the table. Alpha is a float that can have any value from [-10, 45]. The table “A” represents values for every 5 degree increment of alpha. Note that Fortran supports arrays with an arbitrary starting index, in this case -2. So this table supports indices in the range [-2, 9].</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="256" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/interpolation_index.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This first step is multiplying alpha by a scaling value to create a float S, which maps alpha to the range [-2, 9]. An integer index K is created from S and then clamped to values <em>one less</em> than the table’s index range. The value DA is calculated as the difference between S and K.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="256" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/interpolation_scaling.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>The value L is calculated to be one index away from K, in the same direction as S. So now we have two indices to the table, K and L, which we use to read two values from the table, A(K) and A(L). DA is then used to blend between these table values and produce the final result.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="500" height="256" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/interpolation_scaling2.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This has two effects. The first is the simplest to understand. If alpha falls within the input range of the table, L and K are selected as the closest table values. For example, if alpha is 12, the two indices would be 2 and 3. The difference between S and K would be less than 1. The values A(2) and A(3) can be read from the table and then interpolated based on the value of DA. This is a fairly normal interpolation calculation.</p>



<p>The other effect is what happens when alpha is outside of the input range of the table. K is guaranteed to not be the first or last index, and L is allowed to be one index off of K. L and K are still valid indices, but the value of DA may be larger than 1. This means when we interpolate between A(L) and A(K), we can extrapolate values for inputs beyond the range of the table.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="256" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/interpolation_scaling3.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>This means our lookup table can handle values outside of it’s input range. But there is still a limitation. As the input value gets further away from the input range, the extrapolated values will become more and more unrealistic. This allows our plane to fly slightly outside the flight envelope of the lookup tables.</p>



<p>I translated this function into C# like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public static float ReadTable(float[] table, int i, int start) {
    return table[i - start];
}

public static (int k0, int k1, float t) GetLookUpIndex(float value, float scale, int min, int max) {
    float scaled = value * scale;
    int K0 = Mathf.Clamp((int)scaled, min, max);
    float T = scaled - K0;
    int K1 = K0 + (int)Mathf.Sign(T);

    return (K0, K1, T);
}

public static float LinearLookup(float value, float scale, float[] table, int min, int max) {
    (int k0, int k1, float kT) = GetLookUpIndex(value, scale, min + 1, max - 1);
    float T = ReadTable(table, k0, min);
    float U = ReadTable(table, k1, min);
    float result = T + Math.Abs(kT) * (U - T);
    return result;
}</pre>



<p>GetLookUpIndex calculates K, L, and DA. These variables are renamed to k0, k1, and kT respectively.</p>



<p>ReadTable is a function that maps array indices to a new range, to support arbitrary starting indices like Fortran. (C# surprisingly supports this feature natively, but who actually uses that?)</p>



<p>LinearLookup reads the k0 and k1 values from the array and performs the interpolation. This allows us to calculate values for any input to the lookup table.</p>



<p>Note that the expression “T + Math.Abs(kT) * (U – T)” is effectively equivalent to Mathf.LerpUnclamped.</p>



<h2><span id="2D_Lookup_Table">2D Lookup Table</span></h2>



<p>All of the above code is needed to perform a one dimensional table lookup. Performing this kind of table lookup with two input dimensions is called a <em>bilinear interpolation</em>. Extending this to two dimensions is not that much more complicated.</p>



<p>The two input values to the table form a two dimensional space. Our input values form a two dimensional point. Instead of selecting two array indices K and L, we need to select four array indices. These four indices form a box around our input point. We simply perform 2 one dimensional lookups, and then interpolate between them to produce the final value.</p>

<p>The 2 one dimensional lookups are marked in red. The final interpolation is marked in blue.</p>



<p>Implementing this in C# is a simple extension of the LinearLookup function:</p>

    (int y0, int y1, float yT) = GetLookUpIndex(yValue, yScale, yMin + 1, yMax - 1);
    float T = ReadTable(table, x0, y0, xMin, yMin);
    float U = ReadTable(table, x0, y1, xMin, yMin);
    float V = T + Math.Abs(xT) * (ReadTable(table, x1, y0, xMin, yMin) - T);
    float W = U + Math.Abs(xT) * (ReadTable(table, x1, y1, xMin, yMin) - U);

    float result = V + (W - V) * Math.Abs(yT);
    return result;
}</pre>



<p>A bilinear interpolation is a very common operation in computer graphics. This is how textures are sampled when placed on 3D geometry.</p>



<p>In the next section, we will see that the engine thrust calculation interpolates between the output of 2 two dimensional tables. Adding this third interpolation means this calculation is now a <em>trilinear interpolation</em>. Interpolating between two tables is how mipmaps are blended together in computer graphics. How neat is that?</p>

<h2><span id="Engine">Engine</span></h2>



<p>The next system we’re going to add is the engine. In my previous project, the engine was dead simple. The player selected a throttle value from [0, 1], which is multiplied by the plane’s total thrust. This works fine for that simulation and even gives us the ability to reduce thrust to zero, so the plane becomes a glider.</p>



<p>However, it is not a realistic simulation of how a jet engine works. In reality, a jet engine still produces some thrust at idle throttle. And there are more factors that affect thrust output than just the throttle setting.</p>



<p>The thrust output of a jet engine decreases with altitude and increases with speed. As altitude increases, the air gets thinner and the jet engine becomes weaker. But as speed increases, dynamic pressure, and thus pressure in the engine, increases and the engine becomes stronger. These two effects need to be considered at the same time to find the thrust output at any given moment.</p>

The horizontal axes are altitude and mach. The vertical axis is engine thrust in lbf</figcaption></figure>



<p>Additionally, we have to consider how jet engines behave in terms of RPM. Just like piston engines (like in a typical car), jet engines have rotating components whose speed increases with throttle. The max RPM of a jet is much higher than a piston engine, however the range of possible RPM is smaller.</p>



<p>The engine in an F-16 has a maximum RPM of about 14,000. This is at the maximum non-afterburner power, called <em>military power</em>. When throttle is reduced to the lowest setting, <em>idle</em>, the RPM falls to about 8,400 RPM or about 60% of the max. Planes of course do not have a transmission like a car does, so this range of RPM also covers the range of thrust needed at all stages of flight.</p>



<p>At idle throttle, the engine runs at 60% max RPM, but only produces 8% of max thrust. At military power, the engine runs at 100% RPM and produces 100% thrust.</p>



<p>Military power is selected when the pilot moves the throttle lever to 77% of it’s max setting. Pushing the throttle beyond that engages the afterburner and produces even more thrust.&nbsp; Setting the throttle lever to 100% is called <em>max power</em>. Max power provides about 57% more thrust than military power. Engine RPM does not increase when using afterburner.</p>



<p>A significant difference between a piston engine and a jet engine is how fast the engine can change RPM. In a car, you can put the transmission in neutral and rev the engine up and down very quickly. But a jet engine is much slower to respond to changes in throttle, regardless of how fast the pilot moves the throttle lever. Generally, it can take several seconds to go from idle to military power or vice versa.</p>



<p>The reasons why jet engines are slower to change RPM are complicated. The change in throttle is managed by a computer to avoid <em>compressor stall</em>, which can cause damage or shut down of the engine. This computer will change engine parameters slowly to avoid compressor stall or any other problems that might be caused by moving the throttle too quickly.</p>



<h2><span id="Power">Power</span></h2>



<p>The behavior of the jet engine is included in the textbook’s flight model. RPM is not explicitly modeled, but is abstracted as power. The pilot chooses a commanded power level and the engine’s current power setting will move towards this over time. This behavior is spring-like, thus a larger difference will cause the current power setting to change faster. It takes about 2 seconds to increase from idle to military power in this flight model.</p>



<p>The first step is to translate the player’s throttle setting into engine power. This is a fairly simple function that maps military power, or 77% throttle, to 50% power. Full afterburner, or 100%, is mapped to 100% power. This is called the “throttle gearing”, but don’t confuse that with a car’s gearing. It’s much simpler.</p>

<p>The player’s throttle setting is used to calculate the commanded power level. The rate of change of engine power also depends on the current power level. This rate is calculated in the functions PDOT and RTAU:</p>

<p>PDOT means power rate of change. In C#, this is translated as:</p>

    	}

    	return rTau;
}</pre>



<p>Power rate of change is the velocity of the power level. The most important line is this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float pdot = T * (p2 - actualPower);</pre>



<p>The velocity depends on the quantity (p2 – actualPower). Let’s call this value deltaPower. A larger deltaPower means a larger velocity. This is scaled by the factor T. The complexity comes from selecting the values for p2 and T. p2 is <em>sometimes</em> the commandPower value. T is <em>sometimes</em> the result of calling CalculateRTau.</p>



<p>These values are selected by the if statements above. These check for two conditions, the commandedPower being above 50%, and the actualPower being above 50%. This is checking whether the afterburner is being requested, and whether the afterburner is currently active. Remember that afterburner starts at 77% throttle, but 50% power.</p>



<p>If the afterburner is not active, then the T is given the value of CalculateRTau. If it is active, then T is given the constant value of 5.0. This matches with our expectation of how the engine’s RPM changes. When not in afterburner, the engine RPM should change slowly, thus power changes slowly. When in afterburner, fuel flow into the afterburner can change quickly, thus power changes quickly.</p>



<p>If we look at the function CalculateRTau, we can see that T can vary in the range [0.1, 1.0]. This depends on deltaPower. When the engine is not in afterburner, T can be at most 1.0. In afterburner, T is 5.0. That means power can change about 5 times faster when in afterburner. When multiplied with deltaPower, pdot can be as large as 250% per second.</p>



<p>The smallest value of T occurs when deltaPower is 50 or greater. This occurs when actualPower is 0 and commanded power is 50%, for example. This will cause the power rate of change to be quite small at only 6% per second. Note that this is simply the instantaneous rate of change. As the actual power rises, T will become larger and the rate of change will increase.</p>



<p>Now the reason why p2 is used instead of commandedPower is to handle the case where commandedPower is over 50% and actualPower is below 50%, or vice versa. The pilot is requesting afterburner, but the engine has not reached military power yet. In that case, deltaPower would become very large and the simulation would change power levels too quickly. To avoid this, an arbitrary constant is chosen that is on the opposite side of 50%, but not very far.</p>



<p>So if the actualPower is 0%, but commandedPower is 100%, p2 is set to the value of 60. This limits deltaPower to a maximum value of 60, instead of 100. And in the case where actualPower is 100% and commandedPower is 0%, deltaPower is limited to -60.</p>



<p>Another behavior of this code is that CalculateRTau does not handle cases where deltaPower is negative. In this case, the function returns 1, the highest value it can return. This means that the power can decrease 10 times faster than it can increase, in the most extreme case.</p>



<p>I don’t know if this is an intentional effect. This may match the behavior of real jet engines, or it may be an oversight by the authors. You can play with the behavior by adding a few calls to Mathf.Abs().</p>



<p>The practical effect of all this is that the plane’s power will lag behind the player’s throttle setting. The pilot needs to make sure that they provide enough time for the power level to change when moving the throttle.</p>



<p>The HUD for this project is mostly reused from the previous flight sim project. But the throttle indicator must be updated, since it can’t show the difference between commanded power and current power.</p>



<p>Previously, the red bar used to show the player’s throttle setting. This worked fine since power lag was not modeled. In this project, the red bar shows the engine’s current power level. I added a triangle marker to show the commanded power setting.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="337" height="309" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/throttle_lag.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>As you move the throttle, you’ll see that current power level changes quickly when there is a large difference from commanded power, and it slows down as it approaches. And when the engine enters afterburner, the power level changes very quickly.</p>



<h2><span id="Thrust">Thrust</span></h2>



<p>Engine power is a fairly abstract variable in this flight model. It doesn’t really correspond to any physical variable. Once we calculate the current power, we use it to find the <em>thrust</em> generated by the engine. Thrust in this flight model is defined in terms of pounds-force (lbf).</p>



<p>Thrust is defined by a group of look up tables. Each table has two dimensions as input, mach number and altitude, and the output is thrust. This gives us different thrust values in different flight conditions. Mach is input as 0.0 to 1.0 mach, in increments of 0.2 mach. Altitude is input as 0 to 50,000 ft, in increments of 10,000 ft. In other words, the table has dimensions 6×6.</p>



<p>The lookup tables in this flight model correspond to idle power, military power, and max power (full afterburner). The engine’s power value is used to perform a third interpolation between the output values of these tables. This makes the thrust calculation a <em>trilinear interpolation</em>.</p>



<p>At idle throttle, the thrust output has 100% influence from the idle table. When the throttle is halfway to military power, the output has 50% influence from the idle table and 50% influence from the military table. Above military power, the output will have some influence from the military power table and the max power table.</p>



<p>The code to read one table in Fortran is given:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">DATA A/  [IDLE TABLE OMITTED]
DATA B/  [MIL TABLE OMITTED]
DATA C/  [MAX TABLE OMITTED]
H=0.0001*ALT
I=INT(H)
IF (I.GE.5) I=4
DH=H-FLOAT(I)
RM=5.*RMACH
M=INT(RM)
IF (M.GE.5) M=4
DM=RM-FLOAT(M)
CDH=1.0-DH</pre>



<p>These parameters are used to perform the table lookups:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">TMIL= S + (T-S)*DM
IF (POW.LT.50.0) THEN
    S= A(I,M)*CDH + A(I+1,M)*DH
    T= A(I,M+1)*CDH + A(I+1,M+1)*DH
    TIDL= S + (T-S)*DM
    THRUST= TIDL + (TMIL-TIDL)*POW/50.0
ELSE
    S= C(I,M)*CDH + C(I+1,M)*DH
    T= C(I,M+1)*CDH + C(I+1,M+1)*DH
    TMAX= S + (T-S)*DM
    THRUST= TMIL + (TMAX-TMIL)*(POW-50.0)*0.02
END IF</pre>



<p>The output of the military power table, TMIL, is always calculated. If the power level is under 50, then the idle table is calculated as well, TIDL. Otherwise the max table is calculated, TMAX. The output of the two table lookups is then interpolated again to calculate the final thrust value, THRUST.</p>



<p>Altogether, this forms a <em>trilinear lookup</em>. To translate this to C#, we call BilinearLookup twice. Then those two results are interpolated based on the power level:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float InterpolateThrust(float thrust1, float thrust2, float power) {
    float result = Mathf.LerpUnclamped(thrust1, thrust2, power * 0.02f);
    return result;
}

float CalculateThrust(float power, float altitude, float rMach) {
	float a = Mathf.Max(0, altitude);
	float m = Mathf.Max(0, rMach);

	float thrust;
	float thrustMilitary = Table.BilinearLookup(a, 0.0001f, m, 5, militaryPowerTable, 0, 6, 0, 6);

	// perform trilinear interpolation
	if (power &lt; 50.0) {
    	float thrustIdle = Table.BilinearLookup(a, 0.0001f, m, 5, idlePowerTable, 0, 6, 0, 6);
    	thrust = InterpolateThrust(thrustIdle, thrustMilitary, power);
	} else {
    	float thrustMax = Table.BilinearLookup(a, 0.0001f, m, 5, maxPowerTable, 0, 6, 0, 6);
    	thrust = InterpolateThrust(thrustMilitary, thrustMax, power - 50.0f);
	}

	return thrust;
}</pre>



<p>The output of this calculation is the plane’s thrust in pounds-force. A simple unit conversion allows us to apply it in newtons to a Unity rigidbody:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void UpdateThrust(float dt) {
    engine.ThrottleCommand = Throttle;
    engine.Mach = Mach;
    engine.Altitude = AltitudeFeet;

    engine.Update(dt);

    Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(new Vector3(0, 0, engine.Thrust * poundsForceToNewtons));
}</pre>



<h2><span id="Forces">Forces</span></h2>



<h2><span id="Lift_force_vs_Normal_force">Lift force vs Normal force</span></h2>



<p>In the previous flight sim project, we calculated a plane’s lift force using the angle of attack and an AnimationCurve. This is the very core of the flight simulator and is what enables flight. The flight model from the textbook <em>does not</em> calculate lift force.</p>



<p>Instead what this flight model calculates is <em>normal force</em>. Recall that lift force is perpendicular to the aircraft’s velocity vector. Normal force is perpendicular to the aircraft’s nose. This distinction is subtle at a low angle of attack, but it becomes significant at a high angle of attack.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_004_Text.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_004_Text.jpg 1920w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_004_Text-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_004_Text-768x432.jpg 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_004_Text-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>



<p>There are two more analogous forces to consider, drag and axial force. Drag is always exactly opposite to the aircraft’s velocity vector while axial force is opposite the aircraft’s nose. Lift and drag are perpendicular to each other and form one set of forces. Normal and axial form another perpendicular set. It’s important to understand that these two sets of forces are equally valid. In fact, they are simply the consequence of choosing different basis vectors for measuring force.</p>



<p>And of course there is the side force that points to the right. These forces are applied on the normal, side, and longitudinal (axial) axes, which are equivalent to the X, Y, and Z axes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_005_Text.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_005_Text.jpg 1920w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_005_Text-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_005_Text-768x432.jpg 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image_005_Text-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>



<p>Imagine all of the forces being produced by the aircraft are summed into a single force vector. This vector would be strongly vertical, because the plane is generating enough lift to support it’s own weight, and somewhat backwards because of drag. When this vector is projected onto the lift vector, the result is the lift force. When it’s projected onto the normal vector, the result is the normal force.</p>



<p>Choosing to represent these forces as lift/drag or normal/axial is arbitrary. The textbook flight model only deals with normal/axial force. I suspect that’s because it’s easier to measure the physical forces when using normal/axial forces in a wind tunnel, since those are always aligned with the plane’s local axes.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="518" height="363" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cl-cn.png" alt=""><figcaption>Lift force in red vs normal force in blue. The stall condition is visible on both forces at 15 degrees AOA. (From aerospaceweb.org<sup data-fn="a8954d70-ab22-4f44-91ba-707ddd1807a0"><a href="#a8954d70-ab22-4f44-91ba-707ddd1807a0" id="a8954d70-ab22-4f44-91ba-707ddd1807a0-link">10</a></sup>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The normal force is very similar to lift for low angles of attack. Lift force peaks at the stall AOA and then declines. Normal force similarly peaks at stall AOA, but it then increases again to peak at 90 AOA, with an even higher force. 90 degrees AOA means the plane is falling downwards belly first, so it’s no longer producing lift over the wings. Instead the normal vector and the drag vector are now aligned. All of the drag force projected onto the normal vector results in a large normal force.</p>



<p>We can calculate the lift force from the normal and axial force. Both normal and axial force may contribute to the lift force, so a complete projection needs to use both. This is the formula:</p><p>



\(\text{Lift} = \text{normal} * \cos{(\text{alpha})} – \text{axial} * \sin{(\text{alpha})}\)



</p><p>When we apply this formula to the normal force from the textbook, this is the result:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2048" height="1030" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart-2048x1030.png" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart-2048x1030.png 2048w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart-1024x515.png 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart-768x386.png 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart-1536x772.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>Oh wait, that’s upside down. Recall that the Z axis points downward in this coordinate system. So a negative Z value is an upwards force. Still though, the chart is a little confusing. I inverted the values below to make it more intuitive.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2048" height="875" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart_inverted-2048x875.png" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart_inverted-2048x875.png 2048w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart_inverted-1024x438.png 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart_inverted-768x328.png 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NormalLiftChart_inverted-1536x657.png 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"></figure>



<p>We can see at 90 degrees AOA, the normal force stays relatively high while the lift force drops to zero. This roughly matches with the chart from aerospaceweb.org above.</p>



<p>Also note that the textbook only provides table values up to 45 degrees AOA. The extrapolation of the table lookup function is what allows us to have normal force values up to 90 degrees AOA. Additionally, the table only goes down to -10 degrees AOA. We can extrapolate further, but the data will be inaccurate by -30 degrees AOA. Large negative AOA values will quickly become inaccurate. So when you’re flying, don’t do that.</p>



<p>Anyways, adding these forces to our simulator is easy. The functions are fairly simple. They are called CZ, CY, and CX. These calculate the coefficients of force on the Z, Y, and X axes respectively. Note that these functions are the <em>coefficients</em>, not the force values themselves. They are used to calculate the force later on.</p>



<p>CZ or the normal coefficient is calculated like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">FUNCTION CZ(ALPHA,BETA,EL)

    S = 0.2*ALPHA
    K = INT(S)
    IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1
    IF(K.GE.9) K=8
    DA = S - FLOAT(K)
    L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA))
    S = A(K) + ABS(DA)*(A(L)-A(K))
    CZ = S*(1-(BETA/57.3)**2) - .19*(EL/25.0)
C
    RETURN
END</pre>



<p>The bulk of this code is just the table interpolation function. The table only depends on ALPHA and the output is S. The only new part here is the last line, where CZ is assigned a value. S is reduced based on the value of BETA and another term is subtracted based on EL, the elevator angle.</p>



<p>This is very easy to translate to C#:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float GetZAxisForceCoefficient(float alpha, float beta, float elevator) {
    	float S = Table.LinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, zAxisTable, -2, 10);
    	float CZ = S * (1 - Mathf.Pow(beta * Mathf.Deg2Rad, 2)) - 0.19f * (elevator / 25.0f);
    	return CZ;
}</pre>



<p>CY or the side coefficient is even simpler. It doesn’t even have a lookup table. Side force is perpendicular to both normal and axial force.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">FUNCTION CY(BETA,AIL,RDR)
    CY = -.02*BETA + .021*(AIL/20.0) + .086*(RDR/30.0)
C
    RETURN
END</pre>



<p>Side coefficient depends solely on beta, aileron angle, and rudder angle.</p>



<p>In C#:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float GetYAxisForceCoefficient(float beta, float aileron, float rudder) {

    return CY;
}</pre>



<p>CX or the axial coefficient is basically what creates drag on the aircraft. This function is a little more complicated since it performs a bilinear interpolation, with alpha and elevator angle as the inputs.</p>

    W = A(K,N) + ABS(DA)*(A(L,N)-A(K,N))
    CX = V + (W-V)*ABS(DE)
C
    RETURN
END</pre>



<p>Thanks to the table lookup functions, this is easy to translate to C#:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float GetXAxisForceCoefficient(float alpha, float elevator) {
    float result = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, elevator, 1f / 12f, xAxisTable, -2, 9, -2, 2);
    return result;
}</pre>



<p>These three functions define all of the linear force coefficients applied to the aircraft during flight. None of these will rotate the aircraft. That is handled by a different and more complicated set of calculations.</p>



<h2><span id="Moments">Moments</span></h2>



<p>Moment is another word for torque. (There is a subtle difference, but who cares?🤓) The F-16 flight model uses another set of look up tables to compute the moment for the aircraft.</p>



<p>In the previous flight sim, torque was not actually calculated. Instead, the flight model calculates the angular acceleration directly. This ignores the mass of the plane when applying the torque. This is a simplification. A more realistic flight model would take into account the mass of the aircraft when applying torque.</p>



<p>Note that mass is not sufficient to model rotations. When it comes to rotation, the analogy to mass is called <em>moment of inertia</em>. Just like mass is the property that measures an object’s resistance to force, moment of inertia is the resistance to torque. But unlike mass, moment of inertia can differ on all 3 axes. This means a torque on the X axis will result in a different angular acceleration than the same torque on the Y axis, for example.</p>



<p>Moment of inertia is a four-dimensional value, called AXX, AYY, AZZ, and AXZ in the textbook code. This flight model contains it’s own calculations for angular velocity using these moment of inertia values.</p>



<p>The flight model contains several functions that calculate the moment of the aircraft. The three basic functions are called CM, CL, and CN. These calculate the moments around the Y, X, and Z axes, AKA pitch, roll, and yaw, respectively. (L stands for longitudinal, which is the X axis. N stands for normal, which is the Z axis. M stands for… something)</p>



<p>These functions are all simple look up tables. CM (pitch) uses alpha and elevator angle as the input. CL (roll) and CN (yaw) use alpha and beta as the input. CM is basically the same as the other lookup table functions. CL and CN are similar to each other since they both use a symmetric table. This is because the plane is symmetric on the lateral axis, so a single table can represent the left and right sides. Their final output is then multiplied by the sign of beta.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">FUNCTION CL(ALPHA,BETA)
    REAL A(-2:9,0:6)
    DATA A/    [DATA OMITTED]

    S = 0.2*ALPHA
    K = INT(S)
    IF(K.LE.-2) K=-1
    IF(K.GE.9) K=8
    DA = S - FLOAT(K)
    L = K + INT(SIGN(1.1,DA))
    S = .2*ABS(BETA)
    M = INT(S)

    T = A(K,M)
    U = A(K,N)
    V = T + ABS(DA)*(A(L,M) - T)
    W = U + ABS(DA)*(A(L,N) - U)
    DUM = V + (W - V) * ABS(DB)
    CL = DUM + SIGN(1.0,BETA)

    RETURN
END</pre>



<p>Note that there is an error in the textbook code. The final operation “CL = DUM + SIGN(…)” should use multiplication instead of addition. Otherwise this operation doesn’t make any sense.</p>



<p>When translated into C#:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float GetYAxisMoment(float alpha, float elevator) {
    float result = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, elevator, 1f / 12f, yMomentTable, -2, 9, -2, 2);
    return result;
}

float GetXAxisMoment(float alpha, float beta) {
    float DUM = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, Mathf.Abs(beta), 0.2f, xMomentTable, -2, 9, 0, 7);
    float CL = DUM * Mathf.Sign(beta);

    return CL;
}

float GetZAxisMoment(float alpha, float beta) {
    float DUM = Table.BilinearLookup(alpha, 0.2f, Mathf.Abs(beta), 0.2f, zMomentTable, -2, 9, 0, 7);
    float CL = DUM * Mathf.Sign(beta);

    return CL;
}</pre>



<p>Notice that CM takes “elevator” as an argument, so this is where the elevator’s turning effect is calculated. But CL and CN do not take any control surface as an argument. These functions only apply moment based on alpha and beta. For example, at high angles of sideslip, the plane tends to roll. On real planes, this is caused by wing sweep. In this flight model, it’s caused by the CL function.</p>



<p>Elevators are applied in CM, but rudder and ailerons are not. Those are actually handled by four more functions, called DLDA, DLDR, DNDA, and DNDR. The names are cryptic, but it just means which axis is affected from which control surface.</p>



<p>The “L” stands for longitudinal, so DLDA is the longitudinal moment from the ailerons, A. DLDR is the longitudinal moment from the rudder, R. The “N” stands for normal, so those functions are the normal axis moment from aileron and rudders.</p>



<p>These four functions are eventually summed with the CL and CN functions above. These functions mean that roll is affected by aileron and rudder, and yaw is affected by aileron and rudder.</p>



<h2><span id="Damping">Damping</span></h2>



<p>There is one more set of coefficients that must be calculated. These are the damping coefficients and they depend solely on alpha. These values are stored in 9 distinct 1D lookup tables. The code for these lookups is the same as the other lookup code.</p>



<p>These values are stored in an array of length 9 called D.</p>



<p>Damping is the moment that opposes the angular velocity of an aircraft, essentially angular drag. They affect the other moment values in somewhat complex ways. For example, some of them are combined with the plane’s current bank value to affect the roll moment.</p>



<p>What isn’t clear is what the damping values actually represent. In the C# code, I added these comments explaining their meaning:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">//  D[0] = CXq
//  D[1] = CYr
//  D[2] = CYp
//  D[3] = CZq
//  D[4] = Clr
//  D[5] = Clp
//  D[6] = Cmq
//  D[7] = Cnr
//  D[8] = Cnp</pre>



<p>Hope this helps!</p>



<p>The best I can tell is that “CXq” is the damping moment on the X axis relative to <em>q</em>, which is the angular velocity around the Y axis. The other damping values follow this naming scheme.</p>



<p>This is yet another example of aerodynamics texts with poor variable names.</p>



<h2><span id="Complete_Flight_Model">Complete Flight Model</span></h2>



<p>With all of the individual coefficients defined, we can now implement the complete flight model for the F-16. This flight model actually contains it’s own physics integrator. The text provides it’s own code for calculating velocity and angular velocity from the aerodynamic forces.</p>



<p>Strictly speaking, we don’t need to use this code since Unity allows us to provide those same forces and then performs the physics calculation for us. Setting the mass is easy enough, we just have to convert slugs to kilograms. The textbook code calculates acceleration by dividing the force by the aircraft mass. We simply omit this division, convert the forces to newtons, and apply it to the rigidbody.</p>



<p>However the moment of inertia is more complicated. The textbook provides the 4 dimensional MOI values, but Unity expects a 3 dimensional inertia tensor. That inertia tensor is then rotated by a quaternion called “inertiaTensorRotation”. I have no idea how to calculate this quaternion from the textbook’s provided value.</p>



<p>Therefore, we continue to use the textbook’s code for applying moment and simply apply the resulting angular acceleration to the rigidbody.</p>



<p>The Fortran code for the flight model is concise, yet scrutable. The first step is to read the plane’s current state from the input state vector X. This is simply an array that contains all of the relevant data for this frame.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">VT= X(1); ALPHA= X(2)*RTOD; BETA= X(3)*RTOD
PHI=X(4); THETA= X(5); PSI= X(6)
P= X(7); Q= X(8); R= X(9); ALT= X(12); POW= X(13)</pre>



<p>VT is the plane’s velocity in feet per second.</p>



<p>ALPHA and BETA are the plane’s AOA and AOS in degrees. RTOD is the constant to convert from radians to degrees.</p>



<p>PHI, THETA, and PSI are the plane’s roll, pitch, and yaw in radians.</p>



<p>P, Q, and R are the plane’s angular velocities (or roll rate, pitch rate, and yaw rate) in radians per second.</p>



<p>ALT is the altitude in feet.</p>



<p>POW is the current power level of the engine (0 – 100).</p>



<p>The air data computer (ADC) and engine model are then called using these variables:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CALL ADC(VT,ALT,AMACH,QBAR); CPOW= TGEAR(THTL)
XD(13) = PDOT(POW,CPOW); T= THRUST(POW,ALT,AMACH)</pre>



<p>The ADC function populates the variables AMACH and QBAR, which are the altitude mach and dynamic pressure.</p>



<p>CPOW is the pilot’s commanded power setting. That is, the power level returned by calling the throttle gear function, TGEAR, on the throttle lever position, THTL.</p>



<p>The array XD is the output state vector. Specifically, it holds the calculated derivative for every input value. XD(13) is set to the value calculated by PDOT, which is the velocity of the power level.</p>



<p>T is the thrust in pounds-force output by the engine, calculated using the power level, altitude, and altitude mach.</p>



<p>Then the aerodynamic coefficients are calculated using the force and moment functions:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">  CXT = CX (ALPHA,EL)
  CYT = CY (BETA,AIL,RDR)
  CZT = CZ (ALPHA,BETA,EL)
  DAIL= AIL/20.0; DRDR= RDR/30.0
  CLT = CL(ALPHA,BETA) + DLDA(ALPHA,BETA)*DAIL
 &amp;                 	+ DLDR(ALPHA,BETA)*DRDR
  CMT = CM(ALPHA,EL)
  CNT = CN(ALPHA,BETA) + DNDA(ALPHA,BETA)*DAIL
 &amp;                 	+ DNDR(ALPHA,BETA)*DRDR</pre>



<p>The values CXT, CYT, and CZT are the coefficients on the X, Y, and Z axes, calculated by calling their respective coefficient functions.</p>



<p>EL, AIL, and RDR are the current position of the elevators, ailerons, and rudder in degrees. DAIL and DRDR are simply the angle of these surfaces divided by the max angle. Their range is [-1, 1].</p>



<p>The values CLT, CMT, and CNT are the moment coefficients on the longitudinal, m’lateral, and normal axes. Note that CM calculates moment caused by the elevator position. The effects of the other control surfaces are calculated in the DLDA, DLDR, DNDA, and DNDR functions.</p>



<p>Then some other values are calculated and the damping coefficients are added to the above values:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">TVT= 0.5/VT; B2V= B*TVT; CQ= CBAR*Q*TVT
CALL DAMP(ALPHA,D)
CXT= CXT + CQ * D(1)
CYT= CYT + B2V * ( D(2)*R + D(3)*P )
CZT= CZT + CQ * D(4)
CLT= CLT + B2V * ( D(5)*R + D(6)*P )
CMT= CMT + CQ * D(7) + CZT * (XCGR-XCG)
CNT= CNT + B2V*(D(8)*R + D(9)*P) - CYT*(XCGR-XCG) * CBAR/B</pre>



<p>I’ll be honest, I straight up don’t know what any of these values are or why they are being applied like this. The effect appears to be angular damping (AKA angular drag) which opposes the plane’s angular velocity.</p>



<p>The value (XCGR – XCG) is the center of gravity reference minus the current center of gravity. This allows us to alter the center of gravity of the aircraft and see how that affects stability.</p>



<p>XCGR is 0.35 for this flight model. XCG is 0.35 by default. XCG is the normalized position of the center of gravity, with a possible range of [0, 1]. This means that when XCG is 0.35, the term (XCGR – XCG) becomes zero and the aircraft is balanced around it’s center of gravity.</p>



<p>The center of gravity term affects CMT and CNT, which are the pitch and yaw axes. The roll axis is not affected.</p>



<p>The next block of code is fun:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CBTA = COS(X(3)); U=VT*COS(X(2))*CBTA
V= VT * SIN(X(3)); W=VT*SIN(X(2))*CBTA
STH = SIN(THETA); CTH= COS(THETA); SPH= SIN(PHI)
CPH = COS(PHI) ; SPSI= SIN(PSI); CPSI= COS(PSI)
QS = QBAR * S ; QSB= QS * B; RMQS= QS/MASS
GCTH = GD * CTH ; QSPH= Q * SPH
AY = RMQS*CYT ; AZ= RMQS * CZT</pre>



<p>This writhing mass of arithmetic is simply pre-calculating a lot of the values that are used to calculate the aerodynamic forces. Some of these values are used in multiple places, so to avoid repeating them, they are pulled out of those equations and placed here.</p>



<p>This is essentially the “common subexpression” optimization pass of a compiler, but applied manually.</p>



<p>The important variables are U, V, and W, which is the plane’s velocity on the X, Y, and Z axes respectively.</p>



<p>QS is QBAR (dynamic pressure) times S (wing area).</p>



<p>Now the aerodynamic forces are calculated:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">UDOT = R*V - Q*W - GD*STH + (QS * CXT + T)/MASS
VDOT = P*W - R*U + GCTH * SPH + AY
WDOT = Q*U - P*V + GCTH * CPH + AZ
DUM = (U*U + W*W)
xd(1) = (U*UDOT + V*VDOT + W*WDOT)/VT
xd(2) = (U*WDOT - W*UDOT) / DUM
xd(3) = (VT*VDOT- V*XD(1)) * CBTA / DUM</pre>



<p>Once again, I don’t actually understand what I’m reading. UDOT etc are the accelerations on each axis. These values are then used to update the output state vector xd(1), xd(2), and xd(3), which are the VT, ALPHA, and BETA that will be used in the next frame.</p>



<p>It appears that this flight model is calculating the change in alpha and beta directly from the change in velocity. This is not necessary in C#, since we can calculate alpha and beta fresh in each frame.</p>



<p>But I don’t fully understand how UDOT is calculated. R and Q are angular velocities, so multiplying them with linear velocity doesn’t make any sense. Perhaps this is some physics equation that I’m not familiar with.</p>



<p>GD * STH is the gravity acceleration times sin(theta). This is simply how gravity is applied. When the plane is level (theta = 0), sin(theta) is 0. The plane experiences no gravity acceleration on the X axis (the forward axis). When the plane is pointed straight down, sin(theta) = 1, so the plane experiences the full force of gravity pulling on the X axis.</p>



<p>A similar calculation is made for every axis.</p>



<p>For UDOT, the final term is (QS * CXT + T) / MASS. This is the coefficient CXT plus the thrust from the engine, divided by mass. VDOT and WDOT have similar final terms, made more difficult to read by the common subexpression optimization.</p>



<p>Ignoring the other terms, the 3 accelerations can be written:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">UDOT = (QS * CXT + T)/MASS
VDOT = AY
WDOT = AZ</pre>



<p>Then the variables can be expanded and rewritten:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">UDOT = (QBAR * S * CXT + T) / MASS
VDOT = (QBAR * S * CYT)     / MASS
WDOT = (QBAR * S * CZT)     / MASS</pre>



<p>This is simply the force coefficient times QBAR (dynamic pressure) times S (wing area). Then thrust is added to the X axis. This is how all forces are applied to the aircraft.</p>



<p>Recall the lift equation from my previous project:</p><p>



\(L=\frac12\times A\times\rho\times C_L\times v^2\)



</p><ul>
<li>L is the resulting lift force</li>



<li>A is the surface area</li>



<li>ρ (rho) is the air density</li>



<li>C<sub>L</sub> is the coefficient of lift</li>



<li>v is the velocity</li>
</ul>



<p>The surface area A is equivalent to the wing area S in the Fortran code. C<sub>L</sub> is equivalent to the variables CXT, CYT, or CZT. The factor ρ * v<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to QBAR. Thus we are essentially calculating a lift force on all three axes. But remember that we are specifically calculating normal force, not lift force.</p>



<p>The roll, pitch, and yaw state vectors are then updated:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">xd(4) = P + (STH/CTH)*(QSPH + R*CPH)
xd(5) = Q*CPH - R*SPH
xd(6) = (QSPH + R*CPH)/CTH</pre>



<p>Once again, these equations make zero sense to me🤷‍♂️. It’s important for the Fortran code, but we will be calculating roll, pitch, and yaw differently in C#.</p>



<p>Aerodynamic moment is about to be calculated. However this depends on the moment of inertia values and some more values derived from those:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">PARAMETER (AXX=9496.0, AYY= 55814.0, AZZ=63100.0, AXZ= 982.0)
PARAMETER (AXZS=AXZ**2, XPQ=AXZ*(AXX-AYY+AZZ),GAM=AXX*AZZ-AXZ**2)
PARAMETER (XQR= AZZ*(AZZ-AYY)+AXZS, ZPQ=(AXX-AYY)*AXX+AXZS)
PARAMETER ( YPR= AZZ - AXX )</pre>



<p>Now the aerodynamic moment is calculated:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ROLL  = QSB*CLT
PITCH = QS *CBAR*CMT
YAW   = QSB*CNT
PQ    = p*Q
QR    = Q*R
QHX   = Q*HX
xd(7) = ( XPQ*PQ - XQR*QR + AZZ*ROLL + AXZ*(YAW + QHX) )/GAM
xd(8) = ( YPR*P*R - AXZ*(P**2 - R**2) + PITCH - R*HX )/AYY
xd(9) = ( ZPQ*PQ - XPQ*QR + AXZ*ROLL + AXX*(YAW + QHX) )/GAM</pre>



<p>There’s a lot of stuff going on here. The output state vectors are updated using the moment of inertia values as well as HX, which is the angular momentum of the spinning engine mass. I don’t know enough about physics to fully understand why these equations are defined like this.</p>



<p>But we can at least see how the moment coefficients are used if we expand the ROLL, PITCH, and YAW variables:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">ROLL  = QBAR * S * B    * CLT
PITCH = QBAR * S * CBAR * CMT
YAW   = QBAR * S * B    * CNT</pre>



<p>ROLL and YAW depend on B, the wingspan of the plane. Pitch depends on CBAR, the mean aerodynamic chord.</p>



<p>The final step is to calculate the world space position of the aircraft. Since we are using Unity rigidbodies to implement the flight model, this step is not translated to C#. But for reference:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">T1= SPH * CPSI; T2= CPH * STH; T3= SPH * SPSI
S1= CTH * CPSI; S2= CTH * SPSI; S3= T1 * STH - CPH * SPSI
S4= T3 * STH + CPH * CPSI; S5= SPH * CTH; S6= T2*CPSI + T3
S7= T2 * SPSI - T1; S8= CPH * CTH

xd(10) = U * S1 + V * S3 + W * S6 ! North speed
xd(11) = U * S2 + V * S4 + W * S7 ! East speed
xd(12) = U * STH -V * S5 - W * S8 ! Vertical speed

AN = -AZ/GD; ALAT= AY/GD;</pre>



<p>Now we can start translating this into C# using Unity’s physics engine to replace some parts.</p>



<p>A lot of the code can be reused from the previous flight sim project. Using it for this new flight model only requires some conversion into customary units and back. The main class that controls everything is Plane. This class contains instances of the AirDataComputer, Engine, and Aerodynamics, which is where the translated Fortran code lives.</p>



<p>One simplification can be made since we are using Unity physics. We do not need to calculate the acceleration of the aircraft manually. That can be done automatically by the physics engine. However, the moment calculation needs to be copied more or less directly from the textbook.</p>



<p>The air data computer needs to be called:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void UpdateAirData() {
    float speed = LocalVelocity.magnitude;  // m/s
    float speedFeet = speed * metersToFeet;
    AltitudeFeet = Rigidbody.position.y * metersToFeet;

    airData = airDataComputer.CalculateAirData(speedFeet, AltitudeFeet);
}</pre>



<p>Then the engine needs to be updated and the thrust force applied:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void UpdateThrust(float dt) {
    engine.ThrottleCommand = Throttle;
    engine.Mach = Mach;
    engine.Altitude = AltitudeFeet;

    engine.Update(dt);

    Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(new Vector3(0, 0, engine.Thrust * poundsForceToNewtons));
}</pre>



<p>For the aerodynamics class, a struct with all relevant aerodynamic state is passed, similar to the state vector in the Fortran code.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public struct AerodynamicState {
    public Vector4 inertiaTensor;
    public Vector3 velocity;
    public Vector3 angularVelocity;
    public AirData airData;
    public float altitude;
    public float alpha;
    public float beta;
    public float xcg;
    public ControlSurfaces controlSurfaces;
}</pre>



<p>This is populated by the Plane class, which also handles unit conversions:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">AerodynamicState currentState = new AerodynamicState {
    inertiaTensor = inertiaTensor,
    velocity = ConvertVectorToAerospace(LocalVelocity) * metersToFeet,
    angularVelocity = ConvertAngleToAerospace(LocalAngularVelocity),
    airData = airData,
    alpha = alpha,
    beta = beta,
    xcg = centerOfGravityPosition,
    controlSurfaces = ControlSurfaces
};

var newState = aerodynamics.CalculateAerodynamics(currentState);</pre>



<p>All of the flight model code is located inside the Aerodynamics class.</p>



<p>First step is to call the aerodynamic coefficient functions from above:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Vector3 GetForceCoefficient(float alpha, float beta, float aileron, float rudder, float elevator) {
    return new Vector3(
        GetXAxisForceCoefficient(alpha, elevator),
        GetYAxisForceCoefficient(beta, aileron, rudder),
        GetZAxisForceCoefficient(alpha, beta, elevator)
    );
}

Vector3 GetMomentCoefficient(float alpha, float beta, float elevator) {
    return new Vector3(
        GetXAxisMomentCoefficient(alpha, beta),
        GetYAxisMomentCoefficient(alpha, elevator),
        GetZAxisMomentCoefficient(alpha, beta)
    );
}

...

public AerodynamicForces CalculateAerodynamics(AerodynamicState currentState) {
    Vector3 forceCoefficient = GetForceCoefficient(
        currentState.alpha, currentState.beta,
        currentState.controlSurfaces.aileron, currentState.controlSurfaces.rudder, currentState.controlSurfaces.elevator
    );

    Vector3 momentCoefficient = GetMomentCoefficient(
        currentState.alpha, currentState.beta, currentState.controlSurfaces.elevator
    );
}</pre>



<p>Then we calculate the damping values. This function simply performs the 9 table lookups.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">void CalculateDampingValues(float alpha) {
    float S = 0.2f * alpha;
    int K = Mathf.Clamp((int)S, -1, 8);

    float DA = S - K;
    int L = K + (int)Mathf.Sign(DA);

    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 9; i++) {
        dampingTable[i] = ReadDampTable(dampTable, K, i) + Math.Abs(DA) * (ReadDampTable(dampTable, L, i) - ReadDampTable(dampTable, K, i));
    }
}</pre>



<p>Then the variables we need later are calculated:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// calculate variables
float P = currentState.angularVelocity.x;   // roll rate
float Q = currentState.angularVelocity.y;   // pitch rate
float R = currentState.angularVelocity.z;   // yaw rate

float airspeed = Mathf.Max(1, currentState.velocity.magnitude);
float TVT = 0.5f / airspeed;

float B2V = wingSpanFt * TVT;
float CQ = CBAR * Q * TVT;

float DAIL = currentState.controlSurfaces.aileron / 20.0f;
float DRDR = currentState.controlSurfaces.rudder / 30.0f;

float QS = currentState.airData.qBar * wingAreaFtSquared;
float QSB = QS * wingSpanFt;</pre>



<p>Then damping is applied to the force and moment coefficients:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// damping
float CXT = forceCoefficient.x + CQ * dampingTable[0];
float CYT = forceCoefficient.y + B2V * (dampingTable[1] * R + dampingTable[2] * P);
float CZT = forceCoefficient.z + CQ * dampingTable[3];

float CLT = momentCoefficient.x + B2V * (dampingTable[4] * R + dampingTable[5] * P);
CLT += GetDLDA(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DAIL;
CLT += GetDLDR(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DRDR;
float CMT = momentCoefficient.y + CQ * dampingTable[6] + CZT * (XCGR - currentState.xcg);
float CNT = momentCoefficient.z + B2V * (dampingTable[7] * R + dampingTable[8] * P) - CYT * (XCGR - currentState.xcg) * CBAR / wingSpanFt;
CNT += GetDNDA(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DAIL;
CNT += GetDNDR(currentState.alpha, currentState.beta) * DRDR;</pre>



<p>Note that the damping array in Fortran is 1 based, while the same array in C# is 0 based.</p>



<p>Forces are calculated from the force coefficients. Since we are using Unity’s physics to apply gravity, the gravity terms are not included here. The force from engine thrust is applied outside of this class. And force is applied to a rigidbody, so acceleration does not need to be calculated manually. So the force calculations are now very simple:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// forces
// Acceleration in original text. Need to calculate force instead of acceleration
float UDOT = QS * CXT;
float VDOT = QS * CYT;
float WDOT = QS * CZT;</pre>



<p>Moments are calculated using largely the same code as the textbook:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// moments
float ROLL = QSB * CLT;
float PITCH = QS * CBAR * CMT;
float YAW = QSB * CNT;
float PQ = P * Q;
float QR = Q * R;
float QHX = Q * HX;

// calculate inertia values
float AXX = currentState.inertiaTensor.x;
float AYY = currentState.inertiaTensor.y;
float AZZ = currentState.inertiaTensor.z;
float AXZ = currentState.inertiaTensor.w;

float AXZS = AXZ * AXZ;
float XPQ = AXZ * (AXX - AYY + AZZ);
float GAM = AXX * AZZ - AXZS;
float XQR = AZZ * (AZZ - AYY) + AXZS;
float ZPQ = (AZZ - AYY) * AXX + AXZS;
float YPR = AZZ - AXX;

float rollAccel  = ((XPQ * PQ)	- (XQR * QR) + (AZZ * ROLL) + (AXZ * (YAW + QHX))) / GAM;
float pitchAccel = ((YPR * P * R) - (AXZ * (P * P - R * R))   + PITCH - (R * HX))	/ AYY;
float yawAccel   = ((ZPQ * PQ)	- (XPQ * QR) + (AXZ * ROLL) + (AXX * (YAW + QHX))) / GAM;</pre>



<p>Finally, the force and angular acceleration is returned:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public AerodynamicForces CalculateAerodynamics(AerodynamicState currentState) {
    ...
    result.force = new Vector3(UDOT, VDOT, WDOT);
    result.angularAcceleration = new Vector3(rollAccel, pitchAccel, yawAccel);

    return result;
}</pre>



<p>Then in the Plane class, the force and angular acceleration can be applied to the rigidbody:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// aeroForces in pounds
var forces = ConvertVectorToUnity(aeroForces) * poundsForceToNewtons;
Rigidbody.AddRelativeForce(forces);

// aeroAngularAcceleration changes angular velocity directly
Vector3 avCorrection = ConvertAngleToUnity(aeroAngularAcceleration);
Rigidbody.AddRelativeTorque(avCorrection, ForceMode.Acceleration);
lastAngularAcceleration = avCorrection;</pre>



<p>The plane is now able to fly. But if you try flying it right now, you will quickly find that it is impossible to fly by hand.</p>



<h2><span id="Stability">Stability</span></h2>



<p>One important aerodynamic effect not modeled in my previous flight sim project is <em>stability</em>. Stability is the behavior of an aircraft when it’s disturbed from it’s flight path. More specifically, it’s how the aircraft behaves when it’s nose vector doesn’t match it’s velocity vector. Stability is the force that pulls the nose vector back towards the velocity vector.</p>



<p>For most aircraft, stability is created by the stabilizers in the tail. A stabilizer is simply a small airfoil (wing). Even without the pilot giving input, the stabilizers act like the fins of a dart. As the plane increases it’s Angle of Attack, the horizontal stabilizer will produce a lift force at the rear of the plane. This creates a torque that pulls the plane’s nose back towards the velocity vector, thus reducing the AOA. Likewise, the vertical stabilizers will create a torque that reduces Angle of Slip.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_001.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_001.jpg 1920w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_001-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_001-768x432.jpg 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_001-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>



<p>Keep in mind that stability depends on AOA, just as lift does. When the aircraft has a large AOA, the wings produce lift, which brings the velocity vector towards the nose vector. The stabilizers create torque which brings the nose vector towards the velocity vector. These two forces balance out somewhere and the aircraft will take a new attitude with a new velocity.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_002.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_002.jpg 1920w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_002-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_002-768x432.jpg 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_002-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>



<p>However, the aircraft needs to maintain a non-zero AOA to create enough lift to fly straight and level. How does it maintain this AOA when stability works to reduce AOA to zero? The stabilizers can be <em>trimmed</em> to hold a specific AOA. This means that the stabilizers produce zero torque at this particular non-zero AOA. In some planes this must be done manually by the pilot, but in the F-16 this is done automatically by the FCS.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_003.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_003.jpg 1920w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_003-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_003-768x432.jpg 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image-Sequence_003-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>



<p>The two forces of lift and stability combine to produce the “feel” of an aircraft’s controls. The tendency for the nose to be pulled towards the velocity vector is called <em>positive stability</em>. Most non-fighter aircraft are designed to have positive stability to maximize safety and ease of flying.</p>



<p>But fighter aircraft like the F-16 are different. These aircraft are often designed to have <em>neutral</em> or even <em>negative stability</em>. Neutral stability means that the aircraft will hold it’s current attitude. Negative stability means that the aircraft will rotate even further away from the velocity vector, at an increasing rate.</p>



<p>The previous flight sim does not model this at all. There is no torque that changes the plane’s attitude except for the steering force. So the behavior is best described as neutrally stable.</p>



<p>This F-16 flight model does include stability. But keep in mind that the real F-16 was designed to have <em>relaxed static stability</em>. This means that it is positively stable, but weakly so. This makes the aircraft more maneuverable and better at retaining energy while turning. But flying an aircraft like this is difficult or even impossible for a human pilot. The plane will depart from steady flight from the smallest stick input or wind gust. The only way a human can handle an aircraft like this during long and stressful missions is with a computerized <em>flight control system</em>.</p>



<h2><span id="Flight_Control_System">Flight Control System</span></h2>



<p>A <em>flight control system</em> (FCS) is a computer located between the flight stick and the control surfaces. This computer translates the pilot’s input on the flight stick into control surface movement. It can react to disturbances in the plane’s attitude more quickly and precisely than a human can.</p>



<p>In my previous flight sim project, the control surfaces were purely cosmetic. The actual method used to turn the vehicle was by applying torque directly to the center of mass. That torque was calculated to create a certain amount of angular acceleration without exceeding the plane’s turn rate limit.</p>



<p>For example, the plane had a turn rate on the pitch axis of 60 degrees per second and an acceleration of 120 degrees per second per second. The plane’s turn rate never leaves the range [-60, 60]. Actually, no torque is ever calculated. Unity provides a function to apply angular acceleration directly, ignoring moment of inertia. I chose this behavior to make it easy to both understand the code and to fly the plane.</p>



<p>But this F-16 simulator does depend on the position of the control surfaces. Instead of specifying the acceleration directly, this simulator specifies the torque (moment) and calculates the resulting acceleration. This is more accurate to how serious simulators work and how real planes fly, but this makes controlling the plane more difficult.</p>



<p>The steering system in the previous flight sim project was essentially a perfect FCS that could always achieve the turn rate chosen by the pilot. This is helped by the fact that that simulator does not model aerodynamic stability or instability at all. Spinning out of control was simply not possible.</p>



<p>This F-16 simulator is more difficult to control both because of the more accurate control surfaces and because of the modeled stability. You can actually try to fly this F-16 manually, by disabling the FCS in the config menu.</p>



<p>You will quickly find that the F-16 is almost impossible to fly manually. Every small disturbance from straight and level flight will create small torques that turn your plane unexpectedly. If you try to correct it with the control stick, you will almost certainly overcorrect and send the plane into a new and exciting attitude. This is called <em>pilot induced oscillation</em>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="599" height="400" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/f-16_pio.jpg" alt=""><figcaption>PIO was a problem on the real F-16. Photo of an F-16 test flight (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAp4RtGKbHE">Source</a>)</figcaption></figure>



<p>It simply isn’t possible for a human to react quickly and precisely enough to fly this aircraft. You may be able to fly straight and level with some effort, but you will quickly lose control if you attempt any maneuver. This is indeed a property of the real F-16.</p>



<p>The textbook provides no Fortran code for the FCS. From here on out, it’s my own original code.</p>



<h2><span id="PID_Controllers">PID Controllers</span></h2>



<p>The steering system from the previous project cannot be reused. The solution is to use PID controllers, a topic I’ve covered on this blog before.<sup data-fn="7c868a94-be19-4150-96d5-52380d04525c"><a href="#7c868a94-be19-4150-96d5-52380d04525c" id="7c868a94-be19-4150-96d5-52380d04525c-link">11</a></sup></p>



<p>To be more specific, steering in the previous flight sim was easy because we could read the angular velocity of the aircraft and apply a torque that directly countered any undesired movement. This F-16 flight model does not allow us to apply torques directly. We can only set the angle of the control surfaces. This is the problem that PID controllers are good at solving.</p>



<p>Adding the PID controllers is simple. The pilot’s control input is used to select a target angular velocity for the plane, for the 3 axes of rotation. This is given to three independent PID controllers. The output of the PID controllers set the target position for the control surface.</p>



<p>The control surface positions are then passed into the flight model inside AerodynamicState.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Vector3 targetAV = Vector3.Scale(controlInput, steeringSpeed * steeringSpeedFactor);

var accel = lastAngularAcceleration * Mathf.Rad2Deg * dt;

controlSurfaceTarget = new Vector3(
    pitchController.Calculate(dt, av.x, accel.x, targetAV.x),
    -yawController.Calculate(dt, av.y, accel.y, targetAV.y),
    rollController.Calculate(dt, av.z, accel.z, targetAV.z)
);

var current = ControlSurfaces;

ControlSurfaces = new ControlSurfaces(
    Utilities.MoveTo(current.elevator, controlSurfaceTarget.x, elevatorSpeed, dt, -elevatorRange, elevatorRange),
    Utilities.MoveTo(current.rudder,   controlSurfaceTarget.y, rudderSpeed,   dt, -rudderRange, rudderRange),
    Utilities.MoveTo(current.aileron,  controlSurfaceTarget.z, aileronSpeed,  dt, -aileronRange, aileronRange)
);

...

AerodynamicState currentState = new AerodynamicState {
    controlSurfaces = ControlSurfaces
};

var newState = aerodynamics.CalculateAerodynamics(currentState);</pre>



<p>Here the PIDs are named “pitchController”, “yawController”, and “rollController”. They are all tuned separately to handle a single axis.</p>



<p>When the player releases the stick, the PID controllers will attempt to hold an angular velocity of zero. This makes the aircraft feel like it’s neutrally stable. This also acts as a way to trim the aircraft, so that level flight can be maintained without needing to constantly pull the stick. The PID controller will detect an undesired rotation and move the elevators at a slight angle to counter it.</p>



<p>These PID controllers only add a small amount of complexity to the code, but they achieve similar results as the perfect FCS from the previous project. But there are still limitations that prevent it from being a perfect FCS.</p>



<p>First, the PID controllers must be tuned. The output has to be strong enough to quickly respond to pilot inputs, while avoiding oscillation. This is of course a limitation of any PID control system.</p>



<p>Second, the control surfaces move at a finite speed. This means that it will take some time for the control surface to match the FCS’s commands. So the commands will be imperfectly applied to the aircraft.</p>



<p>Third, unlike the previous flight sim, the three axes of rotation are not independent. For example, a large angle of slip will cause the plane to roll. This is due to the swept wings of the F-16. The roll controller will cancel this out somewhat, but a large enough AOS will result in an uncommanded roll.</p>



<p>Even with these limitations, the PID controllers work fairly well at keeping the plane in control.</p>



<p>Additionally, I use a technique called <em>gain scheduling</em> to change the gain parameters of the roll controller. Because roll performance increases with airspeed, we need a way to limit the amount of aileron movement at high speed. I add two animation curves, which take speed as input, and give the P and D gain of the roll controller as output.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">rollController.P = rollPSchedule.Evaluate(Mathf.Max(0, LocalVelocity.z));
rollController.D = rollDSchedule.Evaluate(Mathf.Max(0, LocalVelocity.z));

Vector3 fcsTarget = new Vector3(
    pitchController.Calculate(dt, av.x, accel.x, targetAV.x),
    -yawController.Calculate(dt, av.y, accel.y, targetAV.y),
    rollController.Calculate(dt, av.z, accel.z, targetAV.z)
);</pre>



<p>This allows us to change the strength of the roll controller at different speeds. A more advanced FCS might have a gain schedule for each controller, possibly using more inputs than just airspeed. In fact, if there were multiple inputs, we would need a 2D lookup table to calculate the gain schedule.</p>



<p>Because the flight model is a complete description of how the aircraft will respond at different combinations of AOA, AOS, and control input, it is theoretically possible to design an FCS system that perfectly counters all of the unwanted tendencies. However, that is beyond my understanding of aerodynamics and control theory.</p>



<h2><span id="G_and_AOA_Limiter">G and AOA Limiter</span></h2>



<p>The weakness of PID controllers is that they only control the angular velocity of the plane. This is not sufficient to control the plane. The previous project has a G limiter, which is simple since steering torque is applied directly to the aircraft. Adding a G limiter is more complicated with this F-16 flight model.</p>



<p>Additionally, a critical part of the FCS on a real F-16 is the AOA limiter. Just like the G limiter prevents the pilot from creating excessive G-forces while maneuvering, the AOA limiter prevents excessive AOA. This is because the aircraft becomes so unstable at about 28 degrees AOA that even the FCS can not compensate. And importantly, our flight model only supports a limited range of AOA (up to 45 degrees), so if the pilot goes beyond that, the behavior of the simulator becomes nonsensical. So limiting the AOA to about 25 degrees is important for maintaining stable flight.</p>



<p>The previous flight sim project did not have anything like an AOA limiter. I simply tuned the steering strength so that AOA would not exceed about 15 degrees (unless stalling). And even then, there is no instability caused by high AOA, so nothing bad happens if the pilot exceeds that.</p>



<p>We need a system that prevents the pilot from exceeding 25 degrees AOA. This would be implemented as a multiplier on the pilot’s stick input, just like a G limiter. Since there are two limits, we simply select the more restrictive limit using <em>min()</em>. So if the G limiter says to limit input to 0.75 and the AOA limiter says to limit input to 0.5, the value 0.5 is chosen.</p>



<p>Because this flight model uses lookup tables, there is no simple formula for calculating either the G limiter or AOA limiter. The G limiter from the previous project won’t work here. Additionally, the relationship between steering input and AOA is not simple. There is a feedback loop between AOA and lift. As AOA increases, lift increases. But as lift increases, AOA decreases since lift pulls the plane onto a new velocity vector. Not to mention lift also depends on airspeed and altitude.</p>



<p>Luckily, the F-16 flight model is completely disconnected from Unity’s physics system. We can actually run the flight model as much as we want with any inputs, and use the outputs for any purpose. There is the “main” flight model that syncs with a Unity rigidbody. But we can create “side” flight models to predict future behavior of the plane.</p>



<p>I chose to implement the G and AOA limiters by running a side flight model. This side model takes the pilot’s inputs and simulates the aircraft in a simplified world state. In a single physics update, the main flight model runs once, but the side flight model runs multiple times to predict movement several seconds into the future. Because running the flight model is a few lookups and math operations, running multiple times per frame is dirt cheap.</p>



<p>By running this side model, we can determine how the plane would behave if it flew without any limiters. So if the plane is flying fast enough to pull 16 Gs, the side model will report that. We can use that information to calculate the G limiter for the main model.</p>



<p>The side model is contained in the class SimpleTrimmer. The main function Trim looks like this:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">public SimulatedState Trim(float dt, float timeMax, SimulatedState initialState) {
    float time = 0;

    while (time &lt; timeMax) {
        AerodynamicState aeroState = new AerodynamicState() {
            ...
        };

        var aeroForces = aerodynamics.CalculateAerodynamics(aeroState);

        …

        time += dt;
    }

    return state;
}</pre>



<p>It just calls CalculateAerodynamics in a loop with it’s own time variable. The timestep can also be different from the main FixedUpdate loop time step. The variable timeMax controls how far into the future the prediction runs. For example, this side model can run at 0.1 second time steps for 5 seconds total.</p>



<p>After one step of the simulation is run, the state variables are updated and fed back into the next step. The maximum G force and AOA of the whole simulation is recorded.</p>

state.velocity = velNormalized * airspeed;

state.alpha = Mathf.Atan2(velNormalized.z, velNormalized.x) * Mathf.Rad2Deg;

state.maxAlpha = Mathf.Max(state.maxAlpha, state.alpha);
state.maxAccelerationZ = Mathf.Min(state.maxAccelerationZ, state.acceleration.z);</pre>



<p>This simulation is highly simplified compared to the main flight model. It ignores the pilot’s input except pitch. It ignores angular velocity except for pitch rate. It does not apply drag or any other force that changes airspeed or altitude. It ignores any change to the aircraft’s pitch. Note that the flight model does not care about the orientation of the aircraft to begin with.</p>



<p>The Trim function assumes the pilot is giving a full pitch up or pitch down input and takes the pitch PID controller as a parameter. So this side flight model uses the same PID values as the main model, to prevent the simulation from turning faster than the max turn rate. Since the I term is not used on the PID controller, we can use it without worrying about state.</p>



<p>Gravity as a single float value is also passed as a parameter. This allows the simulation to know how much gravity is affecting the turn on the pitch axis. If the plane is level, this value is 1. If the plane is rolled 90 degrees to the side, this value is 0. If upside down, this value is -1. Gravity on the other axes is ignored.</p>



<p>The larger time step and reduced complexity of simulation means that the side model is not completely accurate to how the plane will fly. But that’s acceptable since we are only using this to estimate the maximum G force and AOA that a turn might create.</p>



<p>After running through a few seconds of simulation on the flight model, the Trim function returns with the max G force and AOA. The FCS then uses these values to calculate the limiting factors for the pilot’s pitch input.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">SimpleTrimmer.SimulatedState state = simpleTrimmer.Trim(
    trimmerTimeStep,
    trimmerTime,
    initialState,
    maxAV.x * Mathf.Deg2Rad,
    gravityFactor * metersToFeet,
    pitchController,
    centerOfGravityPosition
);

float predictedAlpha = state.maxAlpha;

float predictedG = -state.maxAccelerationZ * feetToMeters;

float aoaPitchMult = CalculateAOALimiter(predictedAlpha);
float gLimit = gLimitPitch; // pitch up limit (ie 8G)

if (controlInput.x &gt; 0) {
    gLimit = this.gLimit; // pitch down limit (ie 4G)
}

float gPitchMult = CalculateGLimiter(predictedG, gLimit);</pre>



<p>The limiting factor for AOA and G force is calculated with a simple function:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float ApplyLimiter(float value, float limit, float limitStrength) {
    if (limit &lt;= 0) return 1;
    if (value &lt; limit) return 1;

    float error = value - limit;
    error *= limitStrength;

    return limit / (limit + error);
}</pre>



<p>ApplyLimiter returns a factor in the range [0, 1], which is eventually multiplied with the pilot’s control input. This function then used in the limiter functions:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float CalculateGLimiter(float predictedG, float gLimit) {
    float gForce = predictedG / 9.81f;
    float gPitchMult = ApplyLimiter(gForce, gLimit, gLimitStrength);

    return gPitchMult;
}</pre>



<p>The variable gForce is the predicted max G force from the side model. gLimit is the value chosen as the max G force, for example, 8. If the predicted value is 12, then the variable error will be 12 – 8 = 4. The returned factor would be 8 / (8 + 4) = 8 / 12 = 0.66. limitStrength is used to tune how strongly the error affects the returned limit factor.</p>



<p>If the value is below the limit, the returned factor is 1.</p>



<p>The AOA limiter uses the same function to calculate two limiting factors which are combined:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float CalculateAOALimiter(float predictedAlpha) {
    float aoaPitchMult = 1.0f;

    aoaPitchMult *= ApplyLimiter(predictedAlpha, predictedAoaLimitMax, predictedAoaLimitStrength);

    float realAOA = AngleOfAttack * Mathf.Rad2Deg;
    aoaPitchMult *= ApplyLimiter(realAOA, feedbackAoaLimitMax, feedbackAoaLimitStrength);

    return aoaPitchMult;
}</pre>



<p>One limit factor depends on the predicted alpha from the SimpleTrimmer class. The other factor depends on the actual alpha value the plane currently has. This can handle cases where the real alpha is much larger than the predicted value, such as when the plane is already stalling.</p>



<p>Then the AOA and G limiter factors are applied to the pilot’s input:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float aoaPitchMult = CalculateAOALimiter(predictedAlpha);
float gPitchMult = CalculateGLimiter(predictedG, gLimitPitch);

float pitchMult = Mathf.Min(aoaPitchMult, gPitchMult); // select whichever limiter is stronger
float rollMult = rollPitchFactor.Evaluate(Mathf.Abs(controlInput.x)) * rollAOAFactor.Evaluate(AngleOfAttack * Mathf.Rad2Deg);

Vector3 limitedInput = Vector3.Scale(controlInput, new Vector3(pitchMult, 1, rollMult));
Vector3 targetAV = Vector3.Scale(limitedInput, steeringSpeed * steeringSpeedFactor);</pre>



<p>The min() function is used to select whichever limiter factor is strongest. Since I am designing these systems myself, I can tell you there is not a strong reason why I chose min() instead of another multiplication. This is just the formula that felt right when I was testing it.</p>



<p>In fact there are many different ways that the limiting factors could be calculated and combined. I designed the ApplyLimiter function primarily to be easy to tune. These allow me to have separate variables for tuning predicted G, predicted AOA, and feedback AOA limiters.</p>



<p>There is one final limiter above, rollMult. This is controlled by two AnimationCurves, rollPitchFactor and rollAOAFactor. These curves reduce the strength of roll input when the pilot is commanding a strong pitch rotation and when the plane has a high AOA. I added this because rolls felt too sensitive when in a high G or high AOA turn. Tune these to your own taste.</p>



<h2><span id="Stick_Pusher">Stick Pusher</span></h2>



<p>The final system to add is a stick pusher. A stick pusher is a device some aircraft have that physically pushes the stick forward to avoid a stall. This doesn’t exist in the real F-16, even digitally, but who cares? It was quick and easy to write.</p>



<p>If the AOA exceeds some threshold, a bias value is added to the pilot’s stick input to push the nose down. This is different from the AOA limiter above, which multiplies the input by a factor [0, 1]. If the pilot is giving an input of 0, then the AOA limiter has no effect. The stick pusher adds the bias value to the pilot’s input, so it will work even when the pilot gives no input.</p>



<p>The stick pusher will apply when the plane is stalling or if the AOA limiter fails to keep the AOA in the safe range.</p>



<p>The code for this is incredibly simple in concept and implementation:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">float CalculateAOAPusher() {
    float bias = 0.0f;

    float aoa = AngleOfAttack * Mathf.Rad2Deg;

    if (aoa &gt; stickPusherThreshold) {
        float error = aoa - stickPusherThreshold;
        bias = stickPusherCurve.Evaluate(error);
    }

    return Mathf.Min(stickPusherMax, bias);
}</pre>



<p>If the AOA is over the stickPushThreshold, add a bias to the player’s input. The more it exceeds the threshold, the stronger the bias. At max strength, the stick pusher can give a full nose down input that can’t be overridden by the pilot.</p>



<p>This value is summed with the pilot’s input before running the PID controllers.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">Vector3 stickPusher = new Vector3(CalculateAOAPusher(), 0, 0);

Vector3 limitedInput = Vector3.Scale(controlInput, new Vector3(pitchMult, 1, rollMult)) + stickPusher;
Vector3 targetAV = Vector3.Scale(limitedInput, steeringSpeed * steeringSpeedFactor);</pre>



<p>With all of these systems added to the FCS, the plane should be very stable to fly now. Since the side model simulation is simplified, the G and AOA limiters are not perfect. They will sometimes result in those parameters being limited at a value too high or too low. But these systems do work accurately enough to keep the plane stable.</p>



<h2><span id="Testing">Testing</span></h2>



<p>Of course any implementation can have bugs. We need to test the flight model to make sure it works. This includes the translation of the Fortran flight model, and the code that implements all of this in Unity.</p>



<h2><span id="Unit_Testing">Unit Testing</span></h2>



<p>Because the flight model is separate from Unity’s physics engine, we can actually test it using normal unit testing techniques. Unity provides a unit testing framework based on NUnit, so testing is pretty typical for C#.</p>



<p>The authors of the textbook also helpfully provide a test case to use. They give the inputs to the model (airspeed, control surface position, throttle, etc) and the expected output of the model (forces, moment, angular velocity, etc). This lets us validate that the model is implemented correctly by running a single step of simulation.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="csharp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">// Textbook provides a table of input values and the expected output

<p>Note that the output values for roll, pitch, and yaw, and north, east, and altitude, are not checked in this test. We are using the Unity rigidbody to handle these, so these values are not even calculated in C#.</p>



<p>Additionally, the table lookup operations are fairly simple C# code, so these functions can also be unit tested. I caught a few bugs in the flight model by adding these tests.</p>



<p>All of the tests are in the ModelTestCase class.</p>



<h2><span id="Flight_Testing">Flight Testing</span></h2>



<p>Of course unit testing can only cover so much. The whole point of this project is to create a flight simulator. The only way to know how the flight model really feels is to fly it. So get out there and start flying it!</p>



<p>I have caught a few bugs in the implementation just by flying it and realizing that some aspect felt weird.</p>



<p>In the aerospace industry, test flights are thoroughly instrumented to gather as much data as possible. Force on every axis, angular velocity, pilot input, GPS track, etc is all recorded and stored for future analysis. It’s possible to write automated tests that read this data and check that values stay within expected bounds.</p>



<p>I have done none of that here. Just have fun flying 🙂</p>



<h2><span id="Limitations">Limitations</span></h2>



<p>The flight model defined in the textbook has several limitations.</p>



<p>The effects of alpha on the flight model is only modeled for the range [-10, 45]. Beta is only modeled for the range [-30, 30]. The flight model supports extrapolating data tables beyond their defined ranges, but the returned values will quickly become nonsensical. This means that if you manage to fly the F-16 beyond the provided ranges for alpha and beta, the flight model will break down and begin behaving non-physically.</p>



<p>In some cases, the aircraft will eventually return to controlled flight. But in other cases, one bad data value used to query the tables will cause increasingly bad data to be stored to the plane’s state. These bad values will quickly grow until the plane is thrown to infinity.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="793" height="542" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image.png 793w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-768x525.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 793px) 100vw, 793px"><figcaption>Pilots call this the “impossible turn”</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hopefully, this is not possible when using FCS that I’ve written. But I encourage any readers to try breaking it themselves.</p>



<p>You can also turn off parts of the FCS using the config menu in the top left corner. This allows you to fly the plane completely manually, turn the engine off, or alter the center of gravity.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="161" height="106" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/f16_config_menu.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>If the flight model doesn’t bug out from extreme values, then you can actually perform a backflip or a “Kulbit” maneuver with the F-16. I recommend turning off only the pitch axis FCS if you want to try that.</p>



<p>Another limitation is that flaps and slats are not defined in the flight model. The real F-16 uses a single control surface called a “flaperon” that works as both a flap and an aileron. When more lift is needed at low speeds, both flaperons deflect downwards like traditional flaps. Leading edge slats also deflect downwards to increase lift.</p>



<p>The textbook flight model only considers these control surfaces to be ailerons. That is, they always deflect in opposite directions in order to create a roll moment. Only a single “aileron” value is used to represent both left and right, so they cannot be used as flaps. If they were to be used as flaps, then there would need to be a left aileron and right aileron value and the Z axis force coefficient would depend on flaperon position.</p>



<p>The effect of slat position is blended into the existing tables, so there is some effect of slats on Z axis force. But the slat position cannot be animated on the plane’s 3D model since no variable for it exists.</p>



<p>This means that there are reduced high lift devices on the aircraft. The extra lift from flaps cannot be modeled. So the plane’s takeoff speed is much higher than you might expect from the F-16. The textbook only defines a model for <em>flight</em>, not for taxiing or takeoff. Landings feel quite bad because of this.</p>



<p>Another limitation is the lack of landing gear simulation. The landing gear is implemented exactly the same as the previous project: three capsule colliders. There is no simulation of wheel, tire, or suspension behavior. Again, this makes takeoff and landing feel kind of weird. But I have no idea how to write a system like that and it’s out of scope for this project anyways.🤷‍♂️</p>



<p>Another limitation of the flight model is the inaccuracy when flying super sonic. With real planes, lift and drag forces change drastically as you approach Mach 1. Air accelerates as it passes over the wing. Even while the plane remains subsonic, some parts of the air flow are forced to accelerate above Mach 1. When this air reaches supersonic speeds, shockwaves form over the wing which alters the way air flows around it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1920" height="1571" src="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transonic_flow_patterns.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transonic_flow_patterns.jpg 1920w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transonic_flow_patterns-1024x838.jpg 1024w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transonic_flow_patterns-768x628.jpg 768w, https://vazgriz.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Transonic_flow_patterns-1536x1257.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption>FAA Airplane Flying Handbook</figcaption></figure>



<p>This region, where some air is supersonic and some is not, is called the transonic region. This has a drastic effect on the aircraft’s performance and handling. In particular, the coefficient of drag increases, creating the “sound barrier” effect. The position of lift force on the wing changes, which will change how the plane handles.</p>



<p>None of these effects are included in the textbook’s flight model. These could be modeled by adding another input dimension to the force and moment tables. I suspect these were omitted to keep the flight model simple.</p>



<p>The practical effect is that the flight model only works up to about Mach 0.7. Above that, all of the forces on the aircraft become unrealistic. The behavior of the plane continues to increase smoothly with airspeed as if supersonic effects don’t exist.</p>



<h2><span id="Conclusion">Conclusion</span></h2>



<p>I started this project after I got a job in the aerospace industry. The textbook was recommended by my manager, since I was working on real flight control systems. In a way, this article is a summary of everything I’ve learned about flying and software engineering in that job.</p>



<p>The way this F-16 flight model is implemented is very different from my previous project. It is actually close to how professional level sims are written, though simplified to fit in a textbook. Even so, there are still plenty of limitations in the flight model which means the simulation will behave unrealistically beyond the intended flight envelope.</p>



<p>The authors of the textbook based their flight model on a NASA paper<sup data-fn="39ede4de-9768-4f6e-a777-e5f706c2c887"><a href="#39ede4de-9768-4f6e-a777-e5f706c2c887" id="39ede4de-9768-4f6e-a777-e5f706c2c887-link">12</a></sup> which measured the aerodynamic properties of a scale model in a wind tunnel. The Nasa paper provides 50 lookup tables. The textbook simplified, approximated, and combined these into only 13 lookup tables.</p>



<p>With only a little more effort, you could write a simulator that uses many more tables to cover a larger flight envelope with more detail. The only limit is the data you have access to and your understanding of aerodynamics.</p>



<p>The FCS I’ve written is much simpler than the real FCS. Theoretically, it would be possible to write code that models the real F-16 FCS and apply it to this flight simulator. But how could you even get that information and who would be crazy enough to try that?</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Created by the author using GIMP and freely available images.</p><p><strong>Stop searching, we had it right for 60 years.</strong></p><div><p>Ever since <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nenad_Petrovi%C4%87">Nenad Petrović</a>, grandmaster of chess composition, published his 218 move composition in 1964, people have tried to come up with a better one. Last month, I joined the hunt and, being a computer scientist, I decided to settle this question once and for all, using computers. You can give it a try yourself. Try to find a position with more moves than the one below.</p>
<p><strong>Spoiler</strong>: You won't.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:RmcRmpJOEzQR:rIwLr8BO.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=003f79dea9024998ea4db46c4c764ae26cec4efb" alt="image.png"><br>Reachable chess position with 218 moves for White, published by Petrović in 1964.</p>
<p>...but how can we know for sure?</p>
<p>By checking all <a href="https://github.com/lechmazur/ChessCounter">approximately 8.7x10^45</a> reachable chess positions?<br>Yeah that's not gonna happen...</p>
<p>That's 8.7 billion billion billion billion billion and it's enough to scare even the mightiest of supercomputers. In fact, cracking AES-128 encryption would be easier.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can use the power of Math!</p>
<p>Follow me along and perhaps you can compute yourself a world record afterwards :)</p>
<h2><a href="#using-the-power-of-math" id="using-the-power-of-math"></a>Using the power of Math</h2>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:AZJCGj9etF4L:wQdEg0Vn.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=05a7ba2531a44db54a10d356bdf45846175b6f5f" alt="image.png"><br>Red is the official color of Math, at least in my elementary school.</p>
<p>We're gonna tackle this problem from the white side, i.e., it is White to move. Except for rare exceptions regarding the reachability of positions, this is equivalent.</p>
<p>Since proving that a position is reachable is complicated, we're gonna search through all ways of placing pieces on the board and filter out the non-reachable ones later on, if needed.</p>
<p>Obviously, 99.9% of the positions suck at having lots of moves, they are not even close to 218. We just need a way to skip them and pray that there exists enough electricity to check the rest.</p>
<p>Let's begin with a couple <strong>of</strong> useful observations.</p>
<h4><a href="#useless-pieces" id="useless-pieces"></a>Useless pieces</h4>
<p>A black piece does not improve the number of moves, most of the time. Its existence only benefits the number of moves if it increases White's number of moves, i.e., at least one of the following is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be taken by a white pawn, giving said pawn more moves</li>
<li>It protects the black king from check, making an otherwise illegal position with lots of moves legal</li>
<li>It frees a white piece from being pinned to the white king, thus giving it more moves</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, it is useless, at best, and thus can be removed.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:WasmQmLOrBL6:ULIsaqYx.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=4156d91f382695716b3739afbac196155f423aad" alt="image.png"><br>I inserted this picture for the sole purpose of making this article look less text-heavy.</p>
<h4><a href="#too-powerful-pieces" id="too-powerful-pieces"></a>Too powerful pieces</h4>
<p>Next, we observe that, if piece counts permit, we can always replace a black piece, with the exception of the black king, with a strictly less powerful one. That is, a piece that has a subset of the moves of the original piece. For example, a queen with a pawn/bishop/rook or a bishop with a pawn. Except if a pawn is on the seventh rank, since in that case, each of its moves <strong>to the promotion square</strong> counts as 4 separata moves. The only way for Black's moves to affect White's number of moves is by pinning White's pieces or preventing the white king from stepping on a certain square. Both of these things can't get worse if the black piece has less moves than before.</p>
<h4><a href="#too-weak-pieces" id="too-weak-pieces"></a>Too weak pieces?</h4>
<p>The other way around, it is not so easy, however. You'd think that you can just replace white rooks and white bishops with white queens if counts permit, but the problem is this: How do you ensure that you cannot capture the black king, making the position illegal? Maybe the optimal solution has a rook instead of a queen to avoid just that?</p>
<p>Well, you might say "Let's just place a black piece in between then".</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:siS3rUkB5pwZ:DCkdccwl.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=0976813b03991d42ecf4a80d300aaf2bc111cb02" alt="Untitled.png"></p>
<p>And you would be wrong unless you can tell me why you haven't just blocked some other white piece and thus reduced the number of moves in total. Or what your plan is, if there is no space to put something in between. You just made the position illegal, duh!</p>
<h4><a href="#no-checks-thank-you" id="no-checks-thank-you"></a>No checks, thank you</h4>
<p>Finally, we can get rid of checks. If the black king is in check, it means that the position is illegal, since it is White's turn to move and they could just capture the black king. Not okay! So that can't be it. On the other hand, if the white king is in check, then the number of White's moves is severely restricted and we can easily prove that we cannot reach 218 moves. There are three ways to get out of check:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the king</li>
<li>Capture the attacker</li>
<li>Block the attack</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving the king gives 8 moves at best. Since any square can be reached by at most 16 pieces at the same time (8 knights and 8 other pieces straight or diagonally), capturing gives 16 moves at best. We can have at most 6 squares to block an attack, so that's an additional 6 x 16 = 96 moves. So at best 8+16+96 = 120 moves, far less than 218, and thus we do not need to consider positions in which either king is in check.</p>
<p>So is this it Tobi? Can we now call NASA and ask for their supercomputer?</p>
<p>Nope, it's still absolutely hopeless, there are waaaaay too many positions left.<br>We have to skip even more positions.</p>

<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:mZvNWBPGH05p:UggWM1vO.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=07c189e3deb15f59cf05794ae1041d3aa89ac872" alt="image.png"><br>Reminder: Replace rook pictures by something more interesting.</p>
<p>While searching through all possible piece configurations, we would ideally like to have some provably correct way of telling whether we can still reach 218 moves, so we can stop trying and save ourselves an astronomically large amount of work. The better the method is, the more work we save. But it also needs to be fast, since we need to run it millions and billions of times.</p>
<p>A common technique in optimization is to allow fractional decisions. Instead of a piece being either on e4 or not, it can be 27.3% there and 72.7% not there. This enables us to just "swim" through the solution space towards the optimal solution instead of trying all combinations. The drawback is that we usually end up with a way too good solution with most decisions being fractional. But if that doesn't get us beyond 218 moves, we know we can stop trying.</p>
<p>Obviously, these kinds of algorithms are already implemented in state-of-the-art solvers like Gurobi, so all we need to do is model our problem to its likings (as a so-called integer programming problem), tell it to maximize the number of moves and pray. Finally, after ~55 000 seconds, it crashed.<br>Not enough memory, but also hopelessly far away from completing the proof. Extrapolating the runtime led to an estimated runtime of ~6 years. Yeah, let's not go there. Going back to making more observations:</p>
<h4><a href="#checking-more-positions-to-make-things-less-slow" id="checking-more-positions-to-make-things-less-slow"></a>Checking more positions to make things less slow</h4>
<p>To reduce the size of the model, I bent some chess rules, simplifying the search space:</p>
<ul>
<li>I allowed castling if king and rook were on the right squares, not requiring anything else</li>
<li>I stopped caring about pieces moving despite being pinned</li>
<li>I stopped caring whether the white king is in check or walks into check</li>
<li>I allowed white pawns to always capture when standing on the fifth rank so I'd not have to check en passant.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these things are unlikely to happen in 218+ move positions and after a solution has been found, I can still check and discard it if it has less moves than it claims to have.</p>
<p>I started again and this time, memory wasn't a problem, but the progress was awfully slow with ~29 days remaining. The world could not wait this long and neither could I. I pressed cancel.</p>
<h4><a href="#preventing-white-magic" id="preventing-white-magic"></a>Preventing white magic</h4>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:iShBvrU9VQCw:ArUe8Px1.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=c35b91d1fcfcf2956ddf3aa013c8b34a03026e49" alt="image.png"><br>The optimal fractional solution for the empty board. Most pieces are spread out over multiple squares and have fractional numbers of moves available that sum to ~305. This does prove that the real solution can't have more than 305 moves. Still quite a bit from proving 218 to be the optimum.</p>
<p>Our current way of cheating is too different from reality, causing the solver to have to search through way too many board configurations. In our case, the optimal solution to the easy problem flooded the center with half queens and half knights sharing the same squares, having half pieces move through other half pieces with half moves. Gurobi thinks that the above position has 305 moves in total, which is far away from 218 and a bad upper bound.</p>
<p>In order to cut off this crazy solution, I added a "redundant" constraint, saying that at most one piece in total can move from one direction onto a particular square. Which got us a new hallucination...</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:OmGeWp49e01E:kNej345t.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=ac767d5042739c64da4dd768503de05253fb3043" alt="image.png"><br>The second try. This one has 271 2/3 moves which proves that there is no solution with more than 271 moves.</p>
<p>Now we have 271 2/3 moves, which is much better. It's a bit like having to try all passwords with 53 characters vs. all passwords with 87 characters, the latter being many magnitudes harder.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, White can't have 4 kings.</p>
<p>White does not have four kings. White has 3 times 24.6% kings and one 26.2% king. Also, the queen on g3 barely exists, it's 0.8% but apparently it somehow contributes to the total sum of moves :)</p>
<p>With this improved model, I tried again and after ~23 000 seconds, Gurobi solved it to optimality!</p>
<h2><a href="#results" id="results"></a>Results</h2>
<p>Sadly, instead of finding me a fancy position with 219 moves and making my name immortal, Gurobi gave me the following 12 representative positions (of 40,000 in total) with 218 moves each:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:M7Cw0smh4jQ9:DNPmvada.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=95ebffed9f88146a5632c919b55f27654667793c" alt="image.png"><br><a href="https://lichess.org/study/PLtuv3v5">Link to the positions</a></p>
<p>All 12 positions seem trivially reachable. I only constructed a proof game for one of the positions, since that is sufficient for proving our claim. If you don't believe that this is possible, keep in mind that White's last or second last move might have been a capture. Or click on the link :)</p>
<p>Sadly not a world record, but at least we now know for certain that 218 is the limit.</p>
<p>And you smart chess move 3.7 bit compression people and chess engine developers, you can finally stop worrying. 256 moves will be enough. You're welcome :-)</p>
<p>Except if you allow non-reachable positions, in which case you might want to read on :P</p>
<h2><a href="#other-stuff-solved-along-the-way" id="other-stuff-solved-along-the-way"></a>Other stuff solved along the way</h2>
<p>I also confirmed the optimality of the 144 move record without promotions. Since Gurobi did not find any position with more than 144 moves, that means that there also is no reachable position with more than 144 moves. Hence, 144 moves is the best we can do and "Jenő Bán", a chess composer from Hungary, found one in 1960 already:</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:pa72BRyqBqjr:OdXsn3pg.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=e3af55f6ed060b75e69e4abe96137a36227315c" alt="image.png"><br>144 moves for White, no promotions. Created by Hungarian chess composer "Jenő Bán". Here is a <a href="https://lichess.org/study/hOSxwpyB/PUHHb9cr">proof game</a>, demonstrating that the position is reachable.</p>
<p>Also, I confirmed the optimality of the following illegal position, which has 288 moves for White.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:2lRWfWA2zNcC:vfeNowSo.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=db69bc7ef724e8eb3bca5581f6e7ba980eebcb13" alt="image.png"><br>Illegal position with 288 moves for White. Corner queens can be replaced with bishops.</p>
<p>Now have a guess at what the best non-reachable legal position looks like ;)<br>Yep, you're right, cramming the kings into the corners for 271 moves.</p>
<p><img src="https://image.lichess1.org/display?h=0&amp;op=resize&amp;path=tobs40:ublogBody:D3fh622moE3N:zMvHxcKQ.png&amp;w=800&amp;sig=9509e500782247e9ce8499588941f25c6f268c95" alt="image.png"><br>Legal but non-reachable position with 271 moves for White.

<p>Private surveillance vendor Flock Safety reinstalled all of its stationary license plate cameras in Evanston that had previously been removed, apparently doing so without authorization from the city, which sent the company a cease-and-desist order Tuesday afternoon demanding that the cams be taken back down.</p>

<p>The city previously <strong><a href="https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/08/26/evanston-shuts-down-license-plate-cameras-terminates-contract-with-flock-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered Flock to shut down</a></strong> 19 automated license plate readers (18 stationary and one flex camera that can be attached to a squad car) provided by the company and put its contract with Flock on a 30-day termination notice on Aug. 26. </p>

<p>This decision came after Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias discovered that Flock had allowed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to access Illinois cameras in a “pilot program” against state law, and after the RoundTable reported in June that out-of-state law enforcement agencies were able to search Flock’s data for assistance in immigration cases.</p>

<p>Flock had removed 15 of the 18 stationary cameras by Sept. 8, only to reinstall each one at or near its prior location by Tuesday. City spokesperson Cynthia Vargas said in a written statement that the city has not deviated from or made any changes to its policies “since the earlier contract termination, meaning Flock reinstalled the cameras without the city’s permission.”</p>

<p>“Recently, we became aware that Flock has reinstalled the physical cameras that they had previously taken down,” Vargas wrote. “We immediately issued a cease-and-desist order to Flock. Earlier this afternoon, Flock committed to promptly removing the cameras.”</p>

<p>Flock did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the RoundTable on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>The city first installed Flock cameras in late 2022 and early 2023 as part of two separate one-year contracts, and City Council later approved a single five-year contract extension in January 2024. </p>

<p>The city has paid the first two years of that extension but would still owe $145,500 for the final three years if the contract is upheld. The city intends to terminate the contract on Sept. 26 under its notice to Flock, but the company is challenging that termination, and the dispute could escalate to litigation.</p>


<h4>Same spots, with some different models</h4>

<p>The RoundTable mapped and photographed each of the 18 stationary cameras in June, and site visits on Sept. 8 confirmed that all but three had been removed by Flock. The last three, which appear to have never been removed, are the north-facing cameras at Howard Street’s intersections with Chicago, Ridge and Dodge avenues.</p>



<p>Further site visits Tuesday confirmed that the 15 removed cameras had been replaced at the same locations. Most of them were banded back onto public streetlight fixtures where they were placed before, while five located on east-west streets along McCormick Boulevard had individual poles reinstalled into the ground. Near three of these pole mounts were freshly spray painted lines, the word “FLOCK” and numbers appearing to designate the cameras individually.</p>

<p>A Reddit user posted a photo to <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/evanston/comments/1no1gby/flock_cameras_apparently_being_reinstalled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the r/Evanston subreddit</a></strong> on Monday evening showing a worker installing one of these pole mounts and its camera earlier that morning at the corner of McCormick and Main Street.</p>

<p>The worker is seen on a ladder holding the camera’s solar panel in front of the pole mount, and behind them is an Enterprise-branded rental van parked on the sidewalk in front of the sign for the Skokie Northshore Channel Park. Although this camera and the one at McCormick and Oakton Street are installed outside of Evanston’s city limits, they both fall under Evanston’s contract with Flock, rather than Skokie’s.</p>



<p><em>Click on the images in the gallery above to see them full screen.</em></p>


<p>Additionally, not all of the reinstalled cameras were “Falcon” models — the long, oval-shaped camera with a solar panel and battery packs that was previously used in every location.</p>

<p>At five locations, there was instead a stubbier camera that looks similar to the “Standard” model currently advertised on Flock’s website, except with an extra attachment under the main body. These five also appear to lack solar panels, instead attaching to several previously unseen boxes, and at least one camera is attached to a wire connected to the city-owned light post it’s mounted to, suggesting it may draw power from the city’s grid.</p>



<p><em>Click on the images in the gallery above to see them full screen.</em></p>

<h4>Analysis: Flock’s data suggests cams could be active</h4>

<p>Even before any cameras were initially removed, none of them were supposed to be collecting any data. The city wrote in its Aug. 26 announcement that the 19 cameras were “no longer collecting or providing license plate reader data to the Flock network,” and EPD Cmdr. Scott Sophier reconfirmed this to the RoundTable on Sept. 8.</p>

<p>“The last read on an Evanston Flock camera was logged shortly before 1:00 p.m. on August 26th, which is consistent with the City’s request for de-activation,” Sophier said at the time.</p>


<p>However, Flock’s own publicly available data suggests that may not be the case. </p>

<p>The company maintains a “transparency portal” webpage for Evanston that updates daily with basic data on the cameras’ operations, including “Number of LPR [license plate readers] and other cameras” and “Vehicles detected in the last 30 days.” The RoundTable has tracked this page since shortly after the city’s shutdown order, logging the data and archiving updates on most days.</p>

<p>The “Number of LPR and other cameras” figure was at 19 when the shutdown was ordered, matching Evanston’s 19 cameras, but it later dropped to 10 on Aug. 30. Rather than falling to zero, however, the figure stayed at 10 until Sept. 16, when it increased to 12, eventually returning to 19 on Sept. 23, matching the reinstallation of all the cameras.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the “Vehicles detected in the last 30 days” number has steadily decreased since the shutdown order, with each passing update rolling off another day when the cameras were known to be active. However, the figure has not decreased enough over time to actually reach zero once 30 days have passed.</p>

<p>When the RoundTable began tracking this figure on Aug. 28, it stood at 439,542 vehicles detected over approximately 28 days of active cameras. To reach zero by 30 days post-shutdown, the figure would need to drop by an average of around 15,700 each day, because every new day added to the data should have included zero new vehicles detected.</p>


<p>Based on the city’s Aug. 26 termination notice, there should only be two full days’ worth of vehicle detections left on Flock’s data portal as of late Tuesday, Sept. 23. But the page still reports 155,507 vehicles detected in the last 30 days, yielding a reduction of 284,035 vehicles over 26 days, or around 10,924 per day — well below the reduction rate needed to reach zero.</p>

<p>This trend means that on Friday, Sept. 26, when more than 30 days will have passed since the city’s cameras were supposed to be shut down, Flock will still report some number of vehicles as being detected in the prior 30 days. That suggests some number of cameras may have remained active and logging vehicles after Aug. 26, in violation of the city’s order and without the city’s knowledge, as indicated by Sophier’s response to the RoundTable on Sept. 8.</p>

<p>“Flock has not indicated to the City in direct communications that any ALPR’s are active or have been re-activated,” Sophier wrote. “There is no indication that Flock did not honor/fulfill the City’s request and also no indication on the City’s end to show any plate reads since the aforementioned date/time.”</p>

<p>Flock did not answer questions about this data sent by the RoundTable on Sept. 8. Site visits by the RoundTable that day confirmed that the 15 aforementioned cameras had been removed by that time.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update: </em></strong><em>The City of Evanston has <strong><a href="https://evanstonroundtable.com/2025/09/25/city-covers-up-flock-cameras-while-waiting-for-removal/">covered up the Flock cameras</a></strong> while waiting for their removal</em>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Back in 2021 I made a mod for Deus Ex 1 that fixes the lipsyncing and blinking, which, I betcha didn’t know, was broken since ship. Everything I wrote about it is on Twitter, and it oughta be somewhere else, so here’s a post about it. The mod itself can be downloaded <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/joe-wintergreens-deus-ex-lipsync-mod" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.moddb.com/mods/joe-wintergreens-deus-ex-lipsync-mod">here</a>.</p>

<p>I guess I was playing DX1 and thinking, geez, was this lipsync always this bad? In a weird way? It’s insta-snapping mouth shapes, but they’re not always the same mouth shapes. Is this broken? I couldn’t find anything online about it, but I did find <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/classic-tools-retrospective-the-tools-that-built-deus-ex-with-chris-norden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article</a>: an interview with Chris Norden, a coder on DX, where he goes into the lipsyncing and how it was, at one point, super elaborate and amazing, and they had to pare it back for performance reasons. I thought I’d check how much of this was done in Unrealscript (since the C++ source for DX is nowhere) and whether I could un-pare it. It turns out it was an extremely simple fix to get it as good as I got it, and I think that’s as good as you can get it until someone leaks the source code.</p>



<p>I’d messed around with lipsyncing stuff before and was familiar with the broad strokes of how it tends to work via my intense familiarity with Half-Life 2: you figure out, hopefully automatically, the sounds (phonemes) present in a sound file (“oo”, “ah”, whatever) and map those to mouth shapes (visemes), then when the audio plays, move the mouth into the right shape for the phoneme we’re in at this moment. The figuring-out process is called “phoneme extraction”, at least by Valve, and Valve do this offline, because it takes a sec. In Valve’s case they append this phoneme information to the end of the .wav file, and it looks like this:</p>



<hr>



<pre><code>PLAINTEXT

}
</code></pre>



<p>, etc. Phonemes, start times, end times. Easy!</p>



<p>My assumption is that the reason Deus Ex’s super cool lipsyncing was too expensive to ship was, they don’t seem to save this information anywhere, so I guess they were figuring out the phonemes in realtime. If correct, this is sort of a bummer – doing what Valve did would have scooped the whole cost out. Maybe there was more to it.</p>



<p>Anyway, the Unrealscript. Deus Ex is pre-Unreal having skeletal animation, it’s all vertex animation. The character heads have a few: relevant here, 7 visemes and a blink. <code>nextphoneme</code> is set from somewhere outside this code (probably a cpp audio system I can’t access) to A, E, F, M, O, T or U, which it doesn’t matter which is which and I don’t remember, or X, which is nothing (close mouth). Then this Unrealscript on the character sets the head’s anim sequence to the appropriate pose. This all happens on tick, but only if <code>IsSpeaking</code>. We have a <code>tweentime</code> we’re using to blend between these poses, so we <em>should</em> be seeing nice smooth blending, the lack of which is why I’m here in the first place! So what’s the problem?</p>



<p>The main thing is a dodgy frame rate check:</p>



<pre><code>// update the animation timers that we are using
	animTimer[0] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[1] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[2] += deltaTime;

	if (bIsSpeaking)
	{
		// if our framerate is high enough (&gt;20fps), tween the lips smoothly
		if (Level.TimeSeconds - animTimer[3]  &lt; 0.05)
			tweentime = 0;
		else
			tweentime = 0.1;
</code></pre>



<p>“tweentime” is how long it takes to blend to the next viseme in seconds; if 0, it’s an instant snap. The intent here is to skip blending entirely if our framerate is so low that it looks better snapping the lips around than showing any in-between poses, only it doesn’t work. The code is keeping <code>Level.TimeSeconds</code> from the previous frame and subtracting that from the current <code>Level.TimeSeconds</code> to get deltatime, which if it’s less than 0.05, we’re assumed to be getting less than 20fps. So it’s flipped.</p>



<p>Also, 0.1 is just way too fast a value, which I suspect a reason for that I’ll come back to*. I increased it to 0.35 to make the blends take long enough to really see.</p>



<p>With that fixed, the lipsync is smooth! Hooray! But it’s not perfect: at the end of a line, when the audio finishes, we don’t smoothly close the mouth; we snap the mouth shut instantly. This is because we’re only doing any blending if <code>bIsSpeaking=true</code>, which it suddenly isn’t. The perf hit of this function no longer matters at all, so I just skip that check too: every character always gets to run lipsync. Tweentime is also local to this function and initialises at 0, so I had to set it to 0.3 to get blending even when we have no phoneme.</p>



<p>Blinking was also way too fast, so fast as to be invisible, so I slowed it down a ton. Now you can see ’em blinkin’.</p>



<p>So now we have nice blinking and smooth mouth movement, but there’s one thing that still sucks: presumably as part of the optimisation that made this ship at all, <code>nextphoneme</code> does not update every tick, or anywhere near every tick. It doesn’t even update at a fixed rate – sometimes you’ll get a good amount of updates in a sentence, sometimes one or two. This means that all the smooth blending in the world won’t get you a correct result unless you happen to get lucky: JC can be speaking the M in “a bomb” and you’re still back on the “a”. As far as I can tell there’s no way to fix this right now – the code that updates the phonemes just needs to do it every tick, and it don’t, and it’s not Unrealscript so I can’t touch it. If the time between phoneme updates was at least consistent, you could set tweentime to that duration and make your blend take as long as it takes for a new phoneme to show up, but it ain’t. So close!</p>



<p>*In the interview where Norden alludes to this amazing lipsync demo they had going on before they optimised it down, I assume it was initially getting a new phoneme every tick, and <em>that</em> is probably when they set 0.1 seconds as a blend duration. If you’re getting constant new phonemes, blending super fast to the next one makes sense; it’s only when you’re not that a slower blend time looks good.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of jank to this code. The silliest thing about it might be that it lives in <code>ScriptedPawn</code>, Deus Ex’s NPC class, which does not share an immediate parent with the player character, so this whole function is just duplicated between the two classes.</p>



<p>Anyway, here’s the whole function after I futzed with it.</p>



<pre><code>// lip synching support - DEUS_EX CNN
//
function LipSynch(float deltaTime)
{
	local name animseq;
	local float rnd;
	local float tweentime;

	// update the animation timers that we are using
	animTimer[0] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[1] += deltaTime;
	animTimer[2] += deltaTime;

	if (bIsSpeaking)
	{
		// if our framerate is high enough (&gt;20fps), tween the lips smoothly
		
//JOE CHANGE: 
//This used to set tweentime to 0 (no blend) if it thought FPS was low, else 0.1. It was 
//backwards though, the result was the opposite. 
//Even 0.1 is too fast to look good though. Anyway, skip the check, we don't care
//
//		if (Level.TimeSeconds - animTimer[3]  &lt; 0.05)
//			tweentime = 0.4;
//		else
			tweentime = 0.36;

//Also, ideally tweentime would be the duration until the next time we get a phoneme update?
//But I don't know where that update comes from at the moment

		// the last animTimer slot is used to check framerate
		animTimer[3] = Level.TimeSeconds;

		if (nextPhoneme == "A")
			animseq = 'MouthA';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "E")
			animseq = 'MouthE';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "F")
			animseq = 'MouthF';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "M")
			animseq = 'MouthM';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "O")
			animseq = 'MouthO';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "T")
			animseq = 'MouthT';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "U")
			animseq = 'MouthU';
		else if (nextPhoneme == "X")
			animseq = 'MouthClosed';

		if (animseq != '')
		{
					if (lastPhoneme != nextPhoneme)
			{
				lastPhoneme = nextPhoneme;
				TweenBlendAnim(animseq, tweentime);
				TimeLastPhoneme = Level.TimeSeconds;
			}
		
		}
		

//		if ((Level.TimeSeconds - TimeLastPhoneme) &gt;= tweentime*0.8 &amp;&amp; TimeLastPhoneme != 0)
//		{
//		TweenBlendAnim('MouthClosed', 0.2);
//		nextPhoneme = "X";
//		lastPhoneme = "A";
//		TimeLastPhoneme = Level.TimeSeconds;
//		}
	}
	else
	if (bWasSpeaking)
	{
		bWasSpeaking = false;
		
//JOE: I added this tweentime set. Without it it was 0 as initialised, so the jaw snapped shut

		tweentime = 0.3;
		TweenBlendAnim('MouthClosed', tweentime);
	}

	// blink randomly
	if (animTimer[0] &gt; 0.5)
	{
		animTimer[0] = 0;
		if (FRand() &lt; 0.4)
			PlayBlendAnim('Blink', 0.2, 0.1, 1);
	}

	LoopHeadConvoAnim();
	LoopBaseConvoAnim();

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I had to rent a house for a couple of months recently, which is long enough in California that it pushes you into proper tenant protection law. As landlords tend to do, they failed to return my security deposit within the 21 days <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1950.5&amp;lawCode=CIV">required by law</a>, having already failed to provide the required notification that I was entitled to an inspection before moving out. Cue some tedious argumentation with the letting agency, and eventually me threatening to take them to small claims court.</p><p>This post is not about that.</p><p>Now, under Californian law, the onus is on the <em>landlord</em> to hold and return the security deposit - the agency has no role in this. The only reason I was talking to them is that my lease didn't mention the name or address of the landlord (another <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=1962&amp;lawCode=CIV">legal violation</a>, but the outcome is just that you get to serve the landlord via the agency). So it was a bit surprising when I received an email from the owner of the agency informing me that they did not hold the deposit and so were not liable - I already knew this.</p><p>The odd bit about this, though, is that they sent me another copy of the contract, asserting that it made it clear that the landlord held the deposit. I read it, and instead found a clause reading <q>SECURITY: The security deposit will secure the performance of Tenant’s obligations. IER may, but will not be obligated to, apply all portions of said deposit on account of Tenant’s obligations. Any balance remaining upon termination will be returned to Tenant. Tenant will not have the right to apply the security deposit in payment of the last month’s rent. Security deposit held at IER Trust Account.</q>, where IER is <a href="https://www.iersf.com/">International Executive Rentals</a>, the agency in question. Why send me a contract that says you hold the money while you're telling me you don't? And then I read further down and found this:<br><img src="https://codon.org.uk/~mjg59/pictures/addendum.png" alt="Text reading ENTIRE AGREEMENT: The foregoing constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and may bemodified only in writing signed by all parties. This agreement and any modifications, including anyphotocopy or facsimile, may be signed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed anoriginal and all of which taken together will constitute one and the same instrument. The followingexhibits, if checked, have been made a part of this Agreement before the parties’ execution:۞Exhibit 1:Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (Required by Law for Rental Property Built Prior to 1978)۞Addendum 1 The security deposit will be held by (name removed) and applied, refunded, or forfeited in accordance with the terms of this lease agreement."><br>Ok, fair enough, there's an addendum that says the landlord has it (I've removed the landlord's name, it's present in the original).</p><p>Except. I had no recollection of that addendum. I went back to the copy of the contract I had and discovered:<br><img src="https://codon.org.uk/~mjg59/pictures/no-addendum.png" alt="The same text as the previous picture, but addendum 1 is empty"><br>Huh! But obviously I could just have edited that to remove it (there's no obvious reason for me to, but whatever), and then it'd be my word against theirs. However, I'd been sent the document via <a href="https://www.sharefile.com/rightsignature">RightSignature</a>, an online document signing platform, and they'd added a certification page that looked like this:<br><img src="https://codon.org.uk/~mjg59/pictures/contract-certificate.png" alt="A Signature Certificate, containing a bunch of data about the document including a checksum or the original"><br>Interestingly, the certificate page was identical in both documents, including the checksums, despite the content being different. So, how do I show which one is legitimate? You'd think given this certificate page this would be trivial, but RightSignature provides no documented mechanism whatsoever for anyone to verify any of the fields in the certificate, which is annoying but let's see what we can do anyway.</p><p>First up, let's look at the PDF metadata. </p><a href="https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/"><tt>pdftk</tt></a><p> has a </p><tt>dump_data</tt><p> command that dumps the metadata in the document, including the creation date and the modification date. My file had both set to identical timestamps in June, both listed in UTC, corresponding to the time I'd signed the document. The file containing the addendum? The same creation time, but a modification time of this Monday, shortly before it was sent to me. This time, the modification timestamp was in Pacific Daylight Time, the timezone currently observed in California. In addition, the data included two ID fields, ID0 and ID1. In my document both were identical, in the one with the addendum ID0 matched mine but ID1 was different.</p><p>These ID tags are intended to be some form of representation (such as a hash) of the document. ID0 is set when the document is created and should not be modified afterwards - ID1 initially identical to ID0, but changes when the document is modified. This is intended to allow tooling to identify whether two documents are modified versions of the same document. The identical ID0 indicated that the document with the addendum was originally identical to mine, and the different ID1 that it had been modified.</p><p>Well, ok, that seems like a pretty strong demonstration. I had the "I have a very particular set of skills" conversation with the agency and pointed these facts out, that they were an extremely strong indication that my copy was authentic and their one wasn't, and they responded that the document was "re-sealed" every time it was downloaded from RightSignature and that would explain the modifications. This doesn't seem plausible, but it's an argument. Let's go further.</p><p>My next move was <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pdfalyzer/">pdfalyzer</a>, which allows you to pull a PDF apart into its component pieces. This revealed that the documents were identical, other than page 3, the one with the addendum. This page included tags entitled "touchUp_TextEdit", evidence that the page had been modified using Acrobat. But in itself, that doesn't prove anything - obviously it had been edited at some point to insert the landlord's name, it doesn't prove whether it happened before or after the signing.</p><p>But in the process of editing, Acrobat appeared to have renamed all the font references on that page into a different format. Every other page had a consistent naming scheme for the fonts, and they matched the scheme in the page 3 I had. Again, that doesn't tell us whether the renaming happened before or after the signing. Or does it?</p><p>You see, when I completed my signing, RightSignature inserted my name into the document, and did so using a font that wasn't otherwise present in the document (Courier, in this case). That font was named identically throughout the document, except on page 3, where it was named in the same manner as every other font that Acrobat had renamed. Given the font wasn't present in the document until after I'd signed it, this is proof that the page was edited <em>after</em> signing.</p><p>But eh this is all very convoluted. Surely there's an easier way? Thankfully yes, although I hate it. RightSignature had sent me a link to view my signed copy of the document. When I went there it presented it to me as the original PDF with my signature overlaid on top. Hitting F12 gave me the network tab, and I could see a reference to a </p><tt>base.pdf</tt><p>. Downloading that gave me the original PDF, pre-signature. Running </p><tt>sha256sum</tt><p> on it gave me an identical hash to the "Original checksum" field. Needless to say, it did not contain the addendum.</p><p>Why do this? The only explanation I can come up with (and I am obviously guessing here, I may be incorrect!) is that International Executive Rentals realised that they'd sent me a contract which could mean that they <em>were</em> liable for the return of my deposit, even though they'd already given it to my landlord, and after realising this added the addendum, sent it to me, and assumed that I just wouldn't notice (or that, if I did, I wouldn't be able to prove anything). In the process they went from an extremely unlikely possibility of having civil liability for a few thousand dollars (even if they were holding the deposit it's still the landlord's legal duty to return it, as far as I can tell) to doing something that looks extremely like <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?lawCode=PEN&amp;division=&amp;title=13.&amp;part=1.&amp;chapter=4.&amp;article=">forgery</a>.</p><p>There's a hilarious followup. After this happened, the agency offered to do a screenshare with me showing them logging into RightSignature and showing the signed file with the addendum, and then proceeded to do so. One minor problem - the "Send for signature" button was still there, just below a field saying "Uploaded: 09/22/25". I asked them to search for my name, and it popped up two hits - one marked draft, one marked completed. The one marked completed? Didn't contain the addendum.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/just-use-postgres">books</a> &amp; many articles online, like <a href="https://www.amazingcto.com/postgres-for-everything/">this one</a> arguing for using Postgres for everything. I thought I’d take a look at one use case - using Postgres instead of Redis for caching. I work with APIs quite a bit, so I’d build a super simple HTTP server that responds with data from that cache. I’d start from Redis as this is something I frequently encounter at work, switch it out to Postgres using unlogged tables and see if there’s a difference.</p>
<h2 id="the-setup">The setup</h2>
<p>I’ll run the experiment on my <a href="https://dizzy.zone/2025/03/10/State-of-my-Homelab-2025/">homelab’s</a> k8s cluster. The idea is to run Postgres or Redis on one node, limiting it to 2CPUs via k8s limits, as well as 8GiB of memory. On another node, I’ll run the web server itself and then spin a pod for the benchmark executed via <a href="https://k6.io/">k6</a> on the third.</p>
<p>Both postgres and redis are used with the out of the box settings for the following images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Postgres - <code>postgres:17.6</code></li>
<li>Redis - <code>redis:8.2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I wrote a simple webserver, with 2 endpoints, a cache and a “Session” struct which we’ll store in the cache:</p>

<p>I’ll seed the redis and postgres with 30 million entries each, keeping record of the inserted uuids. From there, I’ll generate a subset of existing uuids to use while benchmarking. This allows for simulating both hits and misses.</p>
<p>I’ll do a few runs of benchmarks for gets first, then sets and then a mixed run. Each run will execute for 2 minutes. I’ll look at the number of operations per second, latencies as well as memory and CPU usage during those times.</p>
<p>To simulate a somewhat real scenario where only a subset of keys exist in the cache the set benchmark will have a 10% chance to update an existing key, whereas the get will have an 80% chance of picking an existing key. The mixed workload will have a 20% chance to execute a set scenario and 80% for the get scenario.</p>

        Requests per second – higher is better
    
</p>






<p>Redis performed better than Postgres, which did not surprise me at all. The bottleneck was actually the HTTP server. The machine running the http server maxed out on CPU, with redis running comfortably with ~1280mCPU - short of the 2000mCPU limit imposed. Redis used ~3800MiB of RAM, which stayed flat across the runs.</p>
<p>For postgres, the bottleneck was the CPU on postgres side. It consistently maxed out the 2 cores dedicated to it, while also using ~5000MiB of RAM.</p>
<p>Redis also did better when it comes to latencies of the HTTP responses:</p>
















<p>
    
        Latency, milliseconds – lower is better
    
</p>






<h3 id="setting-values-in-cache">Setting values in cache</h3>
















<p>
    
        Requests per second – higher is better
    
</p>






<p>Once again Redis performed better. The CPU usage stayed roughly the same as in the case of the GET experiment, with the RAM usage growing to ~4300MiB due to the new keys being inserted. The bottleneck stayed on the HTTP server side, with Redis using ~1280mCPU once again.</p>
<p>Postgres once again was bottlenecked by the CPU, constantly using 100% of the 2 cores it was limited to. During the course of the run, the memory usage grew to ~5500MiB.</p>
<p>During the test, the endpoints with the Redis cache implementation also had better latencies:</p>
















<p>
    
        Latency, milliseconds – lower is better
    
</p>






<h3 id="readwrite-performance">Read/write performance</h3>
















<p>
    
        Requests per second – higher is better
    
</p>






<p>The mixed benchmark also returned the predictable result of Redis reigning superior. As has been the story so far, the CPU stayed put at ~1280mCPU, RAM usage grew a bit due to the new keys being inserted.</p>
<p>Postgres maxed out the two cores and reached around 6GiB of memory used.</p>
<p>Latencies once again were better when using redis:</p>
















<p>
    
        Latency, milliseconds – lower is better
    
</p>






<h3 id="unlogged-tables">Unlogged tables</h3>
<p>In the benchmark, I’ve used an unlogged table for postgres but this has not seemed to help, or has it? If I rerun the same benchmark with a normal(logged) table we can look at the numbers.</p>
















<p>
    
        Requests per second – higher is better
    
</p>






<p>The unlogged table makes a huge difference for the write benchmark and a somewhat smaller but still significant one for the mixed workload. This is because the unlogged tables skip the write ahead log making them a lot faster for writes. There’s very little difference for the read performance though and I expect more runs would show the two test cases converging.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Redis is faster than postgres when it comes to caching, there’s no doubt about it. It conveniently comes with a bunch of other useful functionality that one would expect from a cache, such as TTLs. It was also bottlenecked by the hardware, my service or a combination of both and could definitely show better numbers. Surely, we should all use Redis for our caching needs then, right? Well, I think I’ll still use postgres. Almost always, my projects need a database. Not having to add another dependency comes with its own benefits. If I need my keys to expire, I’ll add a column for it, and a cron job to remove those keys from the table. As far as speed goes - 7425 requests per second is still a lot. That’s more than half a billion requests per day. All on hardware that’s 10 years old and using laptop CPUs. Not many projects will reach this scale and if they do I can just upgrade the postgres instance or if need be spin up a redis then. Having an interface for your cache so you can easily switch out the underlying store is definitely something I’ll keep doing exactly for this purpose.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>This is the default filesystem of Redox OS, inspired by ZFS and adapted to a microkernel architecture.</p>
<p>Redox had a read-only ZFS driver but it was abandoned because of the monolithic nature of ZFS that created problems with the Redox microkernel design.</p>
<p>(It's a replacement for <a href="https://gitlab.redox-os.org/redox-os/tfs">TFS</a>)</p>
<p>Current features:</p>

<li>Compatible with Redox and Linux (FUSE)</li>
<li>Copy-on-write</li>
<li>Data/metadata checksums</li>
<li>Transparent encryption</li>
<li>Standard Unix file attributes</li>
<li>File/directory size limit up to 193TiB (212TB)</li>
<li>File/directory quantity limit up to 4 billion per 193TiB (2^32 - 1 = 4294967295)</li>
<li>Disk encryption fully supported by the Redox bootloader, letting it load the kernel off an encrypted partition.</li>
<li>MIT licensed</li>
</ul>
<p>Being MIT licensed, RedoxFS can be bundled on GPL-licensed operating systems (Linux, for example).</p>

<p>RedoxFS tooling can be used to create, mount and edit contents of an <code>.img</code> file containing RedoxFS. It can be installed with:</p>

		<p>Over the summer <a href="https://gabrielmahler.org/">Gabriel Mahler</a> has been conducting research on <a href="https://gabrielmahler.org/environment/ai/ml/%F0%9F%A6%94/2025/07/04/hedgehogs01.html">hedgehog habitat mapping</a> using <a href="https://gabrielmahler.org/environment/ai/ml/%F0%9F%A6%94/2025/07/13/hedgehogs02.html">Agent Based Models (ABMs)</a> and remote sensing. Hedgehogs seem to like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubus">brambles</a> and so as part of his work he has produced a <a href="https://gabrielmahler.org/environment/ai/ml/%F0%9F%A6%94/2025/08/07/summer5.html">bramble map</a>. He did this by combining the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20380">TESSERA earth representation embeddings</a> (using the <a href="https://github.com/ucam-eo/geotessera">geotessera</a> library) with data from <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>. The current model is an ensemble of <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html">logistic regression</a> and a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html">knn</a> classifier.</p>
<p>Can we really see brambles from space? What better way to test the model than a quick field trip around Cambridge. Gabriel, <a href="https://anil.recoil.org/">Anil</a>, <a href="https://www.shaneweisz.com/">Shane</a> and I did just that today.</p>

<figcaption>Gabriel's model overlaid on a map - which was quite hard to read in outdoor sunlight</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We started at Milton Community Centre, as the model was relatively confident there were brambles near the car park and along the path to Milton Park. It took us about 20 seconds to find the first one in an area indicated by the model.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://toao.com/static/20250924_130422.jpg" alt="Our first bramble!">
<figcaption>Our first bramble!</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So it turns out that there's a lot of bramble between the community center and entrance to Milton Country Park. We stopped six or seven times before reaching the park entrance. While the model predicted we'd find brambles all over the park, we went for the few areas of very high confidence near the entrance. In every place we checked, we found pretty significant amounts of bramble.</p>

<figcaption>I was fairly sure it was in that direction (and thankfully it was)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We collected photos of all the places we stopped, as well as recording our GPS location. One thought while out exploring is that the model did a great job predicting where we would find very large quantities of bramble without any cover. It didn't have high confidence in other areas where we found smaller brambles under partial cover. Since TESSERA is learned representation from remote sensing data (Sentinel 1 and 2), it would make sense that bramble partially obscured from above might be harder to spot. This is something we can potentially tease apart when we have more validation data.</p>

</figure>

<p>Finally, we were satisfied the model was doing a good job in the park area and decided to pick a hotspot the model was predicting in part of a residential street. We drove over to find an empty plot that did indeed have a lot of bramble!</p>
<figure>

<p>Another hotspot was on Fen Road and we stopped by to find this absolute unit:</p>

<figcaption>Absolute unit of bramble</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, we headed back in to Cambridge to see what one of the big hotspots in North Cambridge was like. To our amusement we ended up at the local nature reserve Bramblefields, which, true to its name, has a lot of bramble.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://toao.com/static/20250924_143514.jpg" alt="Bramblefields">
<figcaption>Bramblefields</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by how good Gabriel's model was for its simplicity. Great work!</p>
<p>We had hoped to actually re-run the model based on the data we were gathering but that proved tricky on a laptop, in a park. Given the richness of the TESSERA embeddings and the simplicity of the classifiers being used, a mobile phone-based human-in-the-loop active learning setup could be practical..</p>

This is kind of weird because while having Discord open and I'm in Chrome, the lag still occurs, but it's fixed if I minimize Discord (even though Chrome is fully in focus and maximized). This happens since upgrading to macOS 26 RC, macOS 15 didn't have this issue.<br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>22 years ago, on September 23, 2003, AMD changed the game for x86 once and for all. They released the Athlon 64 CPU, a chip that did something Intel didn’t want. Intel didn’t want to extend x86 to 64 bits. But when AMD did it, it forced Intel to clone AMD, rather than the other way around.</p><h2>Why Intel didn’t want to go 64-bit</h2><figure id="attachment_35916" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-35916"><a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/athlon-64-how-amd-turned-the-tables-on-intel/amd_athlon64_badge/" rel="attachment wp-att-35916"><img data-recalc-dims="1" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AMD_Athlon64_Badge.png?resize=266%2C300&amp;ssl=1" alt="AMD Athlon 64" width="266" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AMD_Athlon64_Badge.png?resize=266%2C300&amp;ssl=1 266w, https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AMD_Athlon64_Badge.png?w=531&amp;ssl=1 531w" sizes="(max-width: 266px) 100vw, 266px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-35916">With the Athlon 64, AMD pulled x86 kicking and screaming into the world of 64-bit, dragging Intel along with it.</figcaption></figure><p>Even in 2001, x86 had decades of baggage attached to it. It was a 32-bit architecture that had been extended from a 16-bit architecture. But that in turn had been extended from an 8-bit CPU design from 1972 that, believe it or not, originated at <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/first-desktop-computer/">Datapoint</a>, not Intel.</p><p>This was great for backward compatibility. 8-bit applications were very easy to port to x86 in the early 1980s, and those early DOS applications still ran flawlessly on modern systems 30 years later. For that matter, it’s not impossible to get them running even today.</p><p>Removal of the ability to run 16-bit applications in 64-bit Windows was a design decision, not a technical limitation.</p><p>Intel wanted to start over to go 64-bit. Without having to worry about backward compatibility, they could design something that would be faster and more efficient. In theory at least, it would be able to scale higher in clock speed. And there was no question a new design would outperform a theoretical 64-bit x86 when running at the same speed because of efficiency.</p><p>And if you are cynical, there was one more motivation. If Intel could start over, they wouldn’t have to worry about competing CPU designs, at least not for a very long time. The new design would be encumbered with so many patents, it might be 20 years before someone could clone it.</p><p>Keep in mind that in 2003, not only was AMD in the picture, but <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/what-happened-to-transmeta-the-last-big-dotcom-ipo/">Transmeta</a> was still in the picture, and <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/cyrix-processor-chips/">Cyrix</a> was fading but not completely gone.</p><p>Starting over with a new CPU architecture outright was massively attractive to Intel.</p><p>This new 64-bit architecture wasn’t theoretical, either. Intel was producing it. It was called Itanium, and Intel first released it in June 2001.</p><h2>AMD’s risky bet and why they made it</h2><p>AMD was well aware of the shortcomings of extending x86 to 64 bits. And they did it anyway. For them, the stakes were completely different.</p><p>AMD knew that if Itanium caught on, that would be the end for them as a CPU company, unless maybe they wanted to become just another ARM licensee. Being just another ARM licensee is more attractive in 2025 than it was in 2003.</p><p>But they could see Itanium wasn’t catching on. It had its uses, and it was doing well enough in those niches, but Windows on Itanium was a non-starter. So much so, <em>The Register</em> called it “Itanic.”</p><p>AMD bet that there would be appeal in a 64-bit architecture that was fully backward compatible with x86 and natively ran 32-bit applications at full speed. People would be able to run 32-bit Windows and 32-bit applications on it if they needed to, and then when they were ready for 64-bit software, the hardware was there and ready to go. And they could continue to run 32-bit apps in 64-bit operating systems as long as needed to ease the transition.</p><p>The transition to 32 bits took a decade. AMD reasoned more people would be willing to upgrade to 64 bits if they made that transition as similar as the transition from the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/286-vs-386sx/">286 to the 386</a> as possible.</p><p>They believed the market would willingly trade lower 64-bit performance in the long term for better 32-bit performance right away. They also believed that if Microsoft was willing to build Windows on Itanium, they would be willing to take a chance on 64-bit x86 as well.</p><p>So on September 23, 2003, AMD launched its Athlon 64, the first 64-bit x86 CPU.</p><h2>Why the Athlon 64 was a hit</h2><p>AMD64 was everything AMD hoped it would be. It was backward compatible with 32-bit x86. The 64-bit builds of Windows weren’t available immediately, and they didn’t catch on immediately, but you cannot say nobody used them. People did, in fact, use them. In late 2005, I was in charge of administering the complimentary antivirus software that Charter Communications provided to its subscribers. I’m not going to say say someone called me every day wanting 64-bit antivirus for 64-bit Windows. But it did happen once a week.</p><p>The transition took at least as long as AMD expected. <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/64-bits-or-bust/">When I finally bought an Athlon 64 in 2011</a>, I found native 64-bit software was still scarce. I’m an outspoken Firefox fan; the reason I briefly switched to <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/google-chrome-launched-september-2-2008/">Google Chrome</a> was to get a 64-bit web browser.</p><h3>The Athlon 64 in the enterprise</h3><p>A few months later, I got a better job with more pay and better growth potential. I can’t talk a lot about the job, but I was administering a mission critical system that ran on Windows, mostly on Dell hardware. I mention <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/history-of-dell-computers/">Dell</a> because they were exclusively an Intel vendor for years. Cofounder and longtime AMD CEO <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/jerry-sanders-cofounder-of-amd/">Jerry Sanders</a> once said of Michael Dell, “I can’t sell him a[n AMD] <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/amd-k6-released-april-2-1997/">K6</a> no matter what I do.”</p><p>It was the Athlon 64 that made Dell relent and finally start using AMD CPUs. Not only were they using them on desktop systems, but they were putting AMD CPUs in servers, an idea that would have been extremely controversial 5 years before. At least in the circles I ran in.</p><p>The Athlon 64 caught on because, in spite of its name, it was an outstanding 32-bit CPU. It was faster than an Intel CPU running at the same clock rate, and it used less power as well. The power consumption was the key to getting into the data center. The Intel name was a security blanket, even though AMD had been making x86 CPUs exactly as long as Intel. But certain decision makers bought Intel marketing and saw AMD as a second tier brand.</p><p>The thing is, when you have a data center with hundreds of systems in it, the money you save on a more efficient CPU really talks.</p><p>Replacing Intel Prescott-based servers with AMD64 servers was not a universally popular idea. But you could tell a difference when you were standing behind a rack full of Intel-based servers versus a rack full of AMD based servers. The Intels ran hotter.</p><p>From an uptime perspective, we couldn’t see a difference. The performance metrics I collected showed there was a slight difference, and that difference was in AMD’s favor. So the AMD critics quickly ate their words.</p><h3>Intel giving in and cloning AMD64</h3><p>In 2004, Intel wrote off the Itanium and cloned AMD64. They called it Intel64, but it was a blatant copy of the AMD implementation. A quirk in the agreements that allowed AMD to use the x86 instruction set also gave Intel the rights to use the AMD64 instructions. So there was nothing illegal about what Intel did. Itanium continued to see use in specialized applications, but Intel quietly discontinued it in 2020.</p><p>AMD and Intel have been chasing and catching each other ever since. One of them will pass the other for a CPU generation or two, and then they will change positions. It’s not terribly different from the situation in 1999 with the <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/amd-athlon-amds-game-changing-cpu-from-1999/">original Athlon</a>, when AMD outperformed Intel for the first time. The question in everyone’s mind was whether they would do it a second time. The Athlon 64 was the second time.</p><p>It was a big step forward. Eight years before, AMD was trying to pass off a high-clocked <a href="https://dfarq.homeip.net/amd-5x86-announced-september-1995/">486 as a Pentium equivalent</a>. With the Athlon 64, AMD was innovating.</p><div itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemscope="" itemprop="author"><p><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/dfarq.homeip.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dave_farquhar_181px.jpg?resize=100%2C100&amp;ssl=1" width="100" height="100" alt="" itemprop="image"></p><div><p>David Farquhar is a computer security professional, entrepreneur, and author.

          <p>
  The European Union wants to force tech companies to scan your private messages &amp; images, even in your favorite encrypted apps.
</p>


<h2>Introduction 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#introduction" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>The 🇪🇺 European Union is advancing legislation that could fundamentally change how we communicate online. <strong>ChatControl</strong> would require <em>all</em> messaging platforms to automatically scan their users’ private messages and images.</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong>, even encrypted ones like <em>Signal</em>, <em>WhatsApp</em> and <em>Telegram</em>. <strong>No</strong>, you can’t opt out.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another privacy policy update you can ignore. If passed, this EU regulation (<em>strongest and most binding legal instrument in EU law</em>) would automatically apply to all member states without any wiggle room for national interpretation. It would even override constitutional protections for communication privacy and establish unprecedented mass surveillance of private communications.</p>
<p>The official justification? Fighting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_sexual_abuse_material" target="_blank">child sexual abuse material</a> (CSAM). Protecting children is undeniably crucial, but the proposed methods would eliminate digital privacy for 450 million Europeans and set a global precedent for mass surveillance.</p>
<p>This surveillance trend extends beyond Europe: 🇨🇭 Switzerland is advancing metadata retention requirements, the 🇬🇧 UK is implementing comprehensive age verification systems and now the 🇪🇺 EU proposes to scan <em>every private message</em>. Each initiative is positioned as child protection policy, but the implications reach far beyond their stated goals.</p>

<h2>What is ChatControl 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#what-is-chatcontrol" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>ChatControl is what critics call the EU’s proposed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_to_Prevent_and_Combat_Child_Sexual_Abuse" target="_blank">Regulation to Prevent and Combat Child Sexual Abuse</a>, also known as CSAR (<em>Child Sexual Abuse Regulation</em>).</p>
<p>The proposal builds on surveillance techniques already deployed by major tech companies. Meta analyzes all Facebook Messenger conversations and unencrypted WhatsApp data (profile photos, group descriptions). Apple announced similar scanning for iCloud content in 2021, though they later suspended the program.</p>
<p>This turns voluntary corporate surveillance into mandatory government-ordered scanning. A temporary 2021 EU regulation allowed platforms to scan content voluntarily for three years. That authorization expired in 2024, which is why CSAR was proposed. The temporary regulation merely permitted scanning; CSAR would make detection obligatory under certain conditions.</p>
<p>There’s also the <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/internal-security/lawful-access-data_en" target="_blank">Roadmap for Lawful Access to Data</a> which has an even bigger goal: making all our digital data readable by authorities upon request. We’ll dive deeper into this broader surveillance agenda later.</p>

<h3>Scope and Coverage 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#scope-and-coverage" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>CSAR casts an extremely wide net. The regulation would apply to all <em>interpersonal communication service providers</em>, not just obvious targets like Signal, WhatsApp, or Telegram, but also:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email providers</li>
<li>Dating apps</li>
<li>Gaming platforms with chat features</li>
<li>Social media platforms</li>
<li>File hosting services (Google Drive, iCloud, DropBox…)</li>
<li>App stores</li>
<li>Even small community hosting services run by associations</li>
</ul>
<p>This means virtually any digital service that allows people to communicate or share content would fall under surveillance requirements. The scope extends far beyond what most people imagine when they hear <em>messaging apps</em>.</p>

<h2>How it Works 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#how-it-works" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h2>
<p>ChatControl relies on <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/doc/2020/fact-sheet-client-side-scanning/" target="_blank">Client-Side Scanning</a>. Your device becomes a monitoring station that analyzes your content before encryption happens.</p>
<p>This represents a fundamental shift away from traditional surveillance that intercepts messages during transmission. With ChatControl, every message gets automatically checked, assuming everyone is guilty until proven innocent and effectively reversing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption_of_innocence" target="_blank">presumption of innocence</a>.</p>

<h3>Technical Implementation

    <figcaption>How does Chat Control work?</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The system would automatically scan for three categories of content <strong>before</strong> encryption:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Known illegal content</strong>: Images or videos already catalogued by authorities as CSAM. Your device creates <em>hash fingerprints</em> of your content and compares them against databases of known illegal material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unknown potential content</strong>: Photos or videos that might constitute CSAM but haven’t been previously identified. AI algorithms analyze visual elements (like exposed skin) to flag potentially problematic content based on statistical models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Grooming behavior</strong>: Text analysis using AI to identify communication patterns that match predefined indicators of adults soliciting children. This involves scanning the actual content of your private conversations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If something gets flagged, it automatically gets reported to authorities. No human checks it first, that would be impossible given the billions of daily messages. This would be mandatory for all messaging platforms in 🇪🇺 Europe.</p>

<h3>Why This Breaks Encryption 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#why-this-breaks-encryption" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>

  
  
  
  





<p>ChatControl <strong>doesn’t break encryption, it bypasses it entirely</strong>. While your messages still get encrypted during transmission, the system defeats the purpose of end-to-end encryption by examining your content before it gets encrypted. True <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption" target="_blank">E2EE</a> means only you and your recipient can read messages: no government, no company, no algorithm should peek inside. This surveillance violates that principle by inserting monitoring at the source.</p>
<p>Privacy-focused companies like Proton <a href="https://proton.me/blog/fr/why-client-side-scanning-isnt-the-answer" target="_blank">point out</a> this approach might be <strong>worse than encryption backdoors</strong>. Backdoors give authorities access to communications you share with others. This system examines everything on your device, whether you share it or not.</p>
<p>Your encrypted messaging app becomes spyware. Supporters claim this protects privacy because scanning happens locally, but surveillance built into your device makes it <strong>impossible to escape</strong>.</p>

<h3>Governance Structure 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#governance-structure" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes" target="_blank">Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The proposal would create a centralized <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2976" target="_blank">EU Centre on Child Sexual Abuse</a> to receive all reports, but EU institutions wouldn’t control the scanning technology itself.</p>
<p>Service providers would face additional obligations beyond scanning. They would need to conduct <em>risk assessments</em> to evaluate and minimize the potential for illegal content sharing on their platforms. This requires collecting detailed information about their users (<em>age groups, content types</em>) that many privacy-focused services deliberately avoid gathering.</p>
<p>The regulation also pushes for mandatory age verification systems. No viable, privacy-respecting age verification technology currently exists. These systems would eliminate online anonymity, requiring users to prove their identity to access digital services.</p>

  </span>

  <span><strong>Rules for thee, but not for me</strong>: While ordinary Europeans would have all their messages scanned, the proposed legislation includes exemptions for government accounts used for “<em>national security purposes, maintaining law and order or military purposes</em>”. Convenient.</span>

<p>ChatControl fits into a broader political strategy. Since the 1990s <em>crypto wars</em>, certain states have argued that privacy-protecting technologies, especially encryption, obstruct police investigations. These technologies are designed to do exactly that, protect everyone’s ability to control their expression and communication.</p>
<p>The European Commission’s <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/news/commission-presents-roadmap-effective-and-lawful-access-data-law-enforcement-2025-06-24_en" target="_blank">Roadmap for Lawful Access to Data</a> wants to make all digital data accessible to authorities by 2030. This involves systematically weakening encryption rather than simply bypassing it.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a>’s revelations ten years ago led to widespread adoption of encryption and institutional consensus supporting the right to encrypted communication. But governments remain frustrated by their inability to access private communications. We’re seeing a return to authoritarian positions using terrorism, organized crime and child exploitation as justifications for undermining encryption.</p>
<p>🇩🇰 <strong>Danish Minister of Justice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hummelgaard" target="_blank">Peter Hummelgaard</a></strong>, chief architect of the current ChatControl proposal, <a href="https://www.ft.dk/samling/20231/almdel/REU/spm/1426/index.htm" target="_blank">recently stated</a>: <em>“We must break with the totally erroneous perception that it is everyone’s civil liberty to communicate on encrypted messaging services.”</em> Well, there you have it folks: <strong>encrypted communication</strong> isn’t a civil liberty anymore. You <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk" target="_blank">cypherpunks</a> were wrong all along. /s</p>
<p>Similarly in 🇫🇷 France, both Bernard Cazeneuve and Emmanuel Macron have explicitly stated their desire to control encrypted messaging, seeking to pierce the privacy of millions who use these services.</p>
<p>CSAR provides the perfect opportunity for member states to finally design and implement a generalized surveillance tool for monitoring population communications. Crossing this threshold means eliminating all confidentiality from communications using digital infrastructure.</p>

<p>These scanning systems get it wrong most of the time. <strong>Studies show approximately 80% of algorithmic reports are false positives</strong>: innocent content incorrectly flagged as illegal. 🇮🇪 Irish law enforcement <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/an-garda-siochana-unlawfully-retains-files-on-innocent-people-who-it-has-already-cleared-of-producing-or-sharing-of-child-sex-abuse-material/" target="_blank">confirms this</a>: only 20.3% of 4,192 automated reports actually contained illegal material.</p>

<p>Even with hypothetical 99% accuracy (<em>which current systems don’t achieve</em>), scanning billions of daily messages would generate millions of false accusations. Police resources would be overwhelmed investigating innocent families sharing vacation photos while real crimes go uninvestigated.</p>
<p>Innocent content regularly triggers these systems: family photos, teenage conversations, educational materials and medical communications. Consider this real case: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/21/technology/google-surveillance-toddler-photo.html" target="_blank">a father was automatically reported to police</a> after sending photos of his child’s medical condition to their doctor. Google’s algorithms flagged this legitimate medical consultation as potential abuse, permanently closed his account and refused all appeals. His digital life was destroyed by an algorithm that couldn’t distinguish between medical care and criminal activity.</p>

<h3>Scientific Opposition

<p>For the third time in three years, over 600 cryptographers, security researchers and scientists across 35 countries have <a href="https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/danger-to-democracy-500-top-scientists-urge-eu-governments-to-reject-technically-infeasible-chat-control/" target="_blank">co-signed an open letter</a> explaining why this mass scanning project is “<em>technically unfeasible</em>”, constitutes a “<em>danger to democracy</em>” and would “<em>completely compromise</em>” the security and privacy of all European citizens.</p>
<p>The letter emphasizes that client-side scanning cannot distinguish between legal and illegal content without fundamentally breaking encryption and creating vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Commission has provided no serious studies demonstrating the effectiveness, reliability or appropriateness of these intrusive measures for actually protecting children. Industry claims appear to have taken precedence over evidence-based policy-making.</p>
<p>Genuine security emerges through thoughtful design where security measures and civil liberties function as complementary forces, not opposing ones.</p>

<h3>Easily Defeated 
    
    
    <span>
        <a href="#easily-defeated" aria-label="Anchor">#</a>
    </span>        
    
</h3>
<p>The fundamental flaw in ChatControl becomes clear when examining how easily determined actors can circumvent these scanning systems. Criminals don’t need sophisticated techniques to bypass client-side scanning; they use well-documented public knowledge already employed by malicious actors.</p>
<p><strong>Layered Encryption</strong><br>
Encrypt files with standard tools like <a href="https://gnupg.org/" target="_blank">GPG</a> before messaging. Hell, even a basic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher" target="_blank">Caesar cipher</a> would be sufficient to bypass detection. Since client-side scanning occurs after user encryption but before transport encryption, pre-encrypted content looks like random data to detection algorithms. Recipients decrypt locally with shared keys.</p>
<p><strong>External Platform Bypass</strong><br>
Upload content to any third-party platform (Dropbox, OneDrive, anonymous file hosts, or obscure hosting services) and share links instead of files. The scanner sees innocent text containing a URL while the actual content sits untouched on external servers.</p>
<p><strong>Custom Messaging Clients</strong><br>
Open-source protocols like <a href="https://xmpp.org/" target="_blank">XMPP</a> and <a href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank">Matrix</a> allow custom client development. Modified clients can automatically implement cloud storage and encryption workflows transparently. Users experience normal messaging while completely evading surveillance infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Steganography</strong><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography" target="_blank">Steganographic techniques</a> embed data within innocent images. Family photos can carry hidden payloads invisible to both human operators and AI systems. Tools like <a href="https://www.openstego.com/" target="_blank">OpenStego</a> make this accessible to average users.</p>
<p><strong>Platform Migration</strong><br>
Criminal networks can shift to decentralized platforms, peer-to-peer networks or services outside EU jurisdiction. Tor-based messaging, blockchain communications or servers in non-compliant countries remain beyond ChatControl’s reach.</p>
<p>ChatControl catches only amateur criminals who directly attach problematic content to messages. Professional networks already employ these evasion techniques as standard practice. EU legislation won’t make them forget how computers work.</p>
<p>The system fails at protecting children while succeeding at mass civilian monitoring. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/it%27s_not_a_bug,_it%27s_a_feature" target="_blank">It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.</a></p>

<p>The child protection narrative masks concerning business interests. The European Commission based its CSAR proposal primarily on claims from industry players rather than independent research.</p>
<p>Commercial surveillance companies would manage the technology with guaranteed access to the European market. Organizations like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28organization%29" target="_blank">Thorn</a> (co-founded by actor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashton_Kutcher" target="_blank">Ashton Kutcher</a>), Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna" target="_blank">PhotoDNA</a> and other tech companies develop these detection systems while simultaneously lobbying for regulations that would require their adoption across Europe.</p>
<p>These companies develop the detection technologies and lobby for laws mandating their adoption, creating a profitable feedback loop. The proposal would secure privileged market positions for surveillance companies across hundreds of millions of European users. Pretty nice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>These systems would be:</strong></p>

<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_of_the_children" target="_blank">Think of the children</a>” is a well-documented political rhetoric technique that appeals to emotion rather than evidence. While child protection is genuinely important, this approach frames any opposition as being against child welfare, making nuanced discussion more difficult.</p>
<p>This creates a false choice. Privacy isn’t a luxury for troublemakers, it’s a <strong>fundamental right</strong> that protects journalists, whistleblowers, activists and ordinary people from unwarranted intrusion.</p>
<p>Critics aren’t opposing child protection. We’re questioning whether undermining privacy rights for 450 million 🇪🇺 Europeans is the most effective approach when targeted alternatives exist that preserve rights.</p>

<p>🇪🇪 <strong>Estonia</strong>: Acknowledges sincere concerns about child exploitation, but opposes undermining end-to-end encryption and forcing mass surveillance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🇫🇮 <strong>Finland</strong>: Cannot support the latest compromise proposal because it contains a constitutionally problematic identification order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🇱🇺 <strong>Luxembourg</strong>: Rejects broad surveillance measures like client-side scanning and insists that EU regulation must ensure proportional, targeted detection to protect citizens’ fundamental rights.</p>

<summary><strong>🤷 Undecided positions</strong> (click to expand)</summary>
<ul>
<li>🇧🇪 <strong>Belgium</strong>: The N-VA party calls ChatControl a <em>“monster that invades your privacy and cannot be tamed”</em>. Despite this, Belgium backed Denmark’s compromise during September meetings. Mixed signals from Brussels.</li>
<li>🇩🇪 <strong>Germany</strong>: Won’t break encryption but wants to find middle ground. They’re trying to craft their own compromise instead of rejecting ChatControl outright. Germany’s fence-sitting could be decisive.</li>
<li>🇬🇷 <strong>Greece</strong>: Still figuring out the technical details. No clear stance yet.</li>
<li>🇮🇹 <strong>Italy</strong>: Has concerns about expanding the scope to cover new CSAM detection. Rome seems hesitant about how far this thing could reach.</li>
<li>🇱🇻 <strong>Latvia</strong>: The government likes what they see on paper but worries about political backlash after summer attention. Classic politicians hedging their bets.</li>
<li>🇸🇰 <strong>Slovakia</strong>: Playing the wait-and-see game. No commitment either way.</li>
<li>🇸🇮 <strong>Slovenia</strong>: Dealing with constitutional headaches around privacy. Another country wrestling with legal implications.</li>
<li>🇸🇪 <strong>Sweden</strong>: Stockholm is still reading the fine print. Taking their time to decide.</li>

<p><strong>Current situation</strong>: Country positions continue shifting regularly since September 12. With 12 countries supporting, 7 opposing, and 8 undecided, ChatControl supporters still fall short of the 65% EU population threshold needed for a qualified majority. The opposition maintains enough demographic weight to block the proposal for now, but the situation remains fluid as the interim regulation approaches expiration.</p>

<p>The effects of these proposals go beyond individual privacy concerns.</p>
<p><strong>Cybersecurity gets compromised</strong><br>
Adding deliberate vulnerabilities to encryption creates weaknesses that everyone can exploit. Any backdoor for authorized access becomes a potential entry point for criminals and foreign intelligence services. In February 2024, the 🇪🇺 European Court of Human Rights <a href="https://edri.org/our-work/european-court-of-human-rights-confirms-weakening-of-encryption-can-violate-the-human-right-to-privacy/" target="_blank">already determined</a> that mandating weakened encryption “<em>cannot be regarded as necessary in a democratic society</em>”.</p>
<p><strong>Innovation suffers</strong><br>
🇪🇺 European cybersecurity companies would face an impossible situation in global markets. How could they credibly sell security solutions when regulations require them to build in access mechanisms that undermine those very protections?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Buy our ultra-secure encrypted stuff!” (Terms and conditions apply, government backdoors included)."</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Tech companies will leave Europe</strong><br>
Privacy-focused services that moved to 🇪🇺 Europe after the Snowden revelations are already signaling they might leave. Signal has explicitly said it would stop operating in 🇪🇺 Europe rather than compromise its security.</p>
<p>Even 🇨🇭 Switzerland, traditionally seen as a privacy haven, is facing severe legislative pressures that are forcing tech companies to relocate. Proton has confirmed it has <a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/is-proton-leaving-switzerland-legal-uncertainty-of-proposed-surveillance-laws-is-pushing-them-to-make-several-changes" target="_blank">begun moving some of its physical infrastructure out of Switzerland</a> due to “<em>legal uncertainty</em>” over the proposed surveillance law amendments. Lumo, their AI chatbot, became the first product <a href="https://proton.me/blog/lumo-ai" target="_blank">to relocate</a>, moving to Germany instead of Switzerland specifically because of these legislative concerns.</p>
<p>The Swiss <strong>OSCPT</strong> (<em>Ordinance on the Surveillance of Correspondence by Post and Telecommunications</em>) revision would require VPNs and messaging apps to identify users and retain data for up to six months, plus decrypt communications upon authority request. As Proton’s CEO <strong>Andy Yen</strong> explained, these are proposals that “<em>have been outlawed in the EU</em>” but could soon become reality in Switzerland.</p>
<p>Other privacy-focused providers like Tuta have <a href="https://tuta.com/blog/switzerland-surveillance-plan" target="_blank">expressed</a> similar concerns and contingency plans to leave 🇨🇭 Switzerland if the surveillance laws pass.</p>
<p><strong>Europe might become dependent on US surveillance</strong><br>
I’m not so sure on this one, but by outsourcing surveillance technology to American companies, 🇪🇺 Europe may create dangerous dependencies. These companies operate under 🇺🇸 US jurisdiction and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act" target="_blank">CLOUD Act</a>, potentially allowing 🇺🇸 Washington to access data collected on 🇪🇺 European citizens. Under the pretense of child protection, the 🇪🇺 EU risks handing surveillance keys to foreign powers.</p>
<p><strong>Social behavior changes</strong><br>
When people know they’re being watched, they change how they communicate. People start self-censoring, avoiding certain topics and carefully choosing their words even in private conversations.</p>
<p>This is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect" target="_blank">chilling effect</a>. Rights don’t disappear overnight: they erode gradually as people change their behavior to avoid potential problems.</p>

<p>The irony is kinda painful: the continent that built <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" target="_blank">GDPR</a> to protect digital privacy now designs ChatControl to dismantle it systematically. What was once a fundamental right could become mandatory surveillance.</p>
<p>ChatControl represents a historic choice for 🇪🇺 Europe. Either we become the first democracy to normalize mass surveillance of private communications or we defend the digital rights that made Europe a global privacy leader.</p>

It revealed how Azure was being used to store and process the trove of Palestinian communications in a mass surveillance programme.</p><p>In a joint investigation with the Israeli-Palestinian publication<a href="https://www.972mag.com/microsoft-8200-intelligence-surveillance-cloud-azure/" data-link-name="in body link"> +972 Magazine</a> and the Hebrew-language outlet <a href="https://www.mekomit.co.il/%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9c%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f-%d7%a9%d7%99%d7%97%d7%95%d7%aa-%d7%91%d7%a9%d7%a2%d7%94-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%90%d7%92%d7%a8-%d7%a9%d7%9c-8200-%d7%a2%d7%9c-%d7%a9%d7%a8%d7%aa%d7%99-%d7%9e%d7%99/" data-link-name="in body link">Local Call</a>, the Guardian revealed how Microsoft and Unit 8200 had worked together on a plan to move large volumes of sensitive intelligence material into Azure.</p><p>The project began after a meeting in 2021 between Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, and the unit’s then commander, Yossi Sariel.</p><p>In response to the investigation, Microsoft ordered an urgent external inquiry to review its relationship with Unit 8200. Its initial findings have now led the company to cancel the unit’s access to some of its cloud storage and AI services.</p><p>Equipped with Azure’s near-limitless storage capacity and computing power, Unit 8200 had built an indiscriminate new system allowing its intelligence officers to collect, play back and analyse the content of cellular calls of an entire population.</p><p>The project was so expansive that, according to sources from Unit 8200 – which is equivalent in its remit to the US National Security Agency – a mantra emerged internally that captured its scale and ambition: “A million calls an hour.”</p><p>According to several sources, the enormous repository of intercepted calls – which amounted to as much as 8,000 terabytes of data – was held in a Microsoft datacentre in the Netherlands. Within days of the Guardian publishing the investigation, Unit 8200 appears to have swiftly moved the surveillance data out of the country.</p><p>According to sources familiar with the huge data transfer outside of the EU country, it occurred in early August. Intelligence sources said Unit 8200 planned to transfer the data to the Amazon Web Services cloud platform. Neither the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) nor Amazon responded to a request for comment.</p><p>The extraordinary decision by Microsoft to end the spy agency’s access to key technology was made amid pressure from employees and investors over its work for Israel’s military and the role its technology has played in the almost two-year offensive in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Gaza</a>.</p><p>A United Nations commission of inquiry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/16/israel-committed-genocide-in-gaza-says-un-inquiry" data-link-name="in body link">recently concluded</a> that Israel had committed genocide in Gaza, a charge denied by Israel but supported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/01/israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-worlds-top-scholars-on-the-say" data-link-name="in body link">many experts</a> in international law.</p><p>The Guardian’s joint investigation prompted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/26/microsoft-employee-sit-in-israeli-military-ties" data-link-name="in body link">protests at Microsoft’s US headquarters</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/10/activists-in-netherlands-protest-on-roof-of-microsoft-site-storing-israeli-military-data" data-link-name="in body link">one of its European datacentres</a>, as well as demands by a worker-led campaign group, No Azure for Apartheid, to end all ties to the Israeli military.</p><figure id="b8c99a97-a3c0-47f0-aec1-b4c2e288b1e3" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-2"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="No Azure for Apartheid demonstrators " src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1416cde65d2a0b1d0d21744f5047812a997de5/403_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="356" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Demonstrators outside a Microsoft event in Seattle in May.</span> Photograph: Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>On Thursday, Microsoft’s vice-chair and president, Brad Smith, informed staff of the decision.

We have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.”</p><p>The decision brings to an abrupt end a three-year period in which the spy agency operated its surveillance programme using Microsoft’s technology.</p><p>Unit 8200 used its own expansive surveillance capabilities to intercept and collect the calls. The spy agency then used a customised and segregated area within the Azure platform, allowing for the data to be retained for extended periods of time and analysed using AI-driven techniques.</p><p>Although the initial focus of the surveillance system was the West Bank, where an estimated 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli military occupation, intelligence sources said the cloud-based storage platform had been used in the Gaza offensive to facilitate the preparation of deadly airstrikes.</p><p>The revelations highlighted how Israel has relied on the services and infrastructure of major US technology companies to support its bombardment of Gaza, which has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and created a profound humanitarian and starvation crisis.</p><figure id="41adb301-3590-4416-b2e1-1b7e6d173af5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.QABlockElement"><gu-island name="QandaAtom" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;ea5c99b8-694b-4577-9ff6-726c78be1c34&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;How many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?&quot;,&quot;html&quot;:&quot;<p>According to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people. </p><p></p><p>The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure&amp;nbsp;only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.</p><p></p><p>According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.</p>&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"><div data-atom-id="ea5c99b8-694b-4577-9ff6-726c78be1c34" data-atom-type="qanda"><details data-atom-id="ea5c99b8-694b-4577-9ff6-726c78be1c34" data-snippet-type="qanda"><summary><span>Q&amp;A</span><h4>How many Palestinians have been killed in Israel's campaign against Gaza?</h4><span><span><span></span>Show</span></span></summary><div><p>According to health officials in Gaza, at least 60,000 people have been killed during Israel’s current military campaign, launched after the Hamas-led attack on 7 October 2023 which killed nearly 1,200 people. </p><p>The actual death toll is likely to be significantly higher, as the figure&nbsp;only includes Palestinians killed by bombs or bullets whose bodies have been recovered, leaving out thousands trapped under the rubble or killed by starvation and other indirect victims of the campaign.</p><p>According to the data – which includes the deaths of militants – women, children, and elderly people account for approximately 55% of the recorded deaths.</p></div></details></div></gu-island></figure><p>According to a document seen by the Guardian, a senior Microsoft executive told Israel’s ministry of defence late last week: “While our review is ongoing, we have at this juncture identified evidence that supports elements of the Guardian’s reporting.”</p><p>The executive told Israel officials that Microsoft “is not in the business of facilitating the mass surveillance of civilians” and notified them that it would “disable” access to services that supported the Unit 8200 surveillance project and suspend its use of some AI products.</p><p>The termination is the first known case of a US technology company withdrawing services provided to the Israeli military since the beginning of its war on Gaza.</p><p>The decision has not affected Microsoft’s wider commercial relationship with the IDF, which is a longstanding client and will retain access to other services.

<p>We’ve fixed a significant source of crashes in the engine: hit testing using outdated display lists (<a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/issues/37932">issue #37932</a>).
<strong>Hit testing</strong> in a web rendering engine is the process that determines which element(s) the user’s mouse is hovering over.</p>
<p>Previously, this process ran inside of <a href="https://github.com/servo/webrender">WebRender</a>, which receives a display list representing what should be rendered for a particular page.
WebRender runs on a separate thread or process from the actual page content, so display lists are updated asynchronously.
By the time we do a hit test, the elements reported may not exist anymore, so we could trigger crashes by (for example) moving the mouse quickly over parts of the page that were rapidly changing.</p>
<p>This was fixed by making the hit test operation synchronous and moving it into the same thread as the actual content being tested against, eliminating the possibility of outdated results (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kongbai1996">@kongbai1996</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38480">#38480,</a> <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38464">#38464,</a> <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38463">#38463,</a> <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38884">#38884,</a> <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38518">#38518)</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API"><strong>IndexedDB</strong></a> implementation (gated behind <code>dom_indexeddb_enabled</code>) is progressing quickly (<a href="https://github.com/arihant2math">@arihant2math</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jdm">@jdm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rodion">@rodion</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kkoyung">@kkoyung</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/28744">#28744</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38737">#38737</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38836">#38836</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38813">#38813</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38819">#38819</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38115">#38115</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38944">#38944</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38740">#38740</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38891">#38891</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38723">#38723</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38850">#38850</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38735">#38735</a>), now reporting errors via <code>IDBRequest</code> interface and supporting autoincrement keys.</p>
<p>A prototype implementation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore"><strong>CookieStore</strong> API</a> is now implemented and gated by the <code>dom_cookiestore_enabled</code> preference (<a href="https://github.com/sebsebmc">@sebsebmc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37968">#37968</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38876">#38876</a>).</p>
<p>Servo now passes over <strong>99.6% of the <a href="https://drafts.fxtf.org/geometry/">CSS geometry</a> test suite</strong>, thanks to an implementation of <strong>matrixTransform() on DOMPointReadOnly</strong>, making all geometry interfaces serializable, and adding the <strong>SVGMatrix and SVGPoint aliases</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/lumiscosity">@lumiscosity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38801">#38801</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38828">#38828</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38810">#38810</a>).</p>
<p>You can now use the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoderStream"><strong>TextEncoderStream</strong> API</a> (<a href="https://github.com/minghuaw">@minghuaw</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38466">#38466</a>).
Streams that are piped now correctly pass through <code>undefined</code> values, too (<a href="https://github.com/gterzian">@gterzian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38470">#38470</a>).
We also fixed a crash in the result of <strong>pipeTo() on ReadableStream</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/gterzian">@gterzian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38385">#38385</a>).</p>
<p>We’ve implemented <strong>getModifierState() on MouseEvent</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/PotatoCP">@PotatoCP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38535">#38535</a>), and made a number of changes involving DOM events: <strong>‘mouseleave’ events</strong> are fired when the pointer leaves an &lt;iframe&gt; (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38539">#38539</a>), pasting from the clipboard into a text input triggers an <strong>‘input’ event</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37100">#37100</a>), <strong>focus now occurs after ‘mousedown’</strong> instead of ‘click’ (<a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38589">#38589</a>), we ignore ‘mousedown’ and ‘mouseup’ events for elements that are disabled (<a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38671">#38671</a>), and removing an event handler attribute like ‘onclick’ clears all relevant event listeners (<a href="https://github.com/TimvdLippe">@TimvdLippe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kotx">@kotx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38734">#38734</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/39011">#39011</a>).</p>
<p>Servo now supports <strong>scrollIntoView()</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/abdelrahman1234567">@abdelrahman1234567</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38230">#38230</a>), and fires a <strong>‘scroll’ event</strong> whenever a page is scrolled (<a href="https://github.com/stevennovaryo">@stevennovaryo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38321">#38321</a>).
You can now focus an element without scrolling, by passing the <code>{preventScroll: true}</code> option to focus() (<a href="https://github.com/abdelrahman1234567">@abdelrahman1234567</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38495">#38495</a>).</p>
<p><strong>navigator.sendBeacon()</strong> is now implemented, gated behind the <code>dom_navigator_sendbeacon_enabled</code> preference (<a href="https://github.com/TimvdLippe">@TimvdLippe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38301">#38301</a>).
Similarly, the <strong>AbortSignal.abort()</strong> static method is hidden behind <code>dom_abort_controller_enabled</code> (<a href="https://github.com/Taym95">@Taym95</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38746">#38746</a>).</p>
<p>The <strong>HTMLDocument</strong> interface now exists as a property on the <code>Window</code> object (<a href="https://github.com/leo030303">@leo030303</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38433">#38433</a>).
Meanwhile, the <strong>CSS</strong> window property is now a <a href="https://webidl.spec.whatwg.org/#idl-namespaces">WebIDL namespace</a> (<a href="https://github.com/simonwuelker">@simonwuelker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38579">#38579</a>).
We also implemented the new <strong>QuotaExceededError</strong> interface (<a href="https://github.com/rmeno12">@rmeno12</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38507">#38507</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38720">#38720</a>), which replaces previous usages of DOMException with the <code>QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR</code> name.</p>
<p>Our 2D canvas implementation now supports <strong>addPath() on Path2D</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/arthmis">@arthmis</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37838">#37838</a>) and the <strong>restore()</strong> methods on <strong>CanvasRenderingContext2D</strong> and <strong>OffscreenCanvas</strong> now pop all applied clipping paths (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38496">#38496</a>).
Additionally, we now support <strong>using web fonts in the 2D canvas</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38979">#38979</a>).
Meanwhile, the performance continues to improve in the new <a href="https://github.com/linebender/vello?tab=readme-ov-file#vello">Vello</a>-based backends (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38406">#38406</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38356">#38356</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38440">#38440</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38437">#38437</a>), with asynchronous uploading also showing improvements (<a href="https://github.com/sagudev">@sagudev</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37776">#37776</a>).</p>
<p>Muting media elements with the <strong>‘mute’</strong> HTML attribute now works during the initial resource load (<a href="https://github.com/rayguo17">@rayguo17</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38462">#38462</a>).</p>
<p>Modifying stylesheets now integrates better with incremental layout, in both light trees and shadow trees (<a href="https://github.com/coding-joedow">@coding-joedow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38530">#38530</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38529">#38529</a>).
Note that calling setProperty() on a readonly CSSStyleDeclaration correctly throws an exception (<a href="https://github.com/simonwuelker">@simonwuelker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38677">#38677</a>).</p>

<p>We’ve upgraded to the upstream <strong>Stylo</strong> revision as of August 1, 2025.</p>
<p>We now support custom CSS properties with the <strong>CSS.registerProperty()</strong> method (<a href="https://github.com/simonwuelker">@simonwuelker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38682">#38682</a>), as well as custom element states with the <strong>‘states’ property on ElementInternals</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/simonwuelker">@simonwuelker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38564">#38564</a>).</p>
<p>Flexbox cross sizes can no longer end up negative through stretching (<a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38521">#38521</a>), while ‘stretch’ on flex items now stretches to the line if possible (<a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38526">#38526</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Overflow calculations are more accurate</strong>, now that we ignore ‘position: fixed’ children of the root element (<a href="https://github.com/stevennovaryo">@stevennovaryo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38618">#38618</a>), compute overflow for &lt;body&gt; separate from the viewport (<a href="https://github.com/shubhamg13">@shubhamg13</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38825">#38825</a>), check for ‘overflow: visible’ in parents and children (<a href="https://github.com/shubhamg13">@shubhamg13</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38443">#38443</a>), and propagate ‘overflow’ to the viewport correctly (<a href="https://github.com/shubhamg13">@shubhamg13</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38598">#38598</a>).</p>
<p>‘color’ and ‘text-decoration’ properties no longer inherit into the contents of &lt;select&gt; elements (<a href="https://github.com/simonwuelker">@simonwuelker</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38570">#38570</a>).</p>
<p>Negative outline offsets work correctly (<a href="https://github.com/lumiscosity">@lumiscosity</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38418">#38418</a>).</p>
<p>Video elements no longer fall back to a preferred aspect ratio of 2 (<a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38705">#38705</a>).</p>
<p>‘position: sticky’ elements are handled correctly inside CSS transforms (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38391">#38391</a>).</p>

<p>We fixed several panics this month, involving IntersectionObserver and missing stacking contexts (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38473">#38473</a>), unpaintable canvases and text (<a href="https://github.com/gterzian">@gterzian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38664">#38664</a>), serializing ‘location’ properties on Window objects (<a href="https://github.com/jdm">@jdm</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38709">#38709</a>), and navigations canceled before HTTP headers are received (<a href="https://github.com/gterzian">@gterzian</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38739">#38739</a>).</p>
<p>We also fixed a number of performance pitfalls.
The document rendering loop is now <strong>throttled to 60 FPS</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Loirooriol">@Loirooriol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38431">#38431</a>), while <strong>animated images do less work</strong> when advancing the current frame (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38857">#38857</a>).
In addition, elements with <strong>CSS images will not trigger page reflow</strong> until their image data is fully available (<a href="https://github.com/coding-joedow">@coding-joedow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38916">#38916</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, we made improvements to memory usage and binary size.
Inline stylesheets are now deduplicated, which can have a significant impact on pages with <strong>lots of form inputs</strong> or <strong>custom elements</strong> with common styles (<a href="https://github.com/coding-joedow">@coding-joedow</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38540">#38540</a>).
We also removed many unused pieces of the ICU library, <strong>saving 16MB</strong> from the final binary.</p>

<p>Evaluating JS from the embedding layer now <strong>reports an error</strong> if the evaluation failed for any reason (<a href="https://github.com/rodio">@rodio</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38602">#38602</a>).</p>
<p>Our <strong>WebDriver</strong> implementation now passes 80% of the implementation conformance tests.
This is the result of lots of work on handling user prompts (<a href="https://github.com/PotatoCP">@PotatoCP</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38591">#38591</a>), computing obscured/disabled elements while clicking (<a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38497">#38497</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38841">#38841</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38436">#38436</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38490">#38490</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38383">#38383</a>), and improving window focus behaviours (<a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38889">#38889</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38909">#38909</a>).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>In August, months</span> after Elon Musk left the federal government, the director of the Office of Personnel Management offered the first hard estimate of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s impact on the civil service. The government would likely end 2025 with about 300,000 fewer employees than it had at the start of the year, he told reporters. Most resignations were attributable to the incentives DOGE had offered the federal workforce to resign their positions. The total figure amounted to one in eight workers.</p><p>Well, almost. In recent weeks, hundreds of the employees DOGE pushed out have reportedly been offered reinstatement.</p><p>The true scope of DOGE’s attack on the federal government remains unknown. While there is no reason to think it achieved meaningful cost savings or operational efficiencies, the ramifications of building a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-collecting-immigrant-data-surveil-track/">master database</a> to track and surveil immigrants are just beginning to be felt, and its cadre of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">Musk protégés</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-hud-systems-access-ai-proptech-real-estate-mobile-home/">tech entrepreneurs</a> remain embedded in agencies throughout the executive branch. The possibilities this opens up—of private takeovers of government operations, of the government embracing Silicon Valley’s ethos of moving fast and breaking things—remain open.</p><p>WIRED spoke with more than 200 federal workers across dozens of agencies to gather the most comprehensive picture yet of how the American government got to this point, and where it may go from here. Many sources requested anonymity because they fear retaliation. They told WIRED not just what has been going on inside the federal government at a time of unprecedented change—but what it’s been like to experience those changes firsthand.</p><p>The following is the story, in their words, of what happened when the world’s most powerful man unleashed the world’s richest one on the world’s most complex institution.</p><p>“I kept comparing it to a natural disaster,” one worker at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told WIRED. “But it wasn’t natural. Just a stampede of wide-eyed, confused government employees moving files around and looking over their shoulders because they think maybe Elon was creeping behind them with a chain saw.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>Donald Trump established DOGE within hours of taking office on January 20, assigning it the task of “modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity.” Within days, Musk’s allies and their coterie of <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/">young, inexperienced</a> technologists were appearing in the offices of relatively unknown agencies like the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management—obtaining unprecedented access to government systems and personnel files in the process. The DOGE operatives included young men like Edward “Big Balls” Coristine, Kyle Schutt, and Ethan Shaotran, all of whom would go on to work at a number of government agencies, from the Department of Education to the Social Security Administration.</em></p><p><span>“I met Kyle</span> and Ethan on January 23, and I very briefly bumped into Coristine before anyone was talking about him. I would describe them all as giddy, excited, curious, passionate, and super interested in learning about and jumping in on this new thing. I was super excited too at first.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“Then the next week it felt like everything shifted and suddenly they were no longer curious or asking questions or on an adventure and instead they were just frantically running around trying to do impossible shit with no context and no flexibility and no ability to push back.</p><p>“I thought maybe it would turn around. But it never did.” <em>—General Services Administration (GSA) worker</em></p><hr><p><span>“The first meeting</span> with DOGE—really the only meeting with DOGE, if I'm going to be honest—was … a virtual meeting that was 30 minutes long. In typical DOGE fashion, the government organization that we were promised unbelievable transparency on, they don't turn the cameras on, they don't tell you who they are, they don't tell you if anybody else is in the room, so you have no idea who you're talking to.” <em>—Colin O’Brien, former head of security at the United States Institute of Peace</em></p><hr><p>“We saw them immediately. They acted like new hires but a bit furtive since they were actually instructed not to share their full names with us at first.” <em>—Technology Transformation Services worker</em></p><hr><p><span>“My big aha</span> moment came late, because for so long I was giving them the benefit of the doubt. These guys were young, and they had a job to do, and yes, they were doing it aggressively—but again, I assumed the best. But then Ethan Shaotran went on Fox News, on Jesse Watters. He just trash-talked us pretty bad, conflating things they’d found at other agencies, basically implying we were misappropriating grant money. It made my blood boil. Ethan had to know that wasn’t true. That was it for me—there is no good faith at all.” <em>—Federal worker</em></p><hr><p><span>“The vibe they</span> gave was ‘So, what is it that you do here?’ and ‘Why can’t AI do that?’” <em>—Technology Transformation Services worker</em></p><hr><p><em>During the early weeks of the administration, emails from DOGE started showing up in federal workers’ inboxes—or at least in their spam folders.</em></p><p><span>“I logged on</span> to find several emails tagged ‘External,’ because DOGE just brought in their own servers and plugged them into the network. Then there were several subsequent emails from different leaders saying things like, ‘Thank you for all the phishing reports, but the emails are real and need to be followed. But also please keep reporting things that look like phishing. Except from DOGE … but probably even then. And this is totally fine and normal.’” <em>—Contractor for the Veterans Administration</em></p><hr><p><em>Among the emails was the now infamous “Fork in the Road,” encouraging workers to be loyal or quit. It closely tracked the language of an email sent to Twitter employees not long after Musk’s takeover of that company. A subsequent follow-up was even more insulting.</em></p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>“It was truly</span> so idiotic and looked like it was written by a disturbed child.” <em>—CDC employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“We’re used to</span> every little thing done by regulation, and now we’re just getting crazy emails … This is a 5-alarm fire. This is a constitutional crisis.” <em>—Department of Labor employee</em></p><hr></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“That response shocked me. We knew that this administration had little regard for professionals who choose to work for the federal government, but to state it so publicly, dripping with contempt, was truly unbelievable to me.” <em>—GSA employee</em></p><hr><p><em>Federal employees who remained were forced back to the office. Many found their workplaces increasingly hostile.</em></p><p><span>“A woman I</span> did not know in the cubicle next to me broke down. She was literally wailing, inconsolable, because she could not get into a childcare facility she could afford on such short notice. She literally had to choose between her little child and working. Her explaining to her manager the way her child cried and begged Mommy to stay home broke me. Then, as if on cue, an email from a person whose account said they were the acting IRS commissioner arrived in our inboxes, reminding us that it was “Mental Health Awareness” month and that we can do such helpful things as “practicing gratitude” and breathing techniques to deal with stress. It also reminded us we can take time off to seek professional help … I never saw her again, and her cube is now empty.” <em>—Internal Revenue Service employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“Because we are</span> part of Homeland Security, there’s always an armed guard at FEMA facilities. That’s a very standard thing. But the guys we’re used to seeing are like the contracted-out, office patrol guys—they’re mall cops, to be polite about it. They sit at the desk and make sure you have ID, and that’s the extent of their policing. We have a pretty good relationship with our local guy at the front desk of our building. He’s a nice guy; he’ll walk around our office sometimes. We share our snacks with him.</p><p>“One day he comes in to walk the office, like he does occasionally, and a few minutes after he passes by, another officer walks through. This time, it’s somebody we’ve never seen before, and he’s like, kitted out. He’s dressed in all black from head to toe; he’s got body armor on. He’s wearing a tactical helmet. He’s got a big gun on him, like a rifle, not like a handgun in a side pouch. He did not have a visible name tag, which is not standard at all—everybody in a federal facility is required to identify themselves at all times, and he had no individual identifying markings. The only writing on his uniform was the big yellow text on his back that said HOMELAND SECURITY.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“He was walking through the office as slowly as he could. He would pause behind you and watch what you were doing for five to 20 seconds and then move on. His entire demeanor, it was very obvious he wanted us to see him, and he wanted to see us watching him. These are fucking office workers working on laptops. We’re doing spreadsheets and PowerPoints. Like, chill out, dude.</p><p>“My coworker went over [to the guard] and was like ‘Hey, welcome, can I help you with something, are we in danger? What’s the problem? The officer announces—not just to my coworker but to as many people as can hear him—‘No, I don’t want your help. I’m just here to patrol you and to desensitize you to my presence.’ Then he just keeps on walking. That’s the only thing he’s said to us. He’s been through a couple times now and never gives anyone the time of day—never smiles, never says good morning, just walks through, dresses us all down for a few minutes, and leaves.” <em>—FEMA employee</em></p><hr><p><em>The offices were also quite literally gross—because DOGE had put a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-government-credit-cards/">$1 spending limit</a> on most government credit cards and didn’t make exceptions for basic necessities.</em></p><p><span>“The women’s restroom</span> was out of toilet paper within a week or so of us coming back to the office. I brought this up to Facilities, like, ‘Hey, this is kind of a sanitation and dignity issue, can you hook us up with more toilet paper?’ They were like, ‘We’d love to, but we can’t purchase anything until they unfreeze the cards, and we don’t even know what the process is, because they have them sort of indefinitely frozen.’</p><p>“For five months we were instructed to bring in our own toilet paper. I literally kept two rolls at my desk. I wish I were joking.” <em>—FEMA employee</em></p><hr><p><em>Musk and Trump were eagerly filling government agencies with their allies. At the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Trump installed Scott Turner, a former NFL cornerback.</em></p><p><span>“[Turner] has two</span> primary sources of anecdotes I keep hearing: his time in the NFL—specifically that he was drafted in the last round—and his father’s time working as a shelf stocker at Safeway and how he is doing the same thing at HUD by ‘taking inventory and restocking the shelves.’ For a motivational speaker and pastor he is neither motivational nor inspirational.” <em>—HUD employee</em></p><hr><p><em>Immigration was a major pillar of the second Trump administration. While the government made crystal clear it did not want foreigners in the country, it carved out an exception for a minority group of white South Africans in an executive order in February—a topic near and dear to Musk’s heart, as a white immigrant from South Africa.</em></p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>“This administration has</span> made a complete mockery of the humanitarian side of immigration. I have interviewed parents who saw their children beheaded in front of them. I have interviewed children who saw their parents killed in front of them. I have interviewed women who have been sexually assaulted. I have interviewed children who have been sexually assaulted. I have interviewed teenagers who were beaten and threatened by their own family because they were part of the LGBTQI+ community. What has happened to these people in South Africa that warrants refugee status in the US? Nothing.” <em>—Department of Homeland Security employee</em></p><hr></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>Musk said he wanted to downsize the federal workforce. What was the right size, exactly? As lean as possible. Entire agencies were gutted as <a data-offer-url="https://www.cnn.com/politics/tracking-federal-workforce-firings-dg" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.cnn.com/politics/tracking-federal-workforce-firings-dg&quot;}" href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/tracking-federal-workforce-firings-dg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tens of thousands of federal employees</a> were subjected to reductions in force, or RIFs. Some of these actions have been challenged in court, but the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5429615/supreme-court-federal-rifs">Supreme Court</a> recently ruled that the Trump administration could continue its proposals to potentially lay off federal workers en masse.</em></p><p><span>“The moment everything</span> crystallized for me was the day they came for a respected career deputy. Someone who embodied integrity and competence. His ‘crime’? Having the guts to challenge DOGE’s reckless RIF plans. One afternoon, he returned from lunch to find security waiting at his desk. No explanation, no warning—just a quiet escort out of the building while stunned colleagues looked on. Years of dedicated service reduced to a public humiliation.” <em>—Department of Labor employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“I knew what</span> the powers that be were doing wasn't legal. So either they were incompetent and didn't know it was illegal, or they knew it was illegal and didn’t care. Which one is scarier?” <em>—CDC employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“What stands out</span> to me is how disorganized and unprofessional the GSA reduction in force was. Staff were instructed to return government IDs ASAP. We lost Google Drive access immediately, and the agency put resources about our RIF on there. We were blocked from sending emails to non-GSA addresses. Even trying to email career documents to your private email address became a huge issue.” <em>—GSA employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“When the Consumer</span> Financial Protection Bureau was first gutted, one person left their blazer in the office and was unable to get back into the building to get it. It was the only blazer they owned: They were broke, applying for jobs, and had nothing to wear to interviews because of this.” <em>—CFPB employee</em></p><hr><p><em>On February 14, tens of thousands of federal workers lost their jobs in an event that would become known to those impacted as the Valentine’s Day Massacre. Other workers were told they were going to receive firing letters imminently—only to wait days with no news.</em></p><p><span>“My fiancée and</span> I had just come back from dinner. We’re getting ready to go to bed. I decide I’m just going to disconnect from social media and my email. I’m just going to turn it off … I saw I had an unread message. I was fired at 11, 11:30 pm. [My fiancée] looks at me, and she sees my demeanor change. [She says,] ‘That was the email, wasn't it?’” <em>—Fired Federal Aviation Administration aeronautical information specialist</em></p><hr><p><span>“It was Valentine’s</span> Day, and my partner planned a romantic dinner for us that I ate in a catatonic state, in my sweatpants, covered in tears.” <em>—CDC employee</em></p><hr><p><em>On February 22, in another echo of his Twitter takeover, Musk warned that the entire federal workforce needed to write an email explaining what they’d gotten done the previous week.</em></p><p><span>“It was so</span> humiliating to have to prove, ostensibly to Elon Musk—someone not in my chain of command or even a government employee—what I was doing. Not only is it none of their business what I was up to (they are not my supervisor), but they wouldn’t even understand anything I put in there anyway since it’s far too technical. I put read receipts on my first submission, and after I hadn’t gotten pinged that it had been read after two subsequent submissions, I just stopped sending them. It made me so mad that not only are they passive-aggressively insinuating I’m doing nothing, but they’re wasting tons of federal workers’ time (and taxpayer money) doing this exercise, and they aren’t even opening the emails. Infuriating.” <em>—Department of Defense employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“[Employees were responding</span> with] emails in different languages … responding with the Constitution, and (for someone coming right back from maternity leave) responding with things such as: ‘breastfed a newborn for X number of hours, changed Y number of diapers with Z throughput, managed stakeholder input from my in-laws on best ways to burp a child.’” <em>—VA IT worker</em></p><hr><p><span>“I actually laughed</span> pretty hard [at Musk’s email]. It’s just so ridiculous … It’s either [that or] be mad 24/7 (which some of my compatriots have decided to do), and I just don’t have the energy anymore.” <em>—FAA air traffic controller</em></p><hr></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>On March 14, 2025, Colin O’Brien, then the head of security for the United States Institute of Peace, learned that the agency’s board had purportedly been fired. DOGE associates, including one named Nate Cavanaugh, arrived at USIP headquarters in Washington, DC.</em></p><p><span>“The on-duty security</span> lieutenant called me and said, ‘Hey, DOGE is here.’ The instructions we had given were that any visit by DOGE that was unscheduled, they were not to be permitted entry. If they had a scheduled appointment, absolutely, we’d have let them in. They stayed outside for a little bit less than 30 minutes and then left.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>Later, O’Brien got another call from the front security desk.</em></p><p><span>“They're like, ‘Hey,</span> the FBI is here with DOGE.’ So we step outside. It was two FBI agents to our right and then four DOGE people to the left, sort of standing in a semicircle. They're dressed like college kids—sneakers and jeans that are too tight—certainly not business attire.</p><p>“Our attorney asked the FBI: <em>Why are you guys here? Do you have a court order, a warrant, anything?</em> And they said no, and they said, ‘<em>We're here to facilitate a cordial conversation.’</em> They looked embarrassed to be there, being just very honest.</p><p>“The conversation lasts maybe five minutes, then the DOGE people leave with the FBI agents. I didn’t realize at the time that one of the women in the DOGE SUV had run around to the side of the building and was trying to convince one of the guards to let her in through a side door, claiming at first that it was cold and she had to go to the bathroom. Then that changed, when she was told no, to: ‘I have every right to be in a government building.’ So on one hand you have the intimidation factor of federal agents plus DOGE at your front door. And then you have this juvenile covert attempt in the back door. If she’d gotten in the door she would’ve probably called 911 and claimed false imprisonment or something.”</p><p><em>DOGE ultimately got into the building (estimated value: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-takes-control-usip-office-building/">$500 million</a>; DOGE attempted to gift GSA the space but was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usip-doge-headquarters-building-ruling/">blocked by a federal judge</a>) and fired nearly every employee. On March 28, as staff were receiving termination notices—and finding out their health care would be cut the same day—one of O’Brien’s colleagues spied a salad in the office refrigerator with the name “Nate C” on it and promptly threw it in the trash.</em></p><hr><p><em>Elsewhere, DOGE was entering more agencies for the first time. Departments that rarely faced political strain, such as those that support arts and culture programs, were put under a microscope. Others, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were put on ice.</em></p><p><span>“No one has</span> ever been against museums and libraries before. It seems like a really nonpolitical issue, and here we are facing a hostile takeover in real time … We were put on leave on March 31. By April 3, we were already starting to hear about grants being terminated. They were done through email, very generically, not through the official recordkeeping system, saying that they no longer met the priorities of the agencies. We initially heard about it from grantees. They were posting things publicly. On LinkedIn. On social media.” <em>—Institute of Museum and Library Services employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“People’s livelihoods were</span> gone, wiped out and thoroughly decimated. So many of these grantees work their entire lives to see a project, book, or exhibit come to fruition. These dreams came to a crashing and fiery end in the single hit of a button by someone who likely would never understand the true devastating impact.” <em>—National Endowment for the Humanities employee</em></p><hr><p><span>“I like to</span> think of it as I am being slightly defiant. I’ll say, ‘Although I was hired to do [certain duties] under the law, I have not been permitted to do work, so my accomplishments are limited to submitting a timesheet.’” <em>—CFPB employee</em></p><hr><p><em>After an initial flurry of lawsuits related to DOGE access to sensitive networks, the president decided to unilaterally declare on March 20 that they could go, essentially, wherever they wanted.</em></p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><span>“Learning about that</span> was like getting punched in the stomach. It goes against everything our agency stands for, our mission. I have personally encouraged immigrant parents to file for benefits for their American children because those children needed it, and have promised all of them that they were safe and that we didn’t share their information, and they trusted me. And now this administration has made a liar out of me.” <em>—Social Security Administration employee</em></p><hr><p><em>At some agencies, that access extended to taking control of official social media accounts.</em></p><p><span>“I had to</span> turn over access to our website and social media accounts. Ethan Shaotran asked me to turn over the login info to the website, to Facebook, Instagram, and X. I gave the passwords and usernames for those accounts. He came back later and asked for the address to log in to the WordPress account. I tried to just give the exact information they asked for because I wanted to passively resist. That’s why DOGE didn’t get access to our LinkedIn—they didn’t ask for it. The public considers these guys to be tech geniuses, but I’d say WordPress is pretty intuitive. It took them two days to take the website down.” <em>—Federal worker</em></p><hr><p><em>In March, the Social Security Administration readied a plan ostensibly to combat identity theft. Under the plan, beneficiaries would not be able to verify their identity on the phone as they had in the past. Instead they’d have to use an online portal or show up in person. (About a week later, the SSA relented and began allowing the phone again.)</em></p><p><span>“Some elderly beneficiaries</span> were crying on the phone, terrified that they would lose their benefits if they couldn’t figure out how to travel to an office and show us their ID. One woman was in her nineties. Another elderly couple showed up at an SSA office to prove they were alive, but it was never clear that this was necessary—no policy guidance had been issued.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“We were told to be patient and wait until guidance could be provided. At one point, we were told that we would receive instructions a week AFTER the policy implementation day.</p><p>“In the end, the administration discovered that there wasn’t a problem with fraud in our teleclaims, something that frontline staff could’ve told them from the beginning. Less than 1 percent of claims were even flagged for further investigation. If our leaders would take the time to learn how to read the records, they might know this too.” <em>—SSA employee</em></p><hr><p><em>The concern for security apparently did not extend to DOGE affiliates themselves.</em></p><p><span>“In April, I</span> happened to come across a partial list of employees and contractors who had not completed some of their mandatory security training. I wasn't surprised to see that DOGE-affiliated names made up more than a quarter of the list. It included [Technology Transformation Services director] Thomas Shedd, [Federal Acquisition Service head] Josh Gruenbaum, Ed Coristine, Luke Farritor, and Steven Davis. <em>—Current GSA IT contractor</em></p><hr><p><em>At AmeriCorps, DOGE called home thousands of young volunteers working on infrastructure projects or disaster relief around the country. It was chaos—a kind of chaos repeated across many agencies as spring wore on.</em></p><p><span>“DOGE arrived at</span> our agency in early April. About a week later, on Tuesday, they shut down the National Civilian Community Corps. They wanted to bring all the members home. Members were in the literal field though, like they were in forests and on trails.</p><p>“The next day, 85 percent of us were placed on administrative leave. They had people booking flights for members to get home, and their computers were cut off while they were booking. It was chaos. People were just disappearing. On April 24, people started receiving RIF notices, except a bunch of them were addressed to the wrong person.” <em>—Current AmeriCorp employee</em></p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p><em>By June, Musk appeared to officially leave DOGE. With him went some key lieutenants: Steve Davis, Musk’s right-hand man during the Twitter takeover and DOGE’s de facto leader; Nicole Hollander, Davis’ partner, who played a key role at the GSA; and Katie Miller, communications lead for DOGE and the wife of White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller. Musk’s send-off had included a friendly press conference with Trump, but that fragile peace was shattered a few days later, when Musk <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-donald-trump-breakup/">went to war</a> with Trump on X. It seemed like Musk’s ouster from government—and breakup with the president—was complete.</em></p><p><span>“For all the</span> talk that Trump likes teams of rivals, he doesn’t respect people who are nasty, interpersonally … I thought the cabinet secretary fights would be the end. The president was not going to tolerate him going after his cabinet secretaries, publicly or privately … The president just didn’t want that. He’s not going to tolerate that negativity. He likes all these people. These are his people. Marco’s a decade-old friend, at least, and a former competitor [with whom] he has a special comradery who he almost picked as his vice president. Peter Navarro went to jail for the guy. Took a federal charge, was found guilty, and ate it. Scott Bessent is his treasury secretary. Stuff like that was not gonna fly for very long.” <em>—Senior Trump official</em></p><hr><p><em>The era of Musk’s DOGE, the flashy, so-called agency that garnered Fox News specials and had orchestrated the biggest upheaval the modern US government has ever faced, appeared to be over.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-service/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-service/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45373081">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>2025-09-25</p><section><p>4 min read</p><img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1ekIsDppJhAU4ktpHPSC2v/9c94c6383d3e759cc9c0eb588191c39a/unnamed__31_.png" alt=""><div><p>If you are building an application, you rely on email to communicate with your users. You validate their signup, notify them about events, and send them invoices through email. The service continues to find new purpose with agentic workflows and other AI-powered tools that rely on a simple email as an input or output.</p><p>And it is a pain for developers to manage. It’s frequently the most annoying burden for most teams. Developers deserve a solution that is simple, reliable, and deeply integrated into their workflow.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we're excited to announce just that: the private beta of Email Sending, a new capability that allows you to send transactional emails directly from Cloudflare Workers. Email Sending joins and expands our popular <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/"><u>Email Routing</u></a> product, and together they form the new Cloudflare Email Service — a single, unified developer experience for all your email needs.</p><p>With Cloudflare Email Service, we’re distilling our years of experience <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/email-security/"><u>securing</u></a> and <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing/"><u>routing</u></a> emails, and combining it with the power of the developer platform. Now, sending an email is as easy as adding a binding to a Worker and calling <code>send</code>:</p>
            <pre><code>export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="49212c252526092c31282439252c672a2624">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" }],
      from: { email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="0362736a2e70666d676671437a6c76712e676c6e626a6d2d606c6e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>", name: "Your App" },
      subject: "Hello World",
      text: "Hello World!"
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  },
};</code></pre>
            <p><b>Email experience is user experience</b></p><p>Email is a core tenet of your user experience. It’s how you stay in touch with your users when they are outside your applications. Users rely on email to inform them when they need to take actions such as password resets, purchase receipts, magic login links, and onboarding flows. When they fail, your application fails.</p><p>That means it’s crucial that emails need to land in your users’ inboxes, both reliably and quickly. A magic link that arrives ten minutes late is a lost user. An email delivered to a spam folder breaks user flows and can erode trust in your product. That’s why we’re focusing on deliverability and time-to-inbox with Cloudflare Email Service.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, we’re tightly integrating with DNS to automatically configure the necessary DNS records — like SPF, DKIM and DMARC — such that email providers can verify your sending domain and trust your emails. Plus, in true Cloudflare fashion, Email Service is a global service. That means that we can deliver your emails with low latency anywhere in the world, without the complexity of managing servers across regions.</p><p><b>Simple and flexible for developers</b></p><p>Treating email as a core piece of your application also means building for every touchpoint in your development workflow. We’re building Email Service as part of the Cloudflare stack to make developing with email feels as natural as writing a Worker.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, that means solving for every part of the transactional email workflow:</p><ul><li><p>Starting with Email Service is easy. Instead of managing API keys and secrets, you can use the <code>Email</code> binding to your <code>wrangler.jsonc</code> and send emails securely and with no risk of leaked credentials.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>You can use Workers to process incoming mail, store attachments in R2, and add tasks to Queues to get email sending off the hot path of your application. And you can use <code>wrangler</code> to emulate Email Sending locally, allowing you to test your user journeys without jumping between tools and environments.</p></li><li><p>In production, you have clear observability over your emails with bounce rates and delivery events. And, when a user reports a missing email, you can quickly dive into the delivery status to debug issues quickly and help get your user back on track.</p></li></ul><p>We’re also making sure Email Service seamlessly fits into your existing applications. If you’ve been leaning on existing email frameworks (like <a href="https://react.email/"><u>React Email</u></a>) to send rich, HTML-rendered emails to users, you can continue to use them with Email Service. Import the library, render your template, and pass it to the <code>send</code> method just as you would elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
            <pre><code>import { render, pretty, toPlainText } from '@react-email/render';
import { SignupConfirmation } from './templates';

export default {
  async fetch(request, env, ctx) {

    // Convert React Email template to html
    const html = await pretty(await render(&lt;SignupConfirmation url="https://your-domain.com/confirmation-id"/&gt;));

    // Use the Email Sending binding to send emails
    await env.SEND_EMAIL.send({
      to: [{ email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="58303d343437183d20393528343d763b3735">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>" }],
      from: { email: "<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f392839ade80969d979681b38a9c8681de979c9e929a9ddd909c9e">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>", name: "Welcome" },
      subject: "Signup Confirmation",
      html,
      text: toPlainText(html)
    });

    return new Response(`Successfully sent email!`);
  }
};</code></pre>
            <p><b>Email Routing and Email Sending: Better together</b></p><p>Sending email is only half the story. Applications often need to receive and parse emails to create powerful workflows. By combining Email Sending with our existing <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-routing"><u>Email Routing</u></a> capabilities, we're providing a complete, end-to-end solution for all your application's email needs.</p><p>Email Routing allows you to create custom email addresses on your domain and handle incoming messages programmatically with a Worker, which can enable powerful application flows such as:</p><ul><li><p>Using <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"><u>Workers AI</u></a> to parse, summarize and even label incoming emails: flagging security events from customers, early signs of a bug or incident, and/or generating automatic responses based on those incoming emails.</p></li><li><p>Creating support tickets in systems like JIRA or Linear from emails sent to <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="7c0f090c0c130e083c0513090e511813111d1512521f1311">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code>.</p></li><li><p>Processing invoices sent to <code><a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="442d2a322b2d272137043d2b313669202b29252d2a6a272b29">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></code> and storing attachments in R2.</p></li></ul><p>To use Email Routing, add the <code>email</code> handler to your Worker application and process it as needed:</p>
            <pre><code>export default {
  // Create an email handler to process emails delivered to your Worker
  async email(message, env, ctx) {

    // Classify incoming emails using Workers AI
    const { score, label } = env.AI.run("@cf/huggingface/distilbert-sst-2-int8", { text: message.raw" })

    env.PROCESSED_EMAILS.send({score, label, message});
  },
};  </code></pre>
            <p>When you combine inbound routing with outbound sending, you can close the loop entirely within Cloudflare. Imagine a user emails your support address. A Worker can receive the email, parse its content, call a third-party API to create a ticket, and then use the Email Sending binding to send an immediate confirmation back to the user with their ticket number. That’s the power of a unified Email Service.</p><p>Email Sending will require a paid Workers subscription, and we'll be charging based on messages sent. We're still finalizing the packaging, and we'll update our documentation, <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/"><u>changelog</u></a>, and notify users as soon as we have final pricing and long before we start charging. Email Routing limits will remain unchanged.</p><p><b>What’s next</b></p><p>Email is core to your application today, and it's becoming essential for the next generation of AI agents, background tasks, and automated workflows. We built the Cloudflare Email Service to be the engine for this new era of applications, we’ll be making it available in private beta this November.</p><ul><li><p>Interested in Email Sending? <a href="https://forms.gle/BX6ECfkar3oVLQxs7"><u>Sign up to the waitlist here.</u></a>&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Want to start processing inbound emails?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="anchor-15e178">After hospitals were acquired by private equity firms, patient death rates in the emergency departments rose by 13% compared with similar hospitals, according to research published this week in <a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-03471" target="_blank">Annals of Internal Medicine</a>.</p><p id="anchor-7ffa60">The research, which compared outcomes at hospitals over a 10-year period, adds fresh evidence to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/patients-private-equity-hospitals-more-infections-falls-jama-study-rcna130956">previous studies </a>showing harmful patient outcomes and <a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/news/private-equity-investments-health-care-may-increase-costs-degrade-quality">higher costs</a> among health care entities owned by profit-oriented financiers. </p><p id="anchor-989875">The increased deaths in emergency departments at private equity-owned hospitals are most likely the result of reduced staffing levels after the acquisitions, which the study also measured, said Dr. Zirui Song, a co-author and associate professor of health care policy and medicine at Harvard Medical School.</p><p id="anchor-544dcb">After hospitals were acquired by private equity, the number of full-time employees fell by an average 11.6% compared with non-private equity facilities, the research found, and salary expenditures in the emergency departments and intensive care units declined by 18% and 16%, respectively. </p><p id="anchor-22482c">“Most hospital care in the country remains a face-to-face, human, labor-intensive endeavor, especially in emergency departments and ICUs,” Song said in an interview. “When human labor is cut to this extent in staffing sensitive areas of the hospital, patient harm can plausibly ensue, including mortality.”</p><p id="anchor-e94edc"><a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/deaths-rose-emergency-rooms-after-hospitals-were-acquired-private-equity-firms">The new study</a> analyzed 1 million emergency department visits by Medicare patients at 49 private equity-owned hospitals from 2009 through 2019. The researchers compared the outcomes of those visits with more than 6 million visits at 293 matched hospitals — those of similar size and location  — not acquired by private equity. </p><p id="anchor-16f972">The study’s co-authors, in addition to Song, are José R. Zubizarreta of Harvard University, Dr. Sneha Kannan of the University of Pittsburgh, Joseph Dov Bruch of the University of Chicago and Dr. Jennifer Stevens, director of the Center for Healthcare Delivery Science at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.</p><p id="anchor-b18fb7">Song said the new research differed from previous studies on private equity’s impact, which focused on patients who were admitted to the hospital.</p><p id="anchor-9c772e">“There are far more patients who come into the emergency department than patients who are actually admitted into the wards of the hospital,” Song said, “so this study looks at a patient population that had not been examined in great depth before.”</p><p id="anchor-2378ab">Private equity firms are sophisticated financial operators that buy companies, typically loading them with large amounts of debt to pay for the acquisitions. The firms hope to sell the companies for profit a few years later.</p><p id="anchor-1e4961">The private equity industry has <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care" target="_blank">poured over $1 trillion </a>into health care companies in recent years. Health care has been a focus of the financiers because it accounts for 18% of <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/national-health-expenditure-data/nhe-fact-sheet">gross domestic product </a>in the United States.</p><p id="anchor-7320fe">Because their acquisitions add debt costs to the companies they buy, those operations must cut other expenses to offset the burden. Employees are <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/warren-lawmakers-renew-legislative-push-to-stop-private-equity-looting" target="_blank">often the first to be fired</a>, and costs are often increased to generate higher profits. Some hospitals owned by private-equity firms sell the land under their buildings, enriching the owners but saddling the facilities with higher rent costs. </p><p id="anchor-d32c1f">Dr. Robert McNamara, chairman of the department of emergency medicine at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine, said the new research confirms what doctors in the field have long complained about: being stretched too thin by private equity owners.</p><p id="anchor-88add3">“When private equity comes in, they try to jack up the revenues and then, when that reaches an end point, they start slashing expenses,” McNamara said in an interview. “Instead of people just losing their jobs, you have bad patient outcomes here. Less staff equals worse outcomes.”</p><p id="anchor-a48c4b">The new research on increased deaths in emergency departments at private equity-owned hospitals aligns with a <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w28474">2021 study</a> that found 11% higher mortality rates at nursing homes owned by private equity. That study, by academics at New York University, the University of Chicago and the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that lower nursing staffs and declines in compliance with care standards contributed to the increased deaths at financier-owned homes.</p><p id="anchor-24fa62">Some states are enacting laws to rein in private equity’s impact on health care. In June, Oregon <a href="https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/2025/06/09/bill-enacting-nations-strictest-limits-on-corporate-health-care-influence-signed-by-gov-kotek/" target="_blank">enacted a law</a> limiting the control corporations and private equity can have over health care operations. And in Indiana, a new law <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/indianas-health-care-reporting-law-to-give-private-equity-pause" target="_blank">expands the attorney general’s powers</a> to investigate health care transactions and mandates reporting on ownership stakes in health care entities by private equity investors and other owners.</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/gretchen-morgenson-ncpn1100071" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture" data-flavor="focal" data-original-height="48" data-original-width="48"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2023_08/3595677/gretchen-morgenson-byline-jm-1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_08/3595677/gretchen-morgenson-byline-jm-1.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_08/3595677/gretchen-morgenson-byline-jm-1.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/gretchen-morgenson-ncpn1100071">Gretchen Morgenson</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/gmorgenson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="https://facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:gretchen.morgenson@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Gretchen Morgenson is the senior financial reporter in the Investigations unit at NBC News.</p></div></div>]]></description>

          <p>As many as 2 million Cisco devices are susceptible to an actively exploited zero-day that can remotely crash or execute code on vulnerable systems.</p>
<p>Cisco <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-snmp-x4LPhte">said Wednesday</a> that the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-20352, was present in all supported versions of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE, the operating system that powers a wide variety of the company’s networking devices. The vulnerability can be exploited by low-privileged users to create a denial-of-service attack or by higher-privileged users to execute code that runs with unfettered root privileges. It carries a severity rating of 7.7 out of a possible 10.</p>
<h2>Exposing SNMP to the Internet? Yep</h2>
<p>“The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of successful exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild after local Administrator credentials were compromised,” Wednesday’s advisory stated. “Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability.”</p>
<p>The vulnerability is the result of a stack overflow bug in the IOS component that handles SNMP (simple network management protocol), which routers and other devices use to collect and handle information about devices inside a network. The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted SNMP packets.</p>
<p>To execute malicious code, the remote attacker must have possession of <a href="https://blog.domotz.com/product-bytes/snmp-community-strings/#h-what-are-snmp-community-strings">read-only community string</a>, an SNMP-specific form of authentication for accessing managed devices. Frequently, such strings ship with devices. Even when modified by an administrator, read-only community strings are often widely known inside an organization. The attacker would also require privileges on the vulnerable systems. With that, the attacker can obtain RCE (remote code execution) capabilities that run as root.</p>

First, while models beat humans on benchmarks, the standardized tests designed to measure AI performance, they struggle to replicate this performance in hospital conditions. Most tools can only diagnose abnormalities that are common in training data, and models often don’t work as well outside of their test conditions. Second, attempts to give models more tasks have run into legal hurdles: regulators and medical insurers so far are reluctant to approve or cover fully autonomous radiology models. Third, even when they do diagnose accurately, models replace only a small share of a radiologist’s job. Human radiologists spend a minority of their time on diagnostics and the majority on other activities, like talking to patients and fellow clinicians.</p><p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly spreading across the economy and society. But radiology shows us that it will not necessarily dominate every field in its first years of diffusion — at least until these common hurdles are overcome. Exploiting all of its benefits will involve adapting it to society, and society’s rules to it.</p><p><span>All AIs are functions or algorithms, called models, that take in inputs and spit out outputs. Radiology models are trained to detect a finding, which is a measurable piece of evidence that helps identify or rule out a disease or condition. </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12044510/" rel="">Most radiology models</a><span> detect a single finding or condition in one type of image. For example, a model might look at a chest CT and answer whether there are </span><a href="https://www.qure.ai/news_press_coverages/qure.ai-launches-FDA-cleared-AI-solution-for-advanced-lung-nodule-quantification-on-CT-scans-at-AABIP-2024" rel="">lung nodules</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.signifyresearch.net/insights/ai-in-medical-imaging-news-round-up-february-2025/" rel="">rib fractures</a><span>, or what the </span><a href="https://www.signifyresearch.net/insights/ai-in-medical-imaging-news-round-up-february-2025/" rel="">coronary arterial calcium score</a><span> is.</span></p><p>For every individual question, a new model is required. In order to cover even a modest slice of what they see in a day, a radiologist would need to switch between dozens of models and ask the right questions of each one. Several platforms manage, run, and interpret outputs from dozens or even hundreds of separate AI models across vendors, but each model operates independently, analyzing for one finding or disease at a time. The final output is a list of separate answers to specific questions, rather than a single description of an image.</p><p><span>Even with hundreds of imaging algorithms approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the market, the combined footprint of today’s radiology AI models still cover only a small fraction of real-world imaging tasks. Many cluster around a few use cases: stroke, breast cancer, and lung cancer together account for </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10546456/" rel="">about 60 percent</a><span> of models, but only a </span><a href="https://media.market.us/medical-imaging-statistics/" rel="">minority of the actual radiology imaging</a><span> volume that is carried out in the US. Other subspecialties, such as vascular, head and neck, spine, and thyroid imaging currently have </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11816879/#:~:text=subspecialties%20including%20vascular%2C%20head/neck%2C%20spine%2C%20thyroid%2C%20and%20FDG%20PET%2DCT%20imaging%20have%20relatively%20few%20AI%20products%20(between%201%20and%202)" rel="">relatively few AI products</a><span>. This is in part due to data availability: the scan needs to be common enough for there to be many annotated examples that can be used to train models. Some scans are also inherently more complicated than others. For example, ultrasounds are taken from multiple angles and do not have standard imaging planes, unlike X-rays.</span></p><p><span>Once deployed outside of the hospital where they were initially trained, models can struggle. In a standard clinical trial, samples are taken from multiple hospitals to ensure exposure to a broad range of patients and to avoid site-specific effects, such as a single doctor’s technique or how a hospital chooses to calibrate its diagnostic equipment.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-174517364" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists#footnote-1-174517364" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> But when an algorithm is undergoing regulatory approval in the US, its developers will normally test it on a relatively narrow dataset.

Some of </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01037-4" rel="">these challenges</a><span> stemmed from avoidable experimental issues like overfitting, but others are indicative of deeper problems like differences in how hospitals record and generate data, such as using slightly different imaging equipment. This means that individual hospitals or departments would need to retrain or revalidate today’s crop of tools before adopting them, even if they have been proven elsewhere.</span></p><p><span>The limitations of radiology models stem from deeper problems with building medical AI. Training datasets come with strict inclusion criteria, where the diagnosis must be unambiguous (typically </span><a href="https://blog.mozilla.ai/the-importance-of-ground-truth-data-in-ai-applications-an-overview/" rel="">confirmed</a><span> by a consensus of two to three experts or a pathology result) and without images that are shot at an odd angle, look too dark, or are blurry. This skews performance towards the easiest cases, which doctors are already best at diagnosing, and away from real-world images. In one 2022 </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9221818/" rel="">study</a><span>, an algorithm that was meant to spot pneumonia on chest X-rays faltered when the disease presented in subtle or mild forms, or when other lung conditions resembled pneumonia, such as pleural effusions, where fluid builds up in lungs, or in atelectasis (collapsed lung). Humans also benefit from context: one radiologist told me about a model they use that labels surgical staples as hemorrhages, because of the bright streaks they create in the image.</span></p><p><span>Medical imaging datasets used for training also tend to have fewer cases from </span><a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.06.25328913v1" rel="">children</a><span>, women, and ethnic minorities, making their performance generally worse for these demographics.

Even a model for the precise question you need and in the hospital where it was trained is unlikely to perform as well in clinical practice as it did in the benchmark. In benchmark studies, researchers isolate a cohort of scans, define goals in quantitative metrics, such as the sensitivity (the percentage of people with the condition who are correctly identified by the test) and specificity (the percentage of people </span><em>without</em><span> the condition who are correctly identified as such), and compare the performance of a model to the score of another reviewer, typically a human doctor.

The gap was largest when computer aids failed to recognize the malignancy itself; many doctors seemed to treat an absence of prompts as reassurance that a film was clean.

Without a doctor involved whose behavior might change we might expect real-world results to match benchmark scores. But regulatory requirements and insurance policies are slowing the adoption of fully autonomous radiology AI.</p><p><span>The FDA </span><a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/160125/download?utm_" rel="">splits imaging software</a><span> into two regulatory lanes: assistive or triage tools, which require a licensed physician to read the scan and sign the chart, and autonomous tools, which do not. Makers of assistive tools simply have to show that their software can match the performance of tools that are already on the market. Autonomous tools have to clear a much higher bar: they must demonstrate that the AI tool will refuse to read any scan that is blurry, uses an unusual scanner, or is outside its competence. The bar is higher because, once the human disappears, a latent software defect could harm thousands before anyone notices.</span></p><p><span>Meeting that criteria is difficult. Even state-of-the-art vision networks falter with images that lack contrast, have unexpected angles, or lots of different artefacts. IDx-DR, a diabetic retinopathy screener and one of the few cleared to operate autonomously, comes with </span><a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cdrh_docs/reviews/DEN180001.pdf?utm_" rel="">guardrails</a><span>: the patient must be an adult with no prior retinopathy diagnosis; there must be two macula-centred photographs of the fundus (the rear of the eye) with a resolution of at least 1,000 times 1,000 pixels; if glare, small pupils or poor focus degrade quality, the software must self-abort and refer the patient to an eye care professional.</span></p><p>Stronger evidence and improved performance could eventually clear both hurdles, but other requirements would still delay widespread use. For example, if you retrain a model, you are required to receive new approval even if the previous model was approved. This contributes to the market generally lagging behind frontier capabilities.</p><p><span>And when autonomous models are approved, malpractice insurers are not eager to cover them. Diagnostic error is the costliest mistake in American medicine, resulting in </span><a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/-/media/armstrong-institute/documents/news/2013-4-23-diagnostic-errors-more-common.pdf" rel="">roughly a third</a><span> of all malpractice payouts, and radiologists are perennial defendants. Insurers believe that software makes catastrophic payments more likely than a human clinician, as a broken algorithm can harm many patients at once. Standard contract language now often includes phrases such as: ‘Coverage applies solely to interpretations reviewed and authenticated by a licensed physician; no indemnity is afforded for diagnoses generated autonomously by software’. One insurer, Berkley, even </span><a href="https://www.hunton.com/hunton-insurance-recovery-blog/the-continued-proliferation-of-ai-exclusions#:~:text=Berkley's%20%E2%80%9CAbsolute%E2%80%9D%20AI%20Exclusion,practices%2C%20procedures%2C%20or%20training;" rel="">carries</a><span> the blunter label ‘Absolute AI Exclusion’.</span></p><p><span>Without malpractice coverage, hospitals cannot afford to let algorithms sign reports. In the case of IDx-DR, the vendor, Digital Diagnostics, includes a </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8651697/" rel="">product liability policy</a><span> and an indemnity clause. This means that if the clinic used the device exactly as the FDA label prescribes, with adult patients, good-quality images, and no prior retinopathy, then the company will reimburse the clinic for damages traceable to algorithmic misclassification.</span></p><p><span>Today, if American hospitals wanted to adopt AI for fully independent diagnostic reads, they would need to believe that autonomous models deliver enough cost savings or throughput gains to justify pushing for exceptions to credentialing and billing norms. For now, usage is too sparse to make a difference. One 2024 investigation </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11458846/" rel="">estimated</a><span> that 48 percent of radiologists are using AI at all in their practice. A </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12202002/#:~:text=Similarly%2C%20while%20most%20organizations%20have%20deployed%20AI%20in%20imaging%20and%20radiology%2C%20only%2019%25%20of%20them%20report%20a%20high%20degree%20of%20success%20in%20this%20area." rel="">2025 survey</a><span> reported that only 19 percent of respondents who have started piloting or deploying AI use cases in radiology reported a ‘high’ degree of success.</span></p><p>Even if AI models become accurate enough to read scans on their own and are cleared to do so, radiologists may still find themselves busier, rather than out of a career.</p><p><span>Radiologists are useful for more than reading scans; a </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23763878/" rel="">study</a><span> that followed staff radiologists in three different hospitals in 2012 found that only 36 percent of their time was dedicated to direct image interpretation. More time is spent on overseeing imaging examinations, communicating results and recommendations to the treating clinicians and occasionally directly to patients, teaching radiology residents and technologists who conduct the scans, and reviewing imaging orders and changing scanning protocols.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-174517364" href="https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/why-ai-isnt-replacing-radiologists#footnote-4-174517364" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> This means that, if AI were to get better at interpreting scans, radiologists may simply shift their time toward other tasks.

This has historical precedent in the field: in the early 2000s hospitals swapped film jackets for digital systems. Hospitals that digitized improved radiologist productivity, and time to read an individual scan went down. A </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3043948/" rel="">study</a><span> at Vancouver General found that the switch boosted radiologist productivity 27 percent for plain radiography and 98 percent for CT within a year of going filmless. This occurred alongside other advancements in imaging technology that made scans faster to execute. Yet, no radiologists were laid off.</span></p><p><span>Instead, the overall American utilization rate per 1,000 insured patients for all imaging </span><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21962785/" rel="">increased by 60 percent</a><span> from 2000 to 2008. This is </span><a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-09-559.pdf" rel="">not explained</a><span> by a commensurate increase in physician visits. Instead, each visit was associated with more imaging on average. Before digitization, the nonmonetary price of imaging was high: the </span><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4586334/" rel="">median reporting turnaround time</a><span> for x-rays was 76 hours for patients discharged from emergency departments, and 84 hours for admitted patients. After departments digitized, these times dropped to 38 hours and 35 hours, respectively.</span></p><p><span>Faster scans give doctors more options. Until the early 2000s, only exceptional trauma cases would receive whole-body CT scans; the increased speed of CT turnaround times mean that they are now a </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00031348211061330?icid=int.sj-abstract.similar-articles.8" rel="">common</a><span> choice. This is a reflection of elastic demand, a concept in economics that describes when demand for a product or service is very sensitive to changes in price. In this case, when these scans got cheaper in terms of waiting time, demand for those scans increased.</span></p><p><span>Over the past decade, improvements in image interpretation have run far ahead of their diffusion. Hundreds of models can spot bleeds, nodules, and clots, yet AI is often limited to assistive use on a small subset of scans in any given practice. And despite </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HMPRXstSvQ" rel="">predictions</a><span> to the contrary, head counts and salaries have continued to rise. The promise of AI in radiology is overstated by benchmarks alone.</span></p><p>Multi‑task foundation models may widen coverage, and different training sets could blunt data gaps. But many hurdles cannot be removed with better models alone: the need to counsel the patient, shoulder malpractice risk, and receive accreditation from regulators. Each hurdle makes full substitution the expensive, risky option and human plus machine the default. Sharp increases in AI capabilities could certainly alter this dynamic, but it is a useful model for the first years of AI models that benchmark well at tasks associated with a particular career.</p><p><span>However, there are industries where conditions are different. Large platforms </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-artificial-intelligence-harmful-content-misinformation/" rel="">rely heavily</a><span> on AI systems to triage or remove harmful or policy-violating content. At Facebook and Instagram, 94 percent and 98 percent of moderation decisions respectively are </span><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/pixels/article/2023/11/14/content-moderation-key-facts-to-learn-from-facebook-instagram-x-and-tiktok-transparency-reports_6252988_13.html" rel="">made by machines</a><span>. But many of the more sophisticated knowledge jobs look more like radiology.</span></p><p>In many jobs, tasks are diverse, stakes are high, and demand is elastic. When this is the case, we should expect software to, at least initially, lead to more human work, not less. The lesson from a decade of radiology models is neither optimism about increased output nor dread about replacement. Models can lift productivity, but their implementation depends on behavior, institutions and incentives. For now, the paradox has held: the better the machines, the busier radiologists have become.</p><p><em>Deena Mousa</em><span> </span><em><span>is a lead researcher at Open Philanthropy.

                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                <p>Use the palette chooser to create a series of colors that are <em>visually equidistant</em>. This is
                    useful for many data visualizations, like pie charts, grouped bar charts, and maps.</p>
                <p><em>Note: there are two other modes besides palette mode –&nbsp;check out <a href="#single">single-hue
                            scales</a> and <a href="#divergent">divergent scales</a> as well.</em></p>
                <p>Creating visually equidistant palettes is basically impossible to do by hand, yet <strong>hugely
                        important</strong> for data visualizations. Why? When colors are <em>not</em> visually
                    equidistant, it’s harder to (a) tell them apart in the chart, and (b) compare the chart to the key.
                    I’m sure we’ve all looked at charts where you can hardly use the key since the data colors are so
                    similar.</p>
                <p>For instance, Google Analytics does a <strong>terrible</strong> job with this:</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://www.learnui.design/tools/img/ga-before.png" alt="Google Analytics stacked bar chart with low-contrast colors">
                    <figcaption>Just try to use this key. I dare you.</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>It’s better to use use a <strong>range of hues</strong> so users can cross-reference with the key
                    easier. It’s far simpler for our brains to distinguish, say, <em>yellow from orange</em> than
                    <em>blue from blue-but-15%-lighter</em>.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Ahh! Much better.</figcaption>

                <p>This color picker allows you to specify both endpoints of the palette. You can choose at least one to
                    be a brand color, which gives you significant flexibility in creating a palette that will work for
                    your visualizations, yet be customized for your brand.</p>
                <p>Here are a few tips for getting the best palette:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try picking <strong>very different endpoint colors</strong> – e.g. one warm, one cool; one
                        bright, one darker&nbsp;–&nbsp;so that your palette covers a wider range</li>
                    <li>If you’re using a <strong>brand color</strong> for one endpoint, don’t be afraid to
                        <strong>modify the <a href="https://www.learnui.design/blog/the-hsb-color-system-practicioners-primer.html">saturation
                                and brightness</a></strong> a bit if it creates a more pleasing palette. Users will
                        recognize your brand color by its hue much <em>far more</em> than by it’s exact
                        saturation/brightness.
                    </li>
                    <li>For data visualizations where you’re showing the <strong>strength of a single value</strong>,
                        try using the <a href="#single">Single Hue Palette Generator</a> instead.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Oh, and...</p>

                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                <p>The Single Hue Scale generator is most useful for visualizations where you’re showing the value of a
                    single variable. Typically, the darker variation will represent a higher value, and a neutral color
                    (even white) will represent a value closer to zero.</p>
                <p>In a pie chart or bar chart, <em>size</em> is used to distinguish higher values. But in some
                    visualizations, the size is set and you need to rely on color. Two examples of this are show in the
                    “In Context” section above:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A <strong>map</strong> in which size represents county size; we need to use color to distinguish
                        the value for each county</li>
                    <li>A <strong>week-by-week calendar</strong> in which each day is an equally sized box; we need to
                        use color to show the value for a particular day</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Here are a few tips for getting the best single hue scale:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To transition to a <strong>flat gray</strong> endpoint, set “Color Intensity” to zero</li>
                    <li>To transition to a <strong>white</strong> endpoint, set “Brightness” to full <em>and</em> “Color
                        Intensity” to zero</li>
                    <li>If your color scale actually shows a variable that transitions from one end to a <em>neutral
                            midpoint</em> to <em>another</em> end, try the <a href="#divergent">Divergent Scale
                            Generator</a> (e.g. Republican to moderate to Democrat; hotter to same-temperature to
                        cooler)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How to Use</h2>
                <p>The Divergent Color Scale generator is most useful for visualizations where you’re showing a
                    transition from (a) one extreme, through a (b) neutral middle, and finally to a (c) opposite
                    extreme.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most common example of this is the “how Democrat/Republican is each state in the US”
                    chart.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="https://www.learnui.design/tools/img/us-voting.png" alt="Map of US states voting in 2016 with divergent color scheme">
                    <figcaption>Shamelessly borrowed (?) from <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/" target="_blank">Five
                            Thirty-Eight</a></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>By default, the neutral midpoint is a light gray. You can change it with the "Modify Midpoint Color"
                    sliders to be slightly darker or more colorful. For the best results, set the Color Intensity to the
                    minimum when the two endpoint hues are significantly different –&nbsp;otherwise, the moderate tones will
                    start to blend together (this will be evident in the map).</p>
                <p>As with the other visualization styles, this will pick colors that are visually equidistant. However,
                    if one of the two endpoint colors is significantly darker or saturated, the swatches on that side
                    will have more color-space between them.</p>

</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL Global Development Group</a>
today announced the release of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html">PostgreSQL 18</a>,
the latest version of the world's most advanced open source database. Translations of this press release are available in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/press/">PostgreSQL 18 press kit</a>.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 improves performance for workloads of all sizes through a new I/O
subsystem that has demonstrated up to 3× performance improvements when reading
from storage, and also increases the number of queries that can use indexes.
This release makes major-version upgrades less disruptive, accelerating upgrade
times and reducing the time required to reach expected performance after an
upgrade completes. Developers also benefit from PostgreSQL 18 features,
including virtual generated columns that compute values at query time, and the
database-friendly <code>uuidv7()</code> function that provides better indexing and read
performance for UUIDs. PostgreSQL 18 makes it easier to integrate with single-sign
on (SSO) systems with support for OAuth 2.0 authentication.</p>
<p>"The efforts of the global open source community shape every PostgreSQL release
and help deliver features that meet users where their data resides," said
Jonathan Katz, a member of the PostgreSQL core team. "PostgreSQL 18 builds on the
project's long, rich history of delivering a reliable and robust data management
experience, while continuing to expand the workloads it can support."</p>
<p>PostgreSQL, an innovative data management system known for its reliability,
robustness, and extensibility, benefits from nearly 30 years of open source
development from a global developer community and has become the preferred open
source relational database for organizations of all sizes.</p>
<h3>Introducing asynchronous I/O</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL previously relied on operating system readahead mechanisms to
accelerate data retrieval. However, because operating systems lack insight into
database-specific access patterns, they cannot always anticipate what data will
be required, leading to suboptimal performance in many workloads.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 introduces a new asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem designed to
address this limitation. AIO lets PostgreSQL issue multiple I/O requests
concurrently instead of waiting for each to finish in sequence. This expands
existing readahead and improves overall throughput. AIO operations supported in
PostgreSQL 18 include sequential scans, bitmap heap scans, and vacuum.
Benchmarking has demonstrated performance gains of up to 3x in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-IO-METHOD"><code>io_method</code></a>
setting lets you toggle between the AIO methods, including <code>worker</code> and <code>io_uring</code>,
or you can choose to maintain the current PostgreSQL behavior with the <code>sync</code>
setting. There are now more parameters to consider tuning with AIO, which you
can <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/runtime-config-resource.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-RESOURCE-IO">learn more about in the documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>Faster upgrades, better post-upgrade performance</h3>
<p>A key PostgreSQL feature is the generation and storage of
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/planner-stats.html">statistics</a> that help
PostgreSQL select the most efficient query plan. Before PostgreSQL 18, these
statistics didn't carry over on a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgupgrade.html">major version upgrade</a>,
which could cause significant query performance degradations on busy systems
until the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-analyze.html"><code>ANALYZE</code></a>
finished running. PostgreSQL 18 introduces the ability to keep planner
statistics through a major version upgrade, which helps an upgraded cluster
reach expected performance more quickly after the upgrade.</p>
<p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgupgrade.html"><code>pg_upgrade</code></a>,
a utility that performs major version upgrades, includes several enhancements in
PostgreSQL 18, such as faster upgrades when a database contains many objects
like tables and sequences. This release also lets <code>pg_upgrade</code> process its
checks in parallel based on the settings of the <code>--jobs</code> flag, and adds the
<code>--swap</code> flag that swaps upgrade directories instead of copying, cloning, or
linking files.</p>
<h3>Query and general performance enhancements</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 further accelerates query performance with features that
automatically make your workloads faster. This release introduces "skip scan"
lookups on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/indexes-multicolumn.html">multicolumn B-tree indexes</a>
that improve execution time for queries that omit an <code>=</code> condition on one or
more prefix index columns. It can also optimize queries that use <code>OR</code> conditions
in a <code>WHERE</code> to use an index, leading to significantly faster execution. There
are also numerous improvements for how PostgreSQL plans and executes table joins,
from boosting the performance of hash joins to allowing merge joins to use
incremental sorts. PostgreSQL 18 also supports parallel builds for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/gin.html">GIN indexes</a>, joining B-tree and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/brin.html">BRIN indexes</a> in supporting
this capability.</p>
<p>This release also builds on PostgreSQL support for hardware acceleration,
including support for ARM NEON and SVE CPU intrinsics for the <code>popcount</code>
function, which is used by the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-bitstring.html"><code>bit_count</code></a>
and other internal capabilities.</p>
<h3>Enhancing the developer experience</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 introduces <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-PARMS-GENERATED-STORED">virtual generated columns</a>
that compute values at query time instead of storing them. This is now the
default option for generated columns. Additionally, stored generated columns can
now be logically replicated.</p>
<p>This release adds the capability to access both the previous (<code>OLD</code>) and current
(<code>NEW</code>) values in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/dml-returning.html"><code>RETURNING</code> clause</a>
for <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, <code>DELETE</code> and <code>MERGE</code> commands. PostgreSQL 18 also adds
UUIDv7 generation through the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-uuid.html#FUNC_UUID_GEN_TABLE"><code>uuidv7()</code></a>
function, letting you generate random UUIDs that are timestamp-ordered to
support better caching strategies. PostgreSQL 18 includes
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-uuid.html#FUNC_UUID_GEN_TABLE"><code>uuidv4()</code></a>
as an alias for <code>gen_random_uuid()</code>.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 adds <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createtable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-PARMS-UNIQUE">temporal constraints</a>
-- constraints over ranges -- for both <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> and <code>UNIQUE</code> constraints
using the <code>WITHOUT OVERLAPS</code> clause, and on <code>FOREIGN KEY</code> constraints using the
<code>PERIOD</code> clause.</p>
<p>Finally, PostgreSQL 18 makes it easier to create the schema definition of a
foreign table using the definition of a local table with the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createforeigntable.html"><code>CREATE FOREIGN TABLE ... LIKE</code></a>
command.</p>
<h3>Improved text processing</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 makes text processing easier and faster with several new
enhancements. This release adds the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/collation.html#COLLATION-MANAGING-STANDARD"><code>PG_UNICODE_FAST</code></a>
collation, which provides full Unicode semantics for case transformations while
helping to accelerate many comparisons. This includes the <code>upper</code> and <code>lower</code>
string comparison functions and the new <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-string.html#FUNCTIONS-STRING-OTHER"><code>casefold</code></a>
function for case-insensitive comparisons. Additionally, PostgreSQL 18 now
supports making <code>LIKE</code> comparisons over text that uses a
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/collation.html#COLLATION-NONDETERMINISTIC">nondeterministic collation</a>,
simplifying how you can perform more complex pattern matching. This release also
changes <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/textsearch.html">full text search</a>
to use the default collation provider of a cluster instead of always using libc,
which may require you to reindex all
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/textsearch-tables.html#TEXTSEARCH-TABLES-INDEX">full text search</a>
and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgtrgm.html#PGTRGM-INDEX"><code>pg_trgm</code></a>
indexes after running <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgupgrade.html"><code>pg_upgrade</code></a>.</p>
<h3>Authentication and security features</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 introduces <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/auth-oauth.html"><code>oauth</code> authentication</a>,
which lets users authenticate using OAuth 2.0 mechanisms supported through
PostgreSQL extensions. Additionally, PostgreSQL 18 includes validation for
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgcrypto.html#PGCRYPTO-OPENSSL-SUPPORT-FUNCS">FIPS mode</a>,
and adds the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-SSL-TLS13-CIPHERS"><code>ssl_tls13_ciphers</code></a>
parameter for configuring server-side TLS v1.3 cipher suites.</p>
<p>This release deprecates <code>md5</code> password authentication, which will be removed in
a future release. If you require PostgreSQL password-based authentication, use
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/auth-password.html">SCRAM authentication</a>.
PostgreSQL 18 also supports SCRAM passthrough authentication with both
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/postgres-fdw.html"><code>postgres_fdw</code></a> and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/dblink.html"><code>dblink</code></a> for authenticating to
remote PostgreSQL instances. Additionally, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgcrypto.html"><code>pgcrypto</code></a>
now supports <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgcrypto.html#PGCRYPTO-CRYPT-ALGORITHMS">SHA-2 encryption for password hashing</a>.</p>
<h3>Replication</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 supports reporting logical replication write conflicts in logs and
in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-SUBSCRIPTION-STATS"><code>pg_stat_subscription_stats</code></a> view. Additionally,
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/sql-createsubscription.html"><code>CREATE SUBSCRIPTION</code></a>
now defaults to using parallel streaming for applying transactions, which can
help improve performance. The
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/app-pgcreatesubscriber.html"><code>pg_createsubscriber</code></a>
utility now has an <code>--all</code> flag so you can create logical replicas for all
databases in an instance with a single command. PostgreSQL 18 also lets you
automatically <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/runtime-config-replication.html#GUC-IDLE-REPLICATION-SLOT-TIMEOUT">drop idle replication slots</a> to help prevent storing too many
write-ahead log files on a publisher.</p>
<h3>Maintenance and observability</h3>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 improves its <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/routine-vacuuming.html">vacuum</a>
strategy by proactively freezing more pages during regular vacuums, reducing
overhead and helping in situations that require aggressive vacuums. </p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 adds more details to <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/using-explain.html"><code>EXPLAIN</code></a>,
which provides information about query plan execution, and as of this release
now automatically shows how many buffers (the fundamental unit of data storage)
are accessed when executing <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>. Additionally, <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>
now shows how many index lookups occur during an index scan, and <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE</code>
includes CPU, WAL, and average read statistics. PostgreSQL 18 includes more info
in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ALL-TABLES-VIEW"><code>pg_stat_all_tables</code></a>
on time spent on vacuum and related operations, as well as per-connection
statistics on I/O and WAL utilization.</p>
<h3>Other notable changes</h3>
<p>Databases initialized with PostgreSQL 18 <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/app-initdb.html"><code>initdb</code></a>
now have page checksums enabled by default. This can affect upgrades from
non-checksum enabled clusters, which would require you to create a new
PostgreSQL 18 cluster with the <code>--no-data-checksums</code> option when using
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/pgupgrade.html"><code>pg_upgrade</code></a>.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 also introduces a new version (3.2) of the PostgreSQL wire
protocol, the first new protocol version since PostgreSQL 7.4 (2003).
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/libpq-connect.html"><code>libpq</code></a> still uses
version 3.0 by default while clients (e.g., drivers, poolers, proxies) add
support for the new protocol version.</p>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
<p>Many other new features and improvements have been added to PostgreSQL 18 that
may also be helpful for your use cases. Please see the
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/release-18.html">release notes</a> for a
complete list of new and changed features.</p>

    <p>Recently a local news station in Maine reported a story of some middle schoolers calling their friends with landline telephones. Their parents thought they were too young for cell phones and wanted to hold off on that aspect of reality, so they got an old phone from the 90s, and soon their friends also got phones. It formed schedules of calls they would make to talk to each other, even creating a phone ring of contacts.</p>
<p>I think I can confidently say that the majority of us aren't happy with the state of social media. Back in its early days it was fresh and exciting, a fun way to connect with your friends that might be far away, or make new friends online. It was cozy. No ads, no feeds, no endless videos. Instead it was just people, the whole reason you started in the first place. Now it's just noise and scary addicting and effective algorithms that keep you plugged in for hours on end. We build apps and products to help kill the monster, or perhaps we even delete some social media apps. Many of our friends we used to stay connected with seem so distant, as many of them too are tired and perhaps jumped off socials altogether. Well, what if I told you we could have the old web back?</p>
<p>In my opinion the answer is honestly pretty simple: blogs and RSS feeds. This was how it was done for years before social media came into the scene. You would find someone's blog, subscribe to their RSS feed, and anytime a new post came out it would pop up in your feed and you could read it. One important clarification is that when we say "blog" it can be pretty much whatever you want it to be. On my personal website I generally write more of my serious blogs, but on my bear blog I plan to be a bit more casual. It will be a place where I record short thoughts, ideas, musings, or cool things I find on the internet. Just sharing what I would normally share with my friends. That's what made the web great, and that's what I want to bring back.</p>
<p>To do this, I am starting a <a href="https://bearblog.dev/">bear blog</a> that will have a dedicated <a href="https://stevedylandev.bearblog.dev/feeds">feeds page</a> that will have all the other blogs I'm subscribing to. The beauty is that you don't need a dedicated social network to make this work; just click on the links. Use whatever RSS reader you want! You don't have to use bear blog either, just use whatever blog you want. The key is connection. I want to point to who I follow so that you might follow them too, and hopefully create a page on your own. In some ways it's bringing back old web rings and simple networking through hyperlinks.</p>
<p>To kick it off, here's a few blogs I'm already subscribed to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://polluterofminds.bearblog.dev/">polluterofminds bear blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://sdv.bearblog.dev/">syndicated debatable views</a></li>
<li><a href="https://0xgramajo.xyz/">gramajo's blog</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.vrypan.net/">blog.vrypan.net</a></li>
<li><a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/">vitalik.eth</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to join but not sure how, check out the video I recorded below:</p>
<p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywvkbwyiBls" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;  web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p>
<p>Best way to keep up with your feeds is to find yourself an RSS reader! There are a lot of options out there (although admittedly a bit old), so just find it on the platform that suits you best. <a href="https://feeder.co/reader">Feeder.co</a> has a pretty generous free plan, and if you're a dev there's hundreds of self hosted projects to choose from like <a href="https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr">Yarr</a>. Personally rocking <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> for MacOS and iOS, and loving it so far!</p>
<p>I have no idea if this will amount to anything or if it's worthwhile, but I'm gonna give it a shot. The landline phones prove that we don't have to buy into the social media dopamine machine. We have autonomy, and we have the freedom to choose how we interact with each other. I want to believe we can resurrect the old web, together.</p>
