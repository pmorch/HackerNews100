   <p>10.09.2025 | Frederik Ramm </p>

   <div>
      <p>This month we’ve ramped up the infrastructure behind the download server, and downloads should now be available earlier<br>
and faster. There’s also a small technical change in that requests for a “…latest” file will now be answered with a<br>
HTTP redirect to the specific latest version (see previous blog post).</p>
<p>I would like to use this opportunity to appeal to users of the download server to “download responsibly”. We want<br>
to continue offering this service as powerful and as convenient as possible within our means. We want everyone<br>
to have easy access to the latest OSM data in a form that is useful to them.</p>
<p>Every now and then, people break things for others. There have been individual clients downloading the exact same<br>
20-GB file 100s of times per day, for several days in a row. (Just the other day, one user has managed to download almost 10,000 copies of the italy-latest.osm.pbf file in 24 hours!) Others download every single file we have on the<br>
server, every day. There’s a limit to the outgoing network bandwidth, and behaviour like this means that<br>
things are slowing down for everyone. Also, when we block an IP range for abuse, innocent third parties can be affected. </p>
<p>Here’s three concrete appeals to users of the download server:</p>
<p>1. If you want data for the whole planet, don’t download it piecemeal from us – simply get the planet file from planet.openstreetmap.org and you’re done!<br>
2. If you want a large region (like Europe or North America) updated daily, use the excellent pyosmium-up-to-date program which will automatically determine the age of your local file and update it by downloading the latest changes; this saves something like 98% of network traffic compared to a fresh download, and is faster.<br>
3. If you automate anything with regard to our download server, monitor what your script is doing or build in appropriate catches so that you don’t end up downloading the same file 1000 times just because your disk is full or something like that.</p>
<p>Happy downloading!</p>

Lee did not address how likely the U.S. was to agree or whether that would be enough for the deal to go forward.</p><p>He said South Korea is different from Japan, which struck a trade deal with the U.S. in July. Tokyo has more than double South Korea's $410 billion foreign exchange reserves, an international currency in the yen and a swap line with the United States, Lee said.</p><p>Seoul and Washington have said in writing that any investment projects must be commercially viable, but working out the details is proving difficult, he said.</p><p>"Reaching detailed agreements that guarantee commercial reasonableness is now the central task - yet it also remains the biggest obstacle," Lee said.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>“</span><a href="https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/7um9a" rel="">Reconstructing Psychopathology: A data-driven reorganization of the symptoms in DSM-5</a><span>” by Miri Forbes, et al. (was available as a preprint at the time of writing this post, later </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21677026241268345" rel="">published in </a><em><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21677026241268345" rel="">Clinical Psychological Science</a></em><span>) is a brilliantly designed and innovative study of the quantitative structure of psychopathology with important ramifications for our understanding of psychiatric classification. No one has conducted a study quite like this before, and the results are remarkable. It takes place in the context of the development of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Taxonomy_of_Psychopathology" rel="">Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)</a><span> which is a dimensional, hierarchical, and quantitative approach to the classification of mental disorders, and relies on identification of patterns of covariation among symptoms.</span></p><p><span>The study is based on a large online survey, with participants recruited from a variety of sources, resulting in a socio-demographically diverse sample size of 14.8K participants. Participants could opt to complete a mini, short, medium, or long version of the questionnaire. The survey consisted of items based on individual symptoms derived from DSM-5. Symptoms were written in first person and past tense, as close to the DSM phrasing as possible but devoid of information about symptom onset, duration, frequency, and severity. Importantly, survey items were presented to participants in a </span><em>random order</em><span>. This randomness is important because in prior studies questions about symptoms were not asked or presented in a random manner. They have been asked using symptom questionnaires that cluster symptoms together in ways influenced by the diagnostic manuals or using a structured clinical interview that adopts the DSM organization. Asking about symptoms in a random order ensures that their co-occurrence is not artificially influenced by the order in which questions are asked. The survey went through multiple rounds of pilot testing, and in the end, 680 items were included. Participants reported how true each symptom statement was for them in the past 12 months on a five-point scale from </span><em>Not at all true (Never)</em><span> to </span><em>Perfectly true (Always)</em><span>. Participants were told to think about their experiences across a wide variety of contexts.</span></p><p><span>The responses were subjected to two statistical clustering methods: </span><em>iclust</em><span> and Ward’s hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Clusters were accepted for further analysis when both methods agreed. This was intended to ensure that there were no idiosyncrasies arising from reliance on one method. This resulted in 139 clusters (“syndromes”) and 81 solo symptoms. Higher-order constructs were identified using hierarchical principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering. The sample was divided into a primary sample (11.8K) and a hold-out sample (3K) to examine the robustness of results. The final classification was based on points of agreement between samples and methods.</span></p><p>The final high order structure included 8 spectra: Externalizing, Harmful Substance Use, Mania/Low Detachment, Thought Disorder, Somatoform, Eating Pathology, Internalizing, and Neurodevelopmental and Cognitive Difficulties. 27 subfactors were identified. As an example, within the internalizing spectrum, the 4 subfactors were: Distress, Social Withdrawal, Dysregulated Sleep and Trauma, and Fear. Similar to earlier literature, a single overarching dimension also emerged. This has been described before as the “p-factor” (general psychopathology factor), but Forbes et al. chose to call it the “Big Everything” to avoid reifying it.</p><p>So here it is, an empirically derived hierarchical clustering of individual symptoms across the range of psychopathology:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png" width="1456" height="814" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:814,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:298979,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BifU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F566fdb24-d95f-474c-9cf3-d3a62e242d25_2564x1433.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Forbes, et al. 2023.</figcaption></figure></div><p>The end result has a prominent convergence with the existing HiTOP model, with some points of divergence that would be important for future revisions of HiTOP.</p><p>Due to the symptom heterogeneity of DSM constructs, they are either broken down into smaller homogenous syndromes or they merge into higher-order clusters such as subfactors and spectra.

Eighteen symptoms and signs of depression were described, 10 of which are covered by the DSM criteria for major depression or melancholia. For two symptoms (mood and cognitive content), DSM criteria are considerably narrower than those described in the textbooks. Five symptoms and signs (changes in volition/motivation, slowing of speech, anxiety, other physical symptoms, and depersonalization/derealization) are not present in the DSM criteria. Compared with the DSM criteria, these authors gave greater emphasis to cognitive, physical, and psychomotor changes, and less to neurovegetative symptoms. These results suggest that important features of major depression are not captured by DSM criteria. This is unproblematic as long as DSM criteria are understood to&nbsp;</span><em>index</em><span>&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;</span><em>constitute</em><span>&nbsp;psychiatric disorders. However, since DSM-III, our field has moved toward a reification of DSM that implicitly assumes that psychiatric disorders are actually just the DSM criteria. That is, we have taken an index of something for the thing itself.”</span></p></blockquote><p><span>DSM criteria for MDD are an index, but what is the </span><em>thing itself</em><span>? If Forbes et al. are correct, the thing itself isn’t a fixed, stable entity but consists of variable and heterogenous subsets of internalizing and neurocognitive symptoms.

  <p>“Hello! I am a developer. Here is my relevant experience: I code in Hoobijag and sometimes jabbernocks and of course ABCDE++++ (but never ABCDE+/^+ are you kidding? ha!)&nbsp; and I like working with Shoobababoo and occasionally kleptomitrons. I’ve gotten to work for Company<sup id="fnref:1"><a data-id="3e2870f0-6d85-441d-a696-e5a4d36ac28e" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> doing Shoobaboo-ing code things and that’s what led me to the Snarfus. So, let’s dive in!&nbsp;</p>
<p>↑ Excerpt ↑</p>
<p>About this tutorial</p>
<p>I first started doing Very Simple Thing<sup id="fnref:2"><a data-id="8df4a1c7-7308-48cc-b322-fa39c18e069b" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> with Snarfus, but the more I used it the more I saw the potential! Despite the jaggle of the chromus, it’s really multi-purpose. And that’s what led me to argyling the pintafore with the quagmire instead of the hoobastank! I know, crazy. But it was kind of working, and actually a lot of fun… Until I hit a big roadblock: the fisterfunk will NOT talk to the shamrock portal or even send beep-boops back to the Snarfus! Of course, you know what that means<sup id="fnref:3"><a data-id="ffe570ad-86df-49e0-8d9b-debc850a3651" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>&nbsp;— Now the entire hoob-tunnel is clogged with gramelions. Unacceptable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I almost gave up but then I realized: If I connect the backside Snarfus stagnator to the backside shamrock Klingon troglodyte emulater, it’s good! Everything beep-boops and ding-dongs and I get the Actual Topic of the Tutorial, which lets me do the Very Simple Thing the way I want after all! Pretty cool<sup id="fnref:4"><a data-id="b039c94a-7f18-4d43-86eb-8ac46b97574a" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So here’s how to set it up:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><p>In the terminal, ajkl;gawgor;iqeg;iJLkqen.&nbsp; wl;R aw;oeiga 4648664 arjarwgj;llj;ja fadgfgajkljl; wlj;sdjk;lfas</p></li>
<li><p>Next go to folder/hidden/deep/in/the/file/system/surprise!.file and copy the contents of the file. If it’s not there, it might be in library/library/library/llibrary/liiiiiibrarrrary/llllliiiiibrary/hidden/hidden/hiding/you can’t find me/hidden/nope/never/hahahahereiam.file.</p></li>
<li><p>Now go back to the terminal and paste in the file contents, then type in 64A786AGR45JAR; rdja;jg [[]][[]][[]][[]]][[]()()()()()()()()(){{}{}{}|{}{|}{}{|}{ ////////////////!! !!!! !! //// !!! agjlkargji;lwej;OI [ASRGASG[]ASGDASG[]EAEadgasg[]EAGE[edaga][]ahgr-0-0=-0-=0-=0=0-0=-0-=0=-0-=0=-0=-0!!!</p></li>

<li><p>Open Snarfus and upload the file you just made.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>Just for shits and giggles, you<em>&nbsp;</em>can de-sham the chronostatiomatrix by running —()()(]]asdg a=-do —cd go cd stay —sususudododo baby shark—][] but that’s optional.&nbsp;</p></li>
<li><p>That’s it!&nbsp;</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know how it goes for you. I’d love to hear if anybody uses this approach with GewGawGamma or ometer2.7.”</p>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" data-id="3e2870f0-6d85-441d-a696-e5a4d36ac28e"><p>I probably should recognize Company because it seems illustrious but I do not recognize Company or know what they do.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:1">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2" data-id="8df4a1c7-7308-48cc-b322-fa39c18e069b"><p>It is not simple.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:2">↵</a></p></li>

<li id="fn:4" data-id="b039c94a-7f18-4d43-86eb-8ac46b97574a"><p>It<em> is</em>&nbsp;cool. I don’t really understand how, but I believe it. I’m glad you know how to do it.&nbsp; <a href="#fnref:4">↵</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:5" data-id="1385bd5d-ec29-4fdf-bdcb-65fb027612bf">
<p>The first 3 steps will take me approximately 7 hours and 193 internet searches to complete. When I finally get to Boop! it will be really satisfying.</p>
<p><strong><em>This is meant in good fun. I really appreciate the folks who take time to share their knowledge and write up tutorials and give tips and so on.&nbsp;</em></strong> <a href="#fnref:5">↵</a></p>

            A team of scientists has investigated how Earth’s twin became so inhospitable, and whether the same will happen to our planet.        </p>

    <p><span>V</span>enus is arguably the worst place in the solar system. A cloak of carbon dioxide suffocates the planet, subjecting its surface to skull-crushing pressure. Sulfuric acid rains down through the sickly yellow sky but never reaches the lava-licked ground. Venus is so hot — hot enough to melt lead — that the acid rain evaporates as it’s falling.</p>
<p>The planet’s extreme inhospitality is at the heart of one of the most beguiling mysteries in planetary science. Venus and Earth formed at the same time, from the same geologic building blocks, in pretty much the same part of the solar system. They’re even the same size. So why is Venus a hellscape, and Earth a garden?</p>
<p>A common refrain in the scientific community is that Venus is just several steps ahead — that it represents the end state of all large rocky planets, including Earth. The hypothesis is that these planets eventually lose the ability to sequester planet-warming greenhouse gases in their geologic underbelly. When those gases then accumulate in the atmosphere, the world enters a runaway greenhouse state — like the boiling hot Venusian climate. “Over the years, we’d always heard about Venus being a preview into Earth’s future,” said <a href="https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/skane">Stephen Kane</a>, a planetary astrophysicist at the University of California, Riverside.</p>

<p>But is that long-held assumption true? In hundreds of millions or billions of years, will Earth’s climate go the way of Venus’, transitioning from a temperate world into a catastrophic hothouse? Kane and his colleagues have been trying to find out. Venus and Earth are often referred to as twins, with Venus being the evil one of the pair. In their Reuniting Twins project, the scientists have developed a digital model of Earth that combines solar physics, volcanology, plate tectonics and climate science. They’ve been pushing their model Earth to its extremes, trying every plausible way to break it and make it into Venus.</p>
<p>As well as exploring what went so wrong on the second rock from the sun, this work speaks to a query closer to home, said <a href="https://eeps.wustl.edu/people/paul-byrne">Paul Byrne</a>, a planetary scientist at Washington University in St. Louis who was not directly involved with the project: “How long is Earth habitable for?”</p>

    <h2><strong>A Planetary Whodunit</strong></h2>
<p>Forecasting Earth’s future requires an understanding of Venus’ past. Long ago, Venus might not have been too different from how Earth is now. Spacecraft surveys and telescope observations have revealed the existence of a rare, heavy form of water in the Venusian atmosphere — a telltale sign that regular water used to be abundant on the planet.</p>
<p>Researchers debate how that water resided there. One possibility is that the water on young Venus formed steam that wafted above the magma sea covering the newborn planet’s surface. That water vapor, a potent greenhouse gas, would have pushed the world into a scorching-hot greenhouse state not long after its birth. Alternatively, Venus’ initial, planetwide magma sea might have cooled and hardened into a crust quickly enough for liquid water — maybe even <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasa-just-broke-the-venus-curse-heres-what-it-took/">an ocean’s worth of water</a> — to flow across it. If that is true, then what happened to all that water?</p>
<p>In 2020, <a href="https://science.gsfc.nasa.gov/sci/bio/michael.j.way">Michael Way</a>, a planetary scientist and climate modeler at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, looked at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JE006276">two possibilities</a> for how a Venusian ocean could have boiled away.</p>
    
    
    
    
<p>The first hypothesis points to the sun, which, as it ages and burns through its hydrogen fuel, blasts out ever more sunlight, subjecting nearby planets — including Venus, which sits closer to the sun than we do — to an increasingly intense blaze. Planetary scientists estimate that by about a billion years after the solar system’s birth, the gradually brightening sun would have been able to efficiently vaporize any liquid water on Venus. Water vapor would then have flooded the Venusian atmosphere, potentially causing intensive global warming; this warming might have been exacerbated further by volcanoes off-gassing carbon dioxide. The combination might have pushed Venus into a runaway greenhouse state.</p>
<p>It’s a nice story. But according to Way’s models, the theory that the sun broke Venus by evaporating its oceans has problems. Venus spins very slowly on its axis, and one day there is equivalent to 116 Earth days, or nearly four months. If the planet’s dayside initially held liquid oceans, that water’s evaporation would have formed thick clouds. Those prodigious, persistent dayside clouds would have reflected sunlight, keeping Venus cooler than it otherwise might have been and actually preventing a runaway <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-pinpoint-the-quantum-origin-of-the-greenhouse-effect-20240807/">greenhouse effect</a> and unrestrained global warming.</p>
<p>Way thinks that a more plausible suspect in Venus’ demise is a form of ruinous volcanism. In its own storied past, Earth experienced prolonged eruptions of lava in single regions, known as large igneous provinces (LIPs), that lasted for hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of years. Each of these events injected copious carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and made the world, for a time, extremely hot. One LIP 252 million years ago <a href="https://doi.org/10.1130/G47365.1">triggered</a> the <a href="https://news.st-andrews.ac.uk/archive/great-dying-what-caused-earths-biggest-mass-extinction/">worst recorded mass extinction in Earth’s history</a>, almost sterilizing the planet.</p>

    <p>Fortunately for life, after each of these LIP events, Earth gradually drew that excess carbon dioxide deep into its rocky bowels, and the planet cooled back down. It accomplished this through a process called subduction: When tectonic plates collide, one plate can descend below the other, drawing seawater rich in dissolved carbon dioxide into the abyssal depths. That carbon remains sequestered in the lower mantle for epochal lengths of time; some of it eventually erupts back into the atmosphere via volcanism. That, in a nutshell, is how <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-biography-of-earth-across-the-age-of-animals-20250915/">Earth’s global thermostat</a> is regulated.</p>

<p>It’s possible that back when there was water on Venus, it also had Earth-like plate tectonics with major subduction zones. But the system wasn’t widespread or large-scale enough to save it from a planetary immolation — especially if several LIP events occurred at roughly the same time. Way’s models show that several concurrent LIPs could have thrown vast quantities of carbon dioxide into Venus’ atmosphere, warming the world so severely that much of its liquid water boiled away into the sky, accelerating the warming further. With no oceans to speak of, all that carbon dioxide could not be reabsorbed. Moreover, water is an enabler of subduction: It lowers the melting point of rocks, allowing tectonic plates to more easily bend and break. And so, with no water left at the surface, major subduction zones would grind to a halt, preventing the entombment of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Other scientists tend to agree with Way’s assessment: The sun alone cannot be responsible for making Venus the awful place it is today. “I really do think you need multiple extreme volcanic episodes … to get there,” said <a href="https://annagulcher.com/">Anna Gülcher</a>, a planetary scientist at the University of Bern in Switzerland.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Break the World</strong></h2>
<p>While studying Venus and its runaway greenhouse wasteland, Kane became morbidly curious: Could the same fate befall Earth? “What if we shut down the carbon cycle on Earth?” he said. “Could you produce a Venus?”</p>
<p>To find out, he and his team built a virtual world-destroying machine. “Everybody loves a post-apocalyptic or doomsday scenario, provided it’s 5 billion years in our future,” he said.</p>

    <p>The first step was to fast-forward their model of Earth about 3.5 billion years, to when the sun and planets will be 8 billion years old. At that point, the sun will shine brighter than it does today, and Earth’s atmosphere will receive the same level of roasting-hot starlight that Venus did when it was just 1 billion years old. Back then, it’s thought, Venus would have been at a tipping point: either temperate and waterlogged, or burnt to a crisp. The 8 billion-year-old sun will push Earth to a similar, climatic knife-edge.</p>
<p>The team’s model suggests that in 3.5 billion years, Earth’s oceans could begin evaporating and become heat-trapping water vapor in the atmosphere. That could be sufficient to kill off Earth’s major subduction zones, since without water, there might be no subduction (plus, there would be less water for carbon dioxide to dissolve into in the first place). “We’re losing the ability to draw back that CO<sub>2</sub> into the Earth’s mantle. So it just builds up,” said <a href="https://www.michellehillphd.com/">Michelle Hill</a> of Stanford University, a member of the Reuniting Twins project.</p>
<p>The shutdown of major subduction zones would mean that the Earth’s tectonic plates stop clashing and jostling about. Instead, they would form a near-united rocky shell around the hot mantle. For a time, the mantle would get hotter, since the shell around it would trap heat generated by radioactively decaying compounds inside it. As heat accumulates in the interior, the Earth in Kane’s simulations would experience an uptick in volcanism lasting for about 15 million years.</p>
<p>This period, known as a “stagnant lid regime,” adds even more carbon dioxide to the sky. But the eruptive spike is short-lived. The mantle cools down and the crust thickens until it becomes nearly impermeable to any major carbon-erupting volcanism.</p>
<p>So 15 million years after its stagnant lid forms, Earth will have reached a new equilibrium. Occasional spurts of volcanism would still happen. (Likewise, scientists have found <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/venus-is-volcanically-alive?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1716366279998">compelling</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/27/science/venus-volcanoes-lava.html">evidence</a> that Venus is volcanically active today.) But Kane explained that these sporadic eruptions aren’t expected to add much carbon to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>At that point, the team’s simulations stop. How Venus-like is their model of the future Earth?</p>

    <h2><strong>There’s No Place Like Venus</strong></h2>
<p>If or when Earth’s large-scale subduction shuts off in about 3.5 billion years, kneecapping the planet’s ability to bury carbon, Kane and his team’s simulations indicate that the carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere will rise anywhere from 0.1 bars to 0.8 bars. (For reference, the total atmospheric pressure at sea level today is 1 bar, and roughly 0.04% of that, or 0.042 bars, comes from carbon dioxide.) Even in their best-case scenario of a 0.1-bar rise in carbon dioxide, Earth’s surface temperature surpasses 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit). The same happens at 0.8 bars, but far more quickly.</p>
<p>Either way, the surface of the world becomes literally boiling hot. Earth will “turn into a post-runaway greenhouse state,” Kane said. “The surface temperature will be too hot for any water. It’ll all boil away.” Nothing sitting on the world’s skin would survive.</p>
<p>Still, Earth won’t get close to the state that Venus is in today. “It’d be Venus lite,” Kane said.</p>
<p>Venus has a 93-bar atmosphere consisting of 96.5% carbon dioxide. Kane and his colleagues’ doomsday machine, no matter how hard they push it, cannot take Earth to those levels. “I was surprised by that,” he said. Because the mantle is sealed off by a stagnant lid, volcanism drops, protecting Earth from a Venus-style roasting better than he thought.</p>
<p>Independent scientists have praised the Reuniting Twins project for challenging prior assumptions and adding significantly to the discussion about the terminal state of rocky planets.</p>
        
        
<p>“I like their idea,” Way said, adding that the team’s version of a future Earth “doesn’t sound unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“You end up with a world that’s stinkingly hot,” said Byrne, the Washington University planetary scientist. But, he said, the possibility that it may not be Venusian levels of hot is intriguing.</p>
<p>Kane’s team acknowledged that their model hasn’t considered LIP-style mega-eruptions, and that these events could feasibly add a bounty of trapped carbon to the atmosphere at any point in the future. Maybe Earth gets unlucky and experiences multiple, simultaneous LIP events (though this grows less likely over time, Kane said, as the mantle cools and its churning slows). If so, that scenario could push Earth to be more like Venus than the team’s model suggests.</p>
<p>Uncertainties abound. But if Kane’s team is even broadly correct, it suggests that Venus has a uniquely grim history. Something — perhaps an inundation of lava — burned that planet to the bone. Earth, meanwhile, has so far been unable to bring about its own destruction. Let’s hope that remains the case long into the future.</p>

															<h2>How can I influence others without manipulating them?</h2>										<div>
				<p>We influence others every day, whether we intend to or not. Sometimes it is through the way we argue, sometimes through the way we listen, and sometimes simply through the story we tell about what matters. Influence is not the property of the few who hold authority. It is the currency of all relationships.</p>
<p>The word persuasion often carries with it the scent of manipulation, as though one person is moving another toward something they do not really want. But there is another way to hold it. Influence can be understood as an invitation. It is the art of meeting people where they are, of entering their world with respect, and of opening a door that they might choose to walk through with us.</p>
<p>This article invites you to consider five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging. Each opens a different path into relationship and commitment. Each has its gifts. Each, when overused, can become a wall instead of a door.</p>
<p>The practice is not to master all five overnight, but to grow our awareness and our range. Persuasion is not a personality trait. It is a skill. It asks us to listen, to notice, and to choose consciously how we invite others.</p>
<h2>Our own doorway: The blind spot of preference</h2>
<p>Most of us have a default style of persuasion. Perhaps you lean on facts. Perhaps you rely on conviction. Perhaps you search for compromise, tell stories, or call on the voices of others. None of these is wrong. Each is a doorway.</p>
<p>Yet our default does more than shape how we speak. It shapes how we see. If I lean on data, I may hear someone’s story as weak rather than inspiring. If I favour conviction, I may interpret hesitation as lack of commitment, when it might be an opening for negotiation. If I thrive on inspiration, I may dismiss detail-oriented questions as nit-picking rather than as a real need for clarity. If I am most comfortable with bridging, I may feel uneasy with those who are direct and independent.</p>
<p>Our own doorway becomes a filter. It colours what we pay attention to, what we dismiss, and how we react. The danger is that we mistake difference for resistance. We think they are being difficult, when in fact they are simply standing at another door.</p>
<p>Becoming aware of our preference allows us to pause. Instead of defending our own style, we can ask: What is the invitation they are offering me through their language and behaviour? Which door are they holding open that I have overlooked because I was guarding my own?</p>
<p>Influence begins with this act of humility. The willingness to see that the door we most trust may not be the one others are waiting at.</p>
<p>Once we recognise our blind spot, we are ready to notice the variety of doors available to us. Influence is not one way, it is five ways. Each has its own language, its own gifts, and its own risks. Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging are not personality types but choices. At any moment, we can choose to knock on a different door, depending on where others are standing and what the moment requires.</p>
<p>What follows is a closer look at each door. how to recognise it, how to walk through it well, and how to avoid turning it into a wall.</p>
<h2>Rationalising: The door of logic</h2>
<p>Rationalising is the style that seeks to persuade through facts, evidence, and analysis. It appeals to those who are comforted by structure and clarity. When someone asks for data, compares benchmarks, or worries about risk and performance, they are standing at the rational door.</p>
<p>This style has its strengths. It reassures the finance director who needs a business case. It appeals to the engineer who wants proof that the system will not fail. It builds trust with the analyst who measures quality by what can be verified.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we come prepared. We gather our facts. We organise our thinking into a clear flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation. We know the return on investment, the efficiency gains, the quality improvements. We anticipate objections and hold evidence ready to meet them. We present data not as a weapon but as a gift of clarity.</p>
<p>Yet logic alone is not enough. Overused, it can become cold and detached. The person across from us may long for empathy, but we bury them in numbers. They may seek relationship, but we offer them a chart. Rationalising can easily turn into proving a point rather than creating understanding.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which metrics or outcomes matter most to this person, and have I framed my case in those terms, for example ROI, risk, quality or efficiency?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is my one-page flow: problem, options, evidence, recommendation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which objections are most likely, and what independent sources will I cite to address them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will a chart or comparison clarify, and where could visuals overwhelm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What level of evidence would be enough for this decision, and how will I check for overload signals in the moment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where might I be using facts to prove a point rather than to build shared understanding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If they are not data-driven, which second door will I pivot to after I test for fit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What jargon should I remove to keep the message precise and clear?</p>
<h2>Asserting: The door of conviction</h2>
<p>Asserting persuades through confidence, authority, and clarity. It is the voice that speaks directly and without hesitation. It is the person who values decisiveness, who prefers a straight line over a winding explanation, who respects those who stand their ground.</p>
<p>You recognise this style when someone expresses strong opinions with little hesitation, when they challenge ideas and expect you to do the same, when they respond best to conviction rather than ambiguity. For them, clarity is a form of respect.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we speak with confidence. We choose firm language, declarative statements, uncluttered by qualifiers. We are direct and concise. We know our boundaries, and we state them. We are ready with anchor points: two or three firm reasons why our proposal matters.</p>
<p>The temptation, though, is to confuse assertiveness with aggression. Overused, asserting becomes domineering. It silences others. It leaves no room for dialogue. It builds resistance where it meant to build respect.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What exactly am I asking for in one clear sentence?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is non-negotiable, and what is flexible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What two or three anchor reasons will I use to support my position?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I signal credibility without drifting into name-dropping or status plays?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What does matching their energy look like while staying respectful and calm?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will I deliberately pause to listen so I do not over-talk the room?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What early signals tell me I am tipping into pressure, and how will I de-escalate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If directness stalls the dialogue, what is my next door to try?</p>
<h2>Negotiating: The door of balance</h2>
<p>Negotiating persuades by finding common ground. It seeks the middle path, the workable solution, the compromise that honours both sides. It is rooted in the belief that influence is not about victory but about mutual benefit.</p>
<p>You notice this style in those who raise concerns gently, who suggest meeting halfway, who speak in terms of “what if” and “could we.” They are pragmatic. They value win–win outcomes. They prefer flexibility over confrontation.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we listen closely to uncover the real concern beneath the stated one. We protect what matters most to us while staying open to trade-offs. We come with options. We ask open-ended questions. We remain collaborative, treating the conversation as joint problem-solving.</p>
<p>But compromise has its dangers. Overused, negotiation turns into unnecessary concession. We may be seen as weak or uncertain. Others may begin every conversation expecting us to bend. We may give away value before fully exploring our own position.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is the real concern beneath what is being said, and how will I surface it with open questions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which larger goals or principles am I protecting, and what are my red lines?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What tradables or creative options can I offer that create value without giving away too much?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What do I expect in return for each concession?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I hold a respectful, collaborative tone so we stay in joint problem solving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	At what point would compromise become drift, and how will I name that threshold?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If others expect automatic concessions from me, how will I reset expectations early?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What alternative door will I use if bargaining signals are not present?</p>
<h2>Inspiring: The door of vision</h2>
<p>Inspiring persuades through story, metaphor, and imagination. It calls people to something larger than themselves. It shifts the focus from what is practical to what is possible.</p>
<p>You know you are with an inspiring type when they disengage from technical talk but light up at mention of purpose or possibility. They ask about impact and legacy. They respond to stories and metaphors. They look for meaning, not just measurement.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we tell relevant stories. We use vivid language and imagery. We connect ideas to values and aspirations. We speak with authenticity and passion. We invite others to imagine: What if you could? What would it feel like if…?</p>
<p>Yet inspiration without grounding can lose its way. Overused, it becomes idealistic, disconnected from reality, heavy with promise and light on delivery. Listeners may nod politely but ask for numbers that never come. Trust fades when vision is not matched by action.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	What specific story from their world will make this possibility feel real and credible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What image or analogy will help them visualise success?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which values or purpose of theirs does this idea serve, for example impact, legacy, innovation or customer experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is the smallest concrete next step that grounds the vision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where will I invite imagination with a genuine what if question, then check for practical concerns?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What numbers or proof points should I have ready if they ask for them?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I keep my tone authentic so enthusiasm does not outpace deliverables?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If inspiration lands politely but without commitment, which door will I move to next?</p>
<h2>Bridging: The door of relationship</h2>
<p>Bridging persuades through connection and social proof. It is the style that builds trust by involving others, by leaning on shared experience, by showing that someone else has walked this path before.</p>
<p>You recognise it when someone asks, “Who else is doing this?” or seems hesitant until they hear a peer’s endorsement. They value rapport and trust more than unknown data. They commit when they see others they respect committing.</p>
<p>To enter this door well, we bring in mutual contacts. We offer testimonials and case studies. We emphasise shared goals. We give before we ask, offering help, making introductions, extending reciprocity. We are warm and attentive, because this style rests on human connection.</p>
<p>But here too lies a danger. Overused, bridging makes us dependent on others. We may delay decisions, waiting for third-party validation. We may undermine our own authority, deferring to outside voices instead of speaking for ourselves.</p>
<h3>Reflection questions</h3>
<p>&nbsp;•	Who do they already trust that I can appropriately involve, and how will I make that connection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Which case study or testimonial best mirrors their context?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I frame our shared goals so alignment is explicit?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What value can I offer first, for example a helpful introduction or insight, before asking for commitment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	How will I keep momentum without waiting for every third party to weigh in?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Where do I need to speak in my own voice so I do not over-rely on others’ validation?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	What is my plan to sustain the relationship beyond this single decision?</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	If bridging slows progress, which door should I try to regain decisiveness?</p>
<h2>Living the paradox of influence</h2>
<p>Each of these five doors, Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, offers a path into relationship. Each works best when it honours the person we hope to influence rather than serving only our own habits.</p>
<p>The paradox is that any of them, when overused, becomes a wall. Logic turns cold. Conviction turns harsh. Compromise turns weak. Vision turns empty. Relationship turns dependent. What begins as invitation can end as imposition.</p>
<p>The practice is not to abandon our natural style but to notice when it no longer serves. To ask: Which doorway is this person already standing at? What language are they using? What energises them? What shuts them down?</p>
<p>Influence then becomes less about pressing harder on the door we know, and more about walking around to the door they are holding open.</p>
<p>Persuasion is not about clever tactics or manipulation. It is about presence. It is about listening for what matters to others and choosing consciously how we invite them.</p>
<p>The question that remains for each of us is simple: Which door will you choose to knock on in your next conversation?</p>

<h2>Influenced by</h2>
<p>The five doors of influence: Rationalising, Asserting, Negotiating, Inspiring, and Bridging, are my synthesis, but several bodies of work have shaped them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Gary Yukl’s research on leadership influence tactics, which identified patterns such as rational persuasion, pressure, exchange, inspirational appeals, and coalition tactics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Robert Cialdini’s principles of persuasion, especially authority, social proof, reciprocity, and consistency, which continue to show how people respond to influence in practice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Negotiation practice and theory, from both organisational behaviour research and classic works on principled negotiation, which highlight the importance of mutual benefit and trade-offs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	Leadership and change literature, including Peter Block’s writings on community and invitation, which shape the idea of influence as a relational act rather than a manipulative one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•	My own work with leadership teams, where repeated practice has confirmed that leaders tend to default to one or two styles, often without realising the limits this creates in how they see and respond to others.</p>
<p>These streams converge in the five doors. They are not meant as a new theory, but as a practical frame that leaders can hold in the moment, to choose how they wish to invite others.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We formulate the task of detecting lines and paragraphs in a document into a unified two-level clustering problem. Given a set of text detection boxes that roughly correspond to words, a text line is a cluster of boxes and a paragraph is a cluster of lines. These clusters form a two-level tree that represents a major part of the layout of a document. We use a graph convolutional network to predict the relations between text detection boxes and then build both levels of clusters from these predictions. Experimentally, we demonstrate that the unified approach can be highly efficient while still achieving state-of-the-art quality for detecting paragraphs in public benchmarks and real-world images.

              <p>The latest nightly releases of Mojo (and our next stable release) include initial support for a new accelerator architecture: Apple Silicon GPUs!</p>
<p>We know that one of the biggest barriers to programming GPUs is access to hardware. It’s our hope that by making it possible to use Mojo to develop for a GPU present in every modern Mac, we can further democratize developing GPU-accelerated algorithms and AI models. This should also enable new paths of local-to-cloud development for AI models and more.</p>
<p>To get started, you need to have an Apple Silicon Mac (we support all M1 - M4 series chips) running macOS 15 or newer, with Xcode 16 or newer installed. The version of the Metal Shading Language we use (3.2, AIR bitcode version 2.7.0) needs the macOS 15 SDK, and you’ll get an error about incompatible bitcode versions if you run on an older macOS or use an older version of Xcode that doesn’t have the macOS 15 SDK.</p>
<p>You can clone our <a href="https://github.com/modular/modular"><code>modular</code></a> repository and try out one of our GPU function examples in the <code>examples/mojo/gpu-functions</code> directory. All but the <code>reduction.mojo</code> example should work on Apple Silicon GPUs today in the latest nightlies. Additionally, puzzles 1-15 of the <a href="https://puzzles.modular.com/introduction.html">Mojo GPU puzzles</a> should now work on Apple Silicon GPUs with the latest nightly. We haven’t yet updated the Pixi environment for the GPU puzzles to add Apple Silicon support, so for now you may need to run the Mojo code manually from another environment.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-current-capabilities-1" href="#p-5775-current-capabilities-1"></a>Current capabilities</h2>
<p>This is just the beginning of our support for Apple Silicon GPUs, and many pieces of functionality still need to be built out. Known features that don’t work today include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intrinsics for many hardware capabilities
<ul>
<li>Not all Mojo GPU examples work, such as <code>reduction.mojo</code> and the more complex matrix multiplication examples</li>
<li>GPU puzzles 16 and above need more advanced hardware features</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Basic MAX graphs</li>
<li>MAX custom ops</li>
<li>PyTorch interoperability</li>
<li>Running AI models</li>
<li>Serving AI models</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll emphasize that even simple MAX graphs, and by extension AI models, don’t yet run on Apple Silicon GPUs. In our Python APIs, <code>accelerator_count()</code> will still return 0 until we have basic MAX graph support enabled. Hopefully, that won’t be long.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-next-steps-2" href="#p-5775-next-steps-2"></a>Next steps</h2>
<p>We’ve identified many of the technical blockers to progressively enable the above. The current list of what we plan to work on includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handle <code>MAX_THREADS_PER_BLOCK_METADATA</code> and similar aliases</li>
<li>Support <code>GridDim</code>, <code>lane_id</code></li>
<li>Enable <code>async_copy_*</code></li>
<li>Convert arguments of an array type to a pointer type</li>
<li>Support <code>bfloat16</code> on ARM devices</li>
<li>Support <code>SubBuffer</code></li>
<li>Enable atomic operations</li>
<li>Complete implementation of <code>MetalDeviceContext::synchronize</code></li>
<li>Enable captured arguments</li>
<li>Support <code>print</code> and <code>debug_assert</code></li>
</ul>
<p>I apologize for some of the cryptic error messages you may get when hitting a piece of missing functionality, or encountering a system configuration we aren’t yet compatible with. We hope to improve the messaging over time, and to provide better guides for debugging failures.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-how-this-works-3" href="#p-5775-how-this-works-3"></a>How this works</h2>
<p>To learn more about how Mojo code is compiled to target Apple Silicon GPUs, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/t2hAfgDYHoc?si=5X7E70xAi_eMjCMN&amp;t=1557">Amir Nassereldine’s detailed technical presentation from our recent Modular Community Meeting</a>. He did amazing work in establishing the fundamentals during his summer internship, and we are now building on that to advance Mojo on this new architecture.</p>
<p>In brief, a multi-step process is used to compile and run Mojo code on an Apple Silicon GPU. First, we compile Mojo GPU functions to Apple Intermediate Representation (AIR) bitcode. This is done through lowering to LLVM IR, and then specifically converting to Metal-compatible AIR.</p>
<p>Mojo handles interactions with an accelerator through the <code>DeviceContext</code> type. In the case of Apple Silicon GPUs, we’ve specialized this into a<code>MetalDeviceContext</code> that handles the next stages in compilation and execution.</p>
<p>The <code>MetalDeviceContext</code> uses the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/">Metal-cpp API</a> to compile the AIR representation into a <code>.metallib</code> for execution on device. Once the <code>.metallib</code> is ready, the <code>MetalDeviceContext</code> manages a Metal <code>CommandQueue</code>, and buffers operations for moving data, running a GPU function, and more. All of this happens behind-the-scenes and a Mojo developer doesn’t need to worry about any of it.</p>
<p>Code that you’ve written to run on an NVIDIA or AMD GPUs should mostly just work on an Apple Silicon GPU, assuming no device-specific features were being used. Obviously, different patterns will be required to get the most performance out of each GPU, and we’re excited to explore this new optimization space on Apple Silicon GPUs with you.</p>
<h2><a name="p-5775-just-the-beginning-4" href="#p-5775-just-the-beginning-4"></a>Just the beginning</h2>
<p>While we’d love help in bringing up Apple Silicon GPU support, some of the infrastructure for introducing support for new AIR intrinsics and compiling them to a <code>.metallib</code> currently requires Modular developers for implementation. We’ll get more of the basics in place before work moves primarily to the open-source standard library and kernels, at which point community members will be able to do a lot more to advance compatibility. Contributions are always welcome, but we don’t want you to hit missing non-public components and get frustrated by being unable to move forward.</p>
<p>We’ll share much more documentation and content on how to work with and optimize for this new hardware family, but we’re extremely excited about even these first few steps onto Apple Silicon GPUs. I’ll to try to keep this post up to date as we expand functionality.</p>

            <p>Our Docker containers largely use Linux within them. Due to the requirement for Xcode tooling to build the <code>.metallib</code> from Mojo code, you’d need to have a virtualized macOS environment in the container. We haven’t yet built a container like that.</p>

            <p>Googling / AI Overlording around it looks like you can’t even mount the gpu from mac into a container anyways. Unless someone knows something I don’t, I’m guessing the guidance on mojo + metal is via host.</p>

   <p>SACRAMENTO, Calif — California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning law enforcement from wearing masks on duty except for things like riot gear, medical masks and undercover work.</p>   <p>Saying it's the first bill of its type in the country, Newsom — a Democrat and frequent critic of President Trump — said it was a sign of growing authoritarianism to have detentions in by masked men "hidden from accountability, any transparency, any oversight. That's Trump's America."</p>   <p>He said federal agents had operated for years in the state unmasked and called masking "a new construct conceived to terrorize our diverse communities." </p>   
   <p>The law, called by sponsors the "<a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260SB627" target="_blank"><u>No Secret Police Act</u></a>," comes in response to increased immigration enforcement in California, particularly in Los Angeles. Newsom went to L.A. for the bill signing.</p>   <p>President Trump's mass deportation program has led to scenes of masked federal agents detaining people off the streets, often without badges or indicating what agency they're from. The city has been the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5427176/the-latest-on-the-la-protests-sparked-by-immigration-sweeps" target="_blank">scene of protests</a> against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids.</p>   <h3 id="The">The impact of the law could be decided in court</h3>   <p>The law takes effect next year. It's unclear exactly what powers state lawmakers have to regulate the conduct of federal law enforcement. University of California, Davis law professor Raquel Aldana says California is trying to use this law to identify what federal agents can and cannot do within a state.</p>   <p>She said there has to be a line somewhere for states outlawing — as hypothetical extremes — things like murder or torture by federal agents. "At some point, the answer has to be 'no' and I think this is what the state of California is trying to do. Establish limits as to how much the federal government can do within the jurisdiction of the state. It's an issue of state sovereignty."</p>   
   <p>Lawmakers in a few other states, including New York and Massachusetts, are considering similar moves.</p>   <p>ICE declined to comment when contacted by NPR. In general, ICE officials have said their agents wear masks to prevent from being identified in videos or photos posted online, sometimes resulting in threats to them or their families.</p>   <p>Newsom also signed several other bills including one that would require law enforcement to clearly display their name or badge number while on duty; another requiring schools to notify parents and staff when immigration enforcement is on site; and two others prohibiting schools and health care facilities from allowing ICE agents on their grounds without valid warrants.</p>   <p>Aldana noted that the legal impact of the mask law on federal law enforcement could be weakened because it does not apply to California state-level law enforcement.</p>   <p>But it does apply to police and sheriffs offices and other local agencies, who routinely operate unmasked. By July 2026, their agencies have to issue mask policies following the law.</p>   <h3 id="California">California law enforcement groups have opposed it</h3>   <p>Several California organizations representing local law enforcement agencies, including the California State Sheriff's Association, opposed the bill, calling it reckless and dangerous to officers and their families.</p>   <p>Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican running in the 2026 race for governor, said the ban showed Newsom and Democratic lawmakers care more about the safety of criminals than officers.</p>   <p>"They didn't ban criminals from wearing masks, they didn't tell criminals that they had to identify themselves," Bianco said while campaigning in Northern California on Friday. "Every single person that voted for that needs to be eliminated in the next election. Anyone that votes for those people are absolute idiots."</p>   <p>The Peace Officers Research Association of California — representing over 80,000 public safety members — and the California Police Chiefs Association were also against the bill.</p>   
   <p>Giselle Garcia with NorCal Resist, a Sacramento-based mutual aid organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants at risk of deportation, said the ban would be helpful even if it's not enforceable.</p>   <p>"There's always a tension between state rights versus the federal government's rights and scope of power," Garcia said. "However, what we do know is that when things are codified under law, there is more of an opportunity to not just cite to law, but hopefully there's some kind of basis for litigation to really challenge when there's a federal government abuse happening."</p>   <p>Garcia said the organization's court observers have been verbally harassed and physically assaulted by ICE agents wearing masks who refuse to identify themselves when asked.</p>      <p><a href="https://www.capradio.org/about/bios/gerardo-zavala/" target="_blank"><em>Gerardo Zavala</em></a><em> covers state government and politics for Capradio.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="4189490c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default">
					<p>LaLiga, Spain’s top football league, is facing a firestorm of criticism after boasting about a staggering 142% increase in anti-piracy takedown notices in early 2025 while simultaneously causing <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-seeks-charges-against-google-and-apple-execs-for-not-remotely-removing-apps-from-peoples-phones">extensive collateral damage across the internet</a>.</p>
<p>As the 2025/2026 season began on August 15, LaLiga ramped up its enforcement strategy, triggering widespread outages for entirely lawful websites, services, and platforms.</p>
<p>These disruptions are tied to a controversial anti-piracy scheme operated in partnership with telecom giant Telefónica.</p>
<p>The initiative, which enjoys judicial backing in Spain, allows LaLiga to instruct major internet service providers, including Movistar, Vodafone, Orange, and DIGI, to block IP addresses suspected of hosting unauthorized streams.</p>
<p>The fallout is that entire chunks of the internet go dark for Spanish users, often during match broadcasts.</p>
<p>LaLiga doesn’t target specific infringing content. Instead, it flags entire IP ranges, many of which are shared by thousands of unrelated domains.</p>
<p>When one site is accused of hosting pirated material, everyone else sharing that IP address gets swept up in the block.</p>
<p>The result is a digital dragnet that has ensnared companies as diverse as Amazon, Cloudflare, GitHub, Twitch, and even Google Fonts.</p>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/end-game-twitch-servers-among-hundreds-blocked-for-piracy-by-spanish-isps-250504/">TorrentFreak</a> has documented repeated weekly blocks of platforms <a href="https://reclaimthenet.org/laliga-spain-internet-censorship-vercel-blocking-piracy-shield">like Vercel since early 2025</a>, while Catalonia’s own .cat domain registry has also reported service disruptions.</p>
<p>The issue became so disruptive that iXsystems, the team behind TrueNAS, a widely used open-source NAS operating system, was forced to shift its distribution model entirely. After its CDN IPs were repeatedly blocked in Spain, making critical security updates inaccessible to users, the developers resorted to distributing their software via BitTorrent.</p>
<p>“These locks have a significant collateral damage about legitimate services, which have nothing to do with football piracy,” TrueNAS noted. Their solution not only bypasses censorship but hands the bandwidth burden back to the same ISPs complicit in the blocking.</p>
<p>In TrueNAS’s official community forums, users from Spain, Italy, and France reported ongoing issues with downloads and connectivity.</p>
<p>Some turned to VPNs to circumvent the blocks, though even popular providers like Cloudflare’s free WARP service were reportedly blocked during peak match times.</p>
<p>LaLiga, meanwhile, continues to tout its enforcement record. A self-published report revealed that over 26 million takedown notices were sent in the first half of 2025 alone, more than doubling the total from all of 2024.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg" alt="Screenshot of a translated tweet from LaLiga reporting anti‑piracy results: it says detection of piracy in live sports reached historic numbers, a 142% increase in notifications to digital intermediaries in the first half of 2025 versus all of 2024, and a 60% reduction in piracy in the 24/25 season, above a coral‑bordered white graphic that reads NOTA INFORMATIVA and LALIGA." width="884" height="952" srcset="https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng.jpg 884w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-279x300.jpg 279w, https://reclaimthenet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A9zZxeOZndng-768x827.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 884px) 100vw, 884px"></p>
<p>Yet despite this surge, only 11% of flagged streams were actually taken offline. LaLiga’s primary targets include hosting services and infrastructure providers, where enforcement remains minimal.</p>
<p>Legal challenges to the league’s blocking strategy are piling up. Cloudflare and RootedCON have taken their grievances to Spain’s Constitutional Court after lower courts refused to curb the overreach.</p>
<p>Despite mounting pressure, there is no indication that the blanket blocking will stop. On the contrary, as the new season unfolds, users are bracing for more censorship.</p>
<p>Calls for reform are growing louder. Opponents of the regime argue that the current system punishes lawful users while failing to meaningfully curb piracy.</p>
<p>As long as courts uphold LaLiga’s authority to dictate who gets to be online during football games, entire swaths of the internet will remain at risk, collateral in a campaign that blurs the line between protection and overreach.</p>
<p>The reality is clear. LaLiga’s war on piracy has become a war on the open web.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The University of Oxford has fallen out of the top three universities in the UK for the first time, according to <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk-university-rankings/feature-guide/article/best-good-university-guide-2026-nlg69hm5k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>The Times and The Sunday Times Good University Guide for 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Both Oxford and Cambridge universities have been supplanted by Durham University, which now holds the third-place spot among the top universities in the UK.</p>



<p>Oxford and Cambridge are tied for fourth in the 2026 rankings, after falling due to their relatively poor performance in the latest National Student Survey.</p>



<p>Durham University was named The Times’s University of the Year, although the number-one ranked university in the UK remained the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) for the second year in a row.</p>



<p>Second place was held by the University of St Andrews, again for the second consecutive year.</p>



<p>While the University of St Andrews ranked very highly in student experience and teaching quality, it lost out to the LSE in graduate prospects and research quality.</p>



<p>Durham University improved by 30 places year-on-year in its students’ evaluation of teaching quality, which was the main driver in securing its third place in the overall university league table.</p>



<p>“Durham is an outstanding place to study. We ensure that every student can grow and thrive here,” said Durham University Vice-Chancellor Professor Karen O’Brien.</p>



<p>“Our loyal, engaged alumni are testament to the impressive career prospects that await our graduates.”</p>



<p>The table below shows the top 20 universities in the United Kingdom, according to The Times University Rankings 2026.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>The following has never happened to me but I often hear stories.</p>
<p>You go into work and discover that a coworker isn't happy with some
code you wrote because they don't understand it. They go to your
manager and tell them that you're being a problem by writing code they
don't understand. Your manager, being very skilled in conflict
resolution, makes a technical decision to avoid whatever tool you used
which caused the problem. In your case it was functional programming.</p>
<p>That's it. You've been told. No more functional programming.</p>
<p>The manager has figured out what's good for the business and you figure
that listening is what's good for your job.</p>
<p>You get back to your desk and take a ticket from JIRA. You've got to
add a page listing a person's coworkers to your internal employee
directory. First you write a function you need.</p>
<pre><code>def userCoworkers(u: User): List[Employee] =
  u.departments.flatMap(_.employees)</code></pre>
<p>But it's pure. You're doing functional programming! Stop</p>
<pre><code>def userCoworkers(u: User): List[Employee] = {
  val coworkers = ListBuffer[Employee]()
  for { d &lt;- departments }
    coworkers ++ d.employees
  coworkers.toList
}</code></pre>
<p>Well, there's a side-effect involved, but the whole method is pure.
You're still doing functional programming!</p>
<pre><code>def userCoworkers(u: User): List[Employee] = {
  logger.info("Collecting coworkers")
  val coworkers = ListBuffer[Employee]()
  for { d &lt;- departments }
    coworkers ++ d.employees
  coworkers.toList
}</code></pre>
<p>Now the method has 1 external side-effect. Is that enough? With "no
functional programming" you've been given a lower-bound of 1
side-effect per method but we don't really know what the ideal number
is. Hopefully you can slip it through code review.</p>
<p>After this exercise you've learned how easy it is to not do functional
programming.</p>
<p>You show it to your product manager. They didn't realise how many
coworkers the average person had. The page is huge. They ask you to just
change it to a number.</p>
<p>You're going to have to add numbers together. Without being pure.
You're going to have to think about this one.</p>
<p>Maybe you should ask your manager how to do it. Good luck.</p>

		<p>Why does Space Station 14 crash with ANGLE on ARM64? 6 hours later…</p>
<p>So. I’ve been continuing work on getting ARM64 builds out for Space Station 14. The thing I was working on yesterday were launcher builds, specifically a <em>single</em> download that supports both ARM64 and x64. I’d already gotten the game client itself running natively on ARM64, and it worked perfectly fine in my dev environment. I wrote all the new launcher code, am pretty sure I got it right. Zip it up, test it on ARM64, aaand…</p>
<p>The game client crashes on Windows ARM64. Both in my VM and on Julian’s real Snapdragon X laptop.</p>
<h2 id="debugging-logs">
	<a href="#debugging-logs">
		Debugging: logs
	</a>
</h2><p>The client logs are empty. They suspiciously cut out right after SDL is initialized.</p>
<p>Of course it isn’t that easy.</p>

	<a href="#debugging-pulling-windbg-out-of-the-shed">

</p>
<p>So at first I decided to start <code>Space Station 14 Launcher.exe</code> directly through WinDbg. This is annoying because I have to go into child processes (with <code>.childdbg 1</code>) twice, and for some reason there’s a lot of waiting, but it does work…</p>
<p>The game crashes in <code>USER32!GetDC</code> on an <em>illegal instruction</em>, somewhere after SDL does <em>something</em>. I barely glanced at the disassembly but it made no sense to me, so I just assumed there’s some UB happening and didn’t think much of it. After all, <em>why would the implementation of <code>GetDC()</code> have broken assembly?</em></p>

<p>WinDbg was also unable to pull stack frames from C# code. It did, thankfully, clearly communicate <em>why</em> this was. Yep, it’s our friend&nbsp;<a href="https://slugcat.systems/post/24-11-20-why-should-you-download-more-ram/"><code>mscordaccore</code></a> again!</p>

Let’s just do it without C# debugging, I can probably manage based off the SDL stack trace.

And that gets us a bit further, we now have proper function names for SDL3!</p>

</p>
<p>So I double click one of the entries in the UI’s stack trace view. And the entire debugger breaks. Stack trace view goes empty. Every action I try to make causes more of these errors to be printed:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="plain"><span><span>Machine is not a possible execution machine

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now even WinDbg is broken??</p>
<p>Googling these errors gave nothing useful. One of them gave <em>not a single result</em>. After just pondering the error for a moment, I thought “wait, why is the command prompt still saying <code>ARM64EC&gt;</code>? ARM64EC is for emulation, but the active debugger processes (<code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> and <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>) are both native ARM64.</p>
<p>Turns out that it’s because I started <code>Space Station 14 Launcher.exe</code> directly. You see, that executable is x64 native, and its only job is to set up the .NET environment and launch the <em>actual</em> ARM64 executable. Something about <em>starting</em> the debugging session with that program causes WinDbg to get extremely confused when later looking at the child processes it spawns.</p>
<p>From this point on I just started launching <code>SS14.Launcher.exe</code> directly<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. This means I wasn’t setting up the same <code>DOTNET_ROOT</code> (because WinDbg can’t set environment variables when launching things… yes really), but this didn’t really matter. This fixed both the “Machine is not a possible execution machine” errors <em>and</em> the issues with showing C# stack traces. I guess WinDbg is compiled for ARM64 after all, and it just decided to run an x64 debug host when you start debugging an x64 application. Fair enough I guess?</p>
<h2 id="debugging-whats-sdl-doing">
	<a href="#debugging-whats-sdl-doing">
		Debugging: what’s SDL doing?
	</a>
</h2><p>After figuring out all of the above, we could <em>really</em> get started. I also opted to swap out <code>SDL3.dll</code> with a locally-built copy, so that the debugger could locate source files<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. What SDL is doing is pretty straight forward: the first time the window is shown, it clears the background with GDI commands:</p>

</picture>
</p>
<p>I mean… this is like, fine, right? I mean I don’t know much about this code, but why would this crash on ARM but not x64??? The window is valid. <code>GetDC()</code> is an extremely fundamental Win32 function call. If there was something broken with it, my OS would not be usable. What the fuck is going on?</p>
<p>The <code>if (ShouldClearWindowOnEraseBackground(data))</code> allows it to be disabled via a hint, which can be specified by environment variable. This fixes the crash… until you open a second OS window, then SDL3 calls <code>GetDC()</code> once again and <em>that</em> crashes. Not a solution.</p>
<p>So I checked the actual <code>USER32!GetDC</code> again, and this time I actually paid attention to the disassembly code instead of glossing over it. What the fuck? <code>pacibsp</code> is missing at the start. It’s loading an address for a jump that only jumps to <em>the next instruction</em>, which is <em>invalid</em>. In some runs, said instruction was instead a broken <code>x26</code>-relative <code>str</code> instruction that AV’d because the register was all zeroes.</p>
<p>At this point let’s introduce the villain. You might have noticed it in the call stack: <code>DXGI!My_GetDC</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="https://slugcat.systems/post/25-09-21-dxgi-debugging-microsoft-put-me-on-a-list/windbg_disasm_2.webp" alt="WinDbg disassembly for DXGI!MyDC. The word &amp;quot;Detour&amp;quot; is clearly visible"><figcaption>

</figure>

<p>For those who aren’t well-versed in DirectX stuff: <em>DXGI</em> is a fundamental part of DirectX ever since DirectX 10 (Vista). For those who have never modded a game before: a <em>detour</em> is a hack that injects instructions into other functions at runtime, to do evil shit. Why the <em>hell</em> is Microsoft using this in DXGI?</p>
<h2 id="debugging-dxgi-despair">
	<a href="#debugging-dxgi-despair">
		Debugging: DXGI despair
	</a>
</h2><p>Through the debugging adventure, I ended up putting a breakpoint on every call to <code>USER32!GetDC</code>. The first few calls are fine, but then the <em>last</em> one, the one that crashes, is not.</p>
<p>At this point I got really desperate. “Asking in low-level programming Discords”-level desperate. I ended up asking for help in the <a href="https://discord.gg/directx">DirectX Discord</a> (yes, there’s an official DirectX Discord, and there’s many MS employees in there).</p>
<section aria-label="Thought" aria-role="Thought">
<p>I would like to thank Jesse Natalia from the DirectX Discord for responding swiftly to my messages in there.</p>
</section>
<p>After some back and forth there, I wanted to catch DXGI in the act. Maybe that would tell me something, I don’t know. So with a simple <code>ba w4 USER32!GetDC</code>, I put a hardware breakpoint for whenever something would <em>write</em> to <code>USER32!GetDC</code>. I did have to awkwardly “run the program for just a little bit” because <code>USER32.dll</code> isn’t loaded immediately at program startup.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<section aria-label="Thought" aria-role="Thought">
<p>While writing this blog post I realized there <em>is</em> an intelligent way to do this. It’s called <code>sxe ld USER32.dll</code>. I’ve literally written about it <a href="https://slugcat.systems/post/25-03-18-virtual-reality-projection-shenanigans/"><em>in this blog before</em></a>. Oops.</p>

</p>
<p>Now this is very interesting. The bottom of the stack trace is quite expected: SDL creates a window, uses ANGLE’s EGL implementation for this, that does a bunch of stuff, and eventually creates a DXGI swapchain. But then what is <code>UpgradeSwapEffect</code>? And why is it installing a detour?</p>
<p>Ah, I already know what this is.</p>

Been out of the DXGI code for too long” “is this related to whatever the thing in windows 11 is that forces flip model on software (ANGLE […] create flip model swap chains when using its own swap chain management)” “Yes”">

</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-windowed-games-flip-model">
	<a href="#optimizing-windowed-games-flip-model">
		Optimizing windowed games: flip model
	</a>
</h2><p>Right. So. DirectX.</p>
<p>When you create a DirectX swapchain, you specify an “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/dxgi/ne-dxgi-dxgi_swap_effect">effect</a>”, which falls into two categories: “bitblt” and “flip”. To make a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/for-best-performance--use-dxgi-flip-model#a-brief-history">long story short</a>: bitblt is the “original” one, while flip is the much more modern one added in Windows 8<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. It’s more efficient and performant, and all software should be using it. Furthermore, on modern versions of Windows and with a GPU supporting “<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/multiplane-overlay-support">Multiplane Overlays</a>”, flip model actually enables windowed games to be displayed with <em>zero additional latency</em> over “exclusive” fullscreen mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, many games never get updated, or they’re stuck on an ancient version. And many of these games don’t care. So in Windows 11, Microsoft added “<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/optimizations-for-windowed-games-in-windows-11-3f006843-2c7e-4ed0-9a5e-f9389e535952">Optimizations for windowed games</a>”, which forcibly enables flip model on games that are still using bitblt. Why does DXGI need to install detours for this? Probably some compatibility shit with the bitblt model. I don’t have any deep knowledge of how Win32 GDI stuff works, but it’s not hard for me to imagine there’s some interplay here they need to take care of. I can also confirm that <em>disabling</em> the feature in Windows’ settings menu fixes the crash!</p>
<p>If you’re wondering why SS14 isn’t using flip model: it’s because we can’t. We’re not creating the swapchain directly, <em>ANGLE</em> is. And ANGLE is continuing to use <code>SWAP_EFFECT_SEQUENTIAL</code>. I actually once <a href="https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox/blob/ac3cb4dc2abe970e611b944b252504e602303dfe/Robust.Client/Graphics/Clyde/GLContext/GLContextAngle.cs">experimented with SS14 managing the swapchain</a>, but this ran into some ANGLE limitations and I never got around to ironing out all the edge cases and crashes. I’d rather just spend the brain power on ditching OpenGL, rather than trying to continue working with this broken API.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So here we are. The entire debugging story so far, you’re like, “surely Microsoft didn’t break DXGI on ARM64, huh???” But now it’s becoming plausible. There’s barely any native ARM64 Windows games, and surely none that are using bitblt swapchains. And guess what, you don’t even <em>need</em> <code>GetDC()</code> for modern DirectX games. SDL does it because it’s heavily designed for OpenGL. Most games run in x64 emulation, and that presumably works fine. Everything adds up to it being possible this just genuinely fell under the radar at Microsoft.</p>
<p>This should be pretty easy to verify in a minimal example. I cloned an <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-SDK-Samples/blob/main/C%2B%2B/Direct3D11/Tutorials/Tutorial01/Tutorial01.cpp">old DirectX SDK sample</a>, updated it to be compiled for ARM64, added some <code>GetDC()</code> calls, aaand… nope, no crash. Then I spent quite a while <em>trying various stuff</em>: comparing the swapchain creation code with that of ANGLE, changing various parameters, verifying whether the detour was being installed (it wasn’t). But eventually, I did find it.</p>
<p>It’s the filename.</p>
<p>Of course it’s the goddamn filename.</p>
<h2 id="im-on-a-list">
	<a href="#im-on-a-list">
		I’m on a list
	</a>
</h2><p><strong>It only happens when the program is called <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>.</strong></p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle. It didn’t happen in a dev environment because then the exe isn’t named <code>SS14.Loader.exe</code>. Microsoft only enables “Optimizations for windowed games” on a specific list of games. And guess what, <em>none</em> of those select games are on ARM64, at least until I was unfortunate enough to port mine. How did we get on the list? Who knows.</p>
<p>Microsoft put me on a list, that ships with every Windows install. And this list actually broke my game. Achievement unlocked!</p>

	<a href="#addendum-why-angle-and-about-opengl-on-windows-arm64">
		Addendum: why ANGLE, and about OpenGL on Windows ARM64
	</a>
</h2><p>Traditionally, OpenGL on Windows has been implemented by the 3 IHVs (Nvidia, AMD, Intel). If they didn’t explicitly go out of their way to add it to their drivers, you’d have no OpenGL beyond 1.0. Those new Snapdragon X devices, however, use Microsoft’s new-ish “OpenGL on D3D12” driver. It’s actually part of Mesa!</p>
<p>The problem with Space Station 14 is that said driver is broken for us, causing severe graphical artifacts and flickering. I had been aware of this for years, because the same driver is used for the GPU acceleration of WSL2, but I never bothered to report it 😬. So for the purpose of porting SS14 to ARM64 Windows, I decided to just immediately force on ANGLE on Qualcomm devices, and call it a day.</p>
<p>What I didn’t know until yesterday is that the OpenGL on D3D12 driver does not ship with Qualcomm’s drivers! <a href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqpsl29bfff?hl=en-US&amp;gl=US">It’s on the Microsoft store!</a> I can even install it in my VM and get it to emulate OpenGL on top of DirectX’s software renderer (WARP), just like I had been doing with ANGLE. I’ve finally bothered to <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa/-/issues/13936">report the graphical issues</a>, so hopefully it gets fixed eventually. If it does get fixed, Microsoft Store distribution means it shouldn’t take too long to trickle down to users, and then we can stop enforcing ANGLE on Qualcomm devices.</p>
<p>For Space Station 14, I will say that this means I’ll be postponing official Windows ARM64 support <em>for now</em>. At least until either bug (OpenGL on D3D12 <em>or</em> ARM64 DXGI detours) are fixed. Or when I finally rewrite the renderer to drop OpenGL, that’s also an option.</p>
<h2 id="addendum-clarifications">

</h2><p>(This bit added a few hours after publishing)</p>
<ul>
<li>“Why not just rename the <code>.exe</code> on ARM”: what I didn’t mention is that Steamworks does not support ARM64 Linux or Windows, at the moment. That means ARM64 builds will not be on Steam regardless, and I didn’t feel like going through even more the effort to add <em>a</em> workaround, just to improve performance for that 0.001% of people playing the game on a Snapdragon X device <em>while also downloading from our website</em>. And God forbid Microsoft updates the list later based on a bulk import of some random filenames and catches the new name too. The game already works when emulated, so I’m leaving it there until Windows is fixed.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p id="first">Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have developed a new, easily manufacturable solid-state thermoelectric refrigeration technology with nano-engineered materials that is twice as efficient as devices made with commercially available bulk thermoelectric materials. As global demand grows for more energy-efficient, reliable and compact cooling solutions, this advancement offers a scalable alternative to traditional compressor-based refrigeration.</p><div id="text">
<p>In a paper published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, a team of researchers from APL and refrigeration engineers from Samsung Research demonstrated improved heat-pumping efficiency and capacity in refrigeration systems attributable to high-performance nano-engineered thermoelectric materials invented at APL known as controlled hierarchically engineered superlattice structures (CHESS).</p>
<p>The CHESS technology is the result of 10 years of APL research in advanced nano-engineered thermoelectric materials and applications development. Initially developed for national security applications, the material has also been used for noninvasive cooling therapies for prosthetics and won an R&amp;D 100 award in 2023.</p>
<p>"This real-world demonstration of refrigeration using new thermoelectric materials showcases the capabilities of nano-engineered CHESS thin films," said Rama Venkatasubramanian, principal investigator of the joint project and chief technologist for thermoelectrics at APL. "It marks a significant leap in cooling technology and sets the stage for translating advances in thermoelectric materials into practical, large-scale, energy-efficient refrigeration applications."</p>
<p><strong>A New Benchmark for Solid-State Cooling</strong></p>
<p>The push for more efficient and compact cooling technologies is fueled by a variety of factors, including population growth, urbanization and an increasing reliance on advanced electronics and data infrastructure. Conventional cooling systems, while effective, are often bulky, energy intensive and reliant on chemical refrigerants that can be harmful to the environment.</p>
<p>Thermoelectric refrigeration is widely regarded as a potential solution. This method cools by using electrons to move heat through specialized semiconductor materials, eliminating the need for moving parts or harmful chemicals, making these next-generation refrigerators quiet, compact, reliable and sustainable. Bulk thermoelectric materials are used in small devices like mini-fridges, but their limited efficiency, low heat-pumping capacity and incompatibility with scalable semiconductor chip fabrication have historically prevented their wider use in high-performance systems.</p>


<p>In the study, researchers compared refrigeration modules using traditional bulk thermoelectric materials with those using CHESS thin-film materials in standardized refrigeration tests, measuring and comparing the electrical power needed to achieve various cooling levels in the same commercial refrigerator test systems. Samsung Research's Life Solution Team, led by executive vice president Joonhyun Lee, collaborated with APL to validate the results through detailed thermal modeling, quantifying heat loads and thermal resistance parameters to ensure accurate performance evaluation under real-world conditions.</p>
<p>The results were striking: Using CHESS materials, the APL team achieved nearly 100% improvement in efficiency over traditional thermoelectric materials at room temperature (around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 C). They then translated these material-level gains into a near 75% improvement in efficiency at the device level in thermoelectric modules built with CHESS materials and a 70% improvement in efficiency in a fully integrated refrigeration system, each representing a significant improvement over state-of-the-art bulk thermoelectric devices. These tests were completed under conditions that involved significant amounts of heat pumping to replicate practical operation.</p>
<p><strong>Built to Scale</strong></p>
<p>Beyond improving efficiency, the CHESS thin-film technology uses remarkably less material -- just 0.003 cubic centimeters, or about the size of a grain of sand, per refrigeration unit. This reduction in material means APL's thermoelectric materials could be mass-produced using semiconductor chip production tools, driving cost efficiency and enabling widespread market adoption.</p>
<p>"This thin-film technology has the potential to grow from powering small-scale refrigeration systems to supporting large building HVAC applications, similar to the way that lithium-ion batteries have been scaled to power devices as small as mobile phones and as large as electric vehicles," Venkatasubramanian said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the CHESS materials were created using a well-established process commonly used to manufacture high-efficiency solar cells that power satellites and commercial LED lights.</p>


<p>"We used metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) to produce the CHESS materials, a method well known for its scalability, cost-effectiveness and ability to support large-volume manufacturing," said Jon Pierce, a senior research engineer who leads the MOCVD growth capability at APL. "MOCVD is already widely used commercially, making it ideal for scaling up CHESS thin-film thermoelectric materials production."</p>
<p>These materials and devices continue to show promise for a broad range of energy harvesting and electronics applications in addition to the recent advances in refrigeration. APL plans to continue to partner with organizations to refine the CHESS thermoelectric materials with a focus on boosting efficiency to approach that of conventional mechanical systems. Future efforts include demonstrating larger-scale refrigeration systems, including freezers, and integrating artificial intelligence-driven methods to optimize energy efficiency in compartmentalized or distributed cooling in refrigeration and HVAC equipment.</p>
<p>"Beyond refrigeration, CHESS materials are also able to convert temperature differences, like body heat, into usable power," said Jeff Maranchi, Exploration Program Area manager in APL's Research and Exploratory Development Mission Area. "In addition to advancing next-generation tactile systems, prosthetics and human-machine interfaces, this opens the door to scalable energy-harvesting technologies for applications ranging from computers to spacecraft -- capabilities that weren't feasible with older bulkier thermoelectric devices."</p>
<p>"The success of this collaborative effort demonstrates that high-efficiency solid-state refrigeration is not only scientifically viable but manufacturable at scale," said Susan Ehrlich, an APL technology commercialization manager. "We're looking forward to continued research and technology transfer opportunities with companies as we work toward translating these innovations into practical, real-world applications."</p>

<p>While <code>uuidv7()</code> is not the most exciting feature (that would be async I/O), it's probably the most awaited one. It was close to being added in 17, and many users have been a bit disappointed that it didn't make the cut. I'm so excited about it, that I decided to take the beta for a spin and write a blog post about it.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-uuid-and-why-are-they-useful">What is a UUID and why are they useful?</h2>
<p>UUIDs are 128-bit values used as identifiers for various items - anything from transactions to companies. They are designed to be unique across space and time and can be generated
efficiently at high rates without depending on centralized services.</p>
<p>Traditionally, relational databases used auto-incrementing types (like <code>SERIAL</code> or <code>identity</code>) to generate unique identifiers. This can be done efficiently on a single machine (although there are drawbacks even in this case), but once you need to scale out, you need a way to generate identifiers that are unique across all nodes. Instagram team wrote a <a href="https://instagram-engineering.com/sharding-ids-at-instagram-1cf5a71e5a5c">short blog</a> about their migration to UUIDs as they sharded their Postgres database.</p>
<p>UUIDs are useful as primary keys in databases in several common scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Generating unique IDs in a distributed database</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->While many distributed databases can support auto-increment (identity) columns, they have limitations and performance issues.</li>
<li><strong>Unguessable public identifiers</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->Properly generated, UUIDs can't be guessed, predicted or used to infer information about the system. If you use auto-increment as a customer identifier, for instance, attackers can scan all existing identifiers and attempt to use them, they can guess the next identifier and estimate how many customers you have.</li>
<li><strong>Allowing clients to generate identifiers</strong>:<br>
<!-- -->Using UUIDs allows clients to generate identifiers that they can use without coordinating with the server. This is useful in mobile apps and serverless environments where you want to minimize communication to the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result of these benefits, UUIDs are used as primary keys in many databases. However, there are also 3 concerns with the use of UUIDs in databases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sorting</strong>: UUIDs are not meaningfully sortable by value.</li>
<li><strong>Index locality</strong>: New UUIDs are not close to each other in the index, this means that inserts will be performed at random locations. This can cause index bloat and other performance issues, as you can see in the charts in <a href="https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/sequential-uuid-generators">this blog post</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Size</strong>: UUIDs are 128-bit values. Most developers default to using <code>INT</code> (32-bit) or <code>BIGINT</code> (64-bit) for their primary keys. For tables with large number of very small records, this can be meaningful overhead.</li>
</ul>
<p>As I'll explain in the next section, UUIDv7 addresses 2 out of these 3 concerns.</p>
<p>The size of the UUID may be a problem when disk space or network bandwidth is limited, but it is worth noting that modern CPUs can compare 128-bit values in a single instruction (<code>CMEQ</code>, part of SIMD instructions), so database operations on UUIDs are highly optimized. The key here is to make sure you use binary representation of UUIDs (proper UUID type) in both the database and the application, and not the string representation.</p>
<h2 id="why-uuidv7">Why UUIDv7?</h2>
<p>UUIDs were first standardized in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">RFC 4122</a> in 2005. This RFC defines 5 variants of UUIDs, of which variant 1 and 4 are the most common.
The specification was later revised to add variants 6-8 in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc9562">RFC 9562</a> which was published in May 2024
(although the first public working draft was published in 2020). Happy Birthday RFC 9562 and UUIDv7!</p>
<p>To motivate the specification update, RFC 9562 discusses the common use case of using UUIDs as primary keys in databases:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One area in which UUIDs have gained popularity is database keys ... but UUID versions 1-5, which were originally defined by [RFC4122], lack certain other desirable characteristics, such as:</p>
<p>UUID versions that are not time ordered, such as UUIDv4 (described in Section 5.4), have poor database-index locality. This means that new values created in succession are not close to each other in the index; thus, they require inserts to be performed at random locations. The resulting negative performance effects on the common structures used for this (B-tree and its variants) can be dramatic.</p>
<p>many widely distributed database applications and large application vendors have sought to solve the problem of creating a better time-based, sortable unique identifier for use as a database key. This has led to numerous implementations over the past 10+ years solving the same problem in slightly different ways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The RFC proceeds to specify 16 (!) different implementations of non-standard UUIDs, each with their own trade-offs. This includes the popular <code>ULID</code>, Twitter's <code>Snowflake</code>, Instagram's <code>ShardId</code> and many more.
All of these implementations were evaluated when designing the new specification.</p>
<p>While the new RFC specifies 3 new variants of UUIDs, the only interesting one is <strong>UUIDv7</strong>. UUIDv6 is introduced for backwards compatibility only - the RFC says "Systems that do not involve legacy UUIDv1 SHOULD use UUIDv7 instead".
UUIDv8 provides a format for experimental and vendor-specific extensions.</p>
<p><strong>UUIDv7 solves both the sorting and index locality concerns.</strong> It uses Unix Epoch timestamp as the most significant 48 bits, keeping the other 74 bits for random values (additional bits are used for version and variant).
This makes UUIDs sortable by time sequence and unique. The standard also provides the option to include millisecond timestamp in the UUID and/or carefully seeded counter,
to support ordering within a single second (if needed). As a result, UUIDv7 is a great fit for use as a primary key in databases - it is guaranteed to be unique, sortable and have good index locality.</p>
<h2 id="uuidv7-in-postgresql-18">UUIDv7 in PostgreSQL 18</h2>
<p>Until PostgreSQL 18, UUIDv7 was not natively supported. The built-in <code>gen_random_uuid()</code> function generated UUIDv4, and while the popular <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension added
support for additional UUID variants, it was limited to the variants specified in RFC 4122.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 adds a new function: <code>uuidv7()</code>, which generates UUIDv7 values. The Postgres implementation includes a 12-bit sub-millisecond timestamp fraction immediately after the timestamp (as allowed but not required by the standard). This guarantees monotonicity for all UUIDv7 values generated by the same Postgres session (same backend process).</p>
<p>For consistency, PostgreSQL 18 added <code>uuidv4()</code> as an alias for <code>gen_random_uuid()</code>, to match the naming.</p>
<p>Calling <code>uuidv7()</code> will generate a new UUIDv7 value where the timestamp is the current time. If you need to generate a UUIDv7 value for a different time, you can pass an optional <code>interval</code> to the function.</p>
<p>Postgres' existing functions for extracting timestamp and version from a UUID are also updated to support UUIDv7. Here is an example of how to use the new functions:</p>
<div><pre><code>postgres<span>=</span># <span>select</span> uuidv7();
                uuidv7
<span>--------------------------------------</span>
 <span>0196</span>ea4a<span>-6</span>f32<span>-7</span>fd0<span>-</span>a9d9<span>-9</span>c815a0750cd
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

postgres<span>=</span># <span>select</span> uuidv7(<span>INTERVAL</span> <span>'1 day'</span>);
                uuidv7
<span>--------------------------------------</span>
 <span>0196</span>ef74<span>-8</span>d09<span>-77</span>b0<span>-</span>a84b<span>-5301262</span>f05ad
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

postgres<span>=</span># <span>SELECT</span> uuid_extract_version(uuidv4());
 uuid_extract_version
<span>----------------------</span>
                    <span>4</span>

postgres<span>=</span># <span>SELECT</span> uuid_extract_version(uuidv7());
 uuid_extract_version
<span>----------------------</span>
                    <span>7</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

postgres<span>=</span># <span>SELECT</span> uuid_extract_timestamp(uuidv7());
   uuid_extract_timestamp
<span>----------------------------</span>
 <span>2025</span><span>-05</span><span>-19</span> <span>20</span>:<span>50</span>:<span>40.381</span><span>+</span><span>00</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

postgres<span>=</span># <span>SELECT</span> uuid_extract_timestamp(uuidv7(<span>INTERVAL</span> <span>'1 hour'</span>));
   uuid_extract_timestamp
<span>----------------------------</span>
 <span>2025</span><span>-05</span><span>-19</span> <span>21</span>:<span>50</span>:<span>59.388</span><span>+</span><span>00</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

postgres<span>=</span># <span>SELECT</span> uuid_extract_timestamp(uuidv7(<span>INTERVAL</span> <span>'-1 day'</span>));
   uuid_extract_timestamp
<span>----------------------------</span>
 <span>2025</span><span>-05</span><span>-18</span> <span>20</span>:<span>51</span>:<span>15.774</span><span>+</span><span>00</span>
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using <code>uuidv7()</code> as the primary key in a table is straightforward, and together with the ability to extract the timestamp, it makes it easy to use the UUID as a sortable key and even inspect the creation time of the record:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>CREATE TABLE</span> test (
    id uuid <span>DEFAULT</span> uuidv7() <span>PRIMARY KEY</span>,
    name text
);

<span>INSERT INTO</span> test (name) <span>VALUES</span> (<span>'foo'</span>);
<span>INSERT INTO</span> test (name) <span>VALUES</span> (<span>'bar'</span>);
<span>-- this will be sorted to the beginning of the list since we are making it 1h older than the other two</span>
<span>INSERT INTO</span> test (id, name) <span>VALUES</span> (uuidv7(<span>INTERVAL</span> <span>'-1 hour'</span>), <span>'oldest'</span>);

<span>SELECT</span> uuid_extract_timestamp(id), name <span>FROM</span> test <span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id;

   uuid_extract_timestamp   <span>|</span>  name
<span>----------------------------+--------</span>
 <span>2025</span><span>-05</span><span>-19</span> <span>19</span>:<span>55</span>:<span>43.87</span><span>+</span><span>00</span>  <span>|</span> oldest
 <span>2025</span><span>-05</span><span>-19</span> <span>20</span>:<span>55</span>:<span>01.304</span><span>+</span><span>00</span> <span>|</span> foo
 <span>2025</span><span>-05</span><span>-19</span> <span>20</span>:<span>55</span>:<span>01.305</span><span>+</span><span>00</span> <span>|</span> bar
(<span>3</span> <span>rows</span>)
</code></pre></div>
<p>All these functions are documented in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/functions-uuid.html">PostgreSQL documentation</a> and if you are interested in the implementation details, you can review the <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=78c5e141e">patch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="try-it-out">Try it out!</h2>
<p>Once PostgreSQL 18 is released, you will be able to use <code>uuidv7()</code> and all the other new functionality by installing it as you normally do.
While the official release is planned for September, <code>Beta 1</code> version is already available and the community encourages users to try it out and report issues.</p>
<p>The installations instructions for the beta versions and nightly snapshots are available <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/snapshots/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 delivers practical improvements that experienced developers will really appreciate. Native support for UUIDv7 is a quiet but impactful addition that addresses long-standing pain points in database design.</p>
<p>UUIDs have always been a tradeoff: secure, guaranteed to be unique, efficient to generate in distributed systems. but with performance drawbacks for use with B-tree indexes. UUIDv7 brings the best of both worlds — globally unique, yet ordered in a way that plays nicely with B-tree indexes and write-heavy workloads. Postgres 18 makes them that much more convenient to use.</p>
<p>If you've ever hesitated to use UUIDs for primary keys, this is your chance to revisit that decision. Try the beta, test it in your schema, and see how it behaves. Whether you're building multi-tenant apps or just want more stable ID generation, UUIDv7 is worth a look.</p>
<p>The best way to shape the future of Postgres is to get involved early — so go ahead, spin up a test instance and let the community know what you find.</p></div></article></div>]]></description>

 <p><em>This is a practical plan to bring people together behind a common vision and a series of steps, including the reform of the Palestinian Authority, that takes us from a ceasefire in Gaza to negotiations on a two-state solution. We will keep driving this forward.</em></p>
 <p><em>As part of this effort I set out in July the terms upon which we would act in line with our manifesto to recognise Palestinian statehood. That moment has now arrived.

I was pretty nervous because I wasn’t sure if he was going to think my app was stupid or if it was weird, but he honestly couldn’t have been nicer. </p><p>He’s also an insanely good instructor, which seems obvious, but when you only see someone on IG as an “influencer”, you’re not entirely sure what to expect.</p><p>But his class was f-ing legit. But be warned, it may or may not be 60 minutes long 😂. Most classes I’ve taken are 45 minutes, but if you like to get there early (like I do), he will start the class early and end the class late and have you BURNING. My max HR hit 172, and I was sore for a week. </p><p>It was excellent.</p><p>I also had an entire plan of going home and editing/posting the content from this day, but like I said, I was sore for a week. So, the immediate aftermath of this class was me just lying down on the couch. No content was edited, posted, or thought about for the rest of the day loll.</p><blockquote><p><em>Footnote: Because I’m always looking at people’s wrists for Apple Watches in class now, I couldn’t help but notice the lady next to me. Most people wear a fitness tracker in class or nothing at all. But this lady next to me was rocking this:</em></p></blockquote><p><strong>Cold DMs actually work (sometimes).</strong><span> I sent maybe 30-40 messages total and got 4-5 meaningful responses. That's not amazing, but it's infinitely better than the zero responses you get when you never reach out at all. </span></p><p><strong>Marketing opens doors that code never could.</strong><span> Sebastian seeing my app in person matters more than any feature I could have shipped that week. You can't build your way into someone's awareness - you have to actually show up.</span></p><p><strong>You can't analytics your way to relationships.</strong><span> The numbers didn't move (see chart below), but the connections did. Having Lagreeing at Home and Sebastian Lagree be aware of the app and the person behind the app </span><em>should</em><span> pay dividends in the future.</span></p><p><strong>Content creation is way harder than I thought.</strong><span> As an engineer, I assumed making an Instagram story would take 10 minutes. Turns out creating something that doesn't look like garbage takes a couple of hours. And doing it daily? Forget about it. I planned a whole week of content on Monday and ended up creating everything day-of because I completely underestimated the work involved.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png" width="1456" height="572" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/eaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:572,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;CleanShot 2025-09-07 at 16.19.01@2x.png&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" alt="CleanShot 2025-09-07 at 16.19.01@2x.png" title="CleanShot 2025-09-07 at 16.19.01@2x.png" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QhLC!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feaa503c8-cbf5-436a-85cb-e2e6079b21c9_2830x1112.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div></div></div>]]></description>

		<p>Checking and repairing disks is one of the more important tasks performed by Disk Utility, but ever since the introduction of APFS, it has been more fraught than it should have been. One of its most persistent and pervasive problems has been complete failure because Disk Utility has been unable to unmount volumes or containers. To my shock, in Monterey 12.0.1 this problem appears worse than ever, and I now have one disk which Disk Utility is completely unable to check or repair. This article suggests ways around this, while we wait for Apple to fix this bug.</p>
<p>For much of this period, the First Aid tool in Disk Utility has relied on the command tool <code>fsck_apfs</code> to do the work, calling it using two options, <code>y</code> and <code>x</code>. The <code>y</code> option simply agrees to make all the repairs suggested by the tool, but the <code>x</code> option is private. I suspect that privacy isn’t sinister, merely allowing communication between the tool and app using XPC.</p>
<p>Best practice for performing disk checks and repairs like this isn’t with a live file system, and those options won’t work when the item being checked is still mounted. So to prepare for the call to <code>fsck_apfs</code>, Disk Utility has to unmount the volume or container, and that’s the step which appears to go awry.</p>

<p>In Catalina and Big Sur, the error reported was confusing, and the recommendation to “back up the data on this volume” inappropriate. It would have been far better if Disk Utility had told us honestly that “this is a known bug, and some day we might get round to fixing it.”</p>

<p>That some day clearly hasn’t come in Monterey 12.0.1. When I was researching <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/2021/11/18/how-should-you-check-an-apfs-backup-store/">yesterday’s article</a> about how to check Time Machine backup volumes, it hit me again and again, so I went back and had a closer look at what now goes wrong, and what to do about it.</p>

<p>This may happen persistently when you try to check and repair an APFS volume.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="62339" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/diskutil11/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg" data-orig-size="952,583" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="diskutil11" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg?w=940" loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg?w=940" alt="diskutil11" srcset="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg 952w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg?w=150&amp;h=92 150w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg?w=300&amp;h=184 300w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil11.jpg?w=768&amp;h=470 768w" sizes="(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px"></span></p>
<p>It can also happen every time with an APFS container.</p>
<p><span><img data-attachment-id="62340" data-permalink="https://eclecticlight.co/diskutil12/" data-orig-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg" data-orig-size="949,875" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="diskutil12" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg?w=940" loading="lazy" src="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg?w=940" alt="diskutil12" srcset="https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg 949w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg?w=150&amp;h=138 150w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg?w=300&amp;h=277 300w, https://eclecticlight.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/diskutil12.jpg?w=768&amp;h=708 768w" sizes="(max-width: 949px) 100vw, 949px"></span></p>
<p>Oddly, though, it doesn’t seem to affect HFS+ volumes.</p>
<p>One way around this is to cave in, start up in Recovery, and use Disk Utility there, where there’s no excuse for problems unmounting anything. If you’re intending to check and repair the boot volume group (System and/or Data) then this is the preferred way. macOS does now provide a good means of ‘freezing’ file system access if you do try that when running in normal user mode, but Recovery is always better.</p>
<p>The best news of all is that you can still use the command tool <code>fsck_apfs</code> directly, and work around this bug in Disk Utility. The bizarre twist is that you can use Disk Utility’s <strong>Unmount</strong> tool to unmount volumes and containers which the app itself appears unable to unmount successfully. Here’s a summary of the process:</p>
<ol>
<li>In Disk Utility (or Terminal) obtain the device name of the APFS container or volume you want to check. In this case, I’ll use <code>disk7s2</code>, which is the sort of volume name you’re looking for, or <code>disk7</code> for a container.</li>
<li>In Disk Utility (or Terminal) unmount the container or volume, by selecting it and clicking on the <strong>Unmount</strong> tool. When you’re checking a container, it’s best to unmount each of its volumes before unmounting the container itself.</li>
<li>Open Terminal and type the chosen command with the correct device name. Then enter your admin user’s password at the prompt.</li>
<li>Watch as the volume or container is checked.</li>
<li>Once that has completed, consider whether the container or volume needs any repair using <code>fsck_apfs</code>.</li>
<li>In Disk Utility (or Terminal) mount the container or volume again, by selecting it and clicking on the <strong>Mount</strong> tool.</li>
</ol>
<p>The command to use depends on whether you just want to check the item, or repair it as well. For the former, use the <code>-n</code> option, and for the latter the <code>-y</code> option will perform all repairs automatically. I advise you to include all snapshots, which are important, but if you want to exclude them all, use the <code>-S</code> option.</p>
<p>If the volume is encrypted, you could keep it mounted and use the <code>-l</code> option to check the live file system, or you can use a command like<br>
<code>diskutil apfs unlockVolume /dev/disk7s2 -nomount</code><br>
to unlock the volume without mounting it (thanks to kapitainsky for suggesting that).</p>
<p>For example, choose between the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>sudo fsck_apfs -n /dev/disk7s2</code> just to check the volume disk7s2 but not repair it, and include snapshots.</li>
<li><code>sudo fsck_apfs -y /dev/disk7s2</code> to check and repair all errors automatically, and include snapshots.</li>
<li><code>sudo fsck_apfs -n -S /dev/disk7s2</code> to check but not repair, but excluding all snapshots.</li>
<li><code>sudo fsck_apfs -n -S /dev/disk7</code> to check but not repair the container disk7, excluding all snapshots.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find details of all available options in <code>man fsck_apfs</code>.</p>
<p><a href="https://support.apple.com/HT210898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple recommends</a> that you first check and repair volumes within a container, then the container itself, and finally the disk (which you can do completely within Disk Utility). That is oddly the exact opposite order previously recommended by many, and duplicates checks on volumes which are normally repeated when you check their container.</p>
<p>The disk which I have such problems with is a little unusual in that it’s partitioned into two: a small HFS+ volume, and a much larger APFS container. The irony is that Disk Utility’s advice to back up the affect volume is being offered for my Time Machine backup, which is not only a backup volume itself, but can’t be backed up because its backup snapshots can’t be copied to another disk.</p>
<p>It will be so good when Apple finally sorts these problems we’ve suffered for the last four years.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Like many backpackers, I’m a sicko. I have weighed all my gear in order to <a href="https://lighterpack.com/r/fxgj10">maintain a spreadsheet</a> for pack weight on every trip I’m on. I’ve spent more money than I care to think about in order to drop pounds, or even ounces. This is why I’m the proud new owner of a power bank that looks like a toy.</p><p>It’s the Haribo-licensed gummy bear power bank. It’s the lightest-ever 20,000mAH power bank, it’s got a gummy-bear themed built-in USB-C cord, and it’s taking over the ultralight backpacking world. The specs say it weighs 9.9 ounces — and in a world where ounces count, that’s a big deal.</p><p>Ultralight culture seems a little nuts to the uninitiated. Probably most people do not measure every piece of equipment they carry for weekend backpacking trips. But when you are hiking more than 10 miles a day, especially if you are walking up mountains, you start looking for stuff to get rid of — because even being two pounds lighter is a tremendous relief. The “ideal” baseweight for ultralighters is below 10 pounds, though below 20 is considered respectable. If you’re hiking more than 100 miles, every ounce counts.</p><p>The ultralight movement is why a lot of backpackers wear trail runners instead of hiking boots, and why a lot of tents now incorporate hiking poles so users don’t have to carry separate poles for freestanding tents. Since 1991, when Ray Jardin published <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pacific-Crest-Trail-Hikers-Handbook/dp/0963235923/ref=asc_df_0963235923/?tag=camdenxodl-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=692875362841&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=1843784315089371347&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9033325&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435177658&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=8c9c91402a4e33108cfde1584dc0263f&amp;hvocijid=1843784315089371347-0963235923-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;gad_source=1&amp;asc_source=browser&amp;asc_refurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorlife.com%2Fadventure%2Ftraditional-vs-ultralight-backpacking%2F&amp;ascsubtag=0000OL0000302588O1110064520250918171810&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>The PCT Hikers Handbook</em></a>, lots of new companies specializing in the lightest possible equipment have sprung up — as have online communities like r/ultralight. In these communities, there’s a ritual called the “shakedown,” where users post their packs and other people tell them how to cut weight.</p><p>So of course this community was first to the exciting new world of gummy bear charging.</p><p>The previous preferred 20k powerbank was a Nitecore build. It’s a serious-looking black box built out of carbon fiber; <a href="http://amazon.com/Nitecore-NB20000-20000mAh-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0DBGZPSCX/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">it costs about $100</a> and tips the scale at 10.3 ounces. My goofy toy <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DCHK-20000mAh-Charging-Portable-Motorola/dp/B0DPWVYMN5?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">power bank costs $23</a>; it weighed slightly more than the promised specs at 9.95 ounces. It has pass-through charging, just like the Nitecore and allows for fast charging, too. This is like discovering a Volkswagen Beetle can out-haul a Tesla Cybertruck.</p><div><p><a href="https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/IMG_5365.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=1.5307820299501,0,96.9384359401,100" data-pswp-height="2913" data-pswp-width="2330.4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="A Haribo power bank is weighed on a kitchen scale.

That was how I discovered there’s a whole Haribo line — <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Adjustable-Multi-Device-Pairing/dp/B0DPWV2X2P?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">a mouse</a>, <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Charging-Adapter-Earbuds-Motorola/dp/B0DPWVMPRY?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">a wall charger</a>, <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Earbuds-Bluetooth-Reduction-Charging/dp/B0DPWWCSHY?ref_=ast_sto_dp&amp;th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">earbuds,</a> <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/8BF588B1-B761-4C2F-9056-F570529B5A59?ingress=2&amp;lp_context_asin=B0DPWV2X2P&amp;visitId=ff7dd178-8d9b-4a12-bd17-e52d914dc427&amp;store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto&amp;ref_=ast_bln&amp;tag=theverge02-20">charging cables</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPWX8132/ref=emc_bcc_2_i?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">a wireless powerbank.</a> It appears to be a brand collab <a href="https://www.makuake.com/project/haribo_dcglobal/">that was crowdfunded in Japan</a>.</p></div><p>Unfortunately the power bank won’t charge through the built-in gummy bear cable, so you’ll have to carry a USB-C cable to get juice on a resupply stop. But still, from the people who brought you “<a href="https://andrewskurka.com/cold-and-wet-standouts-appalachians/">bread bags on your feet to stay dry when it’s raining</a>,” there’s a new ridiculous outdoor device winning hearts and minds. I haven’t done capacity testing yet, but if it does what the specs promise, the most hard-core battery pack an ultralighter can buy is decorated with gummy bears.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/781387/backpacking-ultralight-haribo-power-bank#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODA0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Elizabeth Lopatto</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

It also contained allegations of sexual harassment denied by the company. It states she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour”.</p><p>However, the former diplomat was barred from publicising the memoir after Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, secured a ruling preventing her from doing so. She subsequently appeared before a US Senate judiciary subcommittee, in which she said Meta worked “hand in glove” with Beijing over censorship tools – something the company has denied.</p><p>Pan Macmillan, which published the memoir, said it had sold more than 150,000 copies across all formats. The book was also named in The Sunday Times‘ bestselling hardbacks of 2025 so far. The paperback edition is due to be published early next year.</p><p>New York magazine has previously reported that Wynn-Williams was paid an advance for the book of more than $500,000 (£370,000).</p><p>Haigh highlighted Wynn-Williams’s case in the House of Commons during a debate about employment rights on Monday. She said Wynn-Williams’s decision to speak out had plunged her into financial peril.</p><p>“Despite previous public statements that Meta no longer uses NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] in cases of sexual harassment – which Sarah has repeatedly alleged – she is being pushed to financial ruin through the arbitration system in the UK, as Meta seeks to silence and punish her for speaking out,” she said.</p><p>“Meta has served a gagging order on Sarah and is attempting to fine her $50,000 for every breach of that order. She is on the verge of bankruptcy. I am sure that the whole house and the government will stand with Sarah as we pass this legislation to ensure that whistleblowers and those with the moral courage to speak out are always protected.”</p><p>It is understood that the $50,000 figure represents the damages Wynn-Williams has to pay for material breaches of the separation agreement she signed when she left Meta in 2017. Meta has emphasised that Wynn-Williams entered into the non-disparagement agreement voluntarily as part of her departure.</p><p>Meta said that to date, Wynn-Williams had not been forced to make any payments under the agreement.</p><p>The company did not wish to comment on Haigh’s intervention. It has previously said that Wynn-Williams’s Senate testimony was “divorced from reality and riddled with false claims” about China and the company’s treatment of teenagers.</p><p>Meta has described the book as a “mix of out-of-date and previously reported claims about the company and false accusations about our executives”. It has said she was fired for “poor performance and toxic behaviour” and that an investigation concluded she made misleading and unfounded allegations of harassment.</p><p>It said the ruling preventing her from publicising the memoir confirmed the “false and defamatory book should never have been published”.</p><p>The ruling stated Wynn-Williams should stop promoting the book and, to the extent she could, stop further publication. It did not order any action by Pan Macmillan.</p><p>Wynn-Williams has not spoken in public since appearing at the Senate hearing in April. In a written statement this month, she said she was grateful that the US Senate was continuing to investigate Meta’s behaviour.</p><p>“I wish I could say more,” she said. “I urge other tech employees and those who are thinking of whistleblowing to share what they know before more children are harmed.”</p><p>Her lawyer confirmed Wynn-Williams “remains silenced about the very matters Congress is investigating, despite clear and unanimous voices from Congress calling on Meta to end their arbitration proceedings which threaten to bankrupt her”.</p></div></div>]]></description>
