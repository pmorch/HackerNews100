To date, Google has processed more than seven billion copyright takedown requests for its search engine. The majority of the reported links are purged from Google's search index, as required by the DMCA. Recently, however, Google appears to gone a step further, using search takedowns to "moderate" users' privately saved links collections,
</p>
</div><div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg" alt="googlesaved" width="300" height="110" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg 322w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo-300x110.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20300%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg 322w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo-300x110.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/googlesavedlogo.jpg">For many people, Google is the go-to starting point when they need to find something on the web. With just a few keystrokes, the search engine can find virtually anything.</p>
<p>The company also has many other tools to browse and organize the web, including the Chrome browser and YouTube. </p>
<p>All these products and services fall under the umbrella of the company Alphabet. While the various departments are largely run separately, there is plenty of overlap too. This week, we stumbled upon information suggesting that DMCA notices, received for the search engine, directly impact people’s privately saved links. </p>
<p>As reported earlier this month, Google’s search index is a prime target for copyright holders. Over the past several years, more than <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/google-search-asked-to-remove-one-billion-pirate-links-in-9-months-230807/">seven billion ‘infringing’ URLs</a> have been flagged, with the majority removed. This makes sense, as Google is legally required to process DMCA takedown requests. </p>
<p>What comes as a surprise, however, is that the search takedown requests also impact other Google services. </p>
<h2>Search Takedowns Affect Saved URLs</h2>
<p>A few hours ago, Eddie Roosenmaallen <a href="https://strangeobject.space/@silvermoon82/110969122337810598">shared an email</a> from Google, notifying him that a link had been removed from his Google Saved collection because it violates Google’s policy. </p>
<p>The reason cited for the removal is the “downstream impact”, as the URL in question is “blocked by Google Search”.</p>
<p>“The following saved item in one of your collections was determined to violate Google’s policy. As a result, the item will be moderated..,” Google writes, pointing out a defunct KickassTorrents domain as the problem.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="566" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg 1120w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google-300x283.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20566'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg 1120w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google-300x283.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/saved-google.jpg"></center>
<p>Initially, it was suggested that this removal impacted Google’s synched Chrome bookmarks but further research reveals that’s not the case. Instead, the removals apply to Google’s <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/13128452?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">saved</a> feature. </p>
<p>This Google service allows users to <a href="https://www.google.com/save?authuser=0">save and organize</a> links, similar to what Pinterest does. These link collections can be private or shared with third parties. </p>
<h2>Bookmarks?</h2>
<p>The initial bookmark confusion is likely caused by the fact that, in Google’s app, the saved icon (shown below) appears by default. When clicked, the page in question is added to a “favorite pages” collection, which some people see as a bookmark. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg" alt="google saved" width="400" height="265" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg 750w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved-300x198.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20400%20265'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg 750w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved-300x198.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/google-saved.jpg"></center>
<p>Confusing terminology aside, what stands out here is that Google’s search content policy also applies to these saved links. As a result, URLs for which Google receives a search takedown, disappear from saved collections as well. This applies to both public and private collections. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="67" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg 1111w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved-300x33.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg 1111w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved-300x33.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/search-saved.jpg"></center>
<h2>DMCA’d URLS can’t be Saved</h2>
<p>TorrentFreak was able to replicate this issue. Google doesn’t allow us to ‘save’ URLs that are removed from Google search, such as YouTube ripper “Yout.com”, torrent site “1337x.to”, or the earlier mentioned “Katcr.com.”</p>
<p>These blockades apply to single URLs, not entire domains. For example, thepiratebay.org is still visible in Google searches and can be added to a collection. However, Pirate Bay links that are deindexed, <a href="https://thepiratebay.org/search.php?q=top100:48h_201">such as this one</a>, can’t be saved.</p>
<p>The same applies to other sites. The old homepage of YouTube ripper 2conv.com can’t be saved since it’s been removed from Google search, but the latest homepage URL (2conv.com/neshq) can still be added. </p>
<p>It’s not clear why Google enforces the search policy for saved links or whether preventing copyright infringement is the main goal. The company didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment. If we hear back, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>
<p>For now, the impact is relatively limited as the saved feature isn’t widely used. However, if Google decides to “moderate” users’ Chrome bookmarks, or its DNS resolver, things could get interesting. </p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28878/how-is-it-legal-for-a-hospital-to-put-two-patients-together-in-the-same-room-in">https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/28878/how-is-it-legal-for-a-hospital-to-put-two-patients-together-in-the-same-room-in</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37329261">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>As a short answer, <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/faq/197/must-facilities-have-private-or-soundproof-rooms/index.html" rel="noreferrer">guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services</a> has clarified that HIPAA does not require hospitals to provide separate rooms.</p>

<p>As a longer answer, HIPAA is very deeply misunderstood. It does not prohibit "leaking" patient information; it prohibits unreasonable and unpermitted disclosures of protected health information (PHI).</p>

<p>Among the PHI disclosures that are permitted are uses that are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/45/164.506" rel="noreferrer">for the purpose of delivering medical treatment</a>. Of course, the covered entity (in this case, the hospital) is required to take reasonable measures to safeguard that information.</p>

<p>One of the areas that trips people up is figuring out exactly what it is we're safeguarding that information from. A lot people assume that the HIPAA imposes an absolute rule against disclosure of PHI, but it's more accurate to say that HIPAA requires reasonable safeguards against the unauthorized use of PHI.</p>

<p>With that standard in mind, it becomes easier to see why you don't need to universally separate patients. In all likelihood, neither you nor your roommate is likely to use the other's PHI in any way not allowed under HIPAA. We can look at your question as proof: You've disclosed a person's health condition and medical history, but you were a reasonable person and omitted the man's name, birth date, record number, and anything else that might allow us to link that information to an individual.</p>

<p>Hospitals -- and the law -- recognize that most people have no interest in a random strangers' medical information, let alone plans to do something nefarious with it. Because there isn't much of a threat there, the hospital isn't required to take exhaustive measures to protect the information. But when you put all that information for every patient for every doctor for every department for every hospital into a single database, the information starts getting a lot more valuable. That's why there are much tighter regulations surrounding protection of electronic records.</p>

<p>Of course, the roommate situation might be different if the hospital had a patient that they somehow knew had a history of identity theft or even a history of disclosing PHI. I've never heard of this happening, but I'd imagine that that knowledge would require the hospital to either segregate that patient or otherwise take extra care to avoid disclosing any information about a roommate.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure id="VVGXJ2DQIT_0" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption"></figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-1">SCOTTSDALE, Arizona</p>
<p id="paragraph-2">The employee let out a guttural scream as the darts struck his back. Two men lowered his stiffened body to the floor.</p>
<p id="paragraph-3">A crowd of co-workers howled with laughter and cheered as the account executive, still prostrate, managed to praise the weapon that felled him – a Taser electroshock gun manufactured by his company, Axon Enterprise Inc.</p>
<p id="paragraph-4">“Oh, that’s good,” the Axon employee, Ross Blank, heaved into a microphone.</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">Blank later posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ross-blank-8a1a98199_thisisaxon-activity-7023763957232386048-FuC6/" id="article-link-0">a video</a> on his LinkedIn account of the company’s January event, held at a Phoenix resort. “Taking one more for the team is Bad Assery,” long-time executive Steve Tuttle commented on the post. “Love it!”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-7">Axon, a corporation with a market capitalization of $15 billion, has a dominant position in its niche of electroshock weapons and body camera technology for law enforcement. It describes its mission as a noble one: saving lives. Its best-known product is the Taser, the device it developed to temporarily immobilize criminal suspects with darts that deliver electric current, providing police with an alternative to firearms. Axon&nbsp;says that more than 18,000 law enforcement agencies in 107 countries use Tasers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-8">Less well-known is the all-in corporate culture at Axon, which has tested employees’ commitment and fealty in unusual ways – through measures that some embraced wholeheartedly but others felt were extreme and potentially dangerous.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">Shawn Gorman, a lawyer who worked at Axon until 2019, said the company had a high-pressure culture of loyalty, unlike anything he has seen in nearly two decades of practice.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">“It was truly toxic,” he said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-11">The tasing exercise struck several workplace experts consulted by Reuters as an outlandish and unnecessary hazard. It’s “unhealthy at best, dangerous at worst,” said Jennifer Chatman, a professor studying workplace culture at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “This is on the fringe for sure.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-12">In statements to Reuters, Axon disputed that staff tasings are hazardous. The company and its chief executive officer, Rick Smith, said employees are not pressured into anything.</p>
<p id="paragraph-13">“We strongly object to any implication that Axon pressures employees to engage in activities against their will,” said Andrea James, the company’s chief communications officer.</p>

    <blockquote id="UJWR4XEIH7_2">
        <p>“It was truly toxic.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-15">James defended Axon’s culture, describing it as “a collaborative environment of mission-driven individuals who join forces to deliver an extraordinarily profound impact on society.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">Axon said that staff tasings have never drawn formal complaints and are conducted with “the utmost focus on both psychological and physical safety.” Blank said he never felt pressured by Axon. Tuttle did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">Staff tasings, known as “exposures,” are corporate rituals at Axon. Sometimes they involve mid-career employees like Blank, but often they are used to initiate interns or new recruits into Axon’s all-in culture, according to numerous interviews and videos seen by Reuters. <span id="tasetase"><em id="BZQ6CIYI60_4"></em> “Tase, Tase, Tase,” staffers chanted in unison</span>&nbsp;in a March 2019 recording as a target stood in the line of fire.</p>
<p id="paragraph-18">“It looks like a scene from ancient Rome, gladiator-style,” said Valencia Gibson, a former international support manager at Axon. She was one of several former staffers to compare tasings, frequently held in the tiered atrium at Axon’s Scottsdale headquarters, to the Colosseum’s spectacles. Gibson said there was pressure in general for staff to be tased but that she was able to decline due to pregnancy.</p>

    <figure id="JNZEFIF37Q_7" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Axon directed staff attending a January 2022 conference to a foyer where they could obtain company-branded tattoos, a screenshot of a&nbsp;message to employees shows. Markings and timestamp removed by Reuters for source protection</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-20">Besides hosting Taser exposures, company leaders have urged staff to “make things permanent” by getting tattoos of Axon logos on their bodies and to bet part of their pay on a stock plan most advantageous to ensconced, highly placed executives, according to interviews and Axon materials reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-21">Axon’s leaders want to know “who is in for the long haul,” a senior employee told a co-worker considering the stock plan in 2018 text messages that were reviewed by Reuters. The senior employee, who was helping to implement the plan, added that such tests of loyalty are&nbsp;“totally wrong but it is what it is.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-22">For this story, Reuters reviewed approximately 100 Axon records, including PowerPoint presentations, internal announcements, meeting notes and text messages, as well as 24 exposure videos made either by Axon or unofficially by staffers from 2016 through 2023. Some videos portray multiple individuals being tased.</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">Reuters also interviewed 63 current and former Axon employees, including nine former executives. Most people interviewed requested anonymity, saying they feared harm to their careers or had signed non-disclosure agreements at Axon, sometimes to obtain severance pay. Axon employed about 2,800 full-time staff at the end of 2022, according to its latest annual report.</p>
<p id="paragraph-24">Many ex-employees interviewed by Reuters described Axon as a boys’ club that was unwelcoming or even offensive to women. One HR staffer’s 2019 PowerPoint presentation to an executive on inclusion efforts – reviewed by Reuters – specifically criticized Axon’s “‘Bro’ culture” and “lack of diversity in top leadership.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-25">Men historically have dominated the upper ranks, with 129 in management and financial roles compared with 46 women, according to 2020 data Axon submitted in a public procurement.</p>
<p id="paragraph-26">A dozen people told Reuters that leaders sometimes used obscene or sexual terms for women or discriminated against them. Josh Isner, now Axon’s second in command, referred to one of the company’s few female executives as the “Vagina,” according to several people who either heard the slur or were told about it soon afterward, as well as text exchanges alluding to the comments.</p>
<p id="paragraph-27">Axon said Isner made no such remark. Isner said in a statement, “The defamatory language attributed to me by a disgruntled former employee is emotionally motivated and a complete fabrication.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-28">The company has “zero tolerance” for workplace discrimination or harassment and objects to “inflammatory allegations regarding our environment as it relates to women,” James said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">“Axon supports and celebrates a gender-diverse workforce,” she said, adding that 40% of the highest-level executive team is female, and that the company has promoted men and women equally this year.</p>

    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-31">Fifteen people, about half of whom oversaw human-resources and legal work for Axon, said they felt company leaders sidelined those who didn’t show sufficient loyalty or commitment to the all-in credo – by, for instance, declining the stock program or failing to be tased. They said they believed those employees received less desirable assignments, were excluded from business meetings, or, in some cases, were forced from their jobs.</p>
<p id="paragraph-32">Not everyone objected to the company’s distinctive culture. About a third of those interviewed by Reuters said they felt no pressure to undergo exposures or eagerly signed up.</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">James said Reuters glossed over positive employee reviews, while relying on sources that were “not credible.” She pointed to a confidential, company-funded survey from June in which 87% of some 700 U.S.-based staffers rated Axon as “a great place to work.” Claims that employees felt sidelined are “not rooted in fact,” Axon said. Reuters was unable to obtain a copy of the full survey results.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">The apparent light-heartedness and the zaniness of the tasing exercise – described previously in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/08/27/can-the-manufacturer-of-tasers-provide-the-answer-to-police-abuse" id="article-link-1">2018 story in The New Yorker</a> about Axon’s role in the police body-camera business – might suggest that staff exposures at most induce temporary pain or discomfort.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-36">Tasings, however, can be fatal.</p>
<p id="paragraph-37">More than 1,000 people have died in the United States following incidents in which police used Axon’s Tasers,&nbsp;often along with other types of force, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-911" id="article-link-2">a Reuters examination in 2017 found</a>.&nbsp;No one with whom Reuters spoke was aware of deaths or lawsuits stemming from tasings of Axon staff. Over the years, however, Axon has faced over 120 external lawsuits alleging wrongful death&nbsp;after the weapon’s use, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-legal/" id="article-link-3">Reuters reporting</a>.</p>
<p id="paragraph-38">Axon keeps legal settlements confidential. But the company said in February in its annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that no product claim after 2014 has exceeded its $5 million in self-insurance. Axon has faced fewer lawsuits since 2009, the year it introduced a new Taser model with a lower charge. In the wake of a study showing Taser pulses could interfere with the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-science/" id="article-link-4">rhythms of the human heart</a>, the company that year revised its recommendations on where to aim the device. Previously, users were told to aim at the torso; since 2009, Axon has encouraged users to shoot for the back or below the chest.</p>

<p id="paragraph-40">Videos of employee tasings&nbsp;seen by Reuters show that darts were aimed at the back and thigh area under highly controlled conditions, in which subjects wore safety glasses and spotters clutched their arms as they fell to a mat. Even so, workers have fainted, cried, bled or suffered other pain, witnesses or former human-resources staff said.</p>

    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-42">“I saw people cry real bad,” said one long-time employee who has since left the company.</p>
<p id="paragraph-43">Ann Rosenthal, a senior advisor to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) until 2022, said Axon’s tasing of staff&nbsp;could violate a provision of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which mandates that workplaces be free of recognized hazards that are “likely to cause death or serious physical harm.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-44">An OSHA spokesperson said the administration has no ongoing investigations of Axon, nor any findings from completed investigations. It declined further comment on Axon. The main commission overseeing workplace safety in Arizona, where Axon is based, declined to comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-45">The company told Reuters that it objected to any suggestion that its workplace practices “are illegal or dangerous.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-46">In 2022, Axon published <a href="https://www.axon.com/news/technology/truth-about-taser" id="article-link-5">a blog post</a> aimed at “debunking some of the most common myths” about its weapons. There, the company argues that its Tasers are “one of the most studied, safe and effective means of quickly stopping a threat,” causing muscles to flex by employing “the same technology you see in off-the-shelf muscle stimulators used for rehab and muscle therapy.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">Axon itself has issued <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-taser-warning/" id="article-link-6">multiple pages of safety warnings</a> to police about the risks of using the technology. Even in the controlled setting of the Axon workplace, the company requires exposure candidates to sign a waiver, forfeiting their right to sue Axon for any exposure-related injury.</p>

    <figure id="T4SPE8D9VW_12" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Axon requires employees who participate in tasings to sign a liability waiver that repeatedly cites the risk of death.&nbsp;Highlights added by Reuters</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-49">The waiver warns of the potential for death at least 12 times, according to a 2019 copy. Repeated electrical stimuli “can induce seizure in some people, which may result in death or serious injury,” the waiver states.</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">“Certainly this is a hazard, and they’re clearly aware it’s a hazard because they’re warning employees that they could get killed,” said Rosenthal, who until 2018 was the Labor Department’s top lawyer on workplace safety.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">She and two other experts said the pressure workers describe is similar to that experienced by initiates of&nbsp;gangs or some fraternities.</p>
<p id="paragraph-52">“It sounds like a hazing process as much as anything else,” Rosenthal said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-53">Sigma Chi brothers</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">While a rising sophomore at Harvard in the 1980s, Rick Smith, the future Axon CEO, attended a fraternity rush week at a friend’s school.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">“There was something about being in the company of men, and men alone, that enabled us to speak openly and honestly about what was on our minds,” <a href="https://observer.com/2016/05/how-harvard-administrators-went-wrong-on-single-gender-groups/" id="article-link-7"></a><a href="https://observer.com/2016/05/how-harvard-administrators-went-wrong-on-single-gender-groups/" id="article-link-8">he wrote years later</a> in an op-ed for the news site Observer.com.</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">In 1989, Smith wrote, he started a chapter of the Sigma Chi fraternity at Harvard despite the university’s refusal – both then and now – to recognize such single-gender groups on the grounds that they are discriminatory.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">The fraternity fostered what <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/education/2018/03/13/harvard-university-broken/" id="article-link-9">Smith described in Boston Magazine</a> as “lasting friendships.” As of February, three of the company’s eight board members, including Smith, were alumni of Harvard’s Sigma Chi chapter. Since then, three with no Sigma Chi association have been added, bringing the board to 11.</p>
<p id="paragraph-58">Axon President Josh Isner, who is not a board member, also is a former member of the Harvard fraternity.</p>
<p id="paragraph-59">The company said Smith’s articles had no bearing on Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-60">“My comments on the value of private spaces for men and women to adjust to college life is very separate from how I view diversity in the workplace,” Smith said. “I learn from people who are different from me, who bring different life experiences, and I am proud of our investments to build a diverse team.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">Smith said Isner’s fraternity affiliation was not a factor in Isner’s position at the company and described him as “an instrumental leader at Axon for more than a decade.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">Michael Church, Sigma Chi’s executive director, said that “throughout the years Rick Smith has demonstrated a thorough appreciation for the benefits of a fraternal experience.” He directed further questions to Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">From the time Smith co-founded the business with his brother in 1993, he put his body on the line. A recording from that year, posted on the company website, shows Smith standing in an inflatable pool of water and taking a hit from an early Taser. Smith falls down and grunts, with his arms and legs flailing for about 10 seconds.</p>

<p id="paragraph-68">Screenshots&nbsp;from an Axon promotional video show CEO Rick Smith taking a Taser hit&nbsp;in 1993, the year&nbsp;he co-founded the business.</p>
<p id="paragraph-69">Around 1998, U.S. Marine Corps veteran Hans Marrero joined the company, helping to attract law enforcement customers. An old video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xfI6-Pkwbw" id="article-link-10">on YouTube</a>, which Axon replayed for police at an <a href="https://youtu.be/ju42HtqDz50?t=708" id="article-link-11">event this year</a>, billed Marrero as “one of the toughest men alive” and displayed him handily resisting punches and chokeholds.</p>
<p id="paragraph-70">He “can take pain,” a description of the video on YouTube reads, “but can he handle a taser?”</p>
<p id="paragraph-71">After collapsing from the weapon, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xfI6-Pkwbw" id="article-link-12"></a> Marrero says the Taser had a greater effect than a grenade that once hit him: It “knocked me on my ass,” making him “lay there, like a little baby.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-73">Marrero toured the United States in a camper van “demonstrating” the Taser, Smith said in a separate promotional video for Axon. The demos around 1999 marked a turning point in sales to police, Smith <a href="https://vimeo.com/337807714" id="article-link-13">has said</a>, and set up the company to earn $8.4 million from an initial public offering in 2001.</p>
<p id="paragraph-74">Asked to comment in a brief phone call, Marrero said, “I’m not interested, buddy.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">Smith, now 53, set a macho tone in the workplace, interviews and records show.&nbsp;For instance, Smith at times mocked male employees by calling them a “pussy,” according to two written exchanges seen by Reuters. In a meeting held in recent years&nbsp;with more than a dozen employees including women, he used the same term to refer to a male staffer who wouldn’t do as he asked, an attendee said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-76">According to the 2019 presentation by a human resources staffer, Smith stated his concern in a company meeting that diversity and inclusion efforts meant that Axon “won’t know how to ‘have fun.’”</p>
<p id="paragraph-77">Smith and other executives and staffers took excursions to strip clubs, six former employees said and text messages showed. Some said police joined on occasion, and staff who did not attend said they felt excluded.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">In Las Vegas, Smith traveled around with executives in a rented stretched truck known as “The Beast,” according to a photo and caption posted on the limousine company’s social media account in May 2022. The burnt-orange-colored vehicle, examined by a Reuters reporter, has a stripper pole inside it.</p>

    </figure>
</div>
<p id="paragraph-83">In statements to Reuters, the company drew a distinction between employees’ personal and professional undertakings. “We do not take customers or employees to strip clubs for any company events,” Axon said. “What people choose to do on their own personal time is something we respect their privacy to do. We have firm expectations that nothing inappropriate comes into the workplace either directly or indirectly.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-84">Both male and female staffers said taking time for family was discouraged or penalized at Axon. Three women and two men said in interviews that Axon forced them out after they sought or took parental leave in recent years. One of them, Valencia Gibson, said she received a layoff notice in 2017 a few months before she had a baby.</p>
<p id="paragraph-85">“It’s not morally, ethically right,” Gibson said, adding that she did not pursue legal action because she didn’t want to put herself through the stress.</p>
<p id="paragraph-86">One of the men, however, filed an Equal Employment Opportunity complaint in 2022, seen by Reuters, which he said is pending. Among other things, the person alleged sexism figured in Axon’s decision to terminate him after he filed a family-leave request to bond with his newborn.</p>
<p id="paragraph-87">In its statements to Reuters, Axon disputed the Equal Employment Opportunity claim, adding that more than 100 employees have benefited from its parental leave policies this year. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission declined to comment, citing federal law that barred it from releasing information on such complaints.</p>
<p id="paragraph-88">Axon <a href="https://filecache.investorroom.com/mr5ir_axon/256/AXON_ESGReport_Feb2021.pdf" id="article-link-14">described</a> its leave policies – up to 20 weeks paid for women and 10 weeks for men – as “family-friendly” and “industry-leading” in a 2021 corporate responsibility report. In contracts including a <a href="https://clkrep.lacity.org/onlinecontracts/2022/C-140744_C_07-01-22.pdf" id="article-link-15">recent $7 million deal</a> with Los Angeles for police-car cameras, it agreed not to discriminate against any person on the basis of factors such as gender, pregnancy or childbirth.</p>
<p id="paragraph-89">Smith said he “deeply” embraces diversity at Axon, noting the company wants a balance between “professionalism and personality” while believing “everyone should bring their full selves to work every day and feel welcomed as unique human beings.”</p>

<p id="paragraph-101">‘Young and impressionable’</p>
<p id="paragraph-102">To be tased, in the Axon lexicon, is to “ride the lightning.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-103">Six former employees including two executives told Reuters that Axon tased&nbsp;staff strategically around new-hire orientations – a contention that Axon called “false.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-104">In a 2019 workplace survey seen by Reuters, exposures were described as “Intern Cohort Engagement Activities.” An intern’s tasing in 2018 elicited uproarious screams from his peers, a video showed. “You’re a man’s kind of man!” one person shouted.</p>

    <figure id="MV4LEES9F8_33" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A screenshot of an Axon workplace survey from 2019 shows the company considered tasings, otherwise known as “exposures,” as one of its “Intern Cohort Engagement Activities.”</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-106">“I felt like there definitely was a lot of pressure there,” a different former intern told Reuters, comparing the experience to fraternity rush. “You’re part of the team or the brotherhood if you did it.” He said he could not breathe when he was shot, and he had to leave work early to recover. Every time he heard a Taser discharge “from that point on, I’d kind of jump a little bit in my chair.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-107">Around 2009, the company began hiring cohorts of around 15 college graduates to join a “leadership development program,” a two-year paid role that gave them a chance at a longer-term job.</p>
<p id="paragraph-108">A former employee said she understood the focus on initiating young people this way: “One, they’re young and impressionable, and two, start them early.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-109">“Everybody tells their (tasing) stories,” said the person, who herself took a hit from the darts. “They try to make you think it’s cool.”</p>

    <blockquote id="R8WMHWJE01_34">
        <p>“It looks like a scene from ancient Rome, gladiator-style.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-111">In an Axon video taken&nbsp;at a January 2022 company conference, a new employee states on camera while awaiting a tasing, “This is day three of the job, so we’ll see how it goes.” The footage shows the staffer, clad in a superhero outfit from the animated film series “The Incredibles,” squinting and smiling as the darts hit her back.</p>
<p id="paragraph-112">Others took exposures shirtless or in a sports bra, to avoid having their clothes punctured by darts or stained with blood, said workers, including former intern Keara Berlin.</p>
<p id="paragraph-113">“It just seems like if the goal really is for yourself to experience the product that you’re working on that it should be as safe as possible and private,” not “in a big group of people and taking your shirt off,” said Berlin, now 24. She said the majority of her 2019 cohort was tased&nbsp;in one session lasting at least 45 minutes, although she said she had no interest and told colleagues as an excuse that she was not appropriately dressed.</p>
<p id="paragraph-114">Some interns and young staffers told Reuters they wanted to be tased to satisfy their curiosity or gain confidence in the product. Some said they appreciated the camaraderie. They also liked the mementos for stepping up to the challenge: commemorative coins adorned with Axon insignia. Similar coins are given to military personnel or police officers for service achievements.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-116">Rylan Bennigson, an intern last summer, said his tasing&nbsp;was “100% voluntary.” He called it “a personal decision and a celebration of what we had done in the internship.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-117">Since at least 2005, the company has required exposure volunteers to waive their rights to sue, copies of these forms archived from Axon’s old website show. By 2011, Axon began to warn more prominently in the waivers that the weapons “Can cause death or serious injury,” the forms show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-118">Axon said the waiver aimed “to truly ensure that our employees know and understand their risks and consider them prior to proceeding.” Employees have no obligation to undergo tasing for career advancement, Axon said, and doing so can be in private if they so choose.</p>
<p id="paragraph-119">Smith said in the 2018 New Yorker piece that he no longer watched exposures, because, to him, they were like smelling tequila after a hangover. He told Reuters in his statement that tasings are “unpleasant.”&nbsp;But he defended the practice, saying that most of the company’s law enforcement customers require or offer their officers tasing opportunities as a way to develop “deeper understanding of the technology, as well as an empathy for people on the receiving end.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-120">“We offer this same experience to our employees,” Smith said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-121">Reuters confirmed that some police agencies, including those in Sacramento and San Jose, California, do offer the option. The Los Angeles Police Department requires a Taser-like experience, with exceptions for those with medical risks. The department attaches wires to officers rather than firing the weapon’s darts into their backs, avoiding treatment costs and risks associated with having an open wound, a captain told Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-122">In his statement to Reuters, Smith said: “There is zero pressure for anyone to participate&nbsp;(in tasings)&nbsp;and we make significant effort to ensure people understand they are not expected to do it. Most of our board and many of our most senior executives have chosen not to experience Taser devices.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-123">Axon said employee exposures occurred just a few times a year. They are “part of Axon’s culture because we see the importance in standing behind and in front of our products.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-124">Loyalty etched in ink</p>
<p id="paragraph-125">In October 2021, in a tweet, CEO Smith flexed to display an Axon logo and lightning bolts tattooed on his bicep, celebrating stock options he earned.</p>
<p id="paragraph-126">“Wow,” former chief of staff Mihir Shah commented. “All in!!!”</p>
<p id="paragraph-127">Shah declined to comment and deleted his tweet during a phone call with Reuters in July.</p>
<p id="paragraph-128">Smith and other executives in recent years got inked during excursions to Starlight Tattoo at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, according to Smith’s public statements, employee text messages and three former staffers.</p>

    <figure id="WZ5ZG7TF6Q_36" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">CEO Smith displays the fresh ink on his bicep to mark the Axon stock options he earned. The photos were taken at Starlight Tattoo in Las Vegas and posted on his Twitter account in October 2021.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-130">Starlight’s owner, Mario Barth, said he was traveling and could not immediately comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-131">After getting Axon-themed tattoos, some executives prodded their colleagues to follow suit, said four former employees. Three said&nbsp;they personally resisted getting tattoos despite repeated, sometimes discomfiting entreaties from company leaders.</p>
<p id="paragraph-132">“The execs who got tattoos were considered to be the ones who were all in,” said one of the former employees. “It was like being branded.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-133">“If you didn’t get it – you were questioned,” the person said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-134">Axon invited tattoo artists to internal conferences this year and last, company videos show. “Willing to make things permanent?” an internal company message asked employees. The message directed staff to an on-site artist in a foyer in a Scottsdale conference center.</p>
<p id="paragraph-135">Two of the former employees said women were encouraged to obtain tattoos after company officials expressed concern about only having male employees with Axon ink.</p>
<p id="paragraph-136">“They kept asking some of the girls to get tattoos,” one said. “I was like, no thanks. It’s going to fuel the boys-club fire.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-137">Axon said the vast majority of staff had no such ink and disputed that employees felt pressure to receive tattoos. Smith called the assertion “simply ridiculous,” adding, “Tattoos have never come up in hiring discussions nor promotion discussions, and I would come down hard on anyone who tried to make an issue of it.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-138">Some staffers embraced the offer. One video produced by Axon, posted on its website in November 2022, showed a sales director at a company conference getting a Taser tattoo, a circle with a lightning bolt at the center, on his bicep.</p>
<p id="paragraph-139">The sales director told Reuters he was inspired by Axon’s goal of cutting officer-involved shootings and signed up with as many as 40 of his peers.</p>

<p id="paragraph-144">Axon invited tattoo artists to a Phoenix conference it hosted this year to ink corporate insignia on willing employees, as shown in&nbsp;screenshots from a January video the company posted on YouTube.</p>
<p id="paragraph-145">The tattoo was a “funny, big cultural thing,” said the person, who declined to be named, saying he did not want to be associated with an article critical of Axon. “I do not regret it even a little bit.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-146">“I am proud of my tattoo,” Axon’s Chief Legal Officer Isaiah Fields said in a statement to Reuters. “It symbolizes the small part I have played in Axon’s mission and the positive impact we have made on the world.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-147">The stock plan was another measure of employee commitment – and it led to angst and regrets among some senior staff.</p>
<p id="paragraph-148">Around 2018, following a large stock award to Smith, investors told Axon they wanted to see broader employee buy-in to a stock program instead of “highly concentrated plans among senior management,” the company said in securities filings.</p>
<p id="paragraph-149">More than 500 U.S. staffers with salaries of at least $100,000 were asked to suspend from 5% to as much as half their pay, <a href="https://app.quotemedia.com/data/downloadFiling?webmasterId=101533&amp;ref=112527642&amp;type=PDF&amp;symbol=AXON&amp;companyName=Axon+Enterprise+Inc.&amp;formType=DEFA14A&amp;dateFiled=2018-12-21&amp;CK=1069183" id="article-link-16">according to a 2018 securities filing</a>. In return, over nine years, employees could get up to triple that amount in chunks of stock each time the board certified that Axon had&nbsp;met rigorous financial thresholds.</p>
<p id="paragraph-150">If Axon did not reach any targets by the time an employee quit or was fired, the staffer would get nothing. Those dismissed without cause would earn no stock or a capped amount.</p>
<p id="paragraph-151">Axon did not specifically comment on the stock plan for this story, other than to point out that the majority of qualifying employees were capped at committing up to 10% of their earnings.</p>
<p id="paragraph-152">In a 2019 press release, Axon trumpeted that “more than 300 employees” agreed to allocate $75 million of their compensation to the plan, choosing “to align their pay directly with value creation for shareholders.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-153">This May, Smith told investors on a Zoom video call that “nearly 100” ultimately became millionaires from the program. He rolled up his sleeve to show a tattoo to mark milestones in the form of filled-in bars.</p>
<p id="paragraph-154">“I have my financial scorecard proudly on my body,” he said. He said around a dozen other employees got the same tattoo.</p>
<p id="paragraph-155">The biggest winners by far from the plan, which was reviewed by Reuters, have been top-level executives. Isner alone reaped more than $73 million in vested stock resulting from the targets&nbsp;Axon hit, <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1069183/000155837022005230/tmb-20220520xdef14a.htm" id="article-link-17">a securities filing</a> last year shows.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-157">Isner did not respond to a request for comment on the plan.</p>
<p id="paragraph-158">Six former employees told Reuters they had lost between several hundred dollars and tens of thousands of dollars, although one of them was able to recoup the money upon exiting the company.</p>
<p id="paragraph-159">Wayne Guay, an expert on stock compensation at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said the plan was aggressive in its targets and covered an unusually long period – more risky for younger, often highly mobile employees.</p>
<p id="paragraph-160">“The founder is going to be there til the end for sure, but rank-and-file employees?” said Guay. “I’m just not sure.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-161">In 2018 messages to an Axon official involved in the stock plan, one young employee expressed misgivings. The official told the staffer to “take a chance” on the plan or risk falling behind “with your pants down.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-162">A different lower-level executive told Reuters he acceded to&nbsp;what he felt was “immense pressure” to sign up.</p>
<p id="paragraph-163">“I knew that the people that I reported to would see whether I was committing to be a company man for the next nine years,” said the executive, who has since departed Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-164">Shot 62 times</p>
<p id="paragraph-165">Axon’s all-in culture wasn’t just aimed at eager interns and ambitious young executives.</p>
<p id="paragraph-166">In a December 2019 video created by Axon, then-training manager Lamar Cousins claimed that he had been tased around 62 times. Cousins did not respond to emails requesting comment.</p>

        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A message sent to employees announcing a staff tasing event. Markings and timestamp removed by Reuters for source protection</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-168">A company-wide announcement summoned employees to a ballroom during an internal conference at the Scottsdale Westin resort in January 2022. “Exposures are happening AGAIN in (room) Herberger 3AB! Grab front&nbsp;row to see your fellow employees take a ride!” it read.</p>
<p id="paragraph-169">Videos show 50 or more people of varying ages rallying around to watch spectacles combining elements of playfulness and provocation.</p>
<p id="paragraph-170">High-level executives joined in the antics. In the December 2019 video, then-Chief Revenue Officer Isner asked Kevin De Rosa Jr, a strapping employee in his 30s, if he had been tased during his three years at Axon. De Rosa said he hadn’t.</p>
<p id="paragraph-171">“What?” Isner replied. “Are you kidding?” Isner then turned to the camera and said with a smirk, “I think a lot less of him.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-172">Moments later, De Rosa lined up and was shot with a Taser. “Big tree fall&nbsp;hard,” Isner quipped to a laughing crowd, among them a manager who waved a cutout of CEO Smith’s face. De Rosa bellowed as current flowed through his body.</p>
<p id="paragraph-173">De Rosa declined to comment.</p> 
<p id="paragraph-178">Gibson, the former international support manager, disputed Axon’s statement that exposures are held to improve understanding of the product.</p>
<p id="paragraph-179">It is “more about a bro code,” she said. “This has nothing to do with sales. This has nothing to do with understanding a client or a customer... They’re just doing this for fun. And that’s off-putting.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-180">Gorman, the former Axon lawyer, said he “vividly” remembers an executive asking him if he was going to be tased.</p>
<p id="paragraph-181">“I thought he was joking around,” he said, but “every time there was an exposure, it was like, did you sign up? When are you going to sign up? You’re going to do it, right?”</p>
<p id="paragraph-182">Gorman resisted, saying he was concerned by reports of people involuntarily urinating or defecating as they took a hit.</p>
<p id="paragraph-183">He soon felt he did not belong at Axon.</p>
<p id="paragraph-184">“You’re not part of the culture unless you do it,” he said.</p>

<p dir="auto">This is a tool for automatically creating typing shortcuts from a corpus of your own writing! I use these shortcuts mainly for email and slack:</p>

<p dir="auto">This repo parses a corpus of text and suggest what shortcuts you should use to save the most letters while typing. It then generates config files for <a href="https://github.com/autokey/autokey">Autokey</a>, a linux program that implements keyboard shortcuts!</p>
<p dir="auto">It also contains a tool for optionally parsing a Slack Data Export of your messages to create a corpus.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What phrases should I abbreviate?</h2>
<p dir="auto">The code looks through the corpus to find common n-grams that can be replaced with much shorter phrases. The suggestions are ranked by <code>[characters saved] * [frequency of phrase]</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">I was surprised that very short and frequent words topped this list, such as <code>the -&gt; t</code>, instead of longer phrases that I use a lot, such as <code>what do you think -&gt; wdytk</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/eschluntz/compress/blob/master/img/chars-saved.png"><img src="https://github.com/eschluntz/compress/raw/master/img/chars-saved.png" alt="results"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Just reading through the results was amusing to see how repetitive some of my writing is :)</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to pick abbreviations?</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is largely preferences and heuristics to try to generate memorable abbreviations for different phrases. Some of my design philosphies were:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The abbrev cannot be a word that I want to type. Right now this is done with a blacklist, but I should change it to use my actual corpus.</li>
<li>The goal is being memorable. 1st letter is top choice, and 1st letter + last letter is next choice.</li>
<li>More common phrases get priority for more memorable abbrevs.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">This is currently done as a manual post-process step, but I like to make "families"
of abbrevs to make them more memorable. Some example heuristics for this are:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Plurals should have the same abbrev as the singular, but with an "s". For example <code>robot -&gt; r</code> and <code>robots -&gt; rs</code>.</li>
<li>If a word has an abbrev, a phrase that contains that word should contain the abbrev. For example:</li>
</ol>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="the       -> t
robot     -> r
the robot -> tr"><pre><code>the       -&gt; t
robot     -&gt; r
the robot -&gt; tr
</code></pre></div>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Think about how similar words' abbrevs can be similar as well. i.e.</li>
</ol>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="some      -> s
someone   -> sn
something -> st
sometime  -> sti"><pre><code>some      -&gt; s
someone   -&gt; sn
something -&gt; st
sometime  -&gt; sti
</code></pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Instructions</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>run <code>install.sh</code> to install dependencies. Currently tested on python 3.10.12</li>
<li>Put any corpus of your text that you want to compress in <code>data/corpus/*.txt</code></li>
<li>If you want to use your slack history as a corpus:
<ol dir="auto">
<li>export it to a folder called <code>data/slack_export</code>. Only slack workspace admins can do this (and it only exports public channels).</li>
<li>Change <code>USERNAME_TO_EXPORT</code> at the top of the file to your slack username.</li>
<li>Run <code>parse_slack.py</code>. This will generate a new corpus document in <code>data/corpus/</code></li>
<li>DELETE YOUR SLACK EXPORT WITH <code>srm</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Run <code>find_suggested_phrases.py</code>. This will generate a list of the top 200 suggested shortcuts to <code>output/suggested_shortcuts.yaml</code></li>
<li>Edit or add any shortcuts that you want, then copy the file to <code>shortcuts.yaml</code>.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This is a manual step so you can customize it without it being blown out every time you run the script again.</li>
<li>It's also saved in git even though it's an output so that I can keep it in sync across multiple of my computers :)</li>
<li>If you're starting out, I suggest just going with 10-20 shortcuts to make it easier to remember them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run <code>generate_autokeys.py</code> to convert <code>shortcuts.yaml</code> into actual config files for <code>autokey</code>.</li>
<li>Install <a href="https://github.com/autokey/autokey">Autokey</a>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Right now, Autokey is only supported on linux with X11, not Wayland</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Symlink the output into autokey's config: <code>ln -s output/autokey_phrases ~/.config/autokey/data/My Phrases/</code></li>
<li>From now on when you edit <code>shortcuts.yaml</code> you can re-generate and reload autokey with <code>reload.sh</code></li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Notes</h2>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/autokey/autokey">Autokey</a> Uses simulated keyboard input to replace phrases with your abbreviations. I tried several chrome extensions but this worked much more reliably without conflicting with sites' own javascript.</p>
<p dir="auto">The config files I generate are set to only apply when Chrome is in focus because that's where I do most of my english typing. I found that keeping this active in terminal and vscode caused way more problems than it was solved because my abbreviations overlapped with common short linux commands and variable names i.e. <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>The Federal Communications Commission yesterday rejected requests to eliminate an upcoming requirement that Internet service providers list all of their monthly fees.</p>
<p>Five major trade groups representing US broadband providers <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10117331109471/1">petitioned</a> the FCC in January to scrap the requirement before it takes effect. In June, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/comcast-complains-to-fcc-that-listing-all-of-its-monthly-fees-is-too-hard/">Comcast told the FCC</a> that the listing-every-fee rule "impose[s] significant administrative burdens and unnecessary complexity in complying with the broadband label requirements."</p>
<p>The five trade groups <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/isps-complain-that-listing-every-fee-is-too-hard-urge-fcc-to-scrap-new-rule/">kept up the pressure</a> earlier this month in a meeting with FCC officials and in a filing that complained that listing every fee is too hard. The FCC refused to bend, <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-declines-reconsider-broadband-consumer-label-rules">announcing</a> yesterday that the rules will take effect without major changes.</p>
<p>"Every consumer needs transparent information when making decisions about what Internet service offering makes the most sense for their family or household. No one wants to be hit with charges they didn't ask for or they did not expect," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said.</p>
<p>Yesterday's order "largely affirms the rules... while making some revisions and clarifications such as modifying provider record-keeping requirements when directing consumers to a label on an alternative sales channel and confirming that providers may state 'taxes included' when their price already incorporates taxes," the FCC said.</p>
<h2>ISPs don’t want to list all fees</h2>
<p>Comcast and other ISPs objected to a requirement that ISPs "list all recurring monthly fees" including "all charges that providers impose at their discretion, <em>i.e.</em>, charges not mandated by a government." They complained that the rule will force them "to display the pass-through of fees imposed by federal, state, or local government agencies on the consumer broadband label."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>As we've previously written, ISPs could simplify billing and comply with the new broadband-labeling rules by including all costs in their advertised rates. That would give potential customers a clearer idea of how much they have to pay each month and save ISPs the trouble of listing every charge that they currently choose to break out separately.</p>
<p>Rejecting the broadband industry's request, the FCC order yesterday said:</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e affirm our requirement that providers display all monthly fees with respect to broadband service on the label to provide consumers with clear and accurate information about the cost of their broadband service. We thus decline providers' request that they not disclose those fees or that they instead display an "up to" price for certain fees they choose to pass through to consumers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Specifically, "providers must itemize the fees they add to base monthly prices, including fees related to government programs they choose to 'pass through' to consumers, such as fees related to universal service or regulatory fees," the FCC said.</p>
<p>The FCC was ordered by Congress to implement broadband-label rules. The FCC is requiring ISPs to display the labels to consumers at the point of sale and include information such as the monthly price, additional fees, introductory rates, data caps, charges for data overages, and performance metrics. The FCC rules aren't in force yet because they are subject to a federal Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review under the US Paperwork Reduction Act.</p>

  <p><span>
    <span>05 Sep 2021</span>
  </span></p><p>Airplane window seats are great! Not only are they more comfy and easier to take a nap in, but they also have the most quaint form of in-flight entertainment: The outside world!</p>

<p>But other than taking a few photos of holiday mementos and lens-flaring sunsets, what’s the point? Well, I’m here to prove that you can recycle your photos into something vaguely cool using <strong>photogrammetry</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, see this photo of Edinburgh I took in August 2015:</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/edinburgh.jpg" alt="Photo of Edinburgh from above, taken from an airplane window."></p>

<p>Using <a href="https://qgis.org/">QGIS</a> I can transform this photo onto a map using the ‘georeferencer’ tool. First I mapped several reference points on the photo with identifiable locations on a map of Edinburgh. Then I set the transformation function in the georeferencer settings to be ‘projective’.</p>

<picture>
    <source srcset="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/georeferencer-dark.jpg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
    <img alt="A screenshot of QGIS demonstrating the georeferencer tool being used on a photo of Edinburgh." src="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/georeferencer-light.jpg">
</picture>

<p>After running the transformer, I ended up with a projected image that distorts the photo so that it can be displayed on a world map. You can see the final result by checking out the map below (<a href="https://map-tile-compare.leifgehrmann.com/#https://tiles.leifgehrmann.com/configs/edinburgh_2.json">fullscreen</a>).</p>



<center><p><small>
<strong>Hint:</strong> Pan around the map and zoom in to see the transformation up close. Toggle labels using ⓘ to help with identifying features. Toggle 'compare mode' using ◐ to compare the photo with commercial aerial imagery.
</small></p></center>

<p>Using ‘compare mode’ in the map above you might notice the imagery is slightly warped in different parts of the map. For example, parts of Princes Street in the centre of Edinburgh are misaligned with the real map.</p>

<p>That’s the one downside of using simple projective transformation, which assumes the projected surface is always flat. As the illustration below demonstrates, by using a transformation that assumes a flat surface, the ground surface that is in higher elevation to the projected surface will appear to shift away from the camera and conversely points in lower-elevation will shift towards the camera.</p>

<picture>
    <source srcset="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/distortion-dark.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
    <img alt="An illustration showing a cross-section of terrain and a plane hovering above the ground. Two lines emanate from an airplane window, symbolising the field of view of a photo taken from the plane. The lines intersect with the ground, and another line joining the intersecting points symbolises the geometrical 'plane' that the imagery would be projected on. The illustration demonstrates that the terrain oscillates above and below the 'plane', which implies that the projected image won't be reliable, precisely because the image transformation assumes the terrain is flat." src="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/distortion-light.png">
</picture>

<p>This error becomes more pronounced the closer to the ground the photo is taken. In the example below (<a href="https://map-tile-compare.leifgehrmann.com/#https://tiles.leifgehrmann.com/configs/edinburgh_6.json">fullscreen</a>), notice how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broxburn#The_Shale_Bings">‘Greendykes Bing’</a> stretches (see top-right of the photo). The effect is also noticeable with the farmland shifting around to the left of the ‘bing’ where the land dips into a creek.</p>



<p>The other alternative to a ‘projective’ transformation is to use a ‘thin plate spline’, but the distortion effects can only be mitigated by adding a ridiculous number of reference points which can take ages. For this blog post, I’ll be keeping it simple and use the ‘projective’ transformation through all my examples.</p>

<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p>So what are some applications of having this data? I’ve come up with three:</p>

<h3 id="-open-aerial-data">① Open aerial data</h3>

<p>One benefit to creating my own imagery data is the freedom of ownership. I, as the individual who took the photo, have the right to apply any copyright license I please. So theoretically I can publish this work into the public domain.</p>

<p>There are only two other ways I know of to get imagery right now that are available to be used publicly, both of which have their own problems.</p>

<p><strong>Satellite imagery</strong> in the public domain does exist, such as <a href="https://landlook.usgs.gov/">Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2</a>. But from what I can see, these images have a resolution of ~30 meters. In the photo I took, the midsection of the photo (The centre of the city) has a resolution of ~15 meters. With a better camera setup I could probably get much better results than the casual photo I took.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/sentinel2look.jpg" alt="Satellite imagery of Edinburgh from the Sentinel-2 Satellite. The image shows clouds covering up parts of Edinburgh and the details of the city are very hard to make out."></p>

<center><p><small>

</small></p></center>

<p><strong>Drone imagery</strong> is also an option. These images are usually taken by consumer drones, and are pretty effective at capturing hyper-local aerial data. Much better quality than what I can achieve through an airplane window!</p>

<p>There are several commercial businesses that do drone photogrammetry, but there are also plenty of hobbyists. The only collective effort I’ve seen of people publicly sharing drone photogrammetry is <a href="https://openaerialmap.org/">OpenAerialMap</a>. The neat thing about OpenAerialMap is that all of the imagery is available under a creative-commons public license (CC-BY).</p>

<p>However the issue with flying drones for collecting imagery is often the legal restrictions. For example in the United Kingdom, the Civil Aviation Authority restricts drones from flying anywhere above people, including in buildings or vehicles, with a no-fly-zone extending all the way to the legal height limit. So while drone imagery is easy to get for rural areas, it’s not so useful for cities. In contrast, commercial flights have no problem flying over cities, so it’s possible to capture imagery of urban environments.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/regulations.png" alt="An illustration of two drone regulations provided by the Civil Aviation Authority. One requires operators to not fly closer to people than 50 meters. The other requires operators to be the same distance away from people as the distance from the ground when the drone is more than 50 meters above the ground."></p>

<p>So between satellite imagery and hyper-local drone imagery, capturing aerial data from a commercial aircraft is a neat middle ground. 😁</p>

<h3 id="-amateur-surveying">② Amateur surveying</h3>

<p>It’s also possible to use the aerial imagery for getting very up-to-date information that can be used for mapping purposes, such as contributing data to <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap.org</a>. Depending on the quality of the photo, it might be possible to detect newly built infrastructure like roads and buildings.</p>



<p>For example, I took the photo above (<a href="https://map-tile-compare.leifgehrmann.com/#https://tiles.leifgehrmann.com/configs/germany_2.json">fullscreen</a>) in March 2017. Some of the wind turbines visible in this photo were literally in the process of being constructed when I took the photo. Since it was March, that would have been several months before the yearly aerial imagery for 2017 was collected, which usually is in the late-spring and summer months.</p>

<p><img src="https://assets.leifgehrmann.com/posts/2021-09-05/wind-turbines.jpg" alt="A sequence of 3 photos showing the construction of 2 wind turbines viewed from the sky. One showing Summer 2016, one showing March 2017 (which was captured by your's truly), and a third one showing Summer 2017."></p>

</small></p></center>

<p>In a lot of countries yearly aerial imagery is very rare. So while my example above is a bit contrived since the Netherlands captures data annually, it could still be useful in other countries.</p>

<p>So aerial data captured on commercial flights has a slight edge to professional aerial data, which is great for amateur mappers who want to get the scoop before the professional surveyors. Of course, you can’t really control <em>what</em> photos you’ll be able to capture because of flight paths and cloud conditions, but it’s still an edge. 😛</p>

<h3 id="-historical-imagery">③ Historical imagery</h3>

<p>Re-projecting a photo can also help with easily comparing historical data.</p>

<p>Time-lapsing pictures captured from the sky can be difficult, but by transforming it to fit on a map, it’s much easier to identify gradual changes to a landscape or city.</p>

<p>For the example below (<a href="https://map-tile-compare.leifgehrmann.com/#https://tiles.leifgehrmann.com/configs/netherlands_2.json">fullscreen</a>), you can see what <a href="https://www.natuurmonumenten.nl/projecten/marker-wadden/english-version">Marker Wadden</a> looked like in March, 2017.</p>



<p>For context, below are a sequence of photos that show what Marker Wadden looked like between 2016 and 2017:</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hopefully I’ve convinced you that re-projecting your holiday photos is a neat idea with some cool applications! Or at the very least thought it was mildly interesting.</p>

<p>Of course there are several limitations with taking photos from a plane.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don’t get to control the flight path, meaning you don’t get to choose what specific landmarks you can photograph.</li>
  <li>The weather and lighting is always un-predictable.</li>
  <li>It’s difficult to control the camera’s focus.</li>
  <li>The plane window might have scratches in the plastic, messing up the photo.</li>
  <li>Seat-neighbours probably thinking you are a weirdo for constantly taking pictures, especially during take-off.</li>
</ul>

<p>…but that doesn’t stop us from trying, right? 😄</p>

<p>I had a bit of fun doing these transformations, so I dug through my photo library for more photos I could georeference. So here are a few more that I thought looked interesting:</p>

<p>Google's "Pixel Pass" payment plan has perished. The company is shutting down the all-in-one subscription service that let customers pay a monthly fee for a new Pixel Phone and a bunch of Google subscription services like YouTube Premium. When the service launched in October 2021, Google said that every two years on the Pixel Pass would make you eligible for a brand new phone. But the service only lasted 22 months, so no one will be eligible for that phone upgrade.</p>
<p>
Pixel Pass <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/">was introduced</a> alongside the Pixel 6 launch. For $45 per month, you would get a new Pixel 6, YouTube and YouTube Music Premium, 200GB of Google One storage, "Preferred Care" coverage for your phone, and a "Google Play Pass," a Netflix-style all-you-can-eat subscription for Play Store apps and games. Google said you could "save up to $294 over two years" compared to buying everything individually. A more expensive $55-per-month plan got you a Pixel 6 Pro instead, and there were even plans that included Google Fi Wireless cellular service.</p>
<p>Google explained its latest product shutdown on <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelpass/answer/13968577#zippy=%2Cwhy-is-pixel-pass-being-discontinued">a support page</a>. "Beginning August 29, 2023, Pixel Pass is no longer offered for new Pixel purchases or renewal," the company said.</p>
<p>The support page FAQ asks, "Why is the Pixel Pass being discontinued?" but Google doesn't answer its own question, saying only, "We offer the best value of our hardware products and give users the flexibility to purchase their favorite services. We continue to evaluate offers based on customer feedback and provide different ways for them to access the best of Google."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Besides the questionable popularity of a service like this, Google has been raising a lot of its subscription prices lately, and the Pixel Pass's discounts ran counter to those price increases. YouTube Premium has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/youtube-premium-gets-a-2-price-increase-now-13-99-a-month/">gone up</a> $2 since the Pixel Pass launched, and while Google has raised storage prices for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/google-workspace-launches-annual-plans-20-price-increase-for-monthly-users/">business Workspace customers</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing-announce">Google Cloud</a>, it hasn't gone after personal Google One accounts yet.</p>
<p>The terms of the Pixel Pass were for two years, and paying the subscription for that time would pay off your Pixel phone. Early cancellation meant a big final bill for the remainder of the phone cost. That won't happen here, though—while new signups are no longer allowed, existing users will be able to finish out their two-year term. The end of the term was supposed to mean re-upping with a shiny new device, but Google now says, "By the end of the 2 year term, you can’t upgrade to a new phone with Pixel Pass."</p>
<p>Once the two years are up and your Pixel Pass subscription is dead, there's still the question of what to do with your subscriptions to the still-surviving Google services. After your two years, Google says, "The included Google subscriptions, such as Google One, Google Play Pass, and YouTube Premium, automatically renew each month until canceled. You’ll receive a monthly bill for Google One, Google Play Pass, and YouTube Premium at the current discounted rate, which is visible in the email sent to you on August 29, 2023 with the subject line, 'An important update on Pixel Pass.' If you are using your Pixel Pass device on Google Fi Wireless, the $5 service discount to your Google Fi Wireless plan also ends."</p>
<p>To take some sting out of the move, Google is offering a "$100 loyalty reward credit" for active Pixel Pass subscribers. You can use it for $100 off a new Pixel phone from the Google Store or Google Fi, and it expires in two years.</p>

<p><span>Thankfully, the open source ecosystem is starting to develop, and we are now seeing open source models that rival closed-source alternatives. Hundreds of small teams and individuals are also working to make these models more useful, accessible, and performant.</span></p>
<p><span>These projects push the state of the art in open source AI and help provide a more robust and comprehensive understanding of the technology. They include: instruction-tuning base LLMs; removing censorship from LLM outputs; optimizing models for low-powered machines; building novel tooling for model inference; researching LLM security issues; and many others.</span></p>
<p><span>However, the people behind these projects often don’t have the resources available to pursue their work to conclusion or maintain it in the long run. The situation is more acute in AI than traditional infrastructure, since even fine-tuning models requires significant GPU computing resources, especially as open source models get larger.</span></p>

						<p><strong>OpenAI is expected to far exceed previous revenue projections next year, generating more than $1 billion in revenue, according to The Information.</strong></p>
<p>OpenAI is expected to generate more than $1 billion in revenue over the next 12 months, The Information reported, citing an internal source. That figure is well above the estimates OpenAI had previously given investors.</p>
<p>Prior to the launch of ChatGPT, the company projected revenue of just $28 million in 2021. The estimate implies that OpenAI is currently generating more than $80 million in revenue per month.</p>
<h2>OpenAI's technology is already being used by many companies</h2>
<p>The growth suggests that companies are finding commercial applications for OpenAI's conversational AI technology. App developers and companies like Wall Street firm Jane Street appear to be using the technology to make or save money, according to The Information.</p>
<p>Other OpenAI customers include Zoom, Stripe, Notion, and Databricks. Microsoft uses OpenAI technology in Office 365, Bing Chat, GitHub Copilot and more.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, it also launched <a href="https://the-decoder.com/openai-launches-chatgpt-enterprise-with-enhanced-security-privacy-and-speed/">ChatGPT Enterprise</a>, an enterprise version of the chatbot that promises privacy and direct connectivity to enterprise software - competing with Microsoft's offerings.</p>
<h2>Trend towards customized AI assistants for enterprises</h2>
<p>So the trend is increasingly toward customized AI assistants for enterprises that can use them e.g. to quickly analyze data, inform trades, and add value, as in the case of Jane Street. Citadel is another high-frequency trading firm that has approached OpenAI and others about integrating the technology into its business.</p>
<p>Whether OpenAI can keep such high-profile clients for long remains to be seen: Jane Street recently hired David So, who previously spent eight years at Google and helped develop language models such as PaLM-2 and the Bard chatbot, according to The Information. The hire could be seen as a sign that the company is investing more in developing its own language models.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://xata.io/blog/file-attachments">https://xata.io/blog/file-attachments</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37324370">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, as part of <a href="https://xata.io/blog/launch-week-august-2023">our launch week</a>, we’re beyond excited to announce a feature that we've wanted to add ever since we started Xata: File Attachments. Think of it as having a new database column type where you can store files of any size, and behind the scenes they are stored in AWS S3 and cached through a global CDN. Files simply become a part of a database record. For example, they respect the same security boundary -- if you can access a record, you can also access its attached files. Image file types also get some extra functionality allowing you to request them at any size and style with built-in transformations. With this release, we aim to simplify your application architecture and reduce the number of services you need to manage.</p>
<p>In this blog we'll dive into the capabilities released today and architecture behind our implementation. We hope you enjoy the read as much as we did building it 😃</p>

<p>Both files and relational data are ubiquitous in today's applications. Even the most basic scenarios generally require both structured relational data and file storage. Think about a blog which uses both posts metadata and images, a product catalogue or a document library. They all require basic data record management and query capabilities, as well as storage and access to large binary objects like images, videos, and documents.</p>
<p>We often see engineers using a relational database with a separate storage service to store the data used by their application. In most cases the binary files are related to the relational data, therefore the common pattern is to store a file link in the database. This experience adds unnecessary friction and we saw an opportunity to simplify. Because file storage use cases are so closely correlated to data, we decided to embed <a href="https://xata.io/docs/sdk/file-attachments">file attachments</a> directly into our serverless database and bring a new experience for building data apps that require binary storage.</p>
<p>We've shown this feature to a number of developers before releasing it, and this is the type of feedback we've received on our approach so far:</p>



<p>Let’s take a deeper look into what gets simplified and how Xata achieves this.</p>

<p>We’re really excited about today's release because it packs a lot of functionality into the simple experience of adding another column to your database. We wanted this experience to feel familiar, like adding and viewing an attachment in a spreadsheet instead of dropping a file into a generic bucket. When we started to work on the file attachments, we had the following goals in mind:</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Relational and storage APIs should share the same endpoints and the same connections. It is easier to work with and maintain one service rather than two.</li><li>APIs must share the same authorization scheme and the same permissions model. Avoid having to use different credentials and keep permissions in sync.</li><li>Relational data and binary object data should share the same region. Both data types should reside in the same compliance boundary and have similar guarantees.</li></ol>
<p>The first step in our design was to acknowledge that relational data and large binary objects have very different consumption models and trying to fit both into the same storage service leads to unacceptable compromises. One size doesn’t fit all. Serving large binary objects from a relational database cannot match the performance of a dedicated storage service in terms of compute cost, concurrency and throughput. The opposite is even more obvious, a storage service cannot match the querying and data management capabilities of a relational database.</p>
<p>Like with any design challenge, we had to devise a solution to address seemingly conflicting requirements. The APIs for relational data and binary objects needed to be unified, while the backend storage had to differ to achieve the expected performance and feature set.</p>

<p>At the API and database schema level, the binary object data type became the <code>file</code> column type. You can attach one or multiple files in a column to a record in your database. This approach allowed all existing Xata features to work with the file type without any API change.</p>

<p>Using the existing Xata REST APIs or SDKs, and the same connection, a developer can now upload a file, download a file, run queries over files using filters, aggregations, joins, and even run search queries to match file metadata.</p>
<p>In the record model the file column holds a <a href="https://xata.io/docs/concepts/file-attachments#record-apis">JSON object</a> with a predefined schema which contains both file metadata and the file content.</p>

<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Thinking further about typical relational data and file storage use cases, we noticed significant commonalities and differences. The management of files maps very well to relational data management. CRUD operations are similar in the sense that they work over organized data, entries have owners, there is a permission model in place, and they offer a level of consistency and durability. In general we can say that the write patterns are fairly similar. An application for managing files can very well use a database API to achieve the same.</p>
<p>The important difference comes with the read patterns. Relational databases are designed for complex queries, which can involve high usage of CPU and memory, while storage reads have minimal CPU and memory usage. Because the operations are extremely simple, the storage reads generally scale to much higher request rate, concurrency and throughput. Therefore storage read patterns expect very high concurrency and throughput with minimal cost. Offering the database read for files retrieval will not meet the expectations for a storage service.</p>
<p>We will call this high scale read use case, the content distribution scenario. To address content distribution, Xata introduces direct access URLs. They can be retrieved by reading the file column. Accessing the URL does not involve a database call and therefore they are NOT subject to Xata concurrency and rate limits, and can make use of the storage service capacity.</p>

<p>Since file attachments share the same endpoints with the Xata APIs, the same authorization scheme applies. Whether you are using API keys or OAuth, the same credentials can be used for managing files. This single service approach reduces complexity on the client side and at the same time guarantees that future authorization methods and future permissions models apply uniformly to both records API and file attachments API.</p>

<p>As we discussed in the previous section, there are two distinct usage scenarios for files. The first is the common relational data approach where the operations are file CRUD and metadata query. The common authorization applies here. Access to the file is conditioned by the user having access to the database record.</p>
<p>The second scenario is the content distribution through direct access URLs. In this case the authorization requirements are very different. If resource management requires a trusted security model, content distribution sometimes requires unrestricted access.</p>
<p>To cater for different URL access needs, Xata provides 3 levels of authorization for the URLs that it generates.</p>
<ol role="list"><li>Public Access - the requests to retrieve the file are not subject to any authentication or authorization. This is very convenient for truly public content, but can be very dangerous if configured by mistake on sensitive data. By default, all uploaded files are private (the access URL requires authentication). Public access can be configured per file to allow maximum flexibility. The default can be updated per column, for scenarios where all files need to be public.</li><li>Signed URL - Xata can generate a signed URL which grants access to anyone having the URL for a specified amount of time. This is commonly used in scenarios where an image is rendered but the URL cannot be further shared because it expires shortly. The default timeout is 1 minute, but it can be configured per file.</li><li>Authenticated URL - the requests need to include a valid Authorization header in order to retrieve the file.</li></ol>
<p>All the access URLs offer lower latency compared to file retrieval through the Xata API because, apart from the authorization check (for signed and authenticated URLs) they go directly to storage skipping Xata middleware and the database service.</p>

<p>Going further on storage performance, modern applications require low latency across the globe.</p>
<p>We could not claim to simplify working with files and then ask customers to configure and manage their own CDN to get reasonable global performance. As a result, the support for file attachments includes built-in CDN capabilities. There is no opt-in and no action is required to enable it; all direct access URLs are served through a CDN by default. In essence, all files retrieved through a URL are cached at the edge, making the following requests blazing fast.</p>
<p>Xata opted to integrate <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cdn/">Cloudflare’s Global CDN</a> for its wide geographical coverage, its performance and its feature set.</p>
<p>As with any cache, the great performance improvement comes with the fundamental problem of stale cache entries and cache invalidation. Xata addresses stale cache entries by design using immutable file objects. This means any update to a file is in fact a new file object, with a different ID generating a different URL and eventually a different cache entry. This pattern is also known as <em>versioning</em>, because conceptually the cache keys change with every version of the object.</p>
<p>Following this pattern, when the client application loads a set of records from Xata, it also gets the most up-to-date URLs which are guaranteed NOT to hit a stale cache entry, no matter where the cache is (browser, web proxy, CDN). This is very important because the user can clear the browser cache and Xata can invalidate the CDN cache, but a web proxy in between might still serve a stale cache entry. Versioning guarantees this can never happen. The downside is that file URLs are not persistent and they should not be used as static resources. However, this fits the Xata model of attaching binary objects to database records. Similar to the database records, the URLs are dynamic content and needs to be retrieved through database reads and queries.</p>
<p>We have seen that content cannot be stale, but there is an important note on permissions. When a public object gets cached, changing permissions will not invalidate the cached entry. Making a file private applies immediately for new URLs, but the file is still accessible through old URLs until the cache entry expires in 2h. Xata advises greatest caution when configuring public access, because in practice there is a delay in changing the permissions from public to private.</p>

<p>Looking at the most common scenarios where relational data is used together with binary files, the image use case stands out. All web applications use images today and images tend to require processing before they are rendered. Xata file attachments come with a <a href="https://xata.io/docs/sdk/image-transformations">comprehensive set of image transformations</a> -- from resizing to photo adjustments to changing format and compression.</p>
<p>All transformations are applied at the edge and are cached by default. Again, Xata leverages Cloudflare functionality for image transformations.</p>
<p>We considered more flexible transformation definitions through query parameters or request body objects, but in the end chose the industry standard of defining the transformations in the URL path. This makes it easier to embed the transformation into a web page and the transformation is automatically included in the cache key within the CDN.</p>
<p><code>https://eu-west-1.storage.xata.sh/transform/rotate=180,height=50/nj42n37o4l3dd19fe6vsh4plkk</code></p>

<p>Generally, our philosophy is to abstract away complexity where we can so our end users don’t have to worry about it. File attachments is no exception to this strategy.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the file data is actually stored in two places. The file content is stored as an AWS S3 object while the file metadata (name, type, size, S3 pointer) is stored as a JSON object in the PostgreSQL database table.</p>
<p>We chose S3 for the binary object storage for its high performance, durability, availability and because it shares the same compliance certifications with the AWS Aurora, which we use for running PostgreSQL. This way, all data (relational and binary objects) is located in the same data centers and benefits from the same compliance guarantees.</p>
<p>The fundamental challenge when writing state to two different services is making it transactional. Xata service implements two-phase commit semantics to ensure that a file write either completes successfully or is rolled back. This is one of the key operations where Xata does the heavy lifting and abstracts away the complexity. The client code can rely on the transactional guarantee and no longer be concerned with two-phase commit or dealing with an out of sync state.</p>
<p>A second set of challenges comes around data deletion and cleanup, where again it is not trivial to keep the state in sync between two services. With database tables, Xata takes the cautious approach of delayed cleanup. This allows us to offer undo delete operations (not exposed yet) and to have a general recovery option in case of accidental deletes. When file content storage comes into the picture, it needs to follow the same pattern. Restoring only half of the deleted data is not particularly useful.</p>
<p>The implemented solution treats the PostgreSQL metadata as source of truth and removes the associated file data only when the corresponding records are deleted from PostgreSQL. This is achieved by hooking into the PostgreSQL replication and handling delete record events. This is an elegant way of replicating the deleted state from PostgreSQL to S3, but unfortunately it is only half the solution, because it only handles individual record or value deletes. When data is deleted by dropping entire columns, tables, databases the events are not captured in replication so Xata handles this separately by scheduling bulk deletes.</p>
<p>Backup support adds another level of complexity. Xata creates regular backups and can perform a restore on request. The binary object storage needs to match the ability to restore the state from the time of the database backup. This is achieved through a combination of immutable S3 objects and configuring S3 lifecycle. Deleted files become inaccessible, but they are kept for 7 days after their deletion for recovery purposes. After the 7 days the files are permanently deleted.</p>

<p>If you look at the file column JSON example shown earlier, it might strike you as odd. Files don’t come encoded as base64 and they are certainly not used in their encoded form.</p>
<p>Xata APIs are JSON based and therefore the file content needed to fit in a JSON object. We chose to use Base64 encoding as it is the most common binary encoding and has the widest library support across languages. For a client application that has binary content in a buffer, it should be trivial to encode it as Base64. The Xata SDK offers helpers <a href="https://xata.io/docs/sdk/file-attachments">here</a>.</p>
<p>While we recommend this approach when dealing with small files and when extending existing apps that already use Xata APIs, we acknowledge there are drawbacks in using the Base64 encoding. For very large files or for very high throughput applications, the extra CPU cost of encoding and decoding the files begins to matter and it is exposed in the delivery latency. Also, the extra 33% in file size added by the encoding impacts the size on the wire and implicitly the performance and bandwidth costs.</p>
<p>To alleviate these concerns we introduced <a href="https://xata.io/docs/sdk/file-attachments">binary file APIs</a>. These APIs use similar endpoints but they accept and they retrieve binary content. For files larger than 20MB these are the only APIs for uploading content.</p>
<p>It is important to mention these are still database APIs, they involve reads and writes of metadata to PostgreSQL and they are not direct S3 wrappers.</p>

<p>We have launched this functionality with an example image gallery app to highlight the developer experience you get with Xata and give you a starting point to try it out. This example combines full-text search, aggregations, files, and image transformations. If you’d like to get started, be sure to check out our <a href="https://github.com/xataio/sample-nextjs-chakra-gallery-app">example repository</a>.</p>

<p>The purpose of this map is to highlight the secretly toxic side of the VPN industry, to champion the few heroes in our space that exist, and to showcase how much that corporate spending dictates public opinion of which VPN is best. This map shows the links between VPNs, their actual owners, paid affiliates, and media organizations.
</p>
<h2>Paid VPN Affiliates</h2>
<p><i>The paid incentive to lie for profit</i></p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of VPN comparison sites aren’t providing their services for free.</p>
<p>They get kickbacks. These are disclosed as “affiliate fees” and they earn a set commission per sale.</p>
<p>The most popular VPN review websites can earn tens of thousands of dollars per month simply for providing a link directly to VPNs they are partnered with. In an ideal world, the merits of the VPN being reviewed would prevent these websites from changing their scores.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after reviewing these sites ourselves we have found that not a single affiliate site on the front page of Google adheres to that principle.</p>
<p>Instead, even VPNs that have suffered breaches, disclosed user information, have security vulnerabilities, or lack technical features displayed by other VPNs score higher.</p>
<p>Because the financial incentive is too strong. With the VPN industry worth $44.6B currently and predicted to break $77B within 3 years the margin for profit will only grow. We can only hope to draw attention to this so people will do their own research and find the solutions that serve them best.</p>
<p>As with Windscribe our biggest source of growth is by referrals. By the technically-minded who find we suit their needs and they refer us to their friends in need of similar solutions.</p>
<h2>Corporate VPN Owners</h2>
<p><i>Friendly branding, uncaring ownership</i></p>
<p>A lot of VPNs have cute branding but vicious owners. While their design team is marvelous, little can be said about those that own said companies.</p>
<p>ExpressVPN, famously known previously as Kape, got into the game by creating malware and seeking ways to scrape personal information. Not hide it. Their owner Teddy Sagi has been served multiple lawsuits pertaining to fraud.
Nord VPN’s owners, Tesonet, are well known for their work in data-mining and collection. That’s just two quick examples.</p>
<p>The VPN space should be first and foremost about privacy and while people can change – companies rarely do. Their legacies paint a pretty clear picture about what they value and what they see as important.</p>
<p>Many VPNs also have the same corporate owner. You’ll notice in the map many VPNs are actually part of the same brand. They have a different paint job, but same engine – as it were.</p>
<h2>Bought Influence</h2>
<p><i>Corporate acquisitions to change brand perceptions</i></p>
<p>Many VPNs featured here have suffered data breaches and loss of customer records. Some have bowed to LEO requests and provided customer data. These events should be something that breaks a VPN company altogether.
</p>
<p>Yet corporate VPNs have other options available to them.</p>
<p>They can simply buy referral sites or buy competitors. Kape, the owners of ExpressVPN, bought Webselenese—giving them control over Safety Detectives and VPNMentor. What should be noted here is that ExpressVPN paid more for these content affiliate websites than they did for some actual VPN companies they acquired.</p>
<p>The affiliate programs that have been mentioned are one thing. But in the VPN space we often have queries from content sites telling us that they will only feature us if we are willing to pay thousands of dollars. While as a small independent VPN we don’t have the budget to pay for this coverage – the larger corporate VPNs certainly do have the budget. As many pay hundreds of thousands of dollars per year to be featured on content sites, have positive news spun about them, and for YouTubers and other influencers to paint them in a positive light.</p>
<p>Some of their partners even go so far to paint other VPNs not affiliated with them poorly.</p>
<h2>Dangerous VPN Claims</h2>
<p><i>False representations of threat modeling can cost lives</i></p>
<p>While a small technical hiccup or mistake can be an issue, outright lying about the threat model a VPN can secure can be dangerous.</p>
<p>In fact, the misrepresentation of what a VPN can do can be outright deadly.</p>
<p>We serve our users across all regions. However, the geopolitics involved can be rather dicey. We often get requests from activists, protestors, and NGOs in countries where information is severely restricted and accessing said information could lead to imprisonment or even death.</p>
<p>While some users just want to expand their digital libraries or keep their habits secret – many of our users are trying to fight for a better tomorrow in their country. They are trying to fight for the rights of their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>They may not however have the technical know-how to properly defend themselves. While we can all point to marketing hype and say “Well, they should know!” you have to consider the fact that information for them may be hard to come by or discern.</p>
<p>Which is why we think it is very important to not misrepresent what a VPN can do. Even at the cost of losing customers.</p>
<h2>Secret VPN Logging</h2>
<p><i>"Zero logs VPN, no Logs VPN!" until caught</i></p>
<p>Many VPNs tout a robust no-logs approach to their userbase. Typically, as a sales tactic to ensure that people sign up. Yet we have discovered over the years that while they say one thing – it comes to light they were actually tracking users after all.</p>
<p>There are some less extreme examples of this such as tracking on websites for business reasons.</p>
<p>Here at Windscribe, we have zero user-tracking for marketing purposes and a <a href="https://windscribe.com/privacy">strict no-log policy</a>. But, many of our competitors have a lot of tracking and ways to fingerprint users on their website to help their ad campaigns sell more VPN licenses.</p>
<p>However, the worst case situation is that they lie about not tracking users and then they get hit with a LEO request they bow down to. That they did actually track that user all along and provide user logs and user information to the authorities. Just to avoid the hassle of being taken to court.</p>
<p>Here at Windscribe we take transparency to be a very important point of trust. Which is why we highly recommend you pay attention to our <a href="https://windscribe.com/transparency">Transparency Report</a>.</p>
<p>We hold user privacy and security to that same high standard. Our server locations all operate with RAM-only diskless setups. So that even if we are served a judgment, they raid our offices and confiscate servers, they cannot recover anything. In fact, despite a few years ago our servers running an older industry standard – when raided by the authorities they found absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>We even disclosed a vulnerability that could have been used which has long since been fixed that other VPNs can still fall prey to. Because once again transparency is important to us. While we are lucky that it was never attempted with us even though we have warned other VPNs of this issue many have chosen to ignore us, as fixing it would be costly and require a significant overhaul of their systems.
</p>
<p>Which as you’re aware from reading this page you’ve learned that many more companies prefer profit over performance.</p>
<h2>Lack of Independent VPNs</h2>
<p><i>The rapidly decreasing pool of non-corporate VPNs</i></p>
<p>We’d like to end this by giving a stark warning. To the right of the map you will see a small pool of VPNs with a little green circle.</p>
<p>That denotes that they are independent of corporate owners. That they alone hold the keys to their systems, that they determine their growth, and the direction they head.</p>
<p>Each year corporate VPN owners buy more media companies, buy more VPNs, and attempt to strangle newcomers to the scene.</p>
<p>While untested and unknown VPNs can be a danger themselves...There are only a handful of surviving independents that can be trusted with your data.</p>
<p>We hope that others will be as stalwart as us. Refusing offers of buyout, refusing to sell to the highest bidder, but ultimately this may not be the case.</p>
<p>So keep your eye on the map, keep yourself educated, and support the VPNs that suit you best.</p>
<p>Because these powerful corporately owned VPNs are doing their utmost to hobble everyone else just so they can control the VPN space and ultimately – you.</p>

Our team is distributed around the world, far beyond the bounds of a single laptop.

We started by outlining the key challenges we needed to address: a growing number of features that can impact performance, difficulty operating testing hardware, and a dearth of accurate performance metrics. Through that lens, we came up with a few requirements.</p><p>First, we wanted a system that could test every proposed code change in our main monorepo so we could spot performance regressions across all product features early in the development cycle. This would allow us to approach performance proactively, instead of reactively fixing bugs that users report after a feature goes live. Proactive performance is something that’s core to our work at Figma, and that we embody in many other areas of our engineering work. We know that many of our users spend hours a day in Figma; even a small lag can cause major hiccups in their workflows.</p><div><p>Running many tests in parallel (also called <strong>parallel runs</strong>) is a common way to reduce the time spent waiting for the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Continuous Integration (CI)</a> to complete. At Figma, we already use parallelization on cloud-hosted CI runners for every other type of&nbsp;testing.</p><p>Running performance tests on real hardware for every pull request would require around 100 identical runners at&nbsp;peak.</p></div><p>Next, the system had to run fast. We decided that any performance guardrail check would need to finish in under 10 minutes—anything beyond that would get in the way of the fast-paced development that’s so central to our engineering culture. To achieve this goal, we’d have to embrace <strong>parallel runs</strong>, requiring us to simultaneously run dozens of performance stress scenarios.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/004a5da1938be4f29d572a5d186529e0c820d4ae-1608x904.png?rect=1,0,1607,904&amp;w=528&amp;h=297&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/004a5da1938be4f29d572a5d186529e0c820d4ae-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 264w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/004a5da1938be4f29d572a5d186529e0c820d4ae-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 396w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/004a5da1938be4f29d572a5d186529e0c820d4ae-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 528w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/004a5da1938be4f29d572a5d186529e0c820d4ae-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 792w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/004a5da1938be4f29d572a5d186529e0c820d4ae-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1056w" loading="lazy" alt="A FigJam file with tons of colorful sticky notes" width="528" height="297"></p></div><figcaption>One of the early stress tests we created in FigJam</figcaption></figure><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/1755c4da8ed0ba3889059625647a30ac2c5c5658-1608x904.png?rect=1,0,1607,904&amp;w=528&amp;h=297&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/1755c4da8ed0ba3889059625647a30ac2c5c5658-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 264w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/1755c4da8ed0ba3889059625647a30ac2c5c5658-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 396w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/1755c4da8ed0ba3889059625647a30ac2c5c5658-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 528w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/1755c4da8ed0ba3889059625647a30ac2c5c5658-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 792w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/1755c4da8ed0ba3889059625647a30ac2c5c5658-1608x904.png?w=528&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1056w" loading="lazy" alt="A Figma file with tons of comment pins" width="528" height="297"></p></div><figcaption>A stress test with 5,000 comment pins</figcaption></figure></div><p>Lastly, we needed a way to discuss and compare performance. We wanted the ability to reveal the most subtle changes in performance on real hardware, collect CPU profiles, and share links to all this data to drive decisions and continue improving the model moving&nbsp;forward.</p><p>These requirements might sound straightforward, but fine-tuning performance for Figma can be nuanced. Figma’s foundation on the web, combined with the way people use Figma—with tons of distributed collaborators—can make for a uniquely tricky environment. We often contend with massive client data sets, dozens of screens at a time, and constant rendering. Many of our performance challenges more closely resemble those in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-draws-inspiration-from-the-gaming-world/">gaming world</a> than ones you might encounter in typical applications.</p><h2 id="embracing-performance-work-in-a-remote-first-world"><a href="#embracing-performance-work-in-a-remote-first-world">Embracing performance work in a remote-first world</a></h2><p>With these goals in mind, we turned our attention to the <em>how</em>. Initially, it was just the core working group, which is typical of engineering projects at Figma. While many other folks helped guide, review, and approve our work at different intervals, as a rule, we always try to keep the working group as lean as possible so we can move quickly. After taking a realistic look at what we could deliver in the first six months of work, our strategy was to get to the big, impactful wins quickly, while also planning to build a system that could sustain long-term growth.</p><p>We thought about how to scale the single MacBook and considered building a device farm with many identical laptops running tests on every commit. As we considered what it would take to execute that, we realized that it would be expensive, in terms of both hardware and maintenance. Running a device farm is incredibly challenging with a small team: Not only do you need to ensure every test laptop is nurtured with the right cooling, network bandwidth, and system updates, but you also need to replace hardware as older laptops start to degrade. Even if we ran all tests on virtual machines, we’d still need seemingly endless engineering resources to tame the performance variance.</p><div><p>Counting <strong>CPU instructions</strong> is great for tracking performance of a traditional algorithm but, in practice, other hardware can become a&nbsp;bottleneck.</p><p>Figma is a graphics-heavy application with a lot of work split between CPU and GPU. The speed of moving data between CPU, GPU, and main memory can slow things down, too (commonly called <strong>“I/O” for “input and output” </strong>speeds).</p></div><p>In talking to internal experts and doing our own research, we learned that some performance testing <strong>counts CPU instructions</strong> executed by the program to deterministically detect regressions, but found challenges with this approach, too. For one, our application is a combination of WASM/WebGL and HTML/JS/CSS code running in a variety of browsers with their own interpreters and just-in-time optimizers. Furthermore, Figma’s editor was not always constrained by CPU—sometimes it would be GPU, and rarely <strong>I/O</strong>.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/c7e3f545b7e026ce88965427504b8dccc6e7cc0c-3217x1811.png?rect=2,0,3214,1811&amp;w=804&amp;h=453&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/c7e3f545b7e026ce88965427504b8dccc6e7cc0c-3217x1811.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 402w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/c7e3f545b7e026ce88965427504b8dccc6e7cc0c-3217x1811.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 603w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/c7e3f545b7e026ce88965427504b8dccc6e7cc0c-3217x1811.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 804w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/c7e3f545b7e026ce88965427504b8dccc6e7cc0c-3217x1811.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1206w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/c7e3f545b7e026ce88965427504b8dccc6e7cc0c-3217x1811.png?w=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1608w" loading="lazy" alt="A cloud at the top and a row of computers at the bottom, both connected by unifying system in the middle." width="804" height="453"></p></div><figcaption>We shipped a cloud-based system and a hardware system, both connected by the same CI system.</figcaption></figure></div><p>After considering a few different approaches, we ultimately decided to ship two systems: A cloud-based system would handle mass testing, covering our bases for the majority of situations, and a hardware system would be highly targeted, tackling situations that required more precision. They would be connected by the same CI system, and engineers across product teams would run the same suite of performance test scenarios across&nbsp;them.</p><h3 id="_1-cloud-based-system"><a href="#_1-cloud-based-system">(1) Cloud-based system</a></h3><div><p>There are many ways to mitigate some noise aspects of VMs, like dedicated hosts or RAM disks, <a href="https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/keeping-sync-fast-with-automated-performance-regression-detectio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">like Dropbox did</a>.</p></div><p>The first system runs in GPU-enabled virtual machines, in a headless Chromium process on every code change in every pull request. Virtual machines (VMs) can be tricky for testing performance due to the noise levels of virtualized hardware, loud neighbors on the same underlying host, and inconsistencies in measurement, which all pose problems for accurately timing complex applications. These factors can add a good amount of variance to performance, so we set a 20% pass margin to skip the noise and catch the most egregious and obvious regressions. We decided to only rely on the VM-based system for spotting really large regressions (e.g. a rendering algorithm accidentally turning from <em>O(n)</em> into <em>O(n^2))</em>. Running in VMs also allowed us to run many tests in parallel to hit the 10 minute feedback&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>While building out this system, we had to make a design decision about whether to test components separately (we already had a practice of compiling the C++ editor into a stand-alone binary for tests) or together, end-to-end, in the browser (we already do this for integration testing). We opted for the latter—full in-browser testing with a real GPU. This approach allowed us to capture complex issues involving WebGL rendering, CSS affecting browser layout algorithms, and even accidental misuses of&nbsp;React&nbsp;hooks.</p><div><p>In the future, we could go as far as testing with production backend services, but that requires a lot more engineering investment. <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2016/08/31/web/browserlab-automated-regression-detection-for-the-web/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Meta illustrates</a> the complexities of catching issues end-to-end beyond the&nbsp;browser.</p></div><h3 id="_2-hardware-system"><a href="#_2-hardware-system">(2) Hardware system</a></h3><p>The second system runs on a small array of test laptops that includes older machines, or those that don’t have the latest hardware (think: older MacBooks, outdated Windows laptops, Chromebooks) and allows our developers to schedule custom runs of any test scenario through the same scheduling system in CI.

There are unique challenges that come along with this, and we’re constantly exploring new ways to improve performance and rendering speed—especially on slower devices that might not have the most powerful graphics card&nbsp;or&nbsp;CPU.</p><p>We recently developed stress test scenarios for rendering complex scenes—like thousands of layers edited by 50 multiplayer users—and took a very deep dive into CPU and GPU profiles. There were some techniques that worked well for some hardware configurations, but added too much overhead on others; based on these investigations, we identified which rendering sub-systems to focus on. After all, there is a wide variety of combinations of different CPUs, GPUs, drivers, operating systems, and even browser behaviors that can affect performance.</p><p>We needed to validate every optimization idea as quickly as possible: Is it actually as impactful as we think? Are there any unintended consequences that bring performance down in older or less performant devices? Validating our ideas with runs on real hardware was the key to prioritizing time-consuming engineering work. In benchmarking low-fidelity prototypes, we learned that many ideas that we initially thought were great candidates turned out to be less impactful—or even harmful—on older computers.</p><p>After a few rounds of quick experimentation, we turned our attention to time-slicing of rendering, which showed promising results. With Figma’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">multiplayer technology</a>, in which multiple people can edit a file at once, Figma’s rendering engine has to quickly respond to remote and local edits alike. To do that, the new algorithm prioritizes local edits and operations over rendering changes produced by other users—just like how modern computers allocate computing time among applications. While this approach remained almost unnoticeable on the latest machines, slower devices saw an improvement on perceived frame&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Throughout our development process, we constantly benchmarked the optimized code path against the baseline and the original prototype. We wanted to make sure that we maintained the desired increase in FPS and some custom metrics we introduced specifically for this project as we iterated on implementation and fine-tuned UX trade-offs. With our team split across New York and San Francisco, it was crucial to have convenient access to test machines, track progress through periodic benchmarks, and support our intuition with experimental data.</p></div><div><h3 id="speeding-up-figjam"><a href="#speeding-up-figjam">Speeding up FigJam</a></h3><p><em>Sean Marney, Software Engineer,&nbsp;Figma</em></p><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c9ff903954900c0c3f2d31af3f107c05aba2084-3265x1399.png?rect=0,1,3265,1398&amp;w=1632&amp;h=699&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c9ff903954900c0c3f2d31af3f107c05aba2084-3265x1399.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 816w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c9ff903954900c0c3f2d31af3f107c05aba2084-3265x1399.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 1224w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c9ff903954900c0c3f2d31af3f107c05aba2084-3265x1399.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 1632w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c9ff903954900c0c3f2d31af3f107c05aba2084-3265x1399.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 2448w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/5c9ff903954900c0c3f2d31af3f107c05aba2084-3265x1399.png?w=1632&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 3264w" loading="lazy" alt="" width="1632" height="699"></p></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Since sharing our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-faster/">approach to performance</a> in 2018, we’ve gone through some big changes, including launching another product: FigJam. Figma’s existing rendering and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-draws-inspiration-from-the-gaming-world/#engineers-as-digital-world-builders">multiplayer interaction systems</a> provided a solid foundation for launch; now that FigJam has been out in the world for over two years, we can see that the optimizations we originally created for Figma aren’t quite optimized for FigJam. For example, users are more likely to quickly add tons of sticky notes and recluster them in FigJam, compared to iterating on designs within a few frames in Figma. As we continued optimizing the system for Figma and FigJam, we had to be careful not to create an optimization that only worked for one part of the product: An optimization benefiting a solo designer creating a complex mockup in Figma may not be helpful for hundreds of people participating in a quick whiteboard session in&nbsp;FigJam.</p><p>As we iterated on FigJam in the early days, we’d fix issues reactively, in response to customer reports or changes in production metrics. But we knew there was a better way. With the help of our new testing framework, we wrote tests covering the majority of essential user flows, and automatically found issues before they hit production—most often before they were even merged into the codebase. During the initial setup, we encountered some headaches (no one likes new, flaky tests), but ultimately the tests proved extremely valuable for preventing regressions from completely innocent-seeming code.</p><p>For example: Did you know that <code>background-filter: blur(0)</code> can fix a variety of Safari rendering bugs but <a href="https://twitter.com/finerflame/status/1636163183898673152?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">can also subtly affect its layer compositing speed</a>? I didn’t, nor did the developer who tried to update our sticky page curl animation’s CSS to make it more realistic and more clearly a sticky note. In fact, I’d go so far as to say that pretty much no one should need to&nbsp;know&nbsp;that.</p><div><figure><div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/d38808e911b1b25d3958adfca87387eeae2d3d21-1512x946.png?rect=1,0,1511,946&amp;w=1080&amp;h=676&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/d38808e911b1b25d3958adfca87387eeae2d3d21-1512x946.png?w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 540w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/d38808e911b1b25d3958adfca87387eeae2d3d21-1512x946.png?w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 810w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/d38808e911b1b25d3958adfca87387eeae2d3d21-1512x946.png?w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format 1080w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/localized/d38808e911b1b25d3958adfca87387eeae2d3d21-1512x946.png?w=1080&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1511w" loading="lazy" alt="" width="1080" height="676"></p></div><figcaption>A "GPU layers" mode in Safari that we used used to fix a bug that had to do with a CSS animation of the sticky note corner curl</figcaption></figure></div><p>We don’t usually go looking for CSS changes when we find performance degradations, but thanks to our suite of automated tests, we were able to find this bug while it was still ingesting on our staging platform and make a fix before it ever impacted users. The tests run often enough, on the HEAD of our codebase, that we could see a significant spike in frame lengths for core user behaviors. As a result, we were able to identify the exact code change that caused the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Other times, performance issues may make it further in the process before they’re caught. For example, if a test is temporarily disabled, we won’t get an automated alert about it. Luckily, we can run these tests on older commits, using real hardware in the remotely accessible lab. That means that even these issues can be sussed out, using <code>git bisect</code> to narrow down the commits until we get to a single culprit! At one point, we had an optimization that a…certain engineer wrote...with my initials. While the optimization was great for the 50th percentile of frame rate, it had issues in the 90th percentile, only on specific machines. This meant that while our default system couldn’t catch it, a manual run of a few tests would spot the issue within 10 or so runs of&nbsp;the&nbsp;tests.</p><h2 id="the-work-ahead"><a href="#the-work-ahead">The work ahead</a></h2><p>Performance is a tricky area. Things you expect to be the bottleneck often aren’t. And things you’d never suspect of causing a performance issue can take you by surprise. That’s why it’s so important to establish testing and benchmarking frameworks. We’re now at the point where no one person knows the nuances of all our products and features—and we can’t expect them to! Still, our work impacts our teammates’ work, and vice versa. More than anything, we need to focus on systematically addressing these concerns—it’s essential to maintaining development velocity.</p><p>We’ve come a long way since that single MacBook. Since these improvements went live, we’ve focused on empowering domain experts to drive performance-improving initiatives and putting checks in place to ensure it does not regress over time. With the arrival of remote on-demand test runs, detailed reporting, and carefully picked metrics, we can collaborate on performance-sensitive code across teams and time zones. Plus, we can expand on our existing foundation, rather than reinventing the&nbsp;wheel.</p><p>If this project sounds interesting, <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">check out our open roles</a>—we’re hiring!</p></div></div></div><div><form novalidate=""><div><h2>Subscribe for a Shortcut to fresh news and fun surprises</h2><div><p><label><p>I agree to opt-in to Figma's mailing list.</p></label></p></div></div></form></div><section><header><h2>Related articles</h2></header></section><p><section><h2>Create and collaborate with Figma</h2><a href="https://www.figma.com/signup?locale=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Get started for free</a></section></p></section></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The amount you have to pay in weight-based motor vehicle tax depends on the weight, the number of axles and the suspension system. Therefore, the weight-based vehicle tax may vary considerably depending on the vehicle. Diesel vehicles must in addition pay an environmentally differentiated tax.</p>

    <h2>Challenge Accepted: High-speed AI Drone Overtakes World-Champion Drone Racers</h2>
        <p>In a milestone for artificial intelligence (AI), the AI system “Swift”, designed by UZH researchers, has beaten the world champions in drone racing – a result that seemed unattainable just a few years ago. The AI-piloted drone was trained in a simulated environment. Real-world applications include environmental monitoring or disaster response.</p>

         <p>Remember when IBM’s Deep Blue won against Gary Kasparov at chess in 1996, or Google’s AlphaGo crushed the top champion Lee Sedol at Go, a much more complex game, in 2016? These competitions where machines prevailed over human champions are key milestones in the history of artificial intelligence. Now a group of researchers from the University of Zurich and Intel has set a new milestone with the first autonomous system capable of beating human champions at a physical sport: drone racing.</p>

<p>The AI system, called Swift, won multiple races against three world-class champions in first-person view (FPV) drone racing, where pilots fly quadcopters at speeds exceeding 100 km/h, controlling them remotely while wearing a headset linked to an onboard camera.</p>

         <h3>Learning by interacting with the physical world</h3>

<p>“Physical sports are more challenging for AI because they are less predictable than board or video games. We don’t have a perfect knowledge of the drone and environment models, so the AI needs to learn them by interacting with the physical world,” says Davide Scaramuzza, head of the Robotics and Perception Group at the University of Zurich – and newly minted drone racing team captain.</p>

<p>Until very recently, autonomous drones took twice as long as those piloted by humans to fly through a racetrack, unless they relied on an external position-tracking system to precisely control their trajectories. Swift, however, reacts in real time to the data collected by an onboard camera, like the one used by human racers. Its integrated inertial measurement unit measures acceleration and speed while an artificial neural network uses data from the camera to localize the drone in space and detect the gates along the racetrack. This information is fed to a control unit, also based on a deep neural network that chooses the best action to finish the circuit as fast as possible.</p>

         <h3>Training in an optimised simulation environment</h3>

<p>Swift was trained in a simulated environment where it taught itself to fly by trial and error, using a type of machine learning called reinforcement learning. The use of simulation helped avoid destroying multiple drones in the early stages of learning when the system often crashes. “To make sure that the consequences of actions in the simulator were as close as possible to the ones in the real world, we designed a method to optimize the simulator with real data,” says Elia Kaufmann, first author of the paper. In this phase, the drone flew autonomously thanks to very precise positions provided by an external position-tracking system, while also recording data from its camera. This way it learned to autocorrect errors it made interpreting data from the onboard sensors.</p>

<div>
         <h3>Human pilots still adapt better to changing conditions</h3>

<p>After a month of simulated flight time, which corresponds to less than an hour on a desktop PC, Swift was ready to challenge its human competitors: the 2019 Drone Racing League champion Alex Vanover, the 2019 MultiGP Drone Racing champion Thomas Bitmatta, and three-times Swiss champion Marvin Schaepper. The races took place between 5 and 13 June 2022, on a purpose-built track in a hangar of the Dübendorf Airport, near Zurich. The track covered an area of 25 by 25 meters, with seven square gates that had to be passed in the right order to complete a lap, including challenging maneuvers including a Split-S, an acrobatic feature that involves half-rolling the drone and executing a descending half-loop at full speed.</p>

<p>Overall, Swift achieved the fastest lap, with a half-second lead over the best lap by a human pilot. On the other hand, human pilots proved more adaptable than the autonomous drone, which failed when the conditions were different from what it was trained for, e.g., if there was too much light in the room.</p>

<p>Pushing the envelope in autonomous flight is important way beyond drone racing, Scaramuzza notes. “Drones have a limited battery capacity; they need most of their energy just to stay airborne. Thus, by flying faster we increase their utility.” In applications such as forest monitoring or space exploration, for example, flying fast is important to cover large spaces in a limited time. In the film industry, fast autonomous drones could be used for shooting action scenes. And the ability to fly at high speeds could make a huge difference for rescue drones sent inside a building on fire.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>


 
Allow me to introduce you to one of the largest population groups in India,
as recognized by the constitution of India: Other Backward Classes 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_Backward_Class">OBC Category</a>). 
OBCs are estimated to comprise 40-45% of India's population, therefore, about
500 million people belong to OBC category. 
In other words, 1 in 16 people in the world belongs to the OBC category. As you might have already guessed,
OBCs have historically been socio-economically disadvantaged. The wiki page is a good start. 
</p><p>


The purpose of this post is three-fold: (1) re-claim my identity in its entirety, 
(2) inform the broader public, and (3) reach out to someone searching for an OBC who
"made" it in academia.</p><p>

 It is, perhaps, appropriate to address the elephant in the room:
 <b>I belong to OBC Category</b>. 
 Phew, this was not as hard as I anticipated. 
Typically, one's surname (last name) is a giveaway and most Indians can reasonably identify someone's
caste based on the last name. Fortunately, my last name is rather uncommon and in such 
scenarios one often gets benefit of the doubt, and therefore, very few people have been aware of 
my caste.
 I had begun to mention references to my caste in Facebook/Twitter threads in the past two years. I was, however, not ready
 to publicly declare it <b> until I received tenure</b> as it seemed too risky. </p><p>

 An uninitiated might be forgiven for not realizing that caste-based discrimination is rampant in India
 (yes, even among faculty members  at <a href="https://kafila.online/2019/04/10/the-saderla-story-courage-in-the-face-of-violent-prejudice-manindra-agrawal/">
   IITs</a>), and perhaps worse among Non-Resident Indians (NRIs). 
 Therefore, there was always fear of what would a potential letter writer or 
 someone on tenure evaluation committee think of me if they knew I belonged to OBC.
 It was the same fear that stopped me from mentioning anything about my caste in any of DEI statements that I prepared for the job search or tenure: I had to pretend not to know what it feels to be under-represented. 
</p><p>

As a professor at a  public university, I feel I ought to inform  broader public about the lack of representation of OBCs. I think I can summarize the lack of representation 
with the help of <b> a claim that I believe is true: There are at most five tenure-track faculty who belong to OBC category 
among all the faculty members in North America's "top" 50 CS departments. </b> 
Any reasonable process to pick 50 CS departments should suffice. 
I will, of course, be overjoyed to be corrected. 
</p><p>

You might ask: What evidence do I have to support my claim? 
</p><p>

 To this end, in early 2023, I sought to determine the distribution of CS faculty according to their castes at the five of the most pretigious Indian Institute of Technology (IITs). I relied on Right to Information (RTI) queries to individual IITs to gather data. The result are either shocking or not surprising, depending on how much one knows about the caste system. Well, without further adieu, here are the responses from each of the IITs:



</p></div><ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/attachments/caste/iitb-status.pdf">IIT Bombay </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/attachments/caste/iitd-status.pdf">IIT Delhi </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/attachments/caste/iitk-status.pdf">IIT Kanpur </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/attachments/caste/iitm-status.pdf">IIT Madras </a> </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/attachments/caste/iitkgp-status.pdf">IIT Kharagpur</a>  </li>
</ul><p>

Here is the summary: <b>There is exactly one out of 180 CS faculty members across five
  IITs who belongs to OBC category.</b></p><p>

While the past and present draw a bleak picture concerning the representations of OBCs,
I remain wishful about the future, but there is work to be done. One of the reasons 
I wanted to write this post was because I remember craving a role model belonging to
the OBC category. Therefore, if an OBC person is contemplating a Ph.D. or faculty position, I want them to know: Yes, "we" can succeed. Please reach out to me if I can help, and let me assure you I would be happier than you if I were to hear from you. <b>It's been a lonely road for far too long. </b>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>The first thing ever searched on Google was the name Gerhard Casper, a former Stanford president. As <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/04/30/get-rich-u">the story goes</a>, in 1998, Larry Page and Sergey Brin demoed Google for computer scientist John Hennessy. They searched Casper’s name on both AltaVista and Google. The former pulled up results for Casper the Friendly Ghost; the latter pulled up information on Gerhard Casper the person.</p><p>What made Google’s results different from AltaVista’s was its algorithm, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2005/08/battelle/">PageRank</a>, which organized results based on the amount of links between pages. In fact, the site’s original name, BackRub, was a reference to the backlinks it was using to rank results. If your site was linked to by other authoritative sites, it would place higher in the list than some random blog that no one was citing.</p><p>Google officially went online later in 1998. It quickly became so inseparable from both the way we use the internet and, eventually, culture itself, that we almost lack the language to describe what Google’s impact over the last 25 years has actually been. It’s like asking a fish to explain what the ocean is. And yet, all around us are signs that the era of “peak Google” is ending or, possibly, already over.&nbsp;</p><div><p>This year, <em>The Verge </em>is exploring how Google Search has reshaped the web into a place for robots —&nbsp;and how the emergence of AI threatens Google itself.</p></div><p>There is a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35861915">growing</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/mar/11/users-advertisers-we-are-all-trapped-in-the-enshittification-of-the-internet">chorus</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23711172/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-pages-search-publishers-lawsuit">complaints</a> that Google is not as accurate, as competent, as dedicated to search as it once was. The rise of massive closed algorithmic social networks like Meta’s Facebook and Instagram began eating the web in the 2010s. More recently, there’s been a shift to entertainment-based video feeds like TikTok — which is now being used as a primary search engine by a new generation of internet users.&nbsp;</p><p>For two decades, Google Search was the largely invisible force that determined the ebb and flow of online content. Now, for the first time since Google’s launch, a world without it at the center actually seems possible. We’re clearly at the end of one era and at the threshold of another. But to understand where we’re headed, we have to look back at how it all started.</p><p>If you’re looking for the moment Google truly crossed over into the zeitgeist, it was likely around 2001. In February 2000, Jennifer Lopez wore her iconic green Versace dress to the Grammys, which former Google CEO Eric Schmidt <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-49780020">would later say</a> searches for inspired how Google Image Search functioned when it launched in summer 2001. That year was also the moment when users began to realize that Google was important enough to hijack.&nbsp;</p><p>The term “Google bombing” was first coined by Adam Mathes, now a product manager at Google, who first described the concept in April 2001 while writing for the site Uber.nu. Mathes successfully used the backlinks that fueled PageRank to make the search term “talentless hack” bring up his friend’s website. Mathes did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>A humor site called Hugedisk.com, however, successfully pulled it off first in January 2001. A writer for the site, interviewed under the pseudonym Michael Hugedisk, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/01/remembering-the-first-google-bomb/">told <em>Wired</em></a> in 2007 that their three-person team linked to a webpage selling pro-George W. Bush merchandise and was able to make it the top result on Google if you searched “dumb motherfucker.”</p><p>“One of the other guys who ran the site got a cease and desist letter from the bombed George Bush site’s lawyers. We chickened out and pulled down the link, but we got a lot of press,” Hugedisk recounted.</p><p>“It’s difficult to see which factors contribute to this result, though. It has to do with Google’s ranking algorithm,” a Google spokesperson <a href="https://www.wired.com/2001/01/google-link-is-bush-league/">said of the stunt</a> at the time, calling the search results “an anomaly.”</p><p>But it wasn’t an anomaly. In fact, there’s a way of viewing the company’s 25-year history as an ongoing battle against users who want to manipulate what PageRank surfaces.</p><p>“[Google bombing] was a popular thing — get your political enemy and some curse words and then merge them in the top Google Image resolve and sometimes it works,” blogger Philipp Lenssen told <em>The Verge</em>. “Mostly for the laughs or giggles.”</p><div><p>There’s a way of viewing the company’s 25-year history as an ongoing battle against users who want to manipulate what PageRank surfaces</p></div><p>Lenssen still remembers the first time he started to get a surge of page views from Google. He had been running a gaming site called <a href="https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/">Games for the Brain</a> for around three years without much fanfare. “It was just not doing anything,” he told <em>The Verge</em>. “And then, suddenly, it was a super popular website.”</p><p>It can be hard to remember how mysterious these early run-ins with Google traffic were. It came as a genuine surprise to Lenssen when he figured out that “brain games” had become a huge search term on Google. (Even now, in 2023, Lenssen’s site is still the first non-sponsored Google result for “brain games.”)</p><p>“Google kept sending me people all day long from organic search results,” he said. “It became my main source of income.”</p><p>Rather than brain games, however, Lenssen is probably best known for a blog he ran from 2003 to 2011 called Google Blogoscoped. He was, for a long time, one of the main chroniclers of everything Google. And he remembers the switch from other search engines to Google in the late 1990s. It was passed around by word of mouth as a better alternative to AltaVista, which wasn’t the biggest search engine of the era but was considered the best one yet.</p><p>In 2023, search optimization is a matter of sheer self-interest, a necessity of life in a Google-dominated world. The URLs of new articles are loaded with keywords. YouTube video titles, too — not too many, of course, because an overly long title gets cut off. Shop listings by vendors sprawl into wordy repetition, like side sign spinners reimagined as content sludge. And it goes beyond just Google’s domain. Solid blocks of blue hashtags and account tags trail at the end of influencer Instagram posts. Even teenagers tag their TikToks with #fyp — a hashtag thought to make it more likely for videos to be gently bumped into the algorithmic feeds of strangers.&nbsp;</p><p>The word SEO “kind of sounds like spam when you say it today,” said Lenssen, in a slightly affected voice. “But that was not how it started.”&nbsp;</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/376x251/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/384x256/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/415x277/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/480x320/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/540x360/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/640x427/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/750x500/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/828x552/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/1080x720/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/1200x800/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/1440x960/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/1920x1280/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/2048x1365/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/2400x1600/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2000/2400x1600/filters:focal(1500x1000:1501x1001):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874223/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_002.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>To use the language of today, Lenssen and his cohort of bloggers were the earliest content creators. Their tastes and sensibilities would inflect much of digital media today, from <em>Wordle</em> to food Instagram. It might seem unfathomable now, but unlike the creators of 2023, the bloggers of the early 2000s weren’t in a low-grade war with algorithms. By optimizing for PageRank, they were helping Google by making it better. And that was good for everyone because making Google better was good for the internet.</p><p>This attitude is easier to comprehend when you look back at Google’s product launches in these early years —&nbsp;Google Groups, Google Calendar, Google News, Google Answers. The company also acquired Blogger in 2003.&nbsp;</p><p>“Everything was done really intelligently, very clean, very easy to use, and extremely sophisticated,” said technologist Andy Baio, who still blogs at Waxy.org. “And I think that Google Reader was probably the best, like one of the best, shining examples of that.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Everybody I knew was living off Google Reader,” recalled Scott Beale of Laughing Squid.</p><p>Google Reader was created by engineer Chris Wetherell in 2005. It allowed users to take the RSS feeds — an open protocol for organizing a website’s content and updates — and add those feeds into a singular reader. If Google Search was the spinal cord of 2000s internet culture, Google Reader was the central nervous system.&nbsp;</p><p>“They were encouraging people to write on the web,” said<strong> </strong>Baio. Bloggers like Lenssen, Baio, and Beale felt like everything Google was doing was in service of making the internet better. The tools it kept launching felt tied to a mission of collecting the world’s information and helping people add more content to the web.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Lenssen said he now sees SEO as more or less part of the same nefarious tradition as Google bombing</p></div><p>Many of these bloggers feel differently now. Lenssen said he now sees SEO as more or less part of the same nefarious tradition as Google bombing. “You want a certain opinion to be in the number one spot, not as a meme but to influence people,” he said. Most of the other bloggers expressed a similar change of heart in interviews for this piece.</p><p>“When Google came along, they were ad-free with actually relevant results in a minimalistic kind of design,” Lenssen said. “If we fast-forward to now, it’s kind of inverted now. The results are kind of spammy and keyword-built and SEO stuff. And so it might be hard to understand for people looking at Google now how useful it was back then.”</p><p>But there is one notable holdout among these early web pioneers: Danny Sullivan, who, during this period, became the world’s de facto expert on all things search. (Which, after the dawn of the millennium, increasingly just became Google Search.) Sullivan’s expertise gives his opinion some weight, though there is one teeny little wrinkle — since 2017, he’s been an employee of Google, working as the company’s official search liaison. Which means even if he doesn’t think they are, his opinions about search now have to be in line with Google’s opinions about search.</p><p>According to Sullivan, the pattern of optimizing for search predates Google —&nbsp; it wasn’t the first search engine, after all. As early as 1997, people were creating “doorway pages” — pages full of keywords meant to trick web crawlers into overindexing a site.&nbsp;</p><p>More crucially, Sullivan sees Google Search not as a driver of virality but as a mere echo.</p><p>“I just can’t think of something that I did as a Google search that caused everybody else to do the same Google search,” Sullivan said. “I can see that something’s become a meme in some way. And sometimes, it could even be a meme on Google Search, like, you know, the Doodles we do. People will say, ‘Now you got to go search for this; you’ve got to go see it or whatever.’ But search itself doesn’t tend to cause the virality.”&nbsp;</p><p>Those hundreds of millions of websites jockeying for placement on the first page of results don’t influence how culture works, as Sullivan sees it. For him, Google Search activity does not create more search activity. Decades may have passed, but people are essentially still searching for “Jennifer Lopez dress.” Culture motivates what goes into the search box, and it’s a one-way street.&nbsp;</p><p>But causality is both hard to prove and disprove. The same set of facts that leads Sullivan to discount the effect of Google on culture can just as readily point to the opposite conclusion.</p><div><p>That same month, what is largely considered to be the first real internet meme, “All Your Base Are Belong To Us,” was launched into the mainstream</p></div><p>In February 2001, right after Hugedisk’s Google bomb, Google launched Google Groups, a discussion platform that integrated with the internet’s first real social network, Usenet. And that same month, what is largely considered to be the first real internet meme, “All Your Base Are Belong To Us,” was launched into the mainstream after years of bouncing around as a message board inside joke. It became one of the largest search trends on Google, and an archived <a href="https://archive.google/press/timeline.html">Google Zeitgeist report</a> even lists the infamous mistranslated video game cutscene as one of the top searches in February 2001.&nbsp;</p><p>Per Sullivan’s logic, Google Groups added better discovery to both Usenet and the myriad other message boards and online communities creating proto-meme culture at the time. And that discoverability created word-of-mouth interest, which led to search interest. The uptick in searches merely reflected what was happening outside of Google.&nbsp;</p><p>But you can just as easily conclude that Google — in the form of Search and Groups —&nbsp;drove the virality of “All Your Base Are Belong To Us.”&nbsp;</p><p>“All Your Base Are Belong To Us” had been floating around message boards as an animated GIF as early as 1998. But after Google went live, it began mutating the way modern memes do. A fan project <a href="http://www.overclocked.org/OCzerowing.htm">launched</a> to redub the game, the meme got a page on <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/11940">Newgrounds</a>, and most importantly, the first Photoshops of the meme showed up in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120114133510/http://frogstar.com/content/time-line-all-your-base-are-belong-us">Something Awful thread</a>. (Consider how much harder it would have been, pre-Google, to find the assets for “All Your Base Are Belong To Us” in order to remix them.)&nbsp;</p><p>That back and forth between social and search would create pathways for, and then supercharge, an online network of independent publishers that we now call the blogosphere. Google’s backlink algorithm gave a new level of influence to online curation. The spread of “All Your Base Are Belong To Us” — from message boards, to search, to aggregators and blogs — set the stage for, well, how everything has worked ever since.</p><p>SEO experts like Sullivan might rankle at the idea that Google’s PageRank is a social algorithm, but it’s not <em>not</em> a social mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>We tend to think of “search” and “social” as competing ideas. The history of the internet between the 2000s and the 2010s is often painted as a shift from search engines to social networks. But PageRank does measure online discussion, in a sense —&nbsp;and it also influences how discussion flows. And just like the algorithms that would eventually dominate platforms like Facebook years later, PageRank has a profound effect on how people create content.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex Turvy, a sociologist specializing in digital culture, said it’s hard to map our current understanding of virality and platform optimization to the earliest days of Google, but there are definitely similarities.</p><p>“I think that the celebrity gossip world is a good example,” he said. “Folks that understood backlinks and keywords earlier than others and were able to get low-quality content pretty high on search results pages.”</p><p>He cited examples such as Perez Hilton and the blogs <a href="https://www.crazydaysandnights.net/">Crazy Days and Nights</a> and <a href="https://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/">Oh No They Didn’t!</a> Over the next few years, the web began to fill with aggregators like eBaum’s World, Digg, and CollegeHumor.&nbsp;</p><p>But even the creators of original high-quality content were not immune to the pressures of Google Search.</p><p>Deb Perelman is considered one of the <a href="https://www.culturedmag.com/article/2023/05/17/food-blogger-deb-perelman-smitten-kitchen">earliest food bloggers</a> and is certainly one of the few who’s still at it. She started blogging about food in 2003. Her site, Smitten Kitchen, was launched in 2006 and has since spawned three books. In the beginning, she says, she didn’t really think much about search. But eventually, she, like the other eminent bloggers of the period, took notice.</p><p>“It was definitely something you were aware of — your page ranking — just because it affected whether people could find your stuff through Google,” she said.&nbsp;</p><div><p>It’s hard to find another sector more thoroughly molded by the pressures of SEO than recipe sites</p></div><p>It’s hard to find another sector more thoroughly molded by the pressures of SEO than recipe sites, which, these days, take a near-uniform shape as an extremely long anecdote (often interspersed with ads), culminating in a recipe card that is remarkably terse in comparison. The formatting and style of food bloggers has generated <a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-are-there-long-stories-on-food-blogs">endless discourse</a> for years.&nbsp;</p><p>The reason why food blogs look like that, according to Perelman, is pretty straightforward: the bloggers want to be read on Google.</p><p>That said, she’s adamant that most of the backlash against food bloggers attaching long personal essays to the top of their posts is obnoxious and sexist. People can just not read it if they don’t want to. But she also acknowledged writers are caving to formatting pressures. (There are <a href="https://yoast.com/clear-and-seo-friendly-paragraphs">countless</a> <a href="https://medium.com/illumination/paragraph-length-and-structure-for-seo-d8d503f2a1a6">guides</a> <a href="https://www.searchenginejournal.com/word-count-seo-importance/441742/">instructing</a> that writers use a specific amount of sentences per paragraph and a specific amount of paragraphs per post to rank better on Google.)</p><p>“Rather than writing because there was maybe a story to tell, there was this idea that it was good for SEO,” she said. “And I think that that’s a less quality experience. And yeah, you could directly say I guess that Google has sort of created that in a way.”</p><p>Sullivan says PageRank’s algorithm is a lot simpler than most people assume it is. At the beginning, most of the tips and tricks people were sharing were largely pointless for SEO. The subject of SEO is still rife with superstition. There are a lot of different ideas that people have about exactly how to get a prominent spot on Google’s results, Sullivan acknowledges. But most of the stuff you’ll find by, well, googling “SEO tricks” isn’t very accurate.&nbsp;</p><p>And here is where you get into the circular nature of his argument against Google’s influence. Thousands of food bloggers are searching for advice on how to optimize their blogs for Google. The advice that sits at the top of Google is bad, but they’re using it anyway, and now, their blogs all look the same. Isn’t that, in a sense, Google shaping how content is made?</p><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/376x292/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/384x299/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/415x323/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/480x373/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/540x420/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/640x498/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/750x583/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/828x644/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/1080x840/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/1200x933/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/1440x1120/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/1920x1493/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/2048x1593/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/2400x1866/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:3000x2333/2400x1866/filters:focal(1500x1167:1501x1168):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24874235/236755_When_Google_ruled_the_world_MRohn_003.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p>“All Your Base Are Belong To Us” existed pre-Google but suddenly rose in prominence as the search engine flickered on. Other forms of content began following the same virality curve, rocketing to the top of Google and then into greater pop culture.</p><p>Perelman said that one of the first viral recipes she remembers from that era was a 2006 <em>New York Times</em> tutorial on <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D13Ah9ES2yTU">how to make no-knead bread</a> by Sullivan Street Bakery’s Jim Lahey. “That was a really big moment,” she said.</p><p>True to form, Sullivan doubts that it was search, itself, that made it go viral. “It almost certainly wasn’t hot because search made it hot. Something else made it hot and then everybody went to search for it,” he said.</p><p>(Which may be true. But the video tutorial was also published on YouTube one month after the site was purchased by Google.)</p><p>The viral no-knead bread recipe is a perfect example of how hard it can be to separate the discoverability Google brought to the internet from the influence of that discoverability. And it was even harder 20 years ago, long before we had concepts like “viral” or “influencer.”&nbsp;</p><div><p>Alice Marwick, a communications professor and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Private-Political-Networked-Privacy-Social-ebook/dp/B0C3XNWTL9/?tag=theverge02-20"><em>The Private Is Political: Networked Privacy and Social Media</em></a>, told <em>The Verge</em> that it wasn’t until Myspace launched in 2003 that we started to even develop the idea of internet fame.</p></div><p>“There wasn’t like a pipeline for virality in the way that it is,” she said. “Now, there is a template of, like, weird people doing weird stuff on the internet.”</p><div><p>“Google has gotten shittier and shittier.”</p></div><p>Marwick said that within the internet landscape of the 2000s, Google was the thing that sat on top of everything else. There was a sense that as anarchic and chaotic as the early social web was out in the digital wilderness, what Google surfaced denoted a certain level of quality.&nbsp;</p><p>But if that last 25 years of Google’s history could be boiled down to a battle against the Google bomb, it is now starting to feel that the search engine is finally losing pace with the hijackers. Or as Marwick put it, “Google has gotten shittier and shittier.”</p><p>“To me, it just continues the transformation of the internet into this shitty mall,” Marwick said. “A dead mall that’s just filled with the shady sort of stores you don’t want to go to.”</p><p>The question, of course, is when did it all go wrong? How did a site that captured the imagination of the internet and fundamentally changed the way we communicate turn into a burned-out Walmart at the edge of town?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, if you ask Anil Dash, it was all the way back in 2003 — when the company turned on its AdSense program.</p><p>“Prior to 2003–2004, you could have an open comment box on the internet. And nobody would pretty much type in it unless they wanted to leave a comment. No authentication. Nothing. And the reason why was because who the fuck cares what you comment on there. And then instantly, overnight, what happened?” Dash said. “Every single comment thread on the internet was instantly spammed. And it happened overnight.”</p><p>Dash is one of the web’s earliest bloggers. In 2004, he won a <a href="https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/07/64130">competition</a> Google held to google-bomb itself with the made-up term “nigritude ultramarine.” Since then, Dash has <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2017/11/29/underscores-optimization-arms-races/">written extensively</a> over the years on the impact platform optimization has had on the way the internet works. As he sees it, Google’s advertising tools gave links a monetary value, killing anything organic on the platform. From that moment forward, Google cared more about the health of its own network than the health of the wider internet.&nbsp;</p><p>“At that point it was really clear where the next 20 years were going to go,” he said.</p><div><p>“At that point it was really clear where the next 20 years were going to go.”</p></div><p>Google Answers closed in 2006. Google Reader shut down in 2013, taking with it the last vestiges of the blogosphere. Search inside of Google Groups has <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jp5a77/google-a-search-company-has-made-its-internet-archive-impossible-to-search%5C">repeatedly broken</a> over the years. Blogger still works, but without Google Reader as a hub for aggregating it, most publishers started making native content on platforms like Facebook and Instagram and, more recently, TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>Discoverability of the open web has suffered. Pinterest <a href="https://www.inverse.com/input/culture/pinterest-sucks-google-image-photo-search-ruining-internet">has been accused</a> of eating Google Image Search results. And the recent protests over third-party API access at Reddit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/google-admits-reddit-protests-make-it-harder-to-find-helpful-search-results/">revealed</a> how popular Google has become as a search engine not for Google’s results but for Reddit content. Google’s place in the hierarchy of Big Tech is slipping enough that some are <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/apple-maps-good-now-problem-google-maps/">even admitting</a> that Apple Maps is worth giving another chance, something unthinkable even a few years ago.</p><p>On top of it all, OpenAI’s massively successful ChatGPT has dragged Google into a race against Microsoft to build a completely different kind of search, one that uses a chatbot interface supported by generative AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty-five years ago, at the dawn of a different internet age, another search engine began to struggle with similar issues. It was considered the top of the heap, praised for its sophisticated technology, and then suddenly faced an existential threat. A young company created a new way of finding content.</p><p>Instead of trying to make its core product better, fixing the issues its users had, the company, instead, became more of a portal, weighted down by bloated services that worked less and less well. The company’s CEO admitted in 2002 that it “tried to become a portal too late in the game, and lost focus” and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2002/11/altavista-makeover-a-better-view/">told <em>Wired</em> at the time</a> that it was going to try and double back and focus on search again. But it never regained the lead.</p><p>That company was AltaVista.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="file-hacking-the-lg-monitor-s-edid-md">
    <article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><strong>preface</strong>: Posting these online since it sounds like these notes are somewhat interesting based on a few folks I've shared with. These are semi-rough notes that I basically wrote for myself in case I ever needed to revisit this fix, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p dir="auto">I recently bought an LG ULTRAGEAR monitor secondhand off of a coworker. I really love it and it's been great so far, but I ran into some minor issues with it in Linux. It works great on both Mac and Windows, but on Linux it displays just a black panel until I use the second monitor to go in and reduce the refresh rate down to 60 Hz.</p>
<p dir="auto">This has worked decent so far but there's some issues:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It doesn't work while linux is booting up. The motherboards boot sequence is visible just fine, but as soon as control is handed over to Linux and I'd normally see a splash screen while I'm waiting for my login window, I see nothing.</li>
<li>It doesn't work on the login screen. This would be fine if login consistently worked on my second screen, but I need to manually switch the cables between my work computer and the desktop for the second screen and sometimes I don't feel like doing that. Even when I switch the cables, the second screen seems to be moody and doesn't always show the login screen either.</li>
<li>Once I've logged in and fixed the settings on my second screen it seems to go fine, unless I actually unplug the second screen. If I do, it looks like the graphics settings go reset back to default (settings that don't work) and I lose the main monitor too.</li>
</ul>
<h2 dir="auto">Debugging</h2>
<p dir="auto">Since I was able to fix the issue by manually reducing the refresh rate, my guess is that the issue is really about Linux insisting on defaulting the monitor to a mode that it doesn't support: <code>3440 x 1440 143.923 Hz</code>. I started looking online to do some research and I found a lot of articles and forum posts about how to sync up your logged-in display preferences with your boot sequence preferences &amp; your greeter preferences, but that was mostly around fixing resolution, position, and orientation of monitors and it only worked for specific monitor connections.</p>
<p dir="auto">In my case, it wasn't so much about the positioning of the monitors, the default mode that my monitor seemed to want to be in just didn't seem to work at all. Regardless, I tried the suggestions around creating an xrandr script and having it run when the greeter starts, but it seems that my monitor didn't care and the xrandr script wasn't doing anything at all. I also tried updating my version of Linux Mint and my Linux kernel to the latest versions, neither of those solved the issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since this monitor did work out of the box when hooked up to the Macbook or when I boot this computer into Windows, I knew it was possible for this monitor to work properly.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">EDID</h2>
<p dir="auto">I landed on the arch wiki for xrandr, xorg, and kernel mode setting and started to get the idea that my monitor was possibly reporting the wrong mode to the OS. This eventually lead me to <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/users@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/D2CGPRU4OXMPQ4KKHW5ZYZ2CMELALRCG/" rel="nofollow">this mailing list</a> post which had me start to look closer at the EDID. Running <code>edid-decode /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/drm/card0/card0-DP-2/edid</code> I got this output:</p>

<p dir="auto">I am not an EDID expert by any means (although I'm certainly more than a novice after this whole saga), but most of that looks fine to me. Actually the only place where I saw the mode that Linux Mint was defaulting to was in that last block:</p>
<pre><code>Block 2, DisplayID Extension Block:
    ...
    DTD:  3440x1440  143.923 Hz  64:27  217.323 kHz 799.750 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred)
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">My hypothesis now was that if there was some way for me to change the EDID so that that last block had <code>60 Hz</code> instead of <code>143.923 Hz</code>, that could fix everything.</p>
<p dir="auto">I started by trying to read the specs for EDID and DisplayID. Ultimately these were helpful to have on the side, but actually reading and understanding the details of every byte was beginning to confuse me and was starting to take me too long. I started thinking about a faster way to grok this bytestring when I realized there was a program I just used that was really great at parsing edids: <code>edid-decode</code>.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Edid-Decode</h2>
<p dir="auto">I found the git repo and cloned it locally. Thankfully, the build instructions were super easy, just one <code>make</code> later and I had a development build of <code>parse-edid</code> on disk.</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre>git clone git://linuxtv.org/edid-decode.git
<span>cd</span> edid-decode
make
./edid-decode /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.1/0000:08:00.0/drm/card0/card0-DP-2/edid</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Looking at the output, I wanted to hone in on that <code>DisplayID Extension Block</code> section. I popped the source open in VSCode and started searching around. <code>DisplayID Extension Block</code> shows up as a constant in the <code>block_name</code> function, so looking at usages of that brought me to <code>edid_state::parse_extension</code>. This clearly was a DisplayID block, so I clicked into <code>parse_displayid_block</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">At this point I wanted to orient myself a bit. The function was using things like <code>x[1]</code> and <code>x[2]</code> but I knew we weren't thinking about the second and third bytes of the whole EDID. I added a print statement to print out the first 5 bytes of x, just so that I could compare with my hex editor and see where we were.</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span>printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>-- %x %x %x %x %x<span>"</span></span>, x[<span>0</span>], x[<span>1</span>], x[<span>2</span>], x[<span>3</span>], x[<span>4</span>]);</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This gave us <code>70 12 79 00 00</code> and I could find where that sequence was in my hex editor. In fact, I could also see that the variable assignments lined up with the structure table in the DisplayID Wikipedia page (<code>version</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>prod_type</code>, <code>ext_count</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto">Continuing to trace the code, we moved the pointer forward by 5 and then jumped into <code>edid_state::displayid_block</code>. We know that the next byte <code>tag</code> is <code>0x03</code> which matches the fact that <code>Video Timing Modes Type 1 - Detailed Timings Data Block</code> is the next section that's printed out. Later down the function, there's a function call to <code>edid_state::parse_displayid_type_1_7_timing</code> that we enter and this is where the code starts to get exciting.</p>
<p dir="auto">Actually, the start of the function isn't that bad, but scroll down halfway and you'll find this:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre>t.hact = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>4</span>] | (x[<span>5</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
hbl = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>6</span>] | (x[<span>7</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
t.hfp = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>8</span>] | ((x[<span>9</span>] &amp; <span>0x7f</span>) &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
t.hsync = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>10</span>] | (x[<span>11</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
t.hbp = hbl - t.hfp - t.hsync;
<span>if</span> ((x[<span>9</span>] &gt;&gt; <span>7</span>) &amp; <span>0x1</span>)
  t.pos_pol_hsync = <span>true</span>;
t.vact = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>12</span>] | (x[<span>13</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
vbl = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>14</span>] | (x[<span>15</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
t.vfp = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>16</span>] | ((x[<span>17</span>] &amp; <span>0x7f</span>) &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
t.vsync = <span>1</span> + (x[<span>18</span>] | (x[<span>19</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>));
t.vbp = vbl - t.vfp - t.vsync;
<span>if</span> ((x[<span>17</span>] &gt;&gt; <span>7</span>) &amp; <span>0x1</span>)
  t.pos_pol_vsync = <span>true</span>;
<span>if</span> (x[<span>3</span>] &amp; <span>0x10</span>) {
  t.<span>interlaced</span> = <span>true</span>;
  t.<span>vfp</span> /= <span>2</span>;
  t.<span>vsync</span> /= <span>2</span>;
  t.<span>vbp</span> /= <span>2</span>;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Oh no, there's <strong>no way</strong> I'm going to be able to figure out all this byte manipulation in my head. I probably don't need to care about most of this just to figure out how to fix the refresh rate, and I wish there was a way I could just see what all these values get set to in the end.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Actually debugging now</h2>
<p dir="auto">I don't do much C or C++ development, but I've used <code>gdb</code> in the past for schoolwork and a really great capture the flag I did once. I probably can remember enough about it to get some useful info out.</p>
<p dir="auto">First I worked to try and get debug symbols enabled. Turns out this Makefile already has debug symbols turned on, so that wasn't actually necessary. If you ever do need to turn on debug symbols, the flag to remember is <code>-g</code> for the compiler although in this Makefile I just tossed it onto the <code>WARN_FLAGS</code> variable since I didn't see an obvious other place for it.</p>
<p dir="auto">I fired up <code>gdb ./edid-decode</code> did some quick googling to figure out that setting a breakpoint is <code>break filename.cpp:line-number</code> and running with arguments is <code>run arg1 arg2</code> and I landed in the right place.</p>
<pre><code>Breakpoint 1, edid_state::parse_displayid_type_1_7_timing (this=0x5555555b3940 &lt;state&gt;, x=0x5555555b4408 &lt;edid+264&gt; "f8\001\206o", &lt;incomplete sequence \357&gt;, type7=false, block_rev=1, is_cta=false) at parse-displayid-block.cpp:368
368		print_timings("    ", &amp;t, name.c_str(), s.c_str(), true);
(gdb) 
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">Ok, we just got through that wild bit where we set up <code>t</code>. I'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting since a C struct is just a bunch of bytes, but lets try to print it out:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) p t
$1 = {hact = 3440, vact = 1440, hratio = 64, vratio = 27, pixclk_khz = 799750, rb = 0, interlaced = false, hfp = 48, hsync = 32, 
  hbp = 160, pos_pol_hsync = true, vfp = 3, vsync = 10, vbp = 57, pos_pol_vsync = false, hborder = 0, vborder = 0, even_vtotal = false, 
  no_pol_vsync = false, hsize_mm = 0, vsize_mm = 0, ycbcr420 = false}
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">Oh wow, that's a lot more readable than I expected. I guess debug symbols go a long way! Some of these values I recognize (3440 and 1440 are the resolution), but I'm not seeing the one most important value I need to fix: the refresh rate of <code>143.923</code>. Let's step forward and see if we can figure out how that's calculated:</p>
<pre><code>(gdb) n
    DTD:  3440x1440  143.922761 Hz  64:27   217.323 kHz    799.750000 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred)
               Hfront   48 Hsync  32 Hback  160 Hpol P
               Vfront    3 Vsync  10 Vback   57 Vpol N
369		if (is_cta) {
(gdb) 
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">Oops, we went way too far, all the calculations for the refresh rate just got done without us. I had to go look up the difference between <code>s</code> and <code>n</code> and realized that I stepped over all the interesting stuff (<code>n</code> = next line, <code>s</code> = step into). Well at least we know the interesting stuff is inside the <code>print_timings</code> function.</p>
<p dir="auto">Back in my editor, we go looking and we find another relatively dense function. At this point, I'm looking for other strategies to take shortcuts and I realize that there's a <code>Hz</code> right after the refresh rate. I do a quick search and I find this <code>printf</code>:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span>printf</span>(<span><span>"</span>%s%s: %5ux%-5s %10.6f Hz %3u:%-3u %8.3f kHz %13.6f MHz%s<span>\n</span><span>"</span></span>,
	   prefix, type,
	   t-&gt;hact, buf,
	   refresh,
	   t-&gt;hratio, t-&gt;vratio,
	   out_hor_freq_khz,
	   pixclk / <span>1000000.0</span>,
	   s.c_str());</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That actually makes things a lot clearer. We're really looking at where the <code>refresh</code> variable is set. The definition for that is a bit like this:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span>double</span> refresh = t-&gt;pixclk_khz * <span>1000.0</span> / (htotal * vtotal);
<span>if</span> (options[OptNTSC] &amp;&amp; fmod(refresh, <span>6.0</span>) == <span>0</span>) {
  refresh *= ntsc_fact;
}</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Ah, so that <code>pixclk_khz</code> from the struct earlier is actually pretty key. Let me try to see if I do that math, do I get the same number?</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
\frac{799750 \cdot 1000}{3440 \cdot 1440} = 161.44\dots
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">What if we add in <code>ntsc_fact</code> which is <code>1000.0 / 1001.0</code></p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
\frac{799750 \cdot 1000}{3440 \cdot 1440} \cdot \frac{1000}{1001}= 161.28\dots
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">Huh, 161 is close to 143, but neither of these are quite right. I must be missing something.</p>
<p dir="auto">After a lot of searching, it turned out that <code>htotal</code> and <code>vtotal</code> aren't just the resolution as I had first assumed. Here's the relevant bits, with comments added based on what stuff ended up evaluating out to:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span>if</span> (t-&gt;interlaced) <span><span>//</span> false</span>
  vact /= <span>2</span>;

<span>unsigned</span> hbl = t-&gt;hfp + t-&gt;hsync + t-&gt;hbp + <span>2</span> * t-&gt;hborder; <span><span>//</span> 240</span>
<span>unsigned</span> vbl = t-&gt;vfp + t-&gt;vsync + t-&gt;vbp + <span>2</span> * t-&gt;vborder; <span><span>//</span> 70</span>
<span>unsigned</span> htotal = t-&gt;hact + hbl; <span><span>//</span> 3680</span>
<span>double</span> vtotal = vact + vbl; <span><span>//</span> 1510</span>

<span>if</span> (t-&gt;even_vtotal) <span><span>//</span> false</span>
  vtotal = vact + t-&gt;vfp + t-&gt;vsync + t-&gt;vbp;
<span>else</span> <span>if</span> (t-&gt;interlaced) <span><span>//</span> false</span>
  vtotal = vact + t-&gt;vfp + t-&gt;vsync + t-&gt;vbp + <span>0.5</span>;</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Ok, trying our math again:</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
\frac{799750 \cdot 1000}{3680 \cdot 1510} = 143.922\dots
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>There we go!</strong> Finally, we understand roughly how that refresh rate that Linux Mint was erroneously using was being derived. Now let's see what we can do to fix things.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Working backwards</h2>
<p dir="auto">At this point, we're trying to work backwards from the end result we want to figure out what bytes need to be updated in the EDID. First, we want that fraction to evaluate out to 60 instead, and we don't want to muck with either of the resolution values. That basically means we should change the <code>pixclk_khz</code> value:</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
\frac{x \cdot 1000}{3680 \cdot 1510} = 60
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">This is really easy math, but I already have the whole thing plugged into WolframAlpha so it's easy to just change that to an <code>x</code> and set the whole thing equal to 60:</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
x = 333408
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">Computers are great, aren't they?</p>
<p dir="auto">Ok, so we need <code>t-&gt;pixclk_khz</code> to be <code>333408</code>. Where does that get set?</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span><span>//</span> edid_state::parse_displayid_type_1_7_timing</span>
<span><span>//</span> type7 = false</span>
t.pixclk_khz = (type7 ? <span>1</span> : <span>10</span>) * (<span>1</span> + (x[<span>0</span>] + (x[<span>1</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>8</span>) + (x[<span>2</span>] &lt;&lt; <span>16</span>))); </pre></div>
<p dir="auto">It took me a bit longer than I'd like to admit to realize that this is really just 10 times 1 plus the first 3 bytes of the DisplayID section payload in little endian (look, I don't work with bit manipulation that often). Those bytes in decimal are <code>102</code>, <code>56</code>, and <code>1</code> so let's double check our understanding</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
10 \cdot (1 + 102 + 56\cdot 2^8 + 1 \cdot 2^{16}) = 799750
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">Great, that was the value for <code>pixclk_khz</code> that our debugger showed us earlier. So if we want that to instead be <code>333408</code>, what are the values we need for those three bytes?</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
10 \cdot (1 + x_0 + x_1 \cdot 2^8 + x_2 \cdot 2^{16}) = 333408
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">Rearranging a bit:</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
x_0 + x_1 \cdot 2^8 + x_2 \cdot 2^{16} = 33339.8
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">It looks like we're gonna have to add a bit of imprecision since we're working with whole numbers here. I'm not entirely sure how this is typically handled, but lets just round up to <code>33340</code> and hope that nothing blows up.</p>
<p dir="auto">There's lots of ways to solve this, but at the core it's a base change to base 8. I like to do this with division and remainders. To get the most significant digit <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$x_2$</math-renderer> we divide our number by the value of that place and look at the whole number.</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
\frac{33340}{2^{16}} = 0.5
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">It turns out <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$33340 &amp;lt; 2^{16}$</math-renderer> so <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$x_2$</math-renderer> is 0. Since it's zero, we use the same number with the next place value:</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
\frac{33340}{2^{8}} = 130.234375
$$</math-renderer></p>
<p dir="auto">So we know that <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$x_1$</math-renderer> needs to be 130. We can look at the remainder there by multiplying just the decimals by the place value: <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$0.234375 * 2^8 = 60$</math-renderer> and we've already made it to our 1s place so <math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$x_0$</math-renderer> just needs to be 60.</p>
<p dir="auto"><math-renderer data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static" data-run-id="88b5f6df76e42a40ece9439c58c5af65">$$
60 + 130 \cdot 2^8 + 0 \cdot 2^{16} = 33340
$$</math-renderer></p>
<h2 dir="auto">Making the change</h2>
<p dir="auto">We've got our new 3 bytes, so let's use a hex editor to fix the file. <code>60 130 0</code> is <code>0x3c 0x82 0x00</code> in hex, so we go in and update the first line of our 3rd EDID block:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span><span>-</span>70 12 79 00 00 03 01 14 **66 38 01** 86 6f 0d ef 00</span>
<span><span>+</span>70 12 79 00 00 03 01 14 **3c 82 00** 86 6f 0d ef 00</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Let's save and run <code>edid-decode</code> on the new file. Hopefully it agrees with the change that we made.</p>

I think fixing this with math wouldn't be that difficult (based on the spec, the checksums should be chosen such that the sum of all the bytes in the section modulo 256 is 0), but <code>edid-decode</code> was so kind as to just tell us what they should be, so we can just go and update those lines in the file directly:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span><span>-</span>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0B 90</span>
<span><span>+</span>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 EC 71</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Just a quick check to make sure:</p>
<pre><code>Block 2, DisplayID Extension Block:
  Version: 1.2
  Extension Count: 0
  Display Product Type: Extension Section
  Video Timing Modes Type 1 - Detailed Timings Data Block:
    DTD:  3440x1440   60.000 Hz  64:27   90.601 kHz 333.410 MHz (aspect 64:27, no 3D stereo, preferred)
               Hfront   48 Hsync  32 Hback 160 Hpol P
               Vfront    3 Vsync  10 Vback  57 Vpol N
  Checksum: 0xec
Checksum: 0x71 (should be 0x90)
</code></pre>
<p dir="auto">Doh! The checksum for Block 2 is part of the bytes considered for the overall checksum, so by fixing it we've caused issues for the final checksum. No matter, we can fix that real quick:</p>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span><span>-</span>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 EC 71</span>
<span><span>+</span>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 EC 90</span></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Astute readers might notice that the final checksum changed <strong>back</strong> to 90 just now. This is an interesting artifact of the way that the checksum for EDID works, where all the bytes of a section must be congruent to 0 mod 256. When we fixed the checksum for Block 2, we made the sum of that whole section (including our only changes) cancel out to 0, just like it must have done before for the checksums to be valid.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">The moment of truth</h2>
<p dir="auto">At this point, we've got a valid updated EDID which seems to pass the parse test for <code>edid-decode</code>. The real question is if this EDID would work for the monitor or not. Fortunately, it seems that there's a way to force the Linux kernel to ignore the EDID that the monitor self reports and override it with a custom firmware (very convenient for this very situation).</p>
<p dir="auto">Very briefly, the steps seem to be:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Copy the new firmware to <code>/usr/lib/firmware</code> (call it <code>desktop_edid.bin</code> for compatibility with the scripts below)</li>
<li>Create this file: <code>/etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/desktop_edid.sh</code></li>
</ol>
<div dir="auto"><pre><span><span>#!</span>/bin/sh</span>
<span><span>#</span> Copy local EDID monitor description data</span>

PREREQ=<span><span>"</span><span>"</span></span>
<span>prereqs</span>()

<span>if</span> [ <span>!</span> <span>-f</span> <span><span>"</span><span>$EDID_DATA</span><span>"</span></span> ]<span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>exit</span> 0
<span>fi</span>

add_firmware <span><span>"</span><span><span>$(</span>basename <span>$EDID_DATA</span><span>)</span></span><span>"</span></span>

<span>exit</span> 0</pre></div>
<ol start="3" dir="auto">
<li>Make it executable: <code>sudo chmod +x /etc/initramfs-tools/hooks/desktop_edid.sh</code></li>
<li>Rebuild your initramfs: <code>sudo update-initramfs -u -v</code></li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">If all goes well, you should see a log line about copying firmware <code>desktop_edid.bin</code>. This means that when you next reboot, you can force the kernel to use that firmware.</p>
<p dir="auto">Let's do a quick test first before making any permanent changes:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Reboot</li>
<li>When you get to grub, use <code>e</code> to edit the boot configuration for the current boot</li>
<li>Find the linux line which should have something like <code>quiet splash</code> at the end of it. Update that line to instead end in <code>quiet splash drm.edid_firmware=desktop_edid.bin</code></li>
<li>Press F10 and boot!</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">After all this I saw a sight I've never seen before. The loading spinner for Linux Mint was showing up on my new monitor. A few seconds later, I was greeted with an even more impressive sight: the login screen popped open on the new monitor. To be honest, I wasn't sure that I believed it would work from the start, but I'm amazed that it actually worked in the end.</p>
<h2 dir="auto">Follow ups:</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>One issue is that now my second monitor isn't displaying anything. When I go into Display Settings, it seems like my computer thinks that <strong>both</strong> monitors are sending this EDID so it's put the second monitor into the wrong mode. There is a way to override the firmware for only one connector according to the Arch wiki: <code>drm.edid_firmware=VGA-1:edid/your_edid.bin</code> so I'm going to need to explore that a bit.</li>
<li>Once I get it working, I'll update the grub files for real and make it permanent.</li>
<li>One last thing I might consider doing at some point would be to try to overwrite the EDID on the monitor itself. I'd probably want to confirm that my changes are 100% safe and correct before doing this, but that would mean that my system doesn't need any special configuration for this monitor. Any Linux laptop that I plug it into or any port that I plug it into should just work. I've found docs on this online, but it's pretty risky because if I write a bad EDID I can brick the monitor, and if I do the process wrong it sounds like I could actually brick any of the components in my computer... not good!</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                            <p>
                            These days, it's pretty common for a single application to use multiple data stores.
                            Sometimes, it's because each data store is specialized for a particular task.
                            For example, an e-commerce site might use Postgres for robust customer data management, Elasticsearch for fast product search, and S3 for cheap image storage.
                            Other times, it's because an app was built by multiple teams over time, so it ends up with one service storing customer data in Postgres and another storing customer data in MongoDB.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Building robust apps with multiple data stores is tricky because it's hard to coordinate operations across those stores.
                            Most databases have a notion of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_transaction">transaction</a>, a group of related operations which execute as a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID">atomic, consistent, isolated, and durable</a> unit of work.
                            The canonical example of a transaction is transferring money between bank accounts: to transfer $100 from me to you, the bank runs a transaction which withdraws $100 from my account and deposits $100 in your account.  
                            By running both operations in one transaction, we guarantee that either both go through (and the money is transferred) or neither do (and nothing happens), avoiding failure states where $100 disappears from my account but doesn't appear in yours.
                            However, transactions only work within a single database, so if our our system spans multiple data stores, performing operations reliably is much harder.
                            The traditional solution is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-phase_commit_protocol">two-phase commit</a> through a protocol like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X/Open_XA">X/Open XA</a>. 
                            However, while XA is supported by most big relational databases like Postgres and MySQL, it's not supported by popular newer data stores like MongoDB, Cassandra, or Elasticsearch, even though those stores are increasingly embracing transactions.
                            This means that if you want transactions across multiple data stores, you probably have to do all the hard work of synchronization, concurrency control, and failure management yourself.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            In this blog post, I want to tell you about a new protocol named Epoxy (<a href="http://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2732-kraft.pdf">paper</a>), developed as part of my PhD work at Stanford in the <a href="https://dbos-project.github.io/">DBOS</a> project, which should make this problem easier by providing ACID transactions across heterogeneous data stores.
                            The basic idea behind Epoxy is that we can use a single transactional "primary database", like Postgres, to coordinate transactions among itself and multiple potentially non-transactional "secondary stores", like MongoDB or Elasticsearch.
                            Here's the high-level architecture:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="https://petereliaskraft.net/images/EpoxyBlogPost/epoxy-architecture.jpg" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Epoxy works by adapting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiversion_concurrency_control">multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)</a> to a cross-data store setting.
                            We start an Epoxy transaction by initiating a transaction on the primary database.
                            We then ask the primary database for a <i>snapshot</i>, a list of all past primary database transactions whose effects are visible to our new transaction.
                            Typically, that's all transactions that committed before our new transaction began.
                            Here's what a snapshot might look like:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="https://petereliaskraft.net/images/EpoxyBlogPost/epoxy-snapshot.jpg" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Here, the blue transactions form the snapshot of our new transaction T11, while the pink transactions are invisible to it because they weren't complete when T11 started.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            After beginning a transaction, Epoxy interposes on all its reads and writes to secondary stores to enforce <a href="https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/snapshot-isolation">snapshot isolation</a>.
                            This provides the abstraction that the transaction operates on a fixed view of data containing only the changes committed by transactions in its snapshot on any data store. 
                            Whenever a record is updated on any secondary store, Epoxy doesn't change it in place, but instead creates a new version of it.
                            It tags that version with two pieces of metadata: the ID of the transaction that created the version (beginTxn) and the ID of the transaction that superseded it with a new version (endTxn; this is initialized to infinity, then set when the version is superseded).
                            Epoxy stores this metadata inside the record itself, for example as an additional field in a MongoDB or Elasticsearch document.
                            Then, whenever a read occurs, Epoxy interposes on it, filtering its data source to only include records whose beginTxn field is in the transaction snapshot and whose endTxn field is not.
                            In other words, each transaction can only see the one unique version of a record that was created by a transaction in its snapshot, but not superseded by any transaction in its snapshot.
                            To make that more clear, let's extend our example from earlier and imagine that T11 is a transaction between Postgres and MongoDB:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <img src="https://petereliaskraft.net/images/EpoxyBlogPost/epoxy-example.jpg" alt="">
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Here, the blue record versions are visible because they were created but not superseded by transactions in T11's snapshot, while the pink versions are not visible because they were either created by a transaction not in T11's snapshot (like T9) or superseded by a transaction in T11's snapshot (like T8).
                            Thus, Epoxy guarantees that if the effects of a transaction are visible to us in Postgres, they're also visible in MongoDB, and vice versa.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Epoxy also guarantees that transactions are atomic and durable: they either commit on all stores or abort and are rolled back on all stores.
                            After a transaction is done with all operations on all stores, Epoxy validates it, verifying that none of its operations conflict with concurrent committed transactions on any data store (this is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control">optimistic concurrency control</a>).
                            It then asks all secondary stores to persist the transaction's changes to durable storage.
                            If these steps succeed, Epoxy commits the transaction by committing on the primary database.
                            This causes the transaction to appear in future snapshots, atomically making it visible to all future transactions on all data stores.
                            If anything goes wrong, Epoxy aborts, rolling back the transaction on the primary database and undoing its changes on all secondary stores.
                            Even if that process takes a long time, that's fine—none of its changes are visible to any other transactions because, unless committed, they aren't in anyone's snapshots.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                            Of course, like any new protocol, Epoxy has limitations.
                            First, it makes assumptions about secondary stores, specifically that they provide a way to tag records with metadata and efficiently filter records based on that metadata.
                            Luckily, these assumptions are met by most popular data stores; for example, in MongoDB, you can store all Epoxy metadata in additional document fields and create an index on the field to quickly filter it.
                            Second, Epoxy's interposition comes with some overhead.
                            We analyzed it in <a href="http://petereliaskraft.net/res/p2732-kraft.pdf">our paper</a>—on simulated microservices, Epoxy adds overhead of &lt;10% on read-mostly workloads and ~70% on write-heavy workloads compared to a coordination-free baseline.
                            We found this is similar to the overhead added by XA, even though Epoxy supports more data stores and provides stronger guarantees.
                            Third, and most importantly, Epoxy must be the exclusive mode of accessing a secondary store table because it physically modifies records on secondary stores by adding versioning metadata to them.
                            If one application accessing a secondary store table uses Epoxy, all other applications using that store must use Epoxy for operations on that table.
                            This might make Epoxy tricky to adopt for a database used by multiple services, and it's something that can hopefully be improved in future research.
                            </p>

Meta's Llama 2 is the official successor to the popular LLaMA model. Both the original LLaMA model and Llama 2 releases were accompanied by very detailed research articles, which I highly appreciate:</p><ul><li><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971" rel="">LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models</a></em><span>, Touvron et al., Feb 2023</span></p></li><li><p><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288" rel="">Llama 2: Open Foundation and Fine-Tuned Chat Models</a></em><span>, Touvron et al., Jul 2023</span></p></li></ul><p>Like LLaMA, Llama 2 is a model suite consisting of multiple pretrained LLMs of different sizes. So, what's new and what's interesting about Llama 2? Let's discuss this one by one.</p><p><span>First things first. LLaMA stands for </span><strong>L</strong><span>arge </span><strong>La</strong><span>nguage </span><strong>M</strong><span>odel Meta </span><strong>A</strong><span>I. The capitalization makes it a bit tedious to type, but the good news is that the official spelling of its successor is just "Llama 2". So, if you stumble upon LLaMA in this article, I am referring to LLaMA v1, and Llama 2 refers to the new model, which we are focusing on here.</span></p><p>Before we discuss individual details further below, here's a brief summary of what's new:</p><ul><li><p>Llama 2 was trained on 40% more data than the original LLaMA model.</p></li><li><p>Also, Llama 2 now supports 2x larger inputs.</p></li><li><p>The larger 34B and 70B models have a small architectural change using multi-query attention, which we will discuss later.</p></li><li><p>Another big change is that the Llama 2 modeling suite now includes finetuned models (via supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback); more details later.</p></li><li><p>The Llama 2 license now permits commercial use.</p></li></ul><blockquote></blockquote><p><span>LLaMA (7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B) and Llama 2 (7B, 13B, 34B*, and 70B) come in various sizes, offering different modeling performance and computational requirement trade-offs. However, while LLaMA only offered pretrained base models, Llama 2 offers both pretrained </span><em><strong>base</strong></em><span>&nbsp;models and finetuned </span><em><strong>chat</strong></em><span>&nbsp;models. Here, </span><em>base</em><span>&nbsp;model means that it's only been trained on the next-word pretraining task. The finetuned </span><em>chat</em><span>&nbsp;models have been finetuned on instruction datasets using supervised learning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), but more later.</span></p><p>* (Interestingly, Meta only releases the 7B, 13B, and 70B models, not the 34B model.)</p><p><span>Most readers may want to know the license and usage restrictions before deciding whether to invest more time into Llama 2 and read the further details below. While LLaMA was a big hit and a celebrated effort in the research community, it was also mildly criticized for its restrictive license. The LLaMA inference code was open source, whereas the model weights, granted on a case-by-case basis to academic researchers, were not released as open source. In short, the LLaMA license allowed research but not commercial use, whereas the </span><a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/LICENSE" rel="">Llama 2 license</a><span>&nbsp;now also permits use in commercial applications (see the </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/" rel="">Request to Access page</a><span>&nbsp;for details). However, while the Llama 2 license is permissive enough for most use cases, it is not an open-source license; as discussed in the article </span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blog.opensource.org/metas-llama-2-license-is-not-open-source/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1692833158282053&amp;usg=AOvVaw12tE3bEYV5jVbDiv6dE-jg" rel="">Meta's LLaMa 2 license is not Open Source</a><span>. Personally, I find the Llama 2 usage terms more than reasonable, even though using the term "open source" may be confusing and potentially misleading here. (Nonetheless, for simplicity, I will group Llama 2 among the open-source models for the remainder of the article.)</span></p><p>Now that we have addressed the license and usage question in the previous paragraph, let's get to the most interesting part and address the elephant in the room: "How good is Llama 2"? To address this question fairly, we have to distinguish between Llama 2 base models and finetuned Llama 2 chat models.</p><p>Let's talk about the base models first, which are decoder-style LLMs that have been only trained via the conventional next-word prediction pretraining task.</p><p>For more information about decoder-style vs encoder-style LLMs, see my article below:</p><p>In short, Llama 2 base models compare extremely favorably to other open-source models as shown in the annotated figure below.</p><p>However, Llama 2 base models perform worse than popular closed-source models, but this is expected since the closed-source models listed in the table below are 1) finetuned and 2) much larger (GPT-3.5 has 175B parameters versus 70B parameters in Llama 2). We will see a fairer comparison to the finetuned Llama 2 models later.</p><p>The 77-page Llama 2 report is surprisingly detailed, which I really appreciate. Interestingly, though, in contrast to the first LLaMA model, the report doesn't offer any insights into the training data besides the following short description:</p><p><em>&gt; more robust data cleaning, updated our data mixes, trained on 40% more total tokens</em></p><p>We can speculate that this is either due to 1) keeping a competitive advantage over other open source models or 2) avoiding copyright related lawsuits.</p><p><span>The following Business Insider article argues that it might be due to the latter: </span><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.in/tech/news/llama-copyright-drama-meta-stops-disclosing-what-data-it-uses-to-train-the-companys-giant-ai-models/articleshow/101887460.cms" rel="">Llama copyright drama: Meta stops disclosing what data it uses to train the company's giant AI models</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>Among the highlights of the Llama 2 model suite are the chat models. These chat models are based on the Llama 2 base models and have undergone additional instruction finetuning similar to InstructGPT and ChatGPT.</p><p>The Llama 2-chat models compare very favorably against other popular chat models, as shown in the annotated figure below.</p><p>The finetuning was done in multiple stages: supervised-instruction finetuning as in Alpaca (the first LLaMA model finetuned by researchers at Stanford, and later many other open source LLMs) followed by reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) similar to ChatGPT, as summarized in the annotated figure below.</p><p><span>The section on supervised tuning placed a focus on utilizing a smaller subset of high-quality data, comprising only thousands of samples from their pool of millions. This approach was aligned with the "less is more" philosophy as discussed in the </span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11206&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1692833158286565&amp;usg=AOvVaw2cZIpO1zw7yT7xRnrVyB4N" rel="">LIMA paper</a><span>, a subject I previously covered in a previous issue of this newsletter:</span></p><div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed"><a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/ahead-of-ai-9-llm-tuning-and-dataset" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e54422-a516-49b2-aa28-5f9ee1980541_680x488.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_140,h_140,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4e54422-a516-49b2-aa28-5f9ee1980541_680x488.png" sizes="100vw" alt="Ahead of AI #9: LLM Tuning &amp; Dataset Perspectives" width="140" height="140"></picture></div></a></div><p>Following the initial supervised finetuning, the models were further refined using RLHF.

In contrast, the Llama 2 authors conducted experiments with two different methods, </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01318" rel="">rejection sampling</a><span>&nbsp;and RLHF with PPO.</span></p><p>The authors also nicely illustrated the evolution of the Llama 2 70B Chat models, tracing their journey from the initial supervised finetuning (SFT-v1) to the final RLHF finetuning stage with PPO (RLHF-v5). The chart reflects consistent improvements in both the harmlessness and helpfulness axes, as shown in the annotated plots below.</p><p><span>In the future, it will be interesting how </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290" rel="">Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)</a><span>, a reinforcement learning-free alternative I previously covered in </span><a href="https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/ai-research-highlights-in-3-sentences-2a1" rel="">AI Research Highlights In 3 Sentences Or Less (May-June 2023)</a><span>, compares to these RLHF approaches.</span></p><p>The Llama 2 paper is very detailed, and covering all its aspects in this newsletter issue would be impossible. However, below, I wanted to highlight a few more tidbits that I found interesting.</p><p><span>For instance, 34B and 70B parameter Llama models use </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13245" rel="">grouped-query attention (GQA)</a><span>. GQA can be regarded as a more generalized form of multi-query attention, a concept previously employed in models such as Falcon.</span></p><p>The likely motivation behind this is to reduce computational requirements with minimal impacts on the modeling performance.</p><p>While the Llama 2 base and chat models perform well, there's still room for improvement through finetuning. Think of Llama 2 as a revised foundational model that can be further fine-tuned for more specialized tasks.</p><p>To illustrate the potential benefit of finetuning, let's take the example of the BoolQ benchmark. Surprisingly, Llama 2 doesn't outperform DeBERTa-1.5B, an encoder-only model, on this particular task. It's a reminder that even strong models like Llama 2 can be outperformed by smaller finetuned models, especially when targeting specific tasks.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png" width="1456" height="626" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:626,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe44fb450-26ed-45fc-8202-32f75f6e517c_1999x860.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>For fairness, the DeBERTa-1.5B model (initially proposed at ICLR 2021) was finetuned on the training data portion of BoolQ, whereas Llama 2 was used via few-shot prompting.</p><p>While this experiment has not been done yet, a finetuned Llama 2 model could perform even better on this dataset -- or at least better than the Llama 2 base model.</p><p><span>(And as shown via </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09543" rel="">DeBERTaV3: Improving DeBERTa using ELECTRA-Style Pre-Training with Gradient-Disentangled Embedding Sharing</a><span>&nbsp;at ICLR 2023, it's also possible to even use a much smaller 300M parameter model for good performance on this task.)</span></p><p>As we've seen above, Llama 2 is an extremely capable model.

These 70B models may be computationally infeasible (or reasonable hardware clusters) if they were to support 100k token inputs.</p></li></ol><p><span>Switching gears from open-source to closed-source models, there have also been a few interesting news on the GPT-4 front last month. For instance, the GPT-4 mode</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/" rel="">&nbsp;details have now apparently (finally) been leaked</a><span>:</span></p><p><em>&gt; &nbsp;GPT-4 is a language model with approximately 1.8 trillion parameters across 120 layers, 10x larger than GPT-3. It uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model with 16 experts, each having about 111 billion parameters. Utilizing MoE allows for more efficient use of resources during inference, needing only about 280 billion parameters and 560 TFLOPs, compared to the 1.8 trillion parameters and 3,700 TFLOPs required for a purely dense model.</em></p><p><em>&gt; The model is trained on approximately 13 trillion tokens from various sources, including internet data, books, and research papers. To reduce training costs, OpenAI employs tensor and pipeline parallelism, and a large batch size of 60 million. The estimated training cost for GPT-4 is around $63 million.</em></p><p><span>Source: </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/" rel="">https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/14wbmio/gpt4_details_leaked/</a></p><p>In particular, the fact that GPT-4 is apparently using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach is very interesting and important to highlight. MoE means that it is to improve the performance of a system by combining the predictions or decisions of several specialized sub-models or "experts."</p><p>So, suppose we want to improve models like Llama 2 further and outperform GPT-4-like offerings (by a large margin). In that case, we may not only have to scale the model to a similar size (in this case, 25x larger to be comparable) but also consider using MoE approaches.</p><p><span>We often see claims that OpenAI degrades the ChatGPT performance over time to save computation time and cost. In the recent </span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009" rel="">How is ChatGPT's behavior changing over time?</a></em><span>&nbsp;paper, researchers make an interesting observation that GPT-4's modeling performance appears to be indeed getting worse over time. Is it due to distillation methods to save costs or guard rails to prevent certain types of misuse? (By the way, it is interesting to see research efforts being diverted into studying these changes that could likely already be answered by a researcher and engineers who worked on these models.)</span></p><p><span>As a follow-up, I highly recommend reading the Substack article</span><em><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/is-gpt-4-getting-worse-over-time" rel="">Is GPT-4 getting worse over time?</a></em><span>&nbsp;by </span></p><p><span> and </span></p><p><span>who highlight important shortcomings of the research article above. For instance,</span></p><p><em>&gt; What seems to have changed is that the March version of GPT-4 almost always guesses that the number is prime, and the June version almost always guesses that it is composite. The authors interpret this as a massive performance drop — since they only test primes. For GPT-3.5, this behavior is reversed.</em></p><p>So, the claim that GPT-4 is getting worse over time may not be necessarily true. There are ongoing changes with regard to its behavior, though.</p><p>In practice, one of the biggest advantages of using an API is that we don't have to worry about hosting and serving the model itself. However, this is also the biggest shortcoming if we build services on top of it. Sure, performance improvements are usually appreciated. However, intransparent changes to the model behavior can also cause all your previously working queries to not work reliably the next morning. The more you build on top of a closed API, the more annoying this problem can become.</p><p><span>Last Wednesday, </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-5-turbo-fine-tuning-and-api-updates" rel="">OpenAI announced its new finetuning service for ChatGPT</a><span>. This is super interesting for those who want to finetune LLMs on custom data.</span></p><p>It will be interesting to see how it fares against open-source solutions from which the most recent cutting-edge finetuning techniques emerged (Llama-Adapters, LoRA, QLoRA, and more).</p><p>Also, the recent open-source Llama 2 model, which we discussed above, compares very favorably to ChatGPT / GPT-3.5, as shown below.</p><p>Based on the OpenAI documentation and marketing materials, it doesn't seem like the service will be restricted to just changing the style or tone of the LLM's responses. Instead, it appears that OpenAI is offering a fully-fledged instruction tuning service.</p><p>However, this also means it will likely still be impossible to fully adapt the models to new specialized target domains like medical, financial, or legal contexts. That's because new knowledge is usually ingested via pretraining, not finetuning; this is also true for open-source models.</p><p>While OpenAI does not specify which finetuning method they will use, opting for low-rank adaptation (LoRA) as a finetuning technique would make sense. I believe this would be the easiest and most cost-effective because they won't have to store a new 175B parameter LLM for each customer. With LoRA, you can use the same base LLM but only need to store the LoRA weights.</p><p>One of the open research challenges is how to extend LLMs to larger input contexts. Recent approaches include</p><p><span>1) the </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11062#:~:text=This%20technical%20report%20presents%20the,models%20in%20natural%20language%20processing." rel="">RMT paper on scaling transformers to 1 million tokens</a><span>;</span></p><p><span>2) the</span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794" rel="">&nbsp;convolutional Hyena LLM for 1 million tokens</a><span>;</span></p><p><span>3) </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02486" rel="">LongNet: scaling transformers to 1 billion tokens</a><span>.</span></p><p>While there are several use cases for such long LLMs, for example, asking questions about particular long document inputs, the elephant in the room is: How well do LLMs use these longer contexts?</p><p><span>New research (</span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs//2307.03172" rel="">Lost in the Middle: How Language Models Use Long Contexts</a></em><span>) shows that LLMs are good at retrieving information at the beginning of documents. They do less well in terms of retrieving information if it's contained in the middle of a document.</span></p><p>The analysis in this paper is focused on ChatGPT (as it's shown in the figure) and Claude. Of course, it would be interesting to include other models (Hyena, LongNet etc.) in the future.</p><p>Nonetheless, this is quite interesting!</p><p><span>1) I would expect that the opposite is true for, e.g., RNN-based LLMs like </span><a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1692833158299736&amp;usg=AOvVaw2h6bCGXGmMWf0X9Af5mXGh" rel="">RWKV</a><span>&nbsp;(since it's processing information sequentially, it might rather forget early information)</span></p><p>2) To my knowledge, there is no specific inductive bias in transformer-based LLM architectures that explains why the retrieval performance should be worse for text in the middle of the document. I suspect it is all because of the training data and how humans write: the most important information is usually in the beginning or the end (think paper Abstracts and Conclusion sections), and it's then how LLMs parameterize the attention weights during training.</p><p><strong>More Transformer Alternatives</strong></p><p><span>I mentioned several alternatives to transformer-based LLMs in the paragraph above, such as the recurrent </span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048" rel="">RWKV</a></em><span>&nbsp;LLM and the convolutional </span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794" rel="">Hyena LLM</a></em><span>.</span></p><p><span>The newest transformer alternative is Retentive Network (also called RentionNet), which was proposed in a paper last month with a bold headline: </span><em><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621" rel="">Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models</a><span>.</span></em></p><p>This paper proposes another alternative to large language transformers, one that has linear instead of quadratic complexity concerning the input sequence lengths. RetentionNet can be trained in a parallel mode and switched to a recurrent model to extend context lengths without increasing memory cost to achieve good inference performance. The largest model was 6.7B parameters, and it will be interesting to see future studies comparing RetNet to Llama-2 70B and others.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png" width="670" height="444.5192307692308" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:966,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:670,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" title="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F739e2c39-00d9-49f8-a92e-58deccae5259_1926x1278.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Will it be a widely used alternative to transformer-based LLMs?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                    <p>Ten years ago, a tech-savvy group of people with type 1 <a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-021-00002-5/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-021-00002-5/index.html" data-track-category="body text link">diabetes</a> (T1D) decided to pursue a DIY approach to their own treatment. They knew that a fairly straightforward piece of software could make their lives much easier, but no companies were developing it quickly enough.</p><p>What this software promised was freedom from having to constantly measure and control their blood-glucose levels. In people without T1D, when glucose levels rise, cells in the pancreas release insulin, a hormone that helps tissues to absorb that glucose. In T1D, these cells are killed by the immune system, leaving people with the condition to manage their blood sugar by taking insulin.</p><p>“It is almost inhumane,” says Shane O’Donnell, a medical sociologist at University College Dublin, who, like everyone quoted in this article, lives with T1D. “You’re constantly having to think about diabetes in order to survive.”</p><p>Members of the nascent DIY community were using the most sophisticated technology available: insulin pumps and wearable devices called constant glucose monitors. But they still had to read the monitor’s data, forecast their diet and exercise and then calculate the appropriate insulin dose.</p><p>What they wanted was automation — an algorithm that would analyse glucose data and program the pump itself. Coalescing around this aim in 2013, the community debuted a hashtag: #WeAreNotWaiting.</p><p>Then, in February 2015, group member Dana Lewis shared the code for an algorithm that she and two collaborators had developed and tested.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>“We didn’t set out do to anything big,” says Lewis, now an independent researcher in Seattle, Washington. But soon, people who had downloaded and used the algorithm shared their personal experiences and gave feedback. When users suggested tweaks and potential improvements, others tried them and reported back.</p><p>Katarina Braune, an endocrinologist at Charité – Berlin University Medicine, estimates that around 30,000 people now use open-source technology for automated insulin delivery (AID). Some use Lewis and colleagues’ original OpenAPS system, which requires a minicomputer to control it, whereas others use either AndroidAPS (which evolved from Lewis’ system) or Loop, which are smartphone applications.</p><p>The movement has continued to mature. After years of relying on self-reported data, in the past year, two randomized controlled trials<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> have shown the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03055-2" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03055-2" data-track-category="body text link">safety and effectiveness of open-source systems</a>. And this January, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted regulatory clearance to an <a href="https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-loop-has-received-fda-clearance" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.tidepool.org/blog/tidepool-loop-has-received-fda-clearance" data-track-category="body text link">AID system based on an open-source algorithm</a> for the first time.</p><p>Today, however, the technology landscape for T1D is much more crowded. The first commercial AID system was launched in 2017 and, currently, five companies sell such systems, with more than 750,000 users.</p><p>Is this the beginning of the end for the open-source movement in diabetes care? Some diabetologists think so. But many advocates reject that idea, saying that the community is still pushing the technology in new directions that promise more personalization and automation than commercial versions currently provide.</p><h2><b>Gaining traction</b></h2><p>Sufyan Hussain, an endocrinologist at King’s College London, says that he was initially sceptical about the DIY AID community. But when he started to engage with it in around 2016, he was “shocked at how well engineered the solutions were in terms of the safety and understanding”.</p><p>In 2022, Hussain co-authored an international consensus statement<sup><a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">3</a></sup> — signed by more than 40 medical and legal experts and backed by 9 diabetes charities — calling for health-care professionals to support those wanting to use open-source AID.</p><p>Results from randomized trials have further elevated the status of DIY technology. A study published this year<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup> found that an open-source and a commercial AID system both controlled glucose levels similarly well. And a September 2022 study<sup><a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">2</a></sup> demonstrated the efficacy of an algorithm that runs an artificial pancreas system on Android smartphones. By recruiting participants who were new to the technology, the study addressed long-standing criticisms that advocates had previously cherry-picked data from highly motivated, tech-literate members.</p><p>Despite their tens of thousands of users, many of whom have chosen not to use available commercial systems, DIY devices for T1D remain relatively niche. O’Donnell says that a welcoming and supportive community guides people with limited technology skills through setting up systems. But most people with T1D — and most doctors — haven’t encountered these systems, says Aaron Kowalski, president and chief executive of JDRF, a non-profit research organization in New York City that focuses on T1D.</p><figure>

</figure><p>The FDA’s approval of the open-source system Tidepool Loop could change things, says Kowalski. The algorithm underlying it was created in 2016 by people living with T1D, and was initially rolled out through online forums, before a version of it was taken through FDA clearance by Tidepool, a non-profit organization in Palo Alto, California.</p><p>Tidepool’s goal in getting Loop through regulation is “to make it more accessible to a wider audience”, says spokesperson Saira Khan-Gallo. “Downloading code and building an app on your phone is not for everyone,” she says. But “the algorithm, the novel features and technology should be available to anyone who is interested”.</p><p>Tidepool and others hoping to roll out open-source algorithms face a big challenge: their products do not stand alone. The algorithms require compatibility with continuous glucose monitors and pumps — made by other companies — thereby demanding a cooperative relationship between manufacturers. Tidepool is yet to announce which device company it will collaborate with to launch Loop.</p><p>Interoperability between different products and algorithms could shake up a marketplace in which individual manufacturers have usually developed proprietary, exclusive software. This could have ramifications beyond T1D treatment, affecting any computerized medical hardware that software developers might attempt to improve.</p><p>Kowalski points to examples in other industries, such as aerospace, in which companies use engines made by others. “They’re plugging [in] different components from different manufacturers to get the best performance,” he says. “People with diabetes should have the opportunity to use the best tools that work the best for them.”</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Several device manufacturers, however, told <i>Nature</i> that they are wary of relying on third parties to provide crucial pieces of AID systems. For instance, Tandem, a pump manufacturer in San Diego, California, says that if an algorithm runs on a smartphone app and not on the pump itself, phone damage or connectivity problems could be a risk to therapy. And Medtronic, a medical technology company in Watford, UK, has decided to prioritize designing their own complete system rather than interoperable components.</p><p>Nonetheless, Tidepool’s regulatory approval will hopefully ease the way for future standalone algorithms seeking clearance, says Khan-Gallo. She hopes that having more options will incentivize companies to make their devices cross-compatible.</p><p>And where algorithms have led, open-source hardware might follow, says O’Donnell. A team at the University of Otago in New Zealand has run a successful early-stage clinical trial of an open-source insulin pump<sup><a href="#ref-CR4" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">4</a></sup>. The goal is to provide free-of-charge design plans to qualified manufacturers to build pumps for a fraction of the cost of current commercial ones.</p><h2><b>Algorithms ablaze </b></h2><p>When asked whether the open-source community of users still has a part to play, Kowalski says: “The DIY community is always going to be there. I think they’re the ultimate testing ground for what people want and need.”</p><p>Hussain agrees. Participants’ lived experiences of T1D constantly generate ideas for novel features, he says. But more importantly, the network of online forums and highly motivated members has created a rapid and powerful way to test algorithm functions.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Problematic updates are quickly weeded out, and beneficial innovations self-propagate and achieve widespread use in just months. Currently, Hussain says, “The commercial systems don’t have advanced features that the open-source systems allow.”</p><p>Some of these features mean that certain open-source systems come close to regulating blood sugar completely autonomously. Although commercial systems are advancing, none is as near to solving this important problem; they currently use hybrid algorithms that manage insulin dosing most of the time, but they require a lot of manual input. For instance, users must program in meals to ensure that the devices deliver large corrective insulin doses.</p><p>By contrast, many open-source systems do not require meal announcements and come close to being a fully closed loop<sup><a href="#ref-CR5" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">5</a></sup>.</p><p>Several advances in technology made this possible, says Lewis. The apps can analyse long-term changes in glucose control and insulin sensitivity resulting from, say, hormonal changes or illness. They do this by retrospectively comparing glucose levels with insulin doses over days or weeks, to adjust upcoming dosing according to changes in insulin sensitivity. They can also deal with perturbations to blood glucose “without knowing whether it was a meal, adrenaline, stress, excitement — whatever, it doesn’t matter”, says Lewis.</p><p>Whether open-source systems are better than commercial ones “is a big ‘it depends’ question”, says Rayhan Lal, an endocrinologist at Stanford University in California, and Tidepool’s chief medical adviser, who says that he has started more than 3,000 people on open-source AID systems, and uses one himself.</p><p>What matters, Lal says, is that individuals can find what works best for them, in terms of the control they gain or the effort they want to make. Some people might want to tailor their devices; others might prefer the simplicity of a package from a commercial manufacturer.</p><p>The DIY community and industry are not in opposition, says Lewis. She is delighted that a safety feature that she wrote and freely shared was incorporated into a commercial device. The open-source community will stay relevant, she says, as long as it offers users choice. “The vision of where I’d love to get to — whether it’s commercial or DIY — is really, really about the person with diabetes and our safety and our quality of life.”</p>

place. I wasn’t alone in thinking it was malware, with posts dating back three months showing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/computerviruses/comments/149x25h/bgaupsell_what_is_this_bing_popup/">Reddit users trying to figure out</a> why they were seeing the pop-up.</p><p>I’m sure Microsoft is legally covered by the myriad of license agreements that nobody reads, but in reality I never knowingly consented to&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;abusing its ability to analyze my PC usage to show me a&nbsp;Bing&nbsp;pop-up just because I use Chrome with Google search.</p><p>This isn’t Microsoft’s first rodeo, either. I’m growing increasingly frustrated by the company’s methods of getting people to switch from Google and Chrome to Bing and Edge. Microsoft has been using a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813733/microsoft-windows-edge-download-chrome-prompts">variety of prompts for years now</a>, with pop-ups appearing inside Chrome, on the Windows taskbar, and elsewhere. Microsoft has even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial">forced people into Edge after a Windows Update</a>, and regularly presents a full-screen message to switch to Bing and Edge after updates.</p><p>Microsoft also started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23736289/microsoft-bing-chrome-search-fake-ai-chatbot">taking over Chrome searches in Bing</a> recently to deliver a canned response that looks like it’s generated from Microsoft’s GPT-4-powered chatbot. The fake AI interaction produced a full Bing page to entirely take over the search result for Chrome and convince Windows users to stick with Edge and Bing.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Microsoft even took over Chrome search results in Bing recently." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/376x204/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/384x209/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/415x226/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/480x261/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/540x294/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/640x348/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/750x408/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/828x450/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/1080x587/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/1200x653/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/1440x783/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/1920x1044/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/2048x1114/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/2400x1305/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1920x1044/2400x1305/filters:focal(960x522:961x523):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24707688/chrome___Search___Personal___Microsoft__Edge_6_6_2023_3_52_36_PM.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Microsoft even took over Chrome search results in Bing recently.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>You’ve probably never seen this latest pop-up or even some of the ones in the past, and that’s because Microsoft only experiments with a small number of Windows users before there’s an outcry and the company pivots to try and find another way to nag Windows users. Microsoft even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133372/microsoft-search-chrome-extension-bing-default-search-plans-canceled">had to backtrack on plans</a> to force the Chrome default search to Bing for businesses installing its Office apps.</p><p>You might argue that this is Microsoft’s operating system, or that when using Microsoft’s browser and search engine it’s well within its rights to try and sway people away from Chrome. After all, Google runs similar notifications on its webpages to get people to use Chrome or it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/23/20946114/google-youtube-premium-subscription-ads-pop-ups-spam-rant">annoying YouTube premium spam</a>. But Microsoft’s behaviors here are totally beyond a simple webpage prompt. I shouldn’t have to be dismissing pop-ups that appear on top of my apps and games, or ones that magically appear after I update my copy of Windows.</p><p>Windows isn’t freeware, it requires a license that almost every consumer ultimately pays for. That could be in the form of the price of a laptop that has a Windows OEM license baked in, or a product key if you built your own PC. Microsoft should respect the fact that people already pay for Windows and don’t want ads shoved down their throats. Windows is an important productivity tool for many people, and shouldn’t be treated like a cheap streaming box loaded with ads.</p><p>I truly hope Microsoft changes its ways here, but this has been going on in several different forms for years now so I’m just counting the days until the next annoying pop-up appears.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>GENEVA (29 August 2023)</strong> – Hundreds of thousands of people are being forcibly engaged by organised criminal gangs into online criminality in Southeast Asia - from romance-investment scams and crypto fraud to illegal gambling - a <a href="https://bangkok.ohchr.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/ONLINE-SCAM-OPERATIONS-2582023.pdf">report</a> issued today by the UN Human Rights Office shows.</p>

<p>Victims face a range of serious violations and abuses, including threats to their safety and security; and many have been subjected to torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, forced labour, and other human rights abuses, the report says.</p>

<p>“People who are coerced into working in these scamming operations endure inhumane treatment while being forced to carry out crimes. They are victims. They are not criminals,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.</p>

<p>“In continuing to call for justice for those who have been defrauded through online criminality, we must not forget that this complex phenomenon has two sets of victims.”</p>

<p>The enormity of online scam trafficking in Southeast Asia is difficult to estimate, the reports says, because of the clandestine nature and gaps in the official response. Credible sources indicate that at least 120,000 people across Myanmar may be held in situations where they are forced to carry out online scams, with estimates in Cambodia similarly at around 100,000. Other States in the region, including Lao PDR, the Philippines and Thailand, have also been identified as main countries of destination or transit where at least tens of thousands of people have been involved.</p>

<p>The scam centres generate revenue amounting to billions of US dollars each year.</p>

<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and associated response measures had a drastic impact on illicit activities across the region. Public health measures closed casinos in many countries and in response, casino operators moved operations to less regulated spaces including conflict-affected border areas and Special Economic Zones, as well as to the increasingly lucrative online space, the report says.</p>

<p>Faced with new operational realities, criminal actors increasingly targeted migrants in vulnerable situations – who were stranded in these countries and out of work due to border and business closures – for recruitment into criminal operations, under the pretence of offering them real jobs. As COVID-related shutdowns saw millions of people restricted to their homes, spending more time online, there were more ready targets for online fraud schemes and more people susceptible to fraudulent recruitment.</p>

<p>Most people trafficked into the online scam operations are men, although women and adolescents are also among the victims, the report says. Most are not citizens of the countries in which the trafficking occurs. Many of the victims are well-educated, sometimes coming from professional jobs or with graduate or even post-graduate degrees, computer-literate and multi-lingual. Victims come from across the ASEAN region (from Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam), as well as mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, South Asia, and even further afield from Africa and Latin America.</p>

<p>While some countries in Southeast Asia have put in place legal and policy frameworks relevant to counter trafficking, in some cases they fall short of international standards. In many cases their implementation has failed to respond adequately to the context and sophistication of these online scams, the report says.</p>

<p>Victims of trafficking and other human rights abuse are erroneously identified as criminals or as immigration offenders and, rather than being protected and given access to the rehabilitation and remedy they need, they are subjected to criminal prosecution or immigration penalties, it says.</p>

<p>“All affected States need to summon the political will to strengthen human rights and improve governance and the rule of law, including through serious and sustained efforts to tackle corruption. This must be as much a part of the response to these scams as a robust criminal justice response,” said Türk.</p>

<p>“Only such a holistic approach can break the cycle of impunity and ensure protection and justice for the people who have been so horrifically abused.”</p>

However, there is a real diner and barbershop according to Aitia. </p>
<p>The backlot is located in Pickering, Canada, and TV fans might recognize it from Amazon’s <em>Reacher</em>. In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mattaitia/video/7260962606981123333?embed_source=121355059%2C121351166%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%3Bnull%3Bembed_masking&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.dailymail.co.uk%2Ffemail%2Farticle-12381843%2FFake-town-Canada-gas-station-restaurant-filming-movies.html&amp;referer_video_id=7260716446521527557" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">further video</a>, Aitia explains why a company would go through all that trouble of making such an elaborate set. </p> <p>“Filming on a backlot is usually cheaper than real locations for a few reasons. It can be super costly to shut down a whole street for a film shoot backlots eliminated the need for permits, scheduling, and coordinating with property owners,” Aitia explains. </p> <p>“They also save time as there’s less travel time between locations allowing for more shooting hours each day. They’re also designed for versatility enabling filmmakers to shoot at various locations with logistical and transportational headaches.” </p> <p><img decoding="async" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/4_Backlot-Drone-View-800x600.jpg" alt="Fake TV town" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/4_Backlot-Drone-View-800x600.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/4_Backlot-Drone-View-320x240.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/4_Backlot-Drone-View-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/4_Backlot-Drone-View.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_15-800x600.jpg" alt="Fake TV town" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_15-800x600.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_15-320x240.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_15-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_15.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p> <p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_1-800x600.jpg" alt="Fake TV town" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_1-320x240.jpg 320w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://petapixel.com/assets/uploads/2023/08/Close-Up_1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></p> <p>The backlot is owned and operated by <a href="http://wfwstudios.com/backlot/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="follow external noopener">William F.

<h2><strong>For developers</strong></h2>
<p>You can download the latest Windows Insider SDK at&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk</a>.</p>
<p>SDK NuGet packages are now also flighting at <a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/WindowsSDK">NuGet Gallery | WindowsSDK</a> which include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.NET.Ref/">.NET TFM packages</a> for use in .NET apps as described at <a href="https://aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk">aka.ms/windowsinsidersdk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.CPP/">C++ packages</a> for Win32 headers and libs per architecture</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Windows.SDK.BuildTools/">BuildTools package</a> when you just need tools like MakeAppx.exe, MakePri.exe, and SignTool.exe</li>
</ul>
<p>These NuGet packages provide more granular access to the SDK and better integration in CI/CD pipelines.</p>
<p><strong>SDK flights are now published for both the Canary and Dev Channels, so be sure to choose the right version for your Insider Channel.</strong></p>
<p>Remember to use&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/version-adaptive-apps">adaptive code&nbsp;</a>when targeting new APIs to make sure your app runs on all customer machines, particularly when building against the Dev Channel SDK.&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.foundation.metadata.apiinformation?view=winrt-22621">Feature detection</a>&nbsp;is recommended over OS version checks, as OS version checks are unreliable and will not work as expected in all cases.</p>
<h2><strong>About the Dev Channel</strong></h2>
<p><strong>REMINDER: </strong><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2023/03/06/whats-coming-for-the-windows-insider-program-in-2023/"><strong>The Dev Channel has been rebooted</strong></a><strong>. Windows Insiders who were in the Dev Channel on 25000 series builds have been moved to the new Canary Channel. Going forward, the Dev Channel will receive 23000 series builds. Insiders who were moved to the Canary Channel and want to move back to the Dev Channel can </strong><a href="https://aka.ms/HowtoCleanInstall"><strong>follow these instructions</strong></a><strong> to do a clean installation of Windows 11 and then re-join the Dev Channel to receive 23000 series builds. </strong></p>
<p>The Dev Channel receives builds that represent long lead work from our engineers&nbsp;<strong>with features and experiences that may never get released</strong>&nbsp;as we try out different concepts and get feedback. It is important to remember that the builds we release to the Dev Channel should not be seen as matched to any specific release of Windows and the features included may change over time, be removed, or replaced in Insider builds or may never be released beyond Windows Insiders to general customers. For more information,&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/02/03/whats-coming-for-the-windows-insider-program-in-2022/">please read this blog post</a>&nbsp;about how we plan to use the Dev Channel to incubate new ideas, work on long lead items, and control the states of individual features.</p>
<p>In some cases, features and experiences may go out to the Canary Channel first before going out to the Dev Channel however the Dev Channel will provide better platform stability. As we get closer to shipping, some features and experiences will also make their way to the Beta Channel when they are ready.</p>
<p><strong>The desktop watermark you see at the lower right corner of your desktop is normal for these pre-release builds.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Important Insider Links</strong></h2>

&nbsp;<blockquote>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Abraham drew near and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?&nbsp;  Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?&nbsp;  That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?&nbsp;  And the Lord said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes: Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?&nbsp;  And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.&nbsp;  And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.&nbsp;  And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.&nbsp;  And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.&nbsp;  And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.&nbsp;  And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.&nbsp;  And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.&nbsp;  And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake. </p><p>

&nbsp;<h3>I. The <i>n</i> Controversy</h3> <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer," <a name="T2"></a><a href="#2">2</a> says English jurist William Blackstone.&nbsp;  The ratio 10:1 has become known as the "Blackstone ratio." <a name="T3"></a><a href="#3">3</a>&nbsp;  Lawyers "are indoctrinated" with it "early in law school." <a name="T4"></a><a href="#4">4</a>&nbsp;  "Schoolboys are taught" it. <a name="T5"></a><a href="#5">5</a>&nbsp;  In the fantasies of legal academics, jurors think about Blackstone routinely. <a name="T6"></a><a href="#6">6</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But why ten?&nbsp;  Other eminent legal authorities through the ages have put their weight behind other numbers.&nbsp;  "One" has appeared on
<cite>Geraldo</cite>. <a name="T7"></a><a href="#7">7</a>&nbsp;  "It's better for four guilty men to go free than one innocent man to be imprisoned," says basketball coach George Raveling. <a name="T8"></a><a href="#8">8</a>&nbsp;  But "it's better to turn five guilty men loose than it is to convict one innocent man," according to ex-Mississippi executioner and roadside fruit stand operator Thomas Berry Bruce, who ought to know. <a name="T9"></a><a href="#9">9</a>&nbsp;  "It is better to let nine guilty men free than to convict one innocent man," counters lawyer Bruce Rosen from Madison, Wisconsin. <a name="T10"></a><a href="#10">10</a>&nbsp;  Justice Benjamin Cardozo certainly believed in five for execution, <a name="T11"></a><a href="#11">11</a> and allegedly favored ten for imprisonment, <a name="T12"></a><a href="#12">12</a> which is a bit counterintuitive.&nbsp;  Benjamin Franklin thought "that it is better [one hundred] guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent Person should suffer." <a name="T13"></a><a href="#13">13</a>&nbsp;  Mario Puzo's Don Clericuzio heard about letting a hundred guilty men go free and, "struck almost dumb by the beauty of the concept . . . became an ardent patriot." <a name="T14"></a><a href="#14">14</a>&nbsp;  Denver radio talk show host Mike Rosen claims to have heard it argued "in the abstract" that it's better that 1000 guilty men go free than one innocent man be imprisoned, and comments, "Well, we get our wish." <a name="T15"></a><a href="#15">15</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, perhaps, it may be merely "a few," <a name="T16"></a><a href="#16">16</a> "some," <a name="T17"></a><a href="#17">17</a> "several," <a name="T18"></a><a href="#18">18</a> "many" (and particularly more than eight), <a name="T19"></a><a href="#19">19</a> "a considerable amount," <a name="T20"></a><a href="#20">20</a> or even "a goodly number." <a name="T21"></a><a href="#21">21</a>&nbsp;  Not all commentators weigh acquitting the guilty against the conviction of
<cite>one</cite> innocent man.&nbsp;  A Missouri district court said in 1877 that it was "better that some guilty ones should escape than that many innocent persons should be subjected to the expense and disgrace attendant upon being arrested upon a criminal charge." <a name="T22"></a><a href="#22">22</a>&nbsp;  And in Judge Henry J. Friendly's opinion, "Most Americans would allow a
considerable number of guilty persons to go free than to convict any appreciable number of innocent men." <a name="T23"></a><a href="#23">23</a>&nbsp;  It is unclear whether "considerable" is greater or less than "appreciable." <a name="T24"></a><a href="#24">24</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <cite>n</cite> guilty men, then.&nbsp;  The travels and metamorphoses of <i>n</i> through all lands and eras are the stuff that epic miniseries are made of.&nbsp;  <i>n</i> is the father of criminal law.&nbsp;  This is its story.

</p><h3>II. <i>n</i> by Divine Revelation</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abraham's celebrated haggle from the book of Genesis, allegedly written by Moses but also attributed to God, <a name="T25"></a><a href="#25">25</a> provisionally sets a value of <cite>n = (P - 10) / 10</cite>, where <cite>P</cite> is the population of Sodom. <a name="T26"></a><a href="#26">26</a>&nbsp;  However, as it turns out, no innocents were killed in the destruction of Sodom; there were only four righteous people in the city, and they were all saved, though they lost their real estate. <a name="T27"></a><a href="#27">27</a>&nbsp;  Earlier, <a name="T28"></a><a href="#28">28</a> God had killed the entire population of the earth for its wickedness <a name="T29"></a><a href="#29">29</a> except for Noah and his family, <a name="T30"></a><a href="#30">30</a> in a mass capital punishment which, though carried out without benefit of jury or other due process protections, apparently also produced no false positives or false negatives.&nbsp;  It is also said that one day, there will be a massive post-capital punishment, which will also produce no false positives or false negatives. <a name="T31"></a><a href="#31">31</a>&nbsp;  These anecdotes, however, may only be meant to explain criminal procedure for God Himself, Who can do whatever He likes. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commandments for man can be found in the book of Exodus, by the same Author(s), where God rejects the tradeoff between convicting the guilty and convicting the innocent, and simply commands, "the innocent and righteous slay thou not." <a name="T32"></a><a href="#32">32</a>&nbsp;  One can take this to imply an infinite value of <cite>n</cite>, at least in capital cases.&nbsp;  The twelfth-century Judeo-Spanish legal theorist Moses Maimonides, however, interpreted the commandment of Exodus as implying a value of <cite>n = 1000</cite> for execution. <a name="T33"></a><a href="#33">33</a>&nbsp;  He refers to it as the "290th Negative Commandment" and argues that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely "according to the judge's caprice.&nbsp;  Hence the Exalted One has shut this door" <a name="T34"></a><a href="#34">34</a> against the use of presumptive evidence, for "it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death once in a way." <a name="T35"></a><a href="#35">35</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not all gods, however, agree with "the Exalted One."&nbsp;  The Roman emperor Trajan, who was later deified, wrote to Adsidius Severus that a person ought not "to be condemned on suspicion; for it was preferable that the crime of a guilty man should go unpunished than an innocent man be condemned." <a name="T36"></a><a href="#36">36</a>&nbsp;  For the Romans, then, <cite>n = 1</cite> for all cases where a man is "condemned," which includes capital cases. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most celebrated divine commandment related to punishing the innocent is, of course, Blackstone's.&nbsp;  Evidence of Blackstone's divinity is provided by an Arkansas district court, which ruled in 1991 that "Blackstone is, in the law at least, immortal," <a name="T37"></a><a href="#37">37</a> and evidence of His miraculous works by Lord Avonmore, who wrote: "He it was that first gave the law the air of science.&nbsp;  He found it a skeleton, and clothed it with life, color and complexion; he embraced the cold statute, and by his touch it grew into youth, health, and beauty." <a name="T38"></a><a href="#38">38</a>&nbsp;  Blackstone's <cite>n = 10</cite> applies for all cases of suffering, which is a broader category than either Yahweh's or Trajan's. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In Islam," moreover, <cite>n = 1</cite> for punishment, according to Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who was second in line to become leader of Iran during the mid-1980s. <a name="T39"></a><a href="#39">39</a>&nbsp;  One British writer, commenting on the death of innocent bystanders at the hands of police during anti-IRA crackdowns, wrote, "for a Catholic, oddly enough, it may be better to be shot suddenly like that if you are innocent, than if you are guilty" <a name="T40"></a><a href="#40">40</a> (because of the importance of absolution).&nbsp;  However, this view is either not mainstream or not widely advertised.&nbsp;  To date, no major religious wars have been fought over the value of <cite>n</cite>. <a name="T41"></a><a href="#41">41</a>

</p><h3>III. Dating n</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A British editorialist recently surmised that the "bias against punishment" had its roots  in "the most famous of all miscarriages of justice: Christ's crucifixion." <a name="T42"></a><a href="#42">42</a>&nbsp;  In fact, though, people have been mulling over the innocent-guilty tradeoff at least since the ancient Greeks.&nbsp;  Aristotle supposedly wrote that it is a "serious matter to decide that a slave is free, yet it is much more serious to convict a freeman of being a slave," and gave the same judgment, also with <i>n</i> = 1, about convicting innocents of murder. <a name="T43"></a><a href="#43">43</a>&nbsp;  Others date the maxim to the codes of Athens. <a name="T44"></a><a href="#44">44</a>&nbsp;  Deposed Panamanian leader and amateur classical scholar Manuel Noriega has apparently traced the saying, with <i>n</i> = 1 but in the more generalized context of conviction, back to Socrates. <a name="T45"></a><a href="#45">45</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to some researchers, though, the maxim is considerably older.&nbsp;  At least three commentators  --  one Hebrew prophet, one Founding Father and one appellate judge  --  have dated it back to the beginning of time.&nbsp;  Moses' precept, from the book of Exodus, was supposedly handed down from Someone who was around "in the beginning." <a name="T46"></a><a href="#46">46</a>&nbsp;  Benjamin Franklin claims that the maxim, with <cite>n = 100</cite> and for suffering, "has been long and generally approved; never, that I know, controverted." <a name="T47"></a><a href="#47">47</a>&nbsp;  According to Ninth Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, the "popular notion" <a name="T48"></a><a href="#48">48</a> that <cite>n = 10</cite> (for conviction) is just something "we have always said." <a name="T49"></a><a href="#49">49</a>&nbsp;  A then-future U.S. president, John Adams, was more modest and merely dated the saying (with <cite>n = "many"</cite> and for suffering) back to the beginning of laws, saying that "there never was a system of laws in the world, in which this rule did not prevail." <a name="T50"></a><a href="#50">50</a>

</p><h3>IV. <i>n</i> in English History</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the ninth century, King Alfred is said to have hanged a judge for having executed a defendant "when the jurors were in doubt about their verdict, for in cases of doubt one should rather save than condemn." <a name="T51"></a><a href="#51">51</a>&nbsp;  A century later, the laws of King 'thelred the Unready  --  precursors to modern jury procedure  --  provided that twelve thanes (knights) and a
representative of the king would swear upon a relic that they would "accuse no innocent man, nor conceal any guilty one." <a name="T52"></a><a href="#52">52</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1471, English chief justice John Fortescue suggested <cite>n = 20</cite> for execution: "Indeed I would rather wish twenty evil doers to escape death through pity, than one man to be unjustly condemned." <a name="T53"></a><a href="#53">53</a>&nbsp;  It was apparently widely believed in English courts during the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance that it was better to let many guilty men escape than to convict one innocent person, <a name="T54"></a><a href="#54">54</a> and a form of Fortescue's maxim was cited in a 1607 case from the Star Chamber court. <a name="T55"></a><a href="#55">55</a>&nbsp;  In the seventeenth century, Matthew Hale used <cite>n = 5</cite> for execution, "for it is better five guilty persons should escape unpunished, than one innocent person should die." <a name="T56"></a><a href="#56">56</a>&nbsp;  Hale admitted that this doctrine had certain inconveniences; in
particular, that it is hard to get good direct evidence of
witchcraft, so that many undoubtedly guilty persons escape. <a name="T57"></a><a href="#57">57</a>&nbsp;  As Increase Mather put it in 1692, during the Salem witch trials, "it were better that ten suspected Witches should escape, than that one innocent Person should be Condemned." <a name="T58"></a><a href="#58">58</a> </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edward Seymour, in 1696, favored <cite>n = 10</cite> for suffering.&nbsp;  Seymour
reportedly declared, "I am of the same opinion with the Roman, who, in the case of Catiline, declared, he had rather ten guilty persons should escape, than one innocent should suffer"; though Lieutenant General Mordant is said to have replied, "The worthy member who spoke last seems to have forgot, that the Roman who made that declaration was suspected of being a conspirator himself." <a name="T59"></a><a href="#59">59</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, in the 1760s, came Blackstone.&nbsp;  Blackstone, it seems, wrote his
<cite>Commentaries</cite> with a bottle of wine by his side, and his doubling of Hale's <cite>n = 5</cite> may have been a case of "seeing double." <a name="T60"></a><a href="#60">60</a>&nbsp;  The maxim had become part of common law by 1802. <a name="T61"></a><a href="#61">61</a>&nbsp;  By 1823, Blackstone's doctrine had become a "maxim of English law" and was cited in judicial opinions, <a name="T62"></a><a href="#62">62</a> though Thomas Starkie used <cite>n = "ninety-nine (that is, an indefinite number)"</cite> as "the maxim of the law" in his book on evidence only the following year. <a name="T63"></a><a href="#63">63</a>&nbsp;  (For an indefinite number, though, Starkie's ninety-nine seems quite definite.)&nbsp;  John Stuart Mill also allegedly endorsed the maxim in an address to Parliament in 1868. <a name="T64"></a><a href="#64">64</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of late, British courts have taken both the position that <cite>n = 1</cite> <a name="T65"></a><a href="#65">65</a> and that <cite>n = 10</cite>, <a name="T66"></a><a href="#66">66</a> and allegorically refer to the dilemma as "trying to steer between the Scylla of releasing to the world unpunished an obviously guilty man and the Charybdis of upholding the conviction of a possibly innocent one." <a name="T67"></a><a href="#67">67</a>&nbsp;  Some British laymen have been more generous, though.&nbsp;  London Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Peter Imbert has expressed a belief that <cite>n = 100</cite>, <a name="T68"></a><a href="#68">68</a> while ex-police superintendent Ian McKenzie, once a police officer and later a doctor of psychology with the Fort Worth, Texas, police
department, told BBC television that <cite>n = 5000</cite>, leaving some Britons to ask how the ratio can have risen 500 times or more since earlier, more innocent times. <a name="T69"></a><a href="#69">69</a>&nbsp;  "There has been some inflation" since Hale. <a name="T70"></a><a href="#70">70</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxim has apparently made its way throughout the former British empire, to Canada, <a name="T71"></a><a href="#71">71</a> Australia, <a name="T72"></a><a href="#72">72</a> and Hong Kong.&nbsp;  Hong Kong, which has now been returned to China, actually got off to a halting start; in 1857, during the "incident of the poisoned bread," attorney general Thomas Chisholm Anstley said in open court, "Better hang the wrong men than confess that British sagacity and activity have failed to discover the real criminals." <a name="T73"></a><a href="#73">73</a>&nbsp;  More recently, politician Martin Lee, of the United Democratic party, held that <cite>n = 99</cite>, though politician Elsie Tu disagreed: "What I want is justice for that one innocent man, but not a free ride for the [ninety-nine] guilty ones." <a name="T74"></a><a href="#74">74</a>

</p><h3>V. The Innocent Man and His (Its?) Fate</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though the innocent man referred to in the maxim is typically the innocent about to be unjustly punished by the court, this is not always the case.&nbsp;  Thus, one writer, commenting on the fear that a guilty verdict in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial would have provoked riots,
remarked, "[b]etter . . . to let one killer go free than to have more innocents die." <a name="T75"></a><a href="#75">75</a>&nbsp;  Similar sentiments have been expressed on the subject of possible innocent victims of high-speed police chases. <a name="T76"></a><a href="#76">76</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whoever the innocent man is, he can also naturally be an innocent woman.&nbsp;  The
literature, in a less self-conscious time, usually said "man," but today usually says "person" or "defendant."&nbsp;  In the early modern period, many commentators wrote of guilty and innocent "perfons," warning that "prefumptive evidences fhould be warily preffed." <a name="T77"></a><a href="#77">77</a>&nbsp;  What exactly a perfon is may be a fruitful fubject for further refearch. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increase Mather wrote that he "would rather judge a Witch to be an honest woman, than judge an honest woman as a Witch," <a name="T78"></a><a href="#78">78</a> but this is because most witches at the time seem to have been female. <a name="T79"></a><a href="#79">79</a>&nbsp;  One article, on the appropriateness of punishing people with multiple personalities (only one of which may be guilty), points out that "unless one could devise punishments that punished only the guilty self in some body, multiple selves within the same body would face the legal system with the choice between a radically extended system of vicarious responsibility, or not punishing anyone."&nbsp;  The author suggests the maxim, "Better to let ten guilty selves go free than to punish one innocent self." <a name="T80"></a><a href="#80">80</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To avoid charges of speciesism, we must also consider the possibility that the innocent man may not even be human.&nbsp;  Research has revealed that bees also do it.&nbsp;  In 1732, Thomas Fuller established that <cite>n = 2</cite> for perishing  --  "Better two drones be preserv'd than one good bee perish." <a name="T81"></a><a href="#81">81</a>&nbsp;  Fuller, who seems to have been into numbers, also coined the gems, "Better have one plough going than two cradles," "Better two losses than one sorrow," "Better no children than sottish and mad ones," and "A wooden leg is better than no leg." <a name="T82"></a><a href="#82">82</a>&nbsp;  Back to bees, in 1815, Alan Cheales wrote that <cite>n = 5</cite> for starvation <a name="T83"></a><a href="#83">83</a>&nbsp;  --  "Better feed five drones than starve one bee." <a name="T84"></a><a href="#84">84</a>&nbsp;  The gender and species of the innocent man is potentially of great
significance and may be a fruitful topic for further research. </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objects, such as
computers <a name="T85"></a><a href="#85">85</a> and states, <a name="T86"></a><a href="#86">86</a> and certain categories of people, such as saints, <a name="T87"></a><a href="#87">87</a> are typically not entitled to the presumption of innocence. </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The possible fate contemplated for the guilty man is usually acquittal, though Alabama courts have told juries that 1000 guilty men may go "unwhipped of justice," <a name="T88"></a><a href="#88">88</a> and a West Virginia court advocated leaving the guilty "to the
infallible justice of God." <a name="T89"></a><a href="#89">89</a>&nbsp;  The punishment of the innocent man also varies.&nbsp;  There are, of course, the usual suspects: </p><ul> <li>execution (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 5</cite>, <cite>n = 12</cite>, <cite>n = 20</cite>, <cite>n = "hundreds,"</cite> <cite>n = 1000</cite>), <a name="T90"></a><a href="#90">90</a> </li><li>conviction or condemnation (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 5</cite>, <cite>n = 9</cite>, <cite>n = 10</cite>, <cite>n = 12</cite>, <cite>n = 20</cite>, <cite>n = 99</cite>, <cite>n = 100</cite>, <cite>n = 1000</cite>, <cite>n = 5000</cite>, <cite>n = "several,"</cite> <cite>n = "many,"</cite> <cite>n =
"considerable" , "appreciable"</cite>), <a name="T91"></a><a href="#91">91</a> </li><li>imprisonment (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 4</cite>, <cite>n = 10</cite>, <cite>n = 99</cite>, <cite>n = 100</cite>, <cite>n = 1000</cite>), <a name="T92"></a><a href="#92">92</a> </li><li>punishment (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 9</cite>, <cite>n = 90</cite>, <cite>n = 99</cite>, <cite>n = 900</cite>, <cite>n = 1000</cite>, <cite>n = "several,"</cite> <cite>n = "many"</cite>), <a name="T93"></a><a href="#93">93</a> and </li><li>suffering (<cite>n = 10</cite>, <cite>n = 99</cite>, <cite>n = 100</cite>, <cite>n = "many"</cite>). <a name="T94"></a><a href="#94">94</a> </li></ul>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A British court, in 1883, held, in a case often cited in the United States, <a name="T95"></a><a href="#95">95</a> that <cite>n = infinity</cite> for attorneys sued for slander. <a name="T96"></a><a href="#96">96</a>&nbsp;  If the rule were otherwise, the court explained, "the most innocent of counsel might be unrighteously harassed with suits."&nbsp;  Perish the thought that innocent lawyers be unrighteously harassed. <a name="T97"></a><a href="#97">97</a>&nbsp;  We may say the same of <cite>Gregoire v. Biddle</cite>, a 1949 opinion in which Judge Learned Hand explained that we couldn't subject conscientious bureaucrats "to the constant dread of retaliation." <a name="T98"></a><a href="#98">98</a> </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Charles Dickens
generously endorsed a value of <cite>n = "hundreds"</cite> for capital cases, and not just "that hundreds of guilty persons should escape," but that they should escape "scot-free." <a name="T99"></a><a href="#99">99</a>&nbsp;  Dickens was, in fact, so generous that hundreds of guilty persons escaping scot-free was not only better than one innocent person suffering  --  it was even better "than that the possibility of any innocent man or woman having been sacrificed, should present itself, with the least appearance of reason, to the minds of any class of men!" <a name="T100"></a><a href="#100">100</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxim has also been invoked in the context of: </p><ul>
<li>burning an innocent woman for witchcraft (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 10</cite>), <a name="T101"></a><a href="#101">101</a> </li><li>confining a sane man in a mental institution (<cite>n = 3</cite>, <cite>n = 5</cite>), or doing so for life (<cite>n = infinity</cite>), <a name="T102"></a><a href="#102">102</a> </li><li>denying an innocent ABC its day in court (<cite>n = 1</cite>), <a name="T103"></a><a href="#103">103</a> </li><li>denying meritorious religious claims (<cite>n = "a few"</cite> under the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, <cite>n = "a goodly number"</cite> under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act), <a name="T104"></a><a href="#104">104</a> </li><li>facing the executioner (<cite>n =
1</cite>), <a name="T105"></a><a href="#105">105</a> and
</li><li>introducing a precedent "which may press hardly hereafter on the innocent" (<cite>n = 1</cite>). <a name="T106"></a><a href="#106">106</a> </li></ul>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, such blithe invocation could easily lead too far down the road to
"inconsiderate folly" and "pestiferous nonsense."&nbsp;  As one author noted, there is "nothing so dangerous as a maxim": <a name="T107"></a><a href="#107">107</a>

</p><blockquote>
Better that any number of savings-banks be robbed than that one innocent person be condemned as a burglar!  Better that any number of innocent men, women, and children should be waylaid, robbed, ravished, and murdered by wicked, wilful, and depraved malefactors, than that one innocent person should be convicted and punished for the perpetration of one of this infinite multitude of crimes, by an intelligent and well-meaning though mistaken court and jury!  Better any amount of crime than one mistake in well-meant endeavors to suppress or prevent it! <a name="T108"></a><a href="#108">108</a> </blockquote>

<h3>VI. Characterizing n</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Commentators most often call the "<cite>n</cite> guilty men" maxim a "maxim." <a name="T109"></a><a href="#109">109</a>&nbsp;  It is a "general maxim" (<cite>n = 10</cite>).&nbsp;  An "old maxim" (<cite>n = 10</cite>).&nbsp;  A "benign maxim" (<cite>n = 99</cite>).&nbsp;  A "Maxim, that has been long and generally approved" (<cite>n = 100</cite>).&nbsp;  A maxim that has been listed in a case reporter in a special section called "Maxims" (<cite>n = 10</cite>). <a name="T110"></a><a href="#110">110</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they are not calling it a maxim, however, legal commentators differ on the nature of the "<cite>n</cite> guilty men" notion.&nbsp;  At times, it is
considered an element of folklore, such as an "adage" (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 12</cite>), an "old adage" (<cite>n = 1</cite>, <cite>n = 10</cite>, <cite>n = 100</cite>), or an "ancient and honored adage" (<cite>n = 10</cite>). <a name="T111"></a><a href="#111">111</a>&nbsp;  It has, alternatively, been described as a historical phenomenon, such as an "age-old tradition" (<cite>n = 1</cite>). <a name="T112"></a><a href="#112">112</a>&nbsp;  It runs the gamut from being "perhaps not an unreasonable assumption" (<cite>n = 10</cite>) <a name="T113"></a><a href="#113">113</a> to being a "sense of comparative evil" (<cite>n = 100</cite>). <a name="T114"></a><a href="#114">114</a>&nbsp;  It is also,
sometimes, an item of food, specifically a "chestnut" (<cite>n = 10</cite>). <a name="T115"></a><a href="#115">115</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Less grandly, the maxim has also been called "a propagandistic `noble lie' and myth" (<cite>n = 10</cite>), <a name="T116"></a><a href="#116">116</a> or "bunk" and "a pious platitude of some old maid sop" (<cite>n = 99</cite>). <a name="T117"></a><a href="#117">117</a>

</p><h3>VII. <i>n</i> among Economists and Foreigners</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The idea that letting some number of guilty men go is better than punishing an innocent man is not confined to the Anglo-American legal tradition.&nbsp;  It seems to be widely recognized among economists  --  "the disutility of convicting an innocent person far exceeds the disutility of finding a guilty person to be not guilty," as (only) an economist might say. <a name="T118"></a><a href="#118">118</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even foreigners believe it.&nbsp;  In 1824, Thomas Fielding cited the principle as an Italian proverb. <a name="T119"></a><a href="#119">119</a>&nbsp;  The French apparently agree; as Jean de La Bruyère put it, "A guilty man punished is an example for the rabble; an innocent man condemned is a matter for all honest people." <a name="T120"></a><a href="#120">120</a>&nbsp;  The French have rather consistently gone with <cite>n = 1</cite>. <a name="T121"></a><a href="#121">121</a>&nbsp;  Voltaire has been cited as favoring <cite>n = 1</cite> <a name="T122"></a><a href="#122">122</a> (sometimes translated into English as <cite>n = 2</cite>) <a name="T123"></a><a href="#123">123</a> and <cite>n = 100</cite>; <a name="T124"></a><a href="#124">124</a> apparently, the French seem to have sided with the most conservative of the Voltairean traditions.&nbsp;  While Europeans seldom agree on anything, the French and the Italians even agree with the Germans on this point. <a name="T125"></a><a href="#125">125</a> Johann Wolfgang von Goethe once said he would "rather commit an injustice than suffer a disorder," which, in his context, came out to the same thing. <a name="T126"></a><a href="#126">126</a>&nbsp;  Moreover, similar sentiments have been found in Mexico and among Spanish speakers in the United States. <a name="T127"></a><a href="#127">127</a>

</p><h3>VIII. <i>n</i> Skeptics</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeremy Bentham, founder of utilitarianism, warned against the warm fuzzy feeling that comes from large values of <cite>n</cite>:

</p><blockquote>
We must be on guard against those sentimental exaggerations which tend to give crime impunity, under the pretext of insuring the safety of innocence.&nbsp;  Public applause has been, so to speak, set up to auction.&nbsp;  At first it was said to be better to save several guilty men, than to condemn a single innocent man; others, to make the maxim more striking, fix the number ten; a third made this ten a hundred, and a fourth made it a thousand.&nbsp;  All these candidates for the prize of humanity have been outstripped by I know not how many writers, who hold, that, in no case, ought an accused person to be condemned, unless evidence amount to
mathematical or absolute certainty.&nbsp;  According to this maxim, nobody ought to be punished, lest an innocent man be punished. <a name="T128"></a><a href="#128">128</a> </blockquote>
&lt;
p&gt;
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some less theoretical minds went somewhat further in their skepticism toward the <i>n</i> maxim.&nbsp;  German chancellor Otto von Bismarck is said to have remarked that "it is better that ten innocent men suffer than one guilty man escape." <a name="T129"></a><a href="#129">129</a>&nbsp;  Feliks Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Soviet secret police, saw Bismarck's motto and raised him an execution: "Better to execute ten innocent men than to leave one guilty man alive." <a name="T130"></a><a href="#130">130</a>&nbsp;  Dzerzhinsky
apparently did not elaborate on the rationale for this sort of treatment.&nbsp;  Nor did Nikolai Yezhov, one of his like-minded successors, <a name="T131"></a><a href="#131">131</a> except to quote the Russian proverb, "When you cut down the forest, woodchips fly." <a name="T132"></a><a href="#132">132</a>&nbsp;  For more information, the interested reader is referred to Major Nungo, a Colombian military prosecutor, who said, "For us military men, everybody is guilty until proved otherwise. . . .&nbsp;  Better to condemn an innocent man than to acquit a guilty one, because among the innocent condemned there may be a guilty man." <a name="T133"></a><a href="#133">133</a> <p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The military motif appears quite often among <cite>n</cite>-skeptics.&nbsp;  Back in England, James Fitzjames Stephen suggested that Blackstone's maxim

</p><blockquote>
resembles a suggestion that soldiers should be armed with bad guns because it is better that they should miss ten enemies than that they should hit one friend. . . .&nbsp;  Everything depends on what the guilty men have been doing, and something depends on the way in which the innocent man came to be suspected. <a name="T134"></a><a href="#134">134</a> </blockquote>

<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the same theme, William Paley suggested that "he who falls by a mistaken sentence may be considered as falling for his country." <a name="T135"></a><a href="#135">135</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of patriots, aiming guns, and falling for one's country, Irish Republican Army activity often turns people against the maxim.&nbsp;  One British writer asked what use <cite>n = 10</cite> was "if those [ten] guilty men use their freedom to plant a bomb that kills [a hundred] schoolchildren." <a name="T136"></a><a href="#136">136</a>&nbsp;  Another observer writes about <cite>n = 1000</cite>, blending judicial theory with gastronomy: "With memories of the Guildford Four and the Birmingham Six that, no doubt, is an admirable precept; but it does not tell us who precisely benefits from the liberty of the lucky thousand, with their Semtex and their icing sugar-ammonium nitrate confectionery of murder." <a name="T137"></a><a href="#137">137</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not that Bentham himself was anything like that.&nbsp;  In one of his tirades on judges who hear cases of tax law, he said:

</p><blockquote>
Of the class to which he belongs, and by the sympathy with which he is engrossed, it is the interest that the mass of wealth extracted from the labour of the labouring class be as great as possible: the greater it is, the more there is of it to enrich them, and
encourage others.&nbsp;  Rather than see one guilty individual escape, what number of innocent ones he would see suffer, it is not so easy to say. <a name="T138"></a><a href="#138">138</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bentham actually tried to precisely quantify burdens of proof.&nbsp;  His suggestions have been called "fantastic," and not in a good way. <a name="T139"></a><a href="#139">139</a>

</p><h3>IX. Federal <i>n</i> Law</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; American jurisprudence is contradictory and tormented on the subject of <i>n</i> guilty men.&nbsp;  The Supreme Court first commented on the issue in 1895, when the majority opinion in <cite>Coffin v. United States</cite> <a name="T140"></a><a href="#140">140</a> cited Athenian law, Trajan, Fortescue, Hale, and Blackstone all at once, to underscore the long history of the presumption of innocence, but refused to commit to an actual number.&nbsp;  The Court did not revisit the issue until <cite>Henry v. United States</cite> (1959), which established that "it is better, so the Fourth Amendment teaches, that the guilty sometimes go free than that citizens be subject to easy arrest." <a name="T141"></a><a href="#141">141</a> </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virtually all of the Supreme Court-level <cite>n</cite>-guilty-men jurisprudence was created in the 1970s, starting with <cite>In re Winship</cite> (1970). <a name="T142"></a><a href="#142">142</a>&nbsp;  The majority opinion in <cite>Winship</cite> stated, somewhat
noncommitally, that "it is critical that the moral force of the criminal law not be diluted by a standard of proof that leaves people in doubt whether innocent men are being condemned." <a name="T143"></a><a href="#143">143</a>&nbsp;  Justice Harlan's concurring opinion, though, was much stronger and has been more widely cited.&nbsp;  "I view the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case," Justice Harlan wrote, "as bottomed on a fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free." <a name="T144"></a><a href="#144">144</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both opinions in
<cite>Winship</cite> established <cite>n = 1</cite>; even though Harlan's concurrence said convicting an innocent man was "far worse" than letting a guilty man go free, the Court recognized in <cite>Patterson v. New York</cite> (1977) that the risk society bears in protecting the innocent "is not without limits; and Mr. Justice Harlan's aphorism provides little guidance for determining what those limits are." <a name="T145"></a><a href="#145">145</a>&nbsp;  The value <cite>n = 10</cite> was suggested in Justice Marshall's concurring opinion in <cite>Furman v. Georgia</cite> (1972), <a name="T146"></a><a href="#146">146</a> but <cite>n = 10</cite> did not appear in a majority opinion until Justice Blackmun, in <cite>Ballew v. Georgia</cite> (1978), <a name="T147"></a><a href="#147">147</a> called it "perhaps not an unreasonable assumption." <a name="T148"></a><a href="#148">148</a>&nbsp;  <cite>Ballew</cite>'s mild language did not overrule <cite>Winship</cite>, which continued to be cited during the 1980s. <a name="T149"></a><a href="#149">149</a> </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Supreme Court has also declined to extend the presumption against wrongful conviction to the context of civil commitment.&nbsp;  In <cite>Addington v. Texas</cite> (1979), <a name="T150"></a><a href="#150">150</a> Chief Justice Burger wrote that the interests of people wrongfully committed to a mental institution would be protected by the "concern of family and friends."&nbsp;  "Moreover," Chief Justice Burger wrote, "it is not true that the release of a genuinely mentally ill person is no worse for the individual than the failure to convict the guilty.&nbsp;  One who is suffering from a
debilitating mental illness and in need of treatment is neither wholly at liberty nor free of stigma. . . .&nbsp;  It cannot be said, therefore, that it is much better for a mentally ill person to `go free' than for a mentally normal person to be committed." <a name="T151"></a><a href="#151">151</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Fifth, <a name="T152"></a><a href="#152">152</a> Eighth, <a name="T153"></a><a href="#153">153</a> and Eleventh <a name="T154"></a><a href="#154">154</a> Circuits' rulings have been consistent with those of the Supreme Court.&nbsp;  The Federal, Third, Fourth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits have apparently never ruled on the issue (though district courts in the Third, <a name="T155"></a><a href="#155">155</a> Fourth, <a name="T156"></a><a href="#156">156</a> and Sixth <a name="T157"></a><a href="#157">157</a> Circuits have dealt with the question).&nbsp;  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits have had dissents and concurrences dealing with the question, <a name="T158"></a><a href="#158">158</a> but have never addressed it in a majority opinion. <a name="T159"></a><a href="#159">159</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other circuits have gone their own way (presumably unconstitutionally).&nbsp;  The First Circuit ruled once on the issue, establishing <cite>n = 10</cite> in 1989. <a name="T160"></a><a href="#160">160</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1829, before the Supreme Court had entered the lists  --  and even before the creation of the D.C. Circuit  --  a D.C. court cited Matthew Hale's <cite>n = 5</cite>.&nbsp;  The court also pointed out that if Hale's opinion had been required, "there can be no doubt that his patriotism would have prompted him to say, that it is better that ten guilty persons should escape punishment, than that any one of those rules of the common law which were adopted for the protection of the personal liberty and safety of the subject or citizen, should be abrogated." <a name="T161"></a><a href="#161">161</a>&nbsp;  <cite>n = 5</cite> or even <cite>n = 10</cite>, then, for abrogating common law rules.&nbsp;  In the general criminal context, the D.C. Circuit restated this as <cite>n = "some"</cite> in 1975, <a name="T162"></a><a href="#162">162</a> and narrowed it down to <cite>n = 10</cite> in 1976. <a name="T163"></a><a href="#163">163</a>&nbsp;  The D.C. Circuit also established <cite>n = 1</cite> for the purpose of allowing ABC to go to court. <a name="T164"></a><a href="#164">164</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Second Circuit began its <cite>n</cite>-jurisprudence with <cite>n = 1</cite> in 1949, <a name="T165"></a><a href="#165">165</a> as a way of preempting liability for public officials.&nbsp;  In 1926, <a name="T166"></a><a href="#166">166</a> the Second Circuit had tried to adopt the British rule, from <cite>Munster v. Lamb</cite> (1883), <a name="T167"></a><a href="#167">167</a> that <cite>n = infinity</cite> for attorneys sued for slander, but this was fortunately a dissent.&nbsp;  A 1969 concurrence <a name="T168"></a><a href="#168">168</a> stated that <cite>n = 99</cite>, but the first actual ruling in a squarely criminal case did not come until 1989, <a name="T169"></a><a href="#169">169</a> which cited Blackstone and set <cite>n = 10</cite>.&nbsp;  The Second Circuit is also at odds with the Supreme Court on the value of confining the mentally ill, and granted in 1992 <a name="T170"></a><a href="#170">170</a> that while <cite>n = 10</cite> may be too high in the context of civil commitment, <i>n</i> is still greater than one, and is perhaps three or five. <a name="T171"></a><a href="#171">171</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Military courts, which have their own rules, ruled in 1951 that <cite>n = 5</cite>, <a name="T172"></a><a href="#172">172</a> but scaled <i>n</i> down to one in 1957 <a name="T173"></a><a href="#173">173</a> and have kept it there ever since. <a name="T174"></a><a href="#174">174</a>

</p><h3>X. State <i>n</i> Law</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Table 1 gives a state-by-state breakdown of values of <i>n</i> for 45 states.&nbsp;  Twenty-one states have not ruled on the matter; two have ruled, but not in a majority opinion; of the remaining twenty-seven, twenty-two have pretty much settled on some value of <cite>n</cite>.&nbsp;  This leaves the weirdoes Alabama, California, New York, Ohio, and Virginia. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alabama has gone from <cite>n = "many,"</cite> <a name="T175"></a><a href="#175">175</a> passing briefly through <cite>n = 1</cite>, <a name="T176"></a><a href="#176">176</a> to <cite>n = 5</cite> in recent years. <a name="T177"></a><a href="#177">177</a>&nbsp;  An Alabama court, in 1890, rejected the maxim, but this is not characteristic of Alabama jurisprudence. <a name="T178"></a><a href="#178">178</a>&nbsp;  Also, according to Alabama courts, "it is better that a guilty man should escape than that a precedent should be introduced which may press hardly hereafter on the innocent." <a name="T179"></a><a href="#179">179</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; California began its <cite>n</cite>-jurisprudence in 1904 by critiquing the maxim as being "argumentative" when presented to a jury. <a name="T180"></a><a href="#180">180</a>&nbsp;  But California courts soon entered the fray, with an <cite>n = 10</cite> dissent in 1928 <a name="T181"></a><a href="#181">181</a> and an <cite>n = 1</cite> majority opinion in 1934. <a name="T182"></a><a href="#182">182</a>&nbsp;  California law continued to be <cite>n = 1</cite> through the 1960s, <a name="T183"></a><a href="#183">183</a> until it was overturned to <cite>n = 10</cite> by <cite>In re Dean</cite> (1970). <a name="T184"></a><a href="#184">184</a>&nbsp;  This new value of <i>n</i> remained through the 1980s and 1990s. <a name="T185"></a><a href="#185">185</a>&nbsp;  California courts also ruled that <cite>n = infinity</cite> in attorney slander cases, <a name="T186"></a><a href="#186">186</a> that <cite>n &gt; 1/54</cite> for civil commitment, <a name="T187"></a><a href="#187">187</a> and that <cite>n &lt; 10</cite> where parents' infant daughters are accusing them of pedophilia. <a name="T188"></a><a href="#188">188</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New York started out in <cite>People v. Barrett</cite> (1805) with <cite>n = 1</cite>, <a name="T189"></a><a href="#189">189</a> and stayed with this number for over half a century.&nbsp;  The confusion began in 1858, when <cite>Ruloff v. The People</cite> changed this to <cite>n = "many"</cite> and <cite>n = 5</cite> (at the same time). <a name="T190"></a><a href="#190">190</a>&nbsp;  Since then, <i>n</i> has vacillated between <cite>n = 1</cite>, <a name="T191"></a><a href="#191">191</a> <cite>n = 5</cite>, <a name="T192"></a><a href="#192">192</a> <cite>n = 10</cite>, <a name="T193"></a><a href="#193">193</a> <cite>n = 99</cite>, <a name="T194"></a><a href="#194">194</a> <cite>n = "some,"</cite> <a name="T195"></a><a href="#195">195</a> and <cite>n = "many."</cite> <a name="T196"></a><a href="#196">196</a>&nbsp;  The status of <i>n</i> in New York is therefore uncertain. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ohio has been a
consistently <cite>n = 99</cite> ("ninety-nine") state since <cite>Silver v. State</cite> (1848). <a name="T197"></a><a href="#197">197</a>&nbsp;  The steady stream of cases reaffirming <cite>n = 99</cite> (<cite>n = "ninety and nine,"</cite> <a name="T198"></a><a href="#198">198</a> <cite>n =
"ninetynine"</cite> <a name="T199"></a><a href="#199">199</a>) had only been broken by one <cite>n = "many"</cite> case, <cite>Robbins v. State</cite> (1857), <a name="T200"></a><a href="#200">200</a> which is consistent with <cite>n = 99</cite>.&nbsp;  However, in 1963, <cite>State v. Hill</cite> scaled the number down to <cite>n = "a few."</cite>&nbsp;  It is unclear how much "a few" is, but it is probably less than ninety-nine.&nbsp;  Moreover, "a few" only applies to capital cases, which is highly counterintuitive. </p><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virginia has reluctantly recognized <cite>n = 99</cite> since <cite>McCue v.
Commonwealth</cite> (1905) ("We have no fault to find with the expression as a rhetorical phrase" <a name="T201"></a><a href="#201">201</a>) for criminal cases in general, but considers the proper value of <i>n</i> to be somewhat lower than ninety-nine for cases of housebreaking. <a name="T202"></a><a href="#202">202</a>

</p><h3>XI. Advice for Criminals</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criminals, therefore, are advised to go to New Mexico (<cite>n = 99</cite>) or Oklahoma (<cite>n = 100</cite>).&nbsp;  Criminals who had planned on going to Ohio or Virginia, hoping to find <cite>n = 99</cite> there, may want to reconsider.&nbsp;  Criminals who like to live on the edge may want to take their chances with <cite>n = "many"</cite> in Idaho, Kentucky, New Jersey, or Rhode Island.&nbsp;  They may also want to try out New York, but this could be risky. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Criminals who are planning to violate federal law should go to the D.C. Circuit or the Second Circuit (which contains Connecticut, New York, and Vermont).&nbsp;  The abnormally high crime rate in Washington, D.C. (41% higher than that of its nearest competitor, Florida, and 72% higher than the ninety-fifth percentile of state crime rates) suggests that many criminals already have gone there.&nbsp;  To be on the safe side, criminals who go to D.C. to violate federal law should run for public office. <a name="T203"></a><a href="#203">203</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whether there really is a relationship between high values of <i>n</i> and high crime rates is controversial.&nbsp;  "Tough-on-crime" types believe that there is a positive relationship between <i>n</i> and <cite>c</cite>, or that high values of <i>n</i>&nbsp;  --  a high presumption of innocence  --  lead to high values of <cite>c</cite>  --  an increased incidence of crime.&nbsp;  Others believe, however, that <i>n</i> and <cite>c</cite> are negatively related  --  that punishment may be counterproductive, and that low values of <i>n</i> can lead to high values of <cite>c</cite>.&nbsp;  We would like to find a mathematical function that relates <i>n</i> and <cite>c</cite>, for example, <cite>c = an + b</cite>, to know precisely how different values of <i>n</i> will affect
<cite>c</cite>.&nbsp;  Unfortunately, we do not know at the outset what form this function will take.&nbsp;  It may, for instance, look like <cite>1 / c = an squared + b</cite>, or <cite>ln c = a / <i>n</i> + b</cite>.&nbsp;  Standard statistical programs <a name="T204"></a><a href="#204">204</a> can tell us the values of <cite>a</cite> and <cite>b</cite> that best fit the data, but first we must guess at the precise form of the function.&nbsp;  We tried different possible mathematical functions until we found a
functional form that fit the data better than others.&nbsp;  Using values of <i>n</i> as revealed by state court opinions, and FBI data on crime rates in different states, <a name="T205"></a><a href="#205">205</a> our trial-and-error method yields the following possible model:

</p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <cite>c squared = -1,251,677 ln <i>n</i> + 30,217,466</cite>

</p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <cite>c</cite> is measured in cases per 100,000 population.&nbsp;  The numbers  --  in this case, -1,251,677 and 30,217,466  --  were chosen to make the equation fit the real-world numbers as closely as
possible.&nbsp;  In this model, <i>n</i> and <cite>c</cite> are negatively related  --  as <i>n</i> (the presumption of innocence) goes up, <cite>c</cite> (the crime rate) goes down. <a name="T206"></a><a href="#206">206</a>&nbsp;  Knowing <i>n</i> allows us to predict <cite>c</cite>, and, conversely, knowing current crime rates, <cite>c</cite>, allows us to know
<cite>n</cite>, that is, to tell how strong the presumption of innocence is. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The current national crime rate is 5,482.9 crimes per 100,000.&nbsp;  Setting <cite>c = 5,482.9</cite>, we find that <cite>n = 1.132</cite>  --  a slight presumption of innocence.&nbsp;  If Blackstone were in charge of the criminal justice system, of course, <i>n</i> would be 10, and so <cite>c</cite> would be 5,228.3 crimes per 100,000, about 4.6% better than the current rate. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The data, however, are inconclusive.&nbsp;  Another model, which fits the data about as well, <a name="T207"></a><a href="#207">207</a> instead shows <i>n</i> and <cite>c</cite> positively related  --  with crime rates going up as the presumption of innocence increases:

     <cite>1 / c squared = - (5.6 ' 10^-10 ln n) + (4.75 '
10^-8)</cite> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this model, the Blackstonian crime rate  --  the value of <cite>c</cite>
corresponding to <cite>n = 10</cite>  --  is 4,651.9.&nbsp;  Setting <cite>c = 5,482.9</cite>, the national average, we find that the corresponding value of <i>n</i> is 1.0967 ' 10^11, or approximately 109,670,000,000 (109.67 billion guilty men acquitted for every one innocent man convicted).&nbsp;  That's a lot of presumption of innocence. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A definitive choice between these models must await further empirical evidence. <a name="T208"></a><a href="#208">208</a>

</p><h3>XII. The Future of n</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have seen where <i>n</i> has come from.&nbsp;  Where is <i>n</i> going? <a name="T209"></a><a href="#209">209</a>&nbsp;  Similar statistical methods allow us to determine the evolution of the presumption of innocence over time.&nbsp;  Using all U.S. judicial majority decisions as our data set, <a name="T210"></a><a href="#210">210</a> we can use the following model to predict future values of <i>n</i> based on the year <cite>y</cite>:

     <cite>ln <i>n</i> = -0.00123 y + 3.17</cite>

</p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Setting <cite>n = 1</cite> (in other words, <cite>ln <i>n</i> = 0</cite>), we can determine the year in which we can expect the presumption of innocence to disappear in the United States. <a name="T211"></a><a href="#211">211</a>&nbsp;  The model predicts that this will happen in the year 2586. <a name="T212"></a><a href="#212">212</a>&nbsp;  But note that other models are equally consistent with the
data.&nbsp;  The following model suggests that <i>n</i> and <cite>y</cite> have a linear relationship to each other:

     <cite>n = 0.234 y - 408</cite>

</p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This model fits the data equally well, <a name="T213"></a><a href="#213">213</a> but indicates gradually <cite>increasing</cite> values of
<cite>n</cite>, and suggests that at the inception of the United States, <i>n</i> was 11.04.&nbsp;  This value is consistent with Blackstone's, which seems reasonable, since Blackstone was writing at about the same time, and since the English legal system
prevailed in the colonies.&nbsp;  The model also shows that the current value of <i>n</i> is about 59.72. <a name="T214"></a><a href="#214">214</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitively choosing between these models must await further empirical evidence.

</p><h3>XIII. Conclusion</h3>
<p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Juvenal <a name="T215"></a><a href="#215">215</a> and Goethe <a name="T216"></a><a href="#216">216</a> believed that the guilty are never <cite>really</cite> acquitted.&nbsp;  To such people, the question is somewhat moot.&nbsp;  Franz Kafka doubted the existence of guilt; <a name="T217"></a><a href="#217">217</a> Archibald MacLeish doubted the existence of innocence. <a name="T218"></a><a href="#218">218</a>&nbsp;  Albert Camus doubted both, <a name="T219"></a><a href="#219">219</a> and Pontius Pilate doubted truth. <a name="T220"></a><a href="#220">220</a>&nbsp;  To these, too, our question cannot help but be a little beside the
point.&nbsp;  Still others sidestep the issue, as in the case of former British prime minister John Major, who told a Tory party conference that it is better to put the guilty behind bars than to imprison the innocent in their homes. <a name="T221"></a><a href="#221">221</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Others take a still different tack.&nbsp;  Just convict all the guilty and acquit all the innocent, <a name="T222"></a><a href="#222">222</a> say letter writers, <a name="T223"></a><a href="#223">223</a> state supreme courts, <a name="T224"></a><a href="#224">224</a> Ulysses S. Grant, <a name="T225"></a><a href="#225">225</a> and the Chinese. <a name="T226"></a><a href="#226">226</a>&nbsp;  Blackstone's maxim "supposes a dilemma which does not exist: the security of the innocent may be complete, without favouring the impunity of crime," <a name="T227"></a><a href="#227">227</a> said Jeremy
Bentham.&nbsp;  "The law recognizes no such comparison of numbers," the Alabama Supreme Court has reasoned (debatably), adding (perhaps more soundly) that "the tendency of such a charge, unexplained, is to mislead" jurors; it has often upheld trial courts' decisions not to offer the maxim, holding that the maxim is "merely
argumentative." <a name="T228"></a><a href="#228">228</a>&nbsp;  Other state supreme courts, including those of California <a name="T229"></a><a href="#229">229</a> and Illinois, <a name="T230"></a><a href="#230">230</a> have agreed.&nbsp;  Thomas Starkie called the notion that "moral probabilities could ever be represented by numbers . . . and thus subjected to arithmetical analysis . . . chimerical," but that did not stop him from
developing such an analysis anyway. <a name="T231"></a><a href="#231">231</a> </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To those who accept the fundamental logic of the proposition, however, ten still seems to be the most popular choice, even though, as Susan Estrich reminds us, these ten guilty men may not be "right or macho or manly." <a name="T232"></a><a href="#232">232</a>&nbsp;  That Justice William O. Douglas' version of the maxim <a name="T233"></a><a href="#233">233</a> is often cited in connection with the O.J. Simpson verdict, <a name="T234"></a><a href="#234">234</a> and appears most prominently in a case where the petitioner is named Furman, <a name="T235"></a><a href="#235">235</a> is potentially of great significance and may be a fruitful topic for further
research. </p><p>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The maxim has been "so long in use as to be deemed a mere sound, signifying nothing." <a name="T236"></a><a href="#236">236</a>&nbsp;  Thus, in the 1940s, two Alabama defendants (unsuccessfully) tried to have their juries given simultaneous instructions that <cite>n = infinity</cite> and <cite>n = "many,"</cite> that is, "that no innocent person should be convicted and that it is better that many guilty go unpunished than one innocent person be convicted." <a name="T237"></a><a href="#237">237</a>&nbsp;  Nonetheless, all innocent readers who have never been convicted may now take a moment to thank
Blackstone's maxim for having inspired Western criminal law.&nbsp;  All guilty readers who have been acquitted may do so too. </p><div><p>      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The story is told of a Chinese law professor, who was listening to a British lawyer explain that Britons were so enlightened, they believed it was better that ninety-nine guilty men go free than that one innocent man be executed.&nbsp;  The Chinese professor thought for a second and asked, "Better for whom?" <a name="T238"></a><a href="#238">238</a></p></div><hr>

probability of guilty persons being detected and convicted that we can allow humane doubt to prevail over security.&nbsp;  But we must never forget that ideally the acquittal of ten guilty persons is exactly ten times as great a failure of justice as the conviction of one innocent person."&nbsp;  Allen, <cite>supra</cite> note 56 at 286-287.

<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/ESP32-COOP">COOP-DOOR</a> project aims to create an intelligent and user-friendly automatic coop door system. It empowers users to customize the door's behavior based on specific conditions, such as time and light levels. To facilitate device management and monitoring, the project offers a mobile app.</p>
<p dir="auto">The app enables users to track device and sensor health, as well as configure various operating conditions. For a demonstration of the project, please refer to the demo <a href="https://github.com/ESP32-COOP/ESP32-COOP-DOOR-WEB">here</a>. The core of the smart coop door relies on the ESP-32 platform, and the code repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/ESP32-COOP/ESP32-COOP-DOOR-CORE">here</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This documentation page aims to guide users through the setup process, hardware requirements, and detailed workings of the system.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">📱 App Installation</h2>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37497007/257199071-8056a93b-1d68-41e8-b1e9-84ded7e0bde6.png"><img width="100" alt="app icon" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37497007/257199071-8056a93b-1d68-41e8-b1e9-84ded7e0bde6.png"></a>
<br clear="right">
The coop door application is a Progressive Web App, meaning it functions as a website and can be installed on mobile devices for offline usage.
<p dir="auto">To install the app, follow these steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Visit <a href="https://coop-door.vercel.app/" rel="nofollow">coop-door.vercel.app</a> using your mobile device's web browser.</li>
<li>A small popup will prompt you to install the app. Tap "Install" to proceed.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if the popup doesn't appear, you can manually add the app to your home screen by:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Tapping the three dots in Chrome.</li>
<li>Scrolling down and selecting "Add shortcut to home screen" or "Install app."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The app will be installed on your device and accessible from the home screen.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Now, you can conveniently use the mobile app to monitor and control your coop door system, even without an internet connection.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🧰 Build instruction</h2>
<p dir="auto">Look out for instruction variations depending on the version of the project you're building.</p>
<p dir="auto">First of all, you will need to flash the firmware on the ESP32. Please refer to the instructions <a href="https://github.com/ESP32-COOP/ESP32-COOP-DOOR-CORE">here</a>. I do recommend unplugging the motor before flashing the firmware to avoid any connection problems caused by the encoder or any accidental movement of the powered motor.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">🚀 Initial Setup</h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Before Coop Installation:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">It's a good idea to run comprehensive tests before installing the device in the coop. Debugging is much easier and less frustrating when you're comfortably situated in a well-ventilated room.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Initial ESP32 Boot:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">When the ESP32 boots up initially, it assumes the door is closed. If that's not the case, unplug either the motor or the ESP and manually close the door.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Proper Device Boot:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Now you can properly start up your device. Inside the app, go to settings and then to the door section. Set the number of rotations you want the motor to perform in order to open the door. Click the test button, and the motor will complete a full cycle (going up and then back down). Begin with a small rotation number, and gradually adjust it until you reach your desired door height.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Optimal Rotation Value:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Once you've figured out the best number of motor rotations, jot down this value along with the light sensor reading. To sync the ESP32's time, head to the app's home page and click on the time badge. A panel will appear, showing the time difference between your phone and the ESP32, along with a sync button.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Setting Conditions:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">With that sorted, configure open and closing conditions in the door settings. Base these conditions solely on time, and set the door to stay open for the rest of the day.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Chicken Entry Time:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Return to the coop at the designated chicken entry time to check the light sensor value. If needed, adjust the closing condition within the app's settings.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Autonomous Operation:</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">To enable autonomous operation, revisit the settings and door page. Click on 'auto' and then 'apply'.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">📢 BLE Protocol</h2>
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37497007/257621080-77d5236b-3843-43ea-ab0d-cbb7d245f219.png"><img width="100" alt="BLE illustration" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37497007/257621080-77d5236b-3843-43ea-ab0d-cbb7d245f219.png"></a>
<br clear="right">
To better understand the following, you must understand the basics of the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol.<br>
The key part to understand is that it uses a fixed-size array of bytes to send data to an endpoint.
<p dir="auto">Each endpoint can have three properties: writable, readable, and notifyable.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Writable: It allows the external user to write/edit the endpoint (officially called characteristic in BLE).</li>
<li>Readable: It allows reading the characteristic's value.</li>
<li>Notifyable: It allows getting notified when that value is updated.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">A byte is made out of 8 bits, and its value can go from 0 to 255.</p>
<p dir="auto">To send the desired value in bytes, you must think it through:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>You will need to figure out the array size you will need and the function to convert it back and forth in C and in JS.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Currently, there are five communication subjects:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>The light sensor (made out of 4 bytes).</li>
<li>The time (made out of 9 bytes, 8 to represent UNIX time and 1 to represent the UTC offset).</li>
<li>The closing condition</li>
<li>The opening condition</li>
<li>Door settings</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">💡 Data size</h2>
<p dir="auto">With BLE the goal is to send the smallest array posible</p>
<p dir="auto">for each communication subjects i will justify each bytes and explain it's encoding</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The light sensor</strong> produces 4 bytes of data. Our objective is to transmit the current value, along with the minimum and maximum values recorded by the sensor. To achieve this, we need an additional variable called a "divider." The maximum sensor value is fixed at 1024, while the highest value representable by a byte is 255.</p>
<p dir="auto">Calculating the divider is straightforward: we divide the maximum sensor value of 1024 by 255. This gives us the scaling factor needed for our encoding.</p>
<p dir="auto">With the divider in hand, we can create an encoded transmission as follows:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Current Value: current_value / divider</li>
<li>Minimum Value: min_value / divider</li>
<li>Maximum Value: max_value / divider</li>
<li>Unused Placeholder: (for the divider value)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Reverting back to the original values is easy: simply multiply by the divider. This process maintains the integrity of the data throughout the encoding and decoding stages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The time</strong> use 9 bytes The initial 8 bytes encode the UNIX time, while the ninth byte stores the user's country time offset.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Encoding UNIX Time</strong>:
To encode the UNIX time:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Begin by taking the lowest 8 bits of the time value using a bitwise AND operation with 0xff.</li>
<li>Place this extracted value in the current byte of the array.</li>
<li>Divide the time value by 256 to discard the lowest 8 bits for the next step.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Decoding UNIX Time</strong>:
To decode the UNIX time:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Set up a variable to hold the decoded time value.</li>
<li>Iterate eight times (for each byte), starting from the most significant byte down to the least:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Multiply the current result by 256 (shift left by 8 bits) to make room for the next byte.</li>
<li>Add the value of the current byte to the result.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Encoding Time Offset</strong>:
Encoding the time offset is simple. You subtract the time offset from 12 and then add back 12 during decoding. This process is necessary because the time offset ranges from -12 to 12.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Door Condition</strong> use 4 bytes, used by both open condtion and closing condtion.
We ne the following value: the door mode (checking for light or time), the threshold and finaly the time
The array is form like this [door_mode, light_treshold / 4, time hour, time minutes]
The door mode is represented by a single digit, reflecting various modes:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>0 : do nothing</li>
<li>1 : change on light condition</li>
<li>2 : change on time condition</li>
<li>3 : change on light and time condition</li>
<li>4 : change on light or time condition
By adopting this array format and the corresponding door modes, we efficiently handle door conditions during both opening and closing situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Door settings</strong> use 2 bytes, with the following needed value the door mode and the number of turn.</p>
<p dir="auto">The door mode can take on various values:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>0: Door closed</li>
<li>1: Door open</li>
<li>2: Test door (opens and closes immediately)</li>
<li>10: Automatic mode with the door closed</li>
<li>11: Automatic mode with the door open</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Number of Turns Encoding</strong>:
To encode the number of turns, we simply multiply the value by 10.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here's the array structure for encoding: [door_mode, number_of_turns * 10].</p>
</li>
</ol>

                            Fairphone 5 - to last. Designing for longevity means making a device that’s both modular and well-supported. With a long 5-year hardware
                            warranty and an even longer 8-year software support, it’s easier to hold onto your phone for longer. To get better every time, we’re assessing

The Linux 6.6 modules infrastructure is changing to better protect against the illicit behavior of NVIDIA's proprietary kernel driver.
</p><p>
Luis Chamberlain sent out the modules changes today for the Linux 6.6 merge window. Most notable with the modules update is a change that better builds up the defenses against NVIDIA's proprietary kernel driver from using GPL-only symbols. Or in other words, bits that only true open-source drivers should be utilizing and not proprietary kernel drivers like NVIDIA's default Linux driver in respecting the original kernel code author's intent.
</p><p>
A <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/262e6ae7081d">change</a> made back in 2020 to the kernel module code inherits the TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE and better protects against proprietary modules using GPL-only symbols following <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-59-Proprietary-Shim-Taint">a NVIDIA GPL condom incident</a>. Well, NVIDIA Linux engineers have since worked around that to be able to use GPL-only symbols within their binary blob. As a result we have new defenses being put in place for the kernel.

<p>Christoph Hellwig who authored the latest defensive measure <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20230731083806.453036-6-hch@lst.de/">explained</a>:
</p><blockquote>"It has recently come to my attention that nvidia is circumventing the protection added in 262e6ae7081d ("modules: inherit TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE") by importing exports from their proprietary modules into an allegedly GPL licensed module and then re-exporting them.
<p>
Given that symbol_get was only ever intended for tightly cooperating modules using very internal symbols it is logical to restrict it to being used on EXPORY_SYMBOL_GPL and prevent nvidia from costly DMCA circumvention of access controls lawsuits.
</p><p>
All symbols except for four used through symbol_get were already exported as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL, and the remaining four ones were switched over in the preparation patches."</p></blockquote>
<p>This change to only allow symbol_get of EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL modules will now be in place with Linux 6.6. Luis Chamberlain further added in today's pull request:
</p><blockquote>"Christoph Hellwig's symbol_get() fix to Nvidia's efforts to circumvent the protection he put in place in year 2020 to prevent proprietary modules from using GPL only symbols, and also ensuring proprietary modules which export symbols grandfather their taint. That was done through year 2020 commit 262e6ae7081d ("modules: inherit TAINT_PROPRIETARY_MODULE"). Christoph's new  fix is done by clarifing __symbol_get() was only ever intended to prevent module reference loops by Linux kernel modules and so making it only find symbols exported via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(). The circumvention tactic used by Nvidia was to use symbol_get() to purposely swift through proprietary module symbols and completley bypass our traditional EXPORT_SYMBOL*() annotations and community agreed upon restrictions."</blockquote>
<p>Back in 2020 when the original defense was added, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/NVIDIA-Linux-5.9-Delayed">NVIDIA recommended avoiding the Linux 5.9</a> for the time being. They ended up having a supported driver several weeks later. It will be interesting to see this time how long Linux 6.6+ thwarts their kernel driver. At least NVIDIA is now maintaining their open GPU kernel driver option since last year as an alternative to their proprietary kernel driver.

      <p>Ahead of Google Cloud Next 23, the company announced new map data sets available through the Google Maps API.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now we’re expanding our sustainability offerings with new products in Google Maps Platform. These products apply AI and machine learning, along with aerial imagery and environmental data, to provide up-to-date information about solar potential, air quality and pollen levels. With this technology, developers, businesses and organizations can build tools that map and mitigate environmental impact.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/powering-future-our-new-solar-api">SolarAPI</a> helps building owners and developers estimate potential energy savings by leveraging solar power. Using imagery, LIDAR data and 3D models, the data provides insights on the solar potential of a building and aids the design of solar systems. The data covers 40 countries.</p>

<p>While data from the Solar API can help tackle the causes of climate change, the Air Quality and Pollen APIs help humans mitigate its effects.</p>

<p>Based on a model that takes in land cover, climate data, pollen-production rates from various plant species, the <a href="https://mapsplatform.google.com/maps-products/pollen/">Pollen API</a> provides estimated pollen counts for 15 plant species in 65 countries. The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/maps-platform/introducing-air-quality-api-promoting-resilience-changing-climate">Air Quality API</a> combines data from various sources, including “government monitoring stations, sensors, models, meteorological data, satellites, land cover, and live traffic information,” to create a air-quality layer covering 100 countries.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>McDonald’s ice cream machines are so notorious for breaking that it’s become <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine">a meme</a>. But now we may have some glimmer of Shamrock Shake-flavored hope: not only <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/80215/whats-inside-that-mcdonalds-ice-cream-machine-broken-copyright-law">has iFixit performed</a> a teardown of McDonald’s machines, but it’s also petitioning the government to let it create the parts required for people to fix them.</p><p>As shown in a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?xs=1&amp;id=1025X1701640&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2uCpY3tFTIA">video posted to YouTube</a>, iFixit purchased the same ice cream machine model used by McDonald’s and spent hours trying to get it up and running. The machine spit out numerous error codes that iFixit says “are nonsensical, counterintuitive, and seemingly random, even if you spent hours reading the manual.”</p><p>Despite consisting of “easily replaceable parts,” such as three printed circuit boards, a motor and belt, and a heat exchanger, the ice cream machine can only be fixed by its manufacturer — Taylor — due to an agreement it has with McDonald’s. While a company called Kytch attempted to remedy this by creating a product to read ice cream machine error codes, iFixit says McDonald’s “sent a letter to all of the franchise owners” instructing them not to use the device.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Here’s what's on the inside of a McDonald’s ice cream machine." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/376x251/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/384x256/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/415x277/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/480x320/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/540x360/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/640x427/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/750x500/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/828x552/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/1080x720/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/1200x800/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/1440x960/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/1920x1280/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/2048x1365/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/2400x1600/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2048x1365/2400x1600/filters:focal(1024x683:1025x684):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24881756/ifixit_pcb_mcdonalds.jpeg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>Here’s what's on the inside of a McDonald’s ice cream machine.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: iFixit</cite></p></div></div><p>That’s why the iFixit team is taking things into their own hands. “We’d love to be able to make a device like Kytch that can read error codes on the ice cream machine we have, but we can’t because of copyright law,” Elizabeth Chamberlain, iFixit’s director of sustainability, says in the video. The copyright law Chamberlain is referring to is the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/dmca">Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)</a>, which prevents people from circumventing controls or digital locks to access a copyrighted work.</p><p>To get around this, iFixit and the nonprofit Public Knowledge <a href="https://publicknowledge.org/policy/public-knowledge-ifixit-petition-for-new-exemption/">filed an exemption</a> to the law for ice cream machines, something iFixit has already done (and won) for Xboxes, tractors, and smartphones. But iFixit notes that even if it <em>does</em> receive the exemption, it still won’t be able to distribute a tool designed to fix ice cream machines. Due to that, it’s also asking Congress to reintroduce <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/56976/freedom-to-repair-act">the Freedom to Repair Act</a>, a law that would make it legal to bypass software locks and other measures to repair a product. </p><p>If Congress does end up going through with these changes, we may finally have a future where we don’t have to use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529477/mcdonalds-mcbroken-bot-ice-cream-machines-app-engineering">a broken ice cream machine tracker</a> before we set out for a McFlurry.</p><p><em><strong>Update August 29th, 3:37PM ET: </strong>Added the petition from iFixit and Public Knowledge.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>
