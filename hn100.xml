<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p><strong>Amir Golestan</strong>, the 40-year-old CEO of the Charleston, S.C. based technology company <strong>Micfo LLC</strong>, has been sentenced to five years in prison for wire fraud. Golestan’s sentencing comes nearly two years after he pleaded guilty to using an elaborate network of phony companies to secure more than 735,000 Internet Protocol (IP) addresses from the <strong>American Registry for Internet Numbers</strong> (ARIN), the nonprofit which oversees IP addresses assigned to entities in the U.S., Canada, and parts of the Caribbean.</p>
<div id="attachment_48758"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48758" decoding="async" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/amirgolestan-image.png" alt="" width="749" height="476"></p><p id="caption-attachment-48758">Amir Golestan, the former CEO of Micfo.</p></div>
<p>In 2018, ARIN sued Golestan and Micfo, alleging they had obtained hundreds of thousands of IP addresses under false pretenses. ARIN and Micfo settled that dispute in arbitration, with Micfo returning most of the addresses that it hadn’t already sold.</p>
<p>ARIN’s civil case caught the attention of federal prosecutors in South Carolina, who in May 2019 <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/05/a-tough-week-for-ip-address-scammers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed criminal wire fraud charges against Golestan</a>, alleging he’d orchestrated a network of shell companies and fake identities to prevent ARIN from knowing the addresses were all going to the same buyer.</p>
<p>Prosecutors showed that each of those shell companies involved the production of notarized affidavits in the names of people who didn’t exist. As a result, the government was able to charge Golestan with 20 counts of wire fraud — one for each payment made by the phony companies that bought the IP addresses from ARIN.</p>
<p>Golestan initially sought to fight those charges. But on just the second day of his trial in November 2021, Golestan changed his mind and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/tech-ceo-pleads-to-wire-fraud-in-ip-address-scheme/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pleaded guilty to 20 counts of wire fraud</a> in connection with the phantom companies he used to secure the IP addresses. Prosecutors estimated those addresses were valued at between $10 million and $14 million.<span id="more-65335"></span></p>
<p>ARIN says the 5-year sentence handed down by the South Carolina judge “sends an important message of deterrence to other parties contemplating fraudulent schemes to obtain or transfer Internet resources.”</p>
<p>“Those who seek to defraud ARIN (or other Regional Internet Registries) are subject to costly and serious civil litigation, criminal charges, and, ultimately, a lengthy term of incarceration,” reads <a href="https://www.arin.net/blog/2023/10/16/micfo-golestan-sentencing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a statement</a> from ARIN on Golestan’s sentencing.</p>
<p>By 2013, a number of Micfo’s customers had landed on the radar of <a href="https://www.spamhaus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spamhaus</a>, a group that many network operators rely upon to stem the tide of junk email. Shortly after Spamhaus started blocking Micfo’s IP address ranges, Micfo shifted gears and began reselling IP addresses mainly to companies marketing “virtual private networking” or VPN services that help customers hide their real IP addresses online.</p>
<p>Golestan did not respond to a request for comment. But in a 2020 interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Golestan claimed that Micfo was at one point responsible for brokering roughly 40 percent of the IP addresses used by the world’s largest VPN providers. Throughout that conversation, Golestan maintained his innocence, even as he explained that the creation of the phony companies was necessary to prevent entities like Spamhaus from interfering with his business going forward.</p>
<p>There are fewer than four billion so-called “Internet Protocol version 4” or IPv4 addresses available for use, but the vast majority of them have already been allocated. The global dearth of available IP addresses has turned them into a commodity wherein each IPv4 address can fetch between $15-$25 on the open market.</p>
<p>This has led to boom times for those engaged in the acquisition and sale of IP address blocks, but it has likewise emboldened those who specialize in&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/the-great-50m-african-ip-address-heist/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absconding with</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/09/feds-allege-adconion-employees-hijacked-ip-addresses-for-spamming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spamming from dormant IP address blocks</a>&nbsp;without permission from the rightful owners.</p>
<p>The U.S Department of Justice says Golestan will serve 60 months in prison, followed by a 2-year term of court-ordered supervision. The Micfo CEO also was ordered to pay nearly $77,000 in restitution to ARIN for its work in assisting federal prosecutors.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I recently built a browser-based word game with my friends called Sqword (sqword.com). I'm proud to say that we've been able to maintain a steady group of daily active users over the past 6 months or so despite not doing any real advertising.</p>
<p>Vultures will even pick at modest success stories.</p>
<p>Yesterday one of my collaborators googled "sqword" and to his surprise, there were tons of first-page results that weren't the sqword.com domain. These sites are "game aggregator" sites that host your app inside of an iFrame so that they can steal ad revenue from your product.</p>
<p>This made me angrier than it should have - not because Sqword is a cash cow - we don't run ads on the site and don't make money from it, it's just for fun - but because it was a passion project with friends, something pure and intentionally free to play WITHOUT ads. It's against my ethos as a developer, there are banners and popups everywhere. If I build an app, I believe it should either be free or it should be up-front about what the subscription or purchase price is (and then not upsell you).</p>
<p>I couldn't abide seeing my code monetized in this way.</p>
<p>The mature and responsible thing to do would have been to add a content security policy to the page. I am not mature so instead what I decided to do was render the early 2000s internet shock image Goatse with a nice message superimposed over it in place of the app if Sqword detects that it is in an iFrame.</p>
<p>It has been one of my greatest achievements as a dev: to live-deploy a massive goatse image to at least 8 domains that aren't mine.</p>
<p>Let this be a lesson to you - if you are using an iFrame to display a site that isn't yours, even for legitimate purposes, you have no control over that content - it can change at any time. One day instead of looking into an iFrame, you might be looking at an entirely different kind of portal.</p>

<p><em>Welcome to a </em><em>That One Scene</em><em>, a semi-regular series in which Task &amp; Purpose writers wax nostalgic about that one scene from a beloved movie.</em></p>



<p>Hollywood has attempted, time and again with poor results, to portray what happens when an unidentified or unauthorized aircraft or missile threat penetrates friendly airspace. “Top Gun” and “War Games” tried, but wound up giving us classic 1980s cheeseball cinema. There is a noticeable absence of films that capture the pulse-pounding chess game of ground-controlled interception (GCI) – a sensation that is only amplified when lives are on the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter “Patlabor 2: The Movie,” an obscure, contemplative anime film from Japanese director Mamouru Oshii of “Ghost In the Shell” fame. In between intricate artwork, a thrilling storyline about a plot to bring civil war to early 2000s Japan, and musings on the ethics of the application of military force, one scene stands out as the single most realistic portrayal of GCI ever put to film.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As tactical displays fill the screen and ominous music plays alongside frantic radio traffic, a scene unfolds that’s so technically dense and authentic, we at Task &amp; Purpose had to consult several subject matter experts to make sure we understood exactly what was going on.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="PATLABOR 2 拦截F 16（JSDF Intercepts Wyvern）" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnOfNQ9VWo0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The scene takes place in the winter of 2002 in Japan. A rogue F-16J aircraft fires a TV-guided missile — meaning a missile that uses a camera feed for steering — at the Tokyo Bay Bridge, destroying the middle section and throwing Japan into a state of fear not experienced since Curtis LeMay’s strategic bombing of the mainland during World War II.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only days later, Fuchu Central Strategic Operations Center (SOC) detects a sortie of three more F-16Js, call sign “Wyvern,” this time armed with bombs, on a direct flight from Misawa Air Base to the heart of Tokyo. With only minutes to spare, and suspecting another attack, four <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhPhxWgpaC8&amp;t=108s">F-15 STOL/MTDs</a> — a highly maneuverable F-15 prototype — are scrambled to intercept on two separate paths in the hopes that one of the aircraft will make contact with the incoming bogies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fuchu officials guide the F-15s, call signs “Wizard” and “Priest,” to the incoming F-16Js. The F-15s attempt to make contact, but Wizard cannot see Wyvern or pick them up on radar, despite being nearly on top of them.</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/patlabor1.gif" alt="Entertainment photo" width="1024" height="600"><figcaption>(Gif via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Wizard disappears in a flurry of radio interference, before transmitting via their transponder that they’d been shot down. Wyvern then pivots into a direct trajectory towards Tokyo central, dropping altitude and accelerating, as if making an attack run, and Priest is given clearance from Fuchu SOC to fire as soon as they make radar contact. In addition, Fuchu SOC alerts the Iruma Air Defense Artillery batteries to prepare to engage, now fully anticipating an airborne attack. Civilian air traffic controllers at Narita International Airport scramble to ensure that the incoming aircraft don’t harm passenger planes in holding patterns, further driving home the dire implications of this incursion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as Priest prepares to fire, the interference clears, and the targeted aircraft reveal themselves to be Wizard flight, frantically asking for orders. Fuchu SOC immediately calls off the attack, bewildered that the airborne threat has suddenly disappeared, and recalls the interceptors back to base.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The entire attack was an elaborate ruse, a hack of the Fuchu SOC radar systems and jamming of their radio communications, in an attempt to cause the responding aircraft to engage each other. At the very least, the digital assailant showed the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force that they had the capability to infiltrate their systems and wreak havoc, sowing further doubt and terror among the ranks.</p>



<p>This scene is extremely dense, so we’re going to do a breakdown of exactly what the filmmakers got right, because the detail is as close to real life as it gets (despite the film being a cartoon). High-octane aerial combat movies like “Top Gun” and “Behind Enemy Lines” do not hold a candle to the precision and attention to detail we see in this film, not to mention the chest-thumping thrill ride of the action as it plays out.</p>



<p>When I interviewed our subject matter expert, a former Navy strike force analyst, he had this to say: “All of the brevity terms are used properly, nothing feels out of place like the typical Hollywood screenwriter trying to sound like the military by using terms they found on Google like a lot of films and shows. The Ground Control Intercept (GCI) depiction is exactly how that would play out (TREBOR vectors PRIEST and WIZARD into the target; the fighters are very reliant on the controllers view of the battlespace with only targeting capabilities with their radar). The radar screens aren’t the spinning ‘sonar blip’ bullshit you get in a lot of games, movies, and animation. It’s very true to the displays you actually see in a control tower, with the IFF/squawk codes identifying each aircraft or flight.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, with that in mind, let’s dive deeper into that one scene.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-technology">The technology</h3>



<p>The film uses period-accurate monochrome radar displays that refresh only when the radar beam makes another circuit. Tracked air assets are marked with their “squawk codes,” rather than plane names.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/patlabor2.gif" alt="Entertainment photo" width="1024" height="579"><figcaption>(Gif via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The choice of aircraft is another authentic touch. The F-15 STOL/MTD, was an F-15 variant designed in the 1980s to test the concept of thrust vectoring and super-mobility, and is one that few people aside from those who read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.janes.com/capabilities/defence-equipment-intelligence/air-combat-systems">Jane’s Fighting Planes</a> books would have known about in 1993.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The radios are harsh, muffled, and staticky, and the pilots’ breathing interrupts their dialogue, which is a <a target="_blank" href="https://taskandpurpose.com/tech-tactics/gulf-war-video-f-16-dodging-missiles/">very real thing.</a> The pilots have to be guided onto their targets due to the fact that features like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aviationtoday.com/2018/09/04/f-35-data-fusion/">sensor data sharing between aircraft</a> were only in their infancy at the time of the film’s release, meaning the pilots had to manually steer their narrow-view onboard radar onto the target by taking verbal directions from the SOC, whose more powerful 360-degree radar was much better equipped for locating the general position of targets.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-the-dialogue">The dialogue</h3>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="527" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-1024x527.jpg?auto=webp" alt="Entertainment photo" srcset="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-300x155.jpg 300w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-768x396.jpg 768w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV-1536x791.jpg 1536w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131730_VRV.jpg 1897w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(Screenshot via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>While most movies get radio traffic wrong with amateurish phrases like “over and out” or “I repeat,” Patlabor characters not only use believable dialogue during radio transmissions, but also speak in heavily accented English.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a huge detail that most aviation films neglect, even ones that depict NATO allies, which often simply feature the pilots speaking their native language despite the fact that English is the universal language of air traffic communication. The pilots and air traffic controllers speak in measured, subdued tones, suggesting a high level of training and preparedness. Even the air battle manager and director speak to each other in a manner that, while grim, is still calm and businesslike, underscoring the fact that while the situation is quite precarious, shots have not yet been fired. This is contrasted with the excited, terrified shouts of the civilian air traffic controllers at Narita International Airport, which add to the tension of the scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pilots and controllers give their headings in degrees magnetic, saying the numbers individually like “one-niner-zero” instead of “one-ninety,” and provide their altitude in angels (thousands of feet) which adds another layer of credibility. The terms used, such as “no joy” (no visual contact) “bogey dope” (request target heading, altitude, and airspeed) and “say again” as opposed to “repeat,” are spot on, preventing a good deal of cringe from those in the know.</p>



<h3 id="h-tactics-techniques-and-procedures">Tactics, techniques, and procedures</h3>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="550" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-1024x550.jpg?auto=webp" alt="Entertainment photo" srcset="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-1024x550.jpg 1024w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-300x161.jpg 300w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-768x413.jpg 768w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV-1536x825.jpg 1536w, https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/Screenshot_20210925-131712_VRV.jpg 1906w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>(Screenshot via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Contrast this scene with the hyped-up, Aqua Net-and-cocaine pacing of the air combat scenes of classics like “Top Gun,” and you’ll immediately see that this is a more measured, authentic approach to how air operations work. For starters, one of the biggest things that military aviation movies often neglect is that the airborne radars of fighter aircraft are very limited, only sweeping in a narrow ray in front of the aircraft to avoid microwaving the pilots and crew. It stands to reason that Wizard and Priest flights would be heavily dependent on the Fuchu Central SOC for guidance as to the general vicinity of the intruders, and the scene illustrates this beautifully.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The incoming aircraft are identified, radio hails are sent up, and when there’s no response, interceptors are launched. Once the aircraft checks in, the air traffic controllers give guidance, and the initial intercept time is revised while the pilots begin to search for the target visually and with their onboard targeting radar. The coordination is continuous, with Fuchu Central SOC feeding Wizard and Priest targeting data while trying to deconflict the situation on the ground, to no avail. When Wizard gets “shot down,” the squawk code “7700,” — the international code for “mayday,” or an airborne emergency – appears onscreen at their last known position.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-depiction-of-a-cyber-attack">The depiction of a cyber attack</h3>



<p>Cyberspace is an ever-growing domain of warfare on the modern battlefield, and concerns about its role in a conflict with a near-peer adversary are becoming more commonplace. This scene presents three forms of electronic warfare: GPS spoofing, hacking, and signal jamming. The culmination of this multi-pronged cyber attack is when two friendly aircraft come within seconds of firing on one another.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://taskandpurpose.com/uploads/2022/03/04/patlabor5.gif" alt="Entertainment photo" width="1024" height="575"><figcaption>(Gif via “Patlabor 2: The Movie”)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>In the film, this is done to try to incite a civil war, but in real life, GPS spoofing has become so common that hackers sell kits for $300 to allow the user to send false GPS data. Iran has already made dubious claims that they have mounted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1215/Exclusive-Iran-hijacked-US-drone-says-Iranian-engineer">GPS spoofing attacks on U.S. air assets.</a> The scene demonstrates this when Wizard says “We had heavy jamming and now lost position,” indicating that their communications and their GPS systems were being tampered with. The producers of this film weren’t in possession of any classified information either, since GPS spoofing and jamming was something that even the Iraqis used during Operation Desert Storm in the hopes of defeating GPS-guided bombs aimed at Saddam’s palace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hacking is another daily reality in the modern world, and cyber attacks against various governments are now common shows of force. While it’s not officially known whether or not any tactical systems have been hacked, as revealed in this scene, the possibility of this happening is still greater than zero. Signal jamming, however, is one of the oldest electronic warfare tricks in the book, and involves flooding entire swaths of frequencies with signal noise, which not only forces the enemy to limit communications, but also makes decryption easier by reducing the number of usable frequencies to a select few. This scene accurately portrays electronic warfare when the adversary coordinates Wizard getting “shot down” on the hacked radar display with heavy signal jamming that prevents Fuchu SOC from making contact with them via radio or transponder, adding to the illusion of Wizard being killed, and preventing Priest from deconflicting the airspace once they make radar contact with what they think is the intruding Wyvern flight.</p>



<p>Overall, myself and our subject matter expert both agree that this scene is the most authentic portrayal of air operations ever put to film. Additionally, I interviewed several former military air traffic controllers, strike analysts, and aviators, and their opinion was unanimous: This is pretty dang good. It totally abstains from excessive showmanship, replacing spectacle with the terrifying feeling that something like this could really happen. It’s an outstanding example of how technical detail and thorough authenticity can turn a minor scene, whose only function is to move the storyline forward, into seven minutes of nail-biting suspense.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content="" data-astro-cid-rnrqlda2="">
<p>This was supposed to be a two-part blog post, but I got inspired to write a part three!</p>
<p>At the end of <a href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/og/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs | jakelazaroff.com</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">CRDTs sound cool, but how are they actually used? Let's learn by building a collaborative pixel art editor.</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://jakelazaroff.com/favicon.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, we had just that: a fully functional collaborative pixel editor using state-based CRDTs. The drawback to state-based CRDTs is that you need to transmit the full state between peers to sync up. And our CRDT’s full state is pretty big! For a 100x100 image, it’s around 648kb. Yikes!</p>
<p>I won’t bury the lede: we’re going to reduce that by almost 98% to around 14kb. For context, that’s around half as big as the uncompressed image without any CRDT metadata. While we’ll never beat PNG, we can still do pretty well.</p>
<p>The benchmarks I’ll cite in this article are all based on this image I drew, which was encoded here using the same format we’ll create by the end of the post:<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-louvre" id="user-content-fnref-louvre" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">1</a></sup></p>
<compression-table foreshadow="true" url="/public/_example.0525116f.crdt"></compression-table>
<p>This playground uses the same pixel editor we built in the last post. You can change the color and brush size by clicking on the buttons below the canvas. The table to the right shows the size of the data in kilobytes. Right now, it just shows the size of the uncompressed data and the final result in our mystery format. As we compress our data further, we’ll add rows to the table showing how each format stacks up against the others, and their relative sizes.</p>
<p>Currently, our data looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"0,0"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>255</span><span>]</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It’s just the JSON state of our LWW Map CRDT.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-minify" id="user-content-fnref-minify" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup> Each key is a string of the pixel’s <em>(x,y)</em> coordinates, and each value is a LWW Register state: a tuple of a peer ID, a timestamp and an RGB value. If a pixel has been erased, its RGB value is <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a blank canvas so you can see how quickly the size increases as you draw. Pay attention to the different formats as we go through the article: some will actually start out larger than our uncompressed data, but quickly become smaller as more pixels are drawn!</p>
<compression-table rows="1"></compression-table>
<h3 id="hex-codes">Hex Codes</h3>
<p>The easiest change to make is storing colors as hex codes rather than RGB tuples. As a reminder, here’s the type of each color:</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span><span>RGB</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>red<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> green<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> blue<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Each channel has between one and three digits, so our color values look something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>234</span><span>,</span> <span>56</span><span>]</span></code></pre>
<p>That’s ten characters: six for the numbers, two for the commas and two for the brackets. If each number had three digits, it would take up a whole 13 characters.</p>
<p>Hex codes come in at eight characters, max. By using sixteen digits (A–F representing the numbers 10–15) instead of our usual ten, we can represent each channel with two characters instead of three. Plus, since we know that each channel is two characters long, we can omit the commas.</p>
<p>There’s one more trick: if both characters in each channel are the same, we can omit one, which takes us down to five characters (including quotes). Here’s what the data looks like now:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"0,0"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c-8144-47f7-ae64-340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>"fff"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

<p>All in all, using hex codes rather than RGB tuples gets us down from 648kb to 606kb — a 6% improvement. It’s a start, but we’ll need much bigger improvements than that if we’re going to get all the way down to 14kb.</p>
<compression-table rows="2"></compression-table>
<h3 id="uuid-table">UUID Table</h3>
<p>The next things to look at are the UUIDs. They’re a whopping 38 characters each (including quotes) and they show up in every single pixel. We could — and should! — remove the hyphens, but that will only shave off four characters per pixel. We need something more substantial.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping the UUIDs directly in each pixel, we’ll store them in a table. That way, they only appear once in the document. In their place, each pixel will store a table key that maps to the full UUID. When we need the full state back, we perform the same process in reverse, replacing each pixel’s table key with its corresponding UUID.</p>
<p>Here’s what the data looks like now. The 0th element of each array in <code>data</code> represents an index in the <code>uuids</code> array:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"uuids"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

    <span>"1,0"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>"fff"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"2,0"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Our UUID table uses an array rather than a map, which has implied keys: the index of the item in the array. Using numbers as keys also saves two characters every time we reference a UUID, since we don’t need quotation marks as we would with strings.</p>
<p>This turns out to be a substantial savings, taking us down to 236kb — a 63% improvement!</p>
<compression-table rows="3"></compression-table>
<h3 id="palette-table">Palette Table</h3>
<p>We can use the exact same technique for the colors. Rather than storing each color directly in each pixel, we build a table of all the colors used and replace the hex codes in each pixel with table keys.</p>
<p>The last element of each array in <code>data</code> now represents an index in the <code>palette</code> array:</p>
<pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"uuids"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span><span>"0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796"</span><span>,</span> <span>"4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3"</span><span>]</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Using a table like this seems strictly better, but there are some pathological scenarios in which it actually wastes space. Consider the case in which each color only appears once: we’d have the same number of colors as we have pixels, <strong>plus</strong> the overhead of mapping each pixel to a color in the table. Our current strategy works for pixel art, which tends to have a limited palette — but if we were dealing with photographs, we might want to choose another way to compress the color data.</p>
<p>In this case, the palette table slims us down to 187kb — 71% smaller than our uncompressed data.</p>
<compression-table rows="4"></compression-table>
<h3 id="run-length-encoding">Run-Length Encoding</h3>
<p>The next big things are the pixel coordinates — the map keys of our data object. With x and y each between one and three digits, these can take up to ten characters each (including the quotes and colon).</p>
<p>Remember how, when we were drawing to the screen, we mapped indices in the buffer to coordinates? We went down the array four bytes at a time, drawing to each pixel in the first row and wrapping around when we reached the end.</p>
<buffer-diagram width="3" height="3"></buffer-diagram>
<p>Here we’ll do the same thing, but in reverse. We’ll make the data an array, setting the pixel at <code>"0,0"</code> as the first element, <code>"1,0"</code> as the second element, etc.</p>
<p>This raises a new issue: how do we represent blank pixels, where no user has drawn yet? Before, they would just be missing from the map. But now we have to represent them — otherwise, every pixel after a blank space would be in the wrong place!</p>
<p>We could just put some sort of “spacer” value like <code>null</code> in the array where blank pixels would be. That’d work, but it would also waste a lot of space.</p>
<p>Instead, we’ll use something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">run-length encoding</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Run-length encoding - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>. It’s a very simple compression algorithm: when the same item appears consecutively in a sequence, instead of storing each item, store one of the item and the number of repeated instances.</p>
<p>Let’s take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">this weird sentence</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_while_John_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_had_a_better_effect_on_the_teacher</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James while John had had had had had had had had had had had a better effect on the teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot of repetition there. The sentence has 92 characters, and the word “had” appears eleven times!</p>
<p>With run-length encoding, the sentence might look like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1James 1while 1John 11had 1a 1better 1effect 1on 1the 1teacher.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that before each word, we add a number indicating how many consecutive times it shows up. That lets us skip every consecutive occurrence after the first. If we omit the spaces, this sentence has 54 characters — a 42% reduction from the original!</p>
<p>It’s not an all sunshine and lollipops, though. Consider <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">this classic pangram</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/MetalTypeZoomIn.JPG/1200px-MetalTypeZoomIn.JPG" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sentence is 44 characters and no words repeat consecutively. Here’s what it might look like with run-length encoding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1The 1quick 1brown 1fox 1jumps 1over 1the 1lazy 1dog.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>53 characters — a 20% <strong>increase</strong>! What gives?</p>
<p>The issue is that when you compress something, you need to add metadata so that you can figure out what it looked like originally. Compression algorithms make assumptions about what patterns will occur in the original data in order to optimize the metadata. If the assumptions are right, the compressed data (including the metadata) is much smaller than the original data. But if the assumptions are wrong, the “compressed” data can even end up bigger than it was before!</p>
<p>Our assumption here is that run-length encoding will not be a good fit for LWW Register states, since there are three separate pieces of data that can vary independently. All blank spaces are the same, though, which makes them an excellent candidate for run-length encoding!</p>
<p>Rather than somehow representing each individual blank space in the array, we’ll store a number indicating how many consecutive blank spaces we came across. That lets us know exactly which coordinates the next pixel will be at.</p>
<p>Now that we’re no longer storing the coordinates of each pixel, we also need to store the width of the image. That way, when we’re decompressing the data, we know when the pixels should wrap onto the next row.</p>
<p>Here’s what the data looks like now. Since we’re now using a lot of numbers without any labels, I added some comments so it’s clear what everything is referring to.</p>

<p>Notice how the <code>data</code> array is not homogenous: it contains either a tuple of peer ID, timestamp and color ID <strong>or</strong> a number indicating how many consecutive blank spaces there are.</p>
<p>Using run-length encoding brings us to 129kb — just over 80% smaller than our uncompressed data. We’re doing pretty well, but those last few percentage points are the trickiest ones to eke out. We’re gonna need to try something new.</p>
<compression-table rows="5"></compression-table>
<h3 id="binary-encoding">Binary Encoding</h3>
<p>So far, we’re at just more than an 80% decrease. That’s pretty good, and we could probably get it even smaller if we stopped using JSON. But we’re running into a fundamental limit: it’s inefficient to store things as text. To get much further, we’ll need to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">binary encoding</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Wikipedia_favicon_hexdump.svg/1200px-Wikipedia_favicon_hexdump.svg.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Binary file - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>.</p>
<p>When we’re using a plain text format like JSON, we think in characters. When we’re using binary encoding, we think in bytes. A byte holds an integer from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code>. If we consider groups of bytes as a single unit, it can hold much higher numbers — for example, two bytes can hold up to <code>65535</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-uint8array" id="user-content-fnref-uint8array" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup></p>
<p>The numbers can represent anything we want them to. One common way to interpret them is as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">ASCII</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cf/USASCII_code_chart.png/1200px-USASCII_code_chart.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">ASCII - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, meaning each number corresponds to an alphanumeric character. Another way is just as the number they hold, meaning a byte that holds <code>127</code> would represent the number 127. We’ll interpret bytes in a few different ways as we create our format.</p>
<p>We’ll define a format similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">RIFF</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Resource Interchange File Format - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Interchange_File_Format</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a>, which serves as the basis for file types like WAV and AVI. It’s made up of “chunks”, each of which has two sections: “data”, which is the actual information we need to store, and a “header” that identifies the chunk type and tells us how to actually parse the bytes in the data.</p>
<p>First, binary files usually have a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">magic number</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">File format - Wikipedia</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico#Magic_number" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format#Magic_number</span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16"><use href="/icons.svg#share"></use></svg></span></a> that identifies the format. Ours will represent the ASCII text <code>CRDT</code>, so the first four bytes of the file will be <code>43 52 44 54</code>.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-base16" id="user-content-fnref-base16" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup> That goes in the “info” chunk, along with the width of our artboard.</p>
<p>Here’s a diagram of the binary file. The first part contains a human-readable overview; all the data is labeled, and the values are in a format that makes sense to us (for example, you can see that the magic number reads “CRDT” and that the artboard is 100 pixels wide). The second column contains the raw bytes in the file; each byte shows its index in the file and the hex digits representing its number from <code>0</code> to <code>255</code> (or <code>00</code> to <code>ff</code> in hex). You can hover over data on the left and see the corresponding bytes highlighted, and vice versa.</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;magic number&quot;, &quot;CRDT&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;artboard width&quot;, 100]], []]]"></binary-visualizer>
<p>After the info chunk, the file has three more chunks: one to hold our UUID table, one to hold our palette table and one to hold our pixel data.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the UUID chunk. The header consists of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four bytes that read <code>UUID</code> in ASCII.</li>
<li>Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-bounds" id="user-content-fnref-bounds" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;UUID&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 32]], []]]" chunk-start="1"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The UUID chunk’s data is just all the peer UUIDs, one after the other. These each took up 34 characters (including quotes) in our JSON, but here we can represent each of them in a mere 16 bytes. Just like before, the key will be the index of each UUID — so the first one in the chunk will be <code>0</code>, the second will be <code>1</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s the full UUID chunk. Each white block represents one item in the chunk data — in this case, a UUID:</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;UUID&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 32]], [[&quot;hex&quot;, &quot;uuid 0&quot;, &quot;0442197c814447f7ae64340a2df3d796&quot;], [&quot;hex&quot;, &quot;uuid 1&quot;, &quot;4ae8bd76e84c4652bcd8a5e339c574f3&quot;]]]]" chunk-start="1"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The next chunk is the palette chunk. The header looks similar to the UUID chunk header:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four bytes that read <code>PLTT</code> in ASCII.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-missing" id="user-content-fnref-missing" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.</li>
</ol>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;PLTT&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 9]], []]]" chunk-start="2"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The palette chunk’s data is also similar to the UUID chunk’s data: all the colors, one after the other. When we represented these with hex codes, they took up either five or eight bytes, but here we can represent each one in a concise three bytes — one for each RGB color channel.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-rgb" id="user-content-fnref-rgb" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup></p>
<p>This chunk has one extra quirk: when writing to the data, we skip the first item’s place (so the first color starts as the fourth byte of data, or tenth byte including the header). That might not make sense now, but we’ll learn why in a minute.</p>
<p>Here’s the full palette chunk:</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;PLTT&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 9]], [[&quot;rgb&quot;, &quot;color 0&quot;, [0,0,0]], [&quot;rgb&quot;, &quot;color 1&quot;, [255,255,255]], [&quot;rgb&quot;, &quot;color 2&quot;, [108,79,255]]]]]" chunk-start="2"></binary-visualizer>
<p>The last chunk is the data chunk. You know the drill by now:</p>
<ol>
<li>Four bytes that read <code>DATA</code> in ASCII.</li>
<li>Two bytes that represent the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes.</li>
</ol>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;, &quot;chunk type&quot;, &quot;DATA&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;chunk length&quot;, 23]], []]]" chunk-start="3"></binary-visualizer>
<p>That’s the header. There are two types of items that can appear in the data chunk: pixels and blanks. Each item will start with a single byte “tag” indicating which type it is — <code>0</code> for blank and <code>1</code> for pixel.</p>
<p>Blank items are easy. After the tag, they have two single bytes indicating how many consecutive blank spaces they represent.</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[], [[&quot;item&quot;, [&quot;u8&quot;, &quot;blank tag&quot;, &quot;0&quot;], [&quot;u16&quot;, &quot;run length&quot;, 97]]]]]" chunk-start="3"></binary-visualizer>
<p>There’s a tradeoff here: by using two bytes to indicate the run length, a single blank item can represent up to 65,535 blank spaces. But then every blank item needs to use two bytes to represent the number of spaces — even if none of them need the second byte. If we used one byte, it would mean each blank item is more compact, but if there are more than 255 blank pixels in a row we’d need to use two or more consecutive blank items to represent them.</p>
<p>Pixel items are a bit more complicated. Remember, each pixel is really a LWW Register, which has three pieces of information: the peer ID that last wrote to the register, the timestamp and the value. After the tag, a pixel item has a section for each one:</p>

<p>We also need a way to store erased pixels. In the JSON format, we stored <code>null</code> as a way to indicate that the pixel had been added and then erased. In binary, there’s no <code>null</code> — all we have are bytes. That’s why we skipped the first three bytes when writing the palette chunk: we know that no color will use the <code>0</code> index. If any pixel has <code>0</code> as its index, that pixel was erased.</p>
<p>Here’s our full file. As you hover over pixel data that refers to items in the UUID and palette chunks, you’ll see arrows pointing back to the actual data in those chunks.</p>

<p>This gets us down to just 40kb. An RGB color takes up three bytes, and at this size we’re representing it with only a single byte of overhead! At an almost 94% reduction from the uncompressed data, we’ve already done a great job and could probably stop here if we wanted. But we can take it even further.</p>
<compression-table rows="6"></compression-table>
<h3 id="run-length-binary-encoding">Run-Length Binary Encoding</h3>
<p>We’re in the home stretch now. The info, UUID and palette chunks are about as compact as can be, but we can save a bunch of space in the data chunk.</p>
<p>If you recall a couple sections ago, the reason we run-length encoded the only blank spaces was that each pixel had three pieces of information that could vary independently: the timestamp, the peer ID of the last writer and the color. We’re going to split those up into individual chunks — one for each piece of information. Within each chunk, there will be only one single thing that can vary between items, which will let us use run-length encoding on each individual piece of data. So instead of one data chunk, we’ll have three: a writer chunk, a color chunk and a timestamp chunk.</p>
<p>The writer and color chunks are very similar to each other. Their headers have four bytes that read <code>WRTR</code> (for the writer chunk) or <code>COLR</code> (for the color chunk) in ASCII and two bytes for the length of the rest of the chunk in bytes. Each item in these chunks takes up three bytes: one for the index of the corresponding item in the UUID or palette chunk, and two for the length of the run.</p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;,&quot;chunk type&quot;,&quot;WRTR&quot;],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;chunk length&quot;,6]],[[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;uuid index&quot;,0],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,100]],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;uuid index&quot;,1],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,2]]]],[[[&quot;txt&quot;,&quot;chunk type&quot;,&quot;COLR&quot;],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;chunk length&quot;,9]],[[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;palette index&quot;,1],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,2]],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;palette index&quot;,0],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,98]],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;palette index&quot;,2],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run length&quot;,2]]]]]" chunk-start="3"></binary-visualizer>
<p>You might notice that there are two items in the writer data, but three items in the color data. It means that — going from the top left pixel to the bottom right — the peer who wrote to each pixel changes twice, but the color changes three times. Because we’re now keeping track of each kind of data separately, we can compress them without worrying about the others.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-confusing" id="user-content-fnref-confusing" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup></p>
<p>The final chunk is the timestamp chunk. The header has four bytes that read <code>TIME</code> in ASCII, and two bytes for the length of the data items in bytes. Each item in the timestamp chunk starts with a single byte representing the timestamp of that pixel. We can use a clever trick here to disambiguate blank pixels from drawn pixels. When we instantiate a LWW Register, the timestamp is set to <code>1</code>. There will never be a register with a timestamp of <code>0</code>, which means we can use that value to indicate a blank pixel.</p>
<p>We’ll use the same run-length encoding strategy from the previous binary format. If the timestamp is a positive number, the next byte will be the next timestamp. But if the timestamp is <code>0</code>, we’ll interpret the next two bytes as the length of the run of blank pixels.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-porquenolosdos" id="user-content-fnref-porquenolosdos" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">10</a></sup></p>
<binary-visualizer buffer="[[[[&quot;txt&quot;,&quot;chunk type&quot;,&quot;TIME&quot;],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;chunk length&quot;,8]],[[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,3],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,4],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,2],[&quot;item&quot;,[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,0],[&quot;u16&quot;,&quot;run-length&quot;,97]],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,2],[&quot;u8&quot;,&quot;timestamp&quot;,3]]]]" chunk-start="5"></binary-visualizer>
<p>That also lets us save a bit of space by ignoring runs of blank pixels in the writer and color chunks, by which I mean that a blank pixel doesn’t end the run of a UUID or color. Only when we see a different UUID or color do we start a new run. We consider the timestamp chunk to be the ultimate authority on whether a pixel is blank: if the timestamp is <code>0</code>, then it doesn’t matter what we think the UUID or color is.</p>
<p>Here’s the full file:</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>As you can see, even though state-based CRDTs require their whole state to be synced between peers, it’s possible to for the actual data transferred to be significantly more efficient. We took a CRDT state weighing in at 648kb and reduced its size by almost 98% to only 14kb!</p>

<p>Why do we need to know the length in advance? With binary, we don’t usually use delimiters like quotes or brackets to indicate when things begin or end.

<p>Using one byte for the timestamp makes each pixel smaller, but limits us to a maximum timestamp of 255. Lifting that limit would mean adding another byte to every pixel — even if every timestamp is below that amount. Since we know the maximum timestamp in advance, we could make an optimization here: use two bytes to store the timestamp if and only if one of the timestamps is above 255.

This means that the trade unions and the employers' organizations determine the rules of the game in the labour market, without interference from the state and politicians. In Sweden, approximately nine out of ten workers are covered by collective agreements. </p><p>The terms of the collective agreement include wages, form of employment, occupational pension, working hours, vacations, and periods of notice. Thus, the employers benefit from industry-specific, long-term, and stable ground rules. </p><p>The collective agreements are negotiated on a sector-by-sector basis, and employees are guaranteed the wages and working conditions that are standard across the sector. This allows for companies to operate on a level playing field, while avoiding the risk of any one employer distorting competition in the sector by imposing poor conditions on their employees. </p><h3>Very few labour market conflicts in Sweden</h3> <p>Once a collective agreement is signed, both employers and employees have the obligation to keep the peace. This applies throughout the term of the agreement and ensures that no one can strike to obtain better conditions than those set out in the agreement. </p><p>As a result, the collective agreement ensures a Swedish labour market with very few industrial actions, conflicts or strikes. It is grounded on a long-standing Swedish tradition of over 100 years of negotiations between the labour market parties. The collective agreement creates a situation of clarity and order for both employees and employers, while avoiding conflicts. </p><h3>We strive for a swift solution</h3> <p>IF Metall signs approximately 200 local collective agreements a year in the industry sector.&nbsp; Very rarely do we end up in conflict. At the most part, we have one conflict a year, usually ending in a signed agreement. </p><p>IF Metall of course want our members at Tesla to have the same decent and safe working conditions as the members at other similar companies in Sweden. </p><p>Even though we have called for industrial action, it is our sincere hope that Tesla will finally start negotiating and sign a collective agreement for their plants in Sweden. </p><p>Tesla is a global leader in the green transition. We hope that they will be willing to express the same level of leadership regarding working conditions for their employees and our members. We strive for and look forward to a swift solution. </p><p><strong>Fact:</strong> IF Metall, Industrial metalworkers in Sweden, is the trade union organizing 300 000 members within the manufacturing and chemical industries, in mining, and in the automotive industry. </p>  </article></div>]]></description>

<p>Several months after Feynman’s death, while working on what would become <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Genius-Life-Science-Richard-Feynman/dp/0679747044/?tag=braipick-20" target="_blank"><strong><em>Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman</em></strong></a> (<a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/genius-the-life-and-science-of-richard-feynman/oclc/25316182&amp;referer=brief_results" target="_blank"><em>public library</em></a>) — the masterly biography plumbing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/05/11/richard-feynman-genius-james-gleick/">the wellspring of Feynman’s genius</a> — James Gleick discovered something of arresting strangeness and splendor. </p>
<p>“My heart stopped,” Gleick tells me. “I have never had an experience like that as a biographer, before or since.”</p>
<p>In a mass of unread papers sent to him by Feynman’s widow, Gweneth, Gleick found a letter that discomposed his most central understanding of Feynman’s character. A generation after computing pioneer Alan Turing <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/">tussled with the binary code of body and spirit in the wake of loss</a>, Feynman — a scientist perhaps <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/01/ode-to-a-flower-richard-feynman/">uncommonly romantic</a> yet resolutely rational and unsentimental in his reverence for the indomitable laws of physics that tend toward decay — penned a remarkable letter to a physical nonentity that was, for the future Nobel-winning physicist, the locus of an irrepressible metaphysical reality. </p>

<p>In high school, the teenage Richard spent summers at the beach in his native Far Rockaway. There, he grew besotted with a striking girl named Arline — a girl he knew he would marry. Both complement and counterpoint to his own nature, Arline met Richard’s inclination for science with ardor for philosophy and art. (The art class he took just to be near her would lay the foundation for his <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2013/01/17/richard-feynman-ofey-sketches-drawings/">little-known, lifelong passion for drawing</a>.) By his junior year, Richard proposed. Arline accepted. With the eyes of young love, they peered into a shared future of infinite possibility for bliss. </p>

<p>But they were abruptly grounded when a mysterious malady began afflicting Arline with inexplicable symptoms — a lump would appear and disappear on her neck, fevers would roil over her with no apparent cause. Eventually, she was hospitalized for what was believed to be typhoid. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Feynman began to glimpse the special powerlessness that medical uncertainty can inflict on a scientific person. He had come to believe that the scientific way of thinking brought a measure of calmness and control in difficult situations — but not now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just as Feynman began bombarding the doctors with questions that steered them toward a closer approximation of the scientific method, Arline began to recover just as mysteriously and unpredictably as she had fallen ill. But the respite was only temporary. The symptoms returned, still shorn of a concrete explanation but now unambiguously pointing toward the terminal — a prognosis Arline’s doctors kept from her. Richard refused to go along with the deception — he and Arline had promised each other to face life with unremitting truthfulness — but he was forced to calibrate his commitment to circumstance. </p>
<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>His parents, Arline’s parents, and the doctors all urged him not to be so cruel as to tell a young woman she was dying. His sister, Joan, sobbing, told him he was stubborn and heartless. He broke down and bowed to tradition. In her room at Farmingdale Hospital, with her parents at her side, he confirmed that she had glandular fever. Meanwhile, he started carrying around a letter — a “goodbye love letter,” as he called it — that he planned to give her when she discovered the truth. He was sure she would never forgive the unforgivable lie. </p>
<p>He did not have long to wait. Soon after Arline returned home from the hospital she crept to the top of the stairs and overheard her mother weeping with a neighbor down in the kitchen. When she confronted Richard — his letter snug in his pocket — he told her the truth, handed her the letter, and asked her to marry him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marriage, however, proved to be a towering practical problem — Princeton, where Feynman was now pursuing a Ph.D., threatened to withdraw the fellowships funding his graduate studies if he were to wed, for the university considered the emotional and pragmatic responsibilities of marriage a grave threat to academic discipline. </p>
<p>Just as Feynman began considering leaving Princeton, a diagnosis detonated the situation — Arline had contracted a rare form of tuberculosis, most likely from unpasteurized milk. </p>
<p>At first, Feynman was relieved that the grim alternative options of Hodgkin’s disease and incurable cancers like lymphoma had been ruled out. But he was underestimating, or perhaps misunderstanding, the gravity of tuberculosis — the very disease which had <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2017/02/17/alan-turing-morcom-letters/">taken the love of Alan Turing’s life</a> and which, during its two-century heyday, had claimed more lives around the globe than any other malady and all wars combined. At the time of Arline’s diagnosis in 1941, immunology was in its infancy, the antibiotic treatment of bacterial infections practically nonexistent, and the first successful medical application of penicillin a year away. Tuberculosis was a death sentence, even if it was a slow death with intervals of remission — a fact Richard and Arline faced with an ambivalent mix of brave lucidity and hope against hope. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Richard’s parents met the prospect of his marriage with bristling dread. His mother, who believed he was marrying Arline out of pity rather than love, admonished him that he would be putting his health and his very life in danger, and coldly worried about how the stigma attached to tuberculosis would impact her brilliant young son’s reputation. “I was surprised to learn such a marriage is not unlawful,” she scoffed unfeelingly. “It ought to be.”</p>
<p>But Richard was buoyed by love — a love so large and luminous that he found himself singing aloud one day as he was arranging Arline’s transfer to a sanatorium. Determined to go through with the wedding, he wrote to his beloved:</p>
<blockquote><p>I guess maybe it is like rolling off of a log — my heart is filled again &amp; I’m choked with emotions — and love is so good &amp; powerful — it’s worth preserving — I know nothing can separate us — we’ve stood the tests of time and our love is as glorious now as the day it was born — dearest riches have never made people great but love does it every day — we’re not little people — we’re giants … I know we both have a future ahead of us — with a world of happiness — now &amp; forever.</p></blockquote>
<p>On June 29, 1942, they promised each other eternity. </p>

<p>Gleick writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>He borrowed a station wagon from a Princeton friend, outfitted it with mattresses for the journey, and picked up Arline in Cedarhurst. She walked down her father’s hand-poured concrete driveway wearing a white dress. They crossed New York Harbor on the Staten Island ferry — their honeymoon ship. They married in a city office on Staten Island, in the presence of neither family nor friends, their only witnesses two strangers called in from the next room. Fearful of contagion, Richard did not kiss her on the lips. After the ceremony he helped her slowly down the stairs, and onward they drove to Arline’s new home, a charity hospital in Browns Mills, New Jersey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, WWII was reaching its crescendo of destruction, dragging America into the belly of death with the attack on Pearl Harbor. Now one of the nation’s most promising physicists, Feynman was recruited to work on what would become <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/10/14/richard-feynman-graphic-novel-biography-ottoviani/">the Manhattan Project</a> and soon joined the secret laboratory in Los Alamos. </p>

<p>Arline entered the nearby Albuquerque sanatorium, from where she wrote him letters in code — for the sheer fun of it, because she knew how he cherished puzzles, but the correspondence alarmed the military censors at the laboratory’s Intelligence Office. Tasked with abating any breaches to the secrecy of the operation, they cautioned Feynman that coded messages were against the rules and demanded that his wife include a key in each letter to help them decipher it. This only amplified Arline’s sense of fun — she began cutting holes into her letters, covering passages with ink, and even mail-ordered a jigsaw puzzle kit with which to cut up the pages and completely confound the agents. </p>
<p>But the levity masked the underlying darkness which Richard and Arline tried so desperately to evade — Arline was dying. As her body failed, he steadied himself to her spirit:</p>
<blockquote><p>You are a strong and beautiful woman. You are not always as strong as other times but it rises &amp; falls like the flow of a mountain stream. I feel I am a reservoir for your strength — without you I would be empty and weak… I find it much harder these days to write these things to you.</p></blockquote>
<p>In every single letter, he told her that he loved her. <em>“I have a serious affliction: loving you forever,”</em> he wrote. </p>

<p>In early 1945, two and a half years into their marriage, Richard and Arline made love for the first time. He had been too afraid of harming her frail health somehow, she too afraid of infecting him with the deadly bacterium consuming her. But Arline insisted that this pent up desire could no longer be contained and assured Richard that this would only bring them closer — to each other, and to the life they had so lovingly dreamt up for themselves:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ll always be your sweetheart &amp; first love — besides a devoted wife — we’ll be proud parents too… I am proud of you always Richard –[you are] a good husband, and lover, &amp; well, coach, I’ll show you what I mean Sunday.</p></blockquote>
<p>But heightened as their hopes were by this new dimension of shared experience, Arline’s health continued to plummet. Her weight dropped to eighty-four pounds. Exasperated by the helplessness of medicine, which Feynman had come to see not as a manifestation but as a mutilation of the scientific method, he invested all hope in an experimental drug made of mold growths. “Keep hanging on,” he exhorted Arline. “Nothing is certain. We lead a charmed life.” She began spitting blood. </p>
<p>At twenty-seven, on the precipice of a brilliant scientific career, he was terminally in love. </p>
<p>On June 16, 1945, while working at the computing room at Los Alamos, Feynman received a call from the sanatorium that Arline was dying. He borrowed a colleague’s car and sped to the hospital, where he found her immobile, her eyes barely tracing his movement. Early in his scientific career, he had been animated by the nature of time. Now, hours stretched and contracted as he sat at her deathbed, until one last small breath tolled the end at 9:21PM.</p>
<p>The wake of loss has a way of tranquilizing grief with the pressing demands of practical arrangements — a tranquilizer we take willingly, almost gratefully. The following morning, Feynman arranged for his beloved’s cremation, methodically collected her personal belongings, and on the final page of the small spiral notebook in which she recorded her symptoms he wrote with scientific remove: “June 16 — Death.”</p>
<p>And so we arrive at Gleick’s improbable discovery in that box of letters — improbable because of the extreme rationality with which Feynman hedged against even the slightest intimation of metaphysical conjectures untestable by science and unprovable by reason. During his courtship of Arline, he had been vexed by her enthusiasm for Descartes, whose “proof” of God’s perfection he found intellectually lazy and unbefitting of Descartes’s reputation as <a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/03/31/descartes-rules-for-the-direction-of-the-mind/">a champion of reason</a>. He had impishly countered Arline’s insistence that there are two sides to everything by cutting a piece of paper and half-twisting it into a Möbius strip, the ends pasted together to render a surface with just one side. </p>
<p>Everything that appeared mystical, Feynman believed, was simply an insufficiently explained mystery with a physical answer not yet found. Even Arline’s dying hour had offered testing ground for conviction. Puzzlingly, the clock in the room had stopped at exactly 9:21PM — the time of death. Aware of how this bizarre occurrence could foment the mystical imagination in unscientific minds, Feynman reasoned for an explanation. Remembering that he had repaired the clock multiple times over the course of Arline’s stay at the sanatorium, he realized that the instrument’s unwieldy mechanism must have choked when the nurse picked it up in the low evening light to see and record the time. </p>
<p>How astonishing and how touchingly human, then, that Feynman penned the letter Gleick found in the box forty-two years later — a letter he wrote to Arline in October of 1946, 488 days after her death:</p>
<blockquote><p>D’Arline,</p>
<p>I adore you, sweetheart.</p>
<p>I know how much you like to hear that — but I don’t only write it because you like it — I write it because it makes me warm all over inside to write it to you.</p>
<p>It is such a terribly long time since I last wrote to you — almost two years but I know you’ll excuse me because you understand how I am, stubborn and realistic; and I thought there was no sense to writing.</p>
<p>But now I know my darling wife that it is right to do what I have delayed in doing, and that I have done so much in the past. I want to tell you I love you. I want to love you. I always will love you.</p>
<p>I find it hard to understand in my mind what it means to love you after you are dead — but I still want to comfort and take care of you — and I want you to love me and care for me. I want to have problems to discuss with you — I want to do little projects with you. I never thought until just now that we can do that. What should we do. We started to learn to make clothes together — or learn Chinese — or getting a movie projector. Can’t I do something now? No. I am alone without you and you were the “idea-woman” and general instigator of all our wild adventures.</p>
<p>When you were sick you worried because you could not give me something that you wanted to and thought I needed. You needn’t have worried. Just as I told you then there was no real need because I loved you in so many ways so much. And now it is clearly even more true — you can give me nothing now yet I love you so that you stand in my way of loving anyone else — but I want you to stand there. You, dead, are so much better than anyone else alive.</p>
<p>I know you will assure me that I am foolish and that you want me to have full happiness and don’t want to be in my way. I’ll bet you are surprised that I don’t even have a girlfriend (except you, sweetheart) after two years. But you can’t help it, darling, nor can I — I don’t understand it, for I have met many girls and very nice ones and I don’t want to remain alone — but in two or three meetings they all seem ashes. You only are left to me. You are real.</p>
<p>My darling wife, I do adore you.</p>
<p>I love my wife. My wife is dead.</p>
<p>Rich.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then, with the sole defibrillator for heartache we have — humor — Feynman adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>PS Please excuse my not mailing this — but I don’t know your new address.</p></blockquote>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="dataContent">
                                    <p><span>When Maya Santamaria was opening a Minneapolis club in 2003, a city worker handed her a card for a Minneapolis police officer and said, “You’re going to work with this guy.”</span></p>
<p><span>To get a business license, a licensing employee told her she had to hire a certain number of off-duty Minneapolis police officers to provide security.</span></p>
<p><span>Why?</span></p>
<p><span>“Because they’re racist and we’re Mexican,” Santamaria said. “They didn’t want to let Mexicans have nightclubs.”</span></p>
<p><span>That’s her conclusion after seeing other similar-sized, white-owned venues escape the same mandate.</span></p>
<p><span>With over a million dollars invested, Santamaria had little choice. “You gotta do what they say,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, MPD “socked it to me,” she said. She started out paying the officers $40 to $45 an hour, always more than one officer per night. And they didn’t just work one or two hours; they charged a minimum of four hours no matter how many they actually worked, she said. The pay gradually increased to nearly $60 an hour.</span></p>
<p><span>“I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars,” she said. “There were many years I wasn’t making it, and they didn’t give a damn.”</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria was later required to come up with security plans outlining the number of officers needed per night. The officers insisted on getting paid cash, she said. She feared if she didn’t oblige, she’d lose her license.</span></p>
<p><span>Eventually, another officer helped schedule off-duty work: Derek Chauvin. He worked security at her club for 17 years.</span></p>
<p><span>“They were in charge and everybody had to go through them,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>El Nuevo Rodeo became Minnesota’s largest Latino concert venue, and while there were a few brawls, “We never were a problem property,” Santamaria said.</span></p>
<p><span>MPD officers would usually sit in their squad cars, fully uniformed, and do crossword puzzles or chat with their girlfriends or spouses. Sometimes they’d leave to go help MPD with calls.</span></p>
<p><span>“They were gone half the time,” Santamaria said. “They were on my payroll but they were gone.”</span></p>
<p><span>She sold the club in 2019. When Santamaria saw Chauvin pinning George Floyd on the pavement in the video that shocked the world, she recognized both, because Floyd worked as a bouncer inside the club in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>El Nuevo Rodeo burned to the ground during the subsequent riots.</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria’s allegations about MPD off-duty work are echoed by the experiences of other business owners, documented in government reports and even remarked upon by the city’s new police chief, Brian O’Hara.</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.southwestvoices.news/posts/new-police-chief-candidly-talks-about-youth-violence-police-policies"><span> He </span><span>said</span></a><span> the system is “ripe for corruption,” citing a </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nj.com/hudson/2020/12/jersey-city-brings-back-off-duty-jobs-program-for-cops-after-halting-it-over-of-corruption.html"><span>federal investigation</span></a><span> in Jersey City, where a dozen cops were arrested due to widespread corruption of off-duty work.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The timing is favorable for more rigorous oversight: MPD is soon to be operating under both state and federal supervision following damning investigative reports about racist policing, and O’Hara is a newish outsider who speaks the rhetoric of reform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Changes to off-duty policy face a key obstacle, however: A 1997 court injunction restricts how much the city can manage officers’ side gigs. Given the injunction, the city can only seek major reforms via the collective bargaining process, which means if the city wants to change off-duty policies, it would likely have to give up something in return.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how the off-duty work program works: Some businesses — like large nightclubs —&nbsp;are required by the city to have security, which until 2020, sometimes had to be off-duty Minneapolis police officers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The city can also require that organizers of large events and businesses plagued with a lot of 911 calls also hire off-duty MPD officers. Businesses may also voluntarily hire off-duty officers for security and traffic control, and negotiate pay and hours directly with officers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The city doesn’t keep track of how much officers are working or how much they’re paid, or even have access to the contracts. Off-duty work often pays a lot more — up to hundreds of dollars per hour — than working overtime for MPD.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some officers are still paid in cash, increasing the risk of tax evasion. And, several business owners and Minneapolis officials said some small business owners —&nbsp;particularly those owned by immigrants — have been led to believe they must hire MPD officers, or risk getting ghosted by police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was precisely this arrangement that caught the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice in its 2011 report on the New Orleans Police Department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, the MPD off-duty situation has parallels to NOPD before the feds arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The recent DOJ investigative report about MPD drew only a passing —&nbsp;</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/16/doj-mpd-off-duty-work-system-undermines-supervision/"><span>but still condemnatory</span></a><span> — reference to off-duty jobs. The DOJ was looking for racism. Some business owners of color say look no further.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h4>‘Instead of helping us, they’re hurting us’</h4>

	
<p><span>Basim Sabri, owner of a Somali mall called Karmel Mall and a Latino mall called Plaza Mexico on Lake Street, said he held a Cinco de Mayo party every year for 27 years to encourage people to come to the area and see that “It really isn’t a war zone, it is a beautiful place.”</span></p>
<p><span>For years, they never had police there, and then about a dozen years ago, he said, there was a shooting a few blocks away from the event. The city began requiring him to hire off-duty police.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Lake Street has been tremendously damaged, and instead of helping us, they’re hurting us,” said Sabri, who once </span><a target="_blank" href="https://bringmethenews.com/news/developer-convicted-in-bribery-back-at-minneapolis-city-hall-pushing-reforms"><span>went to prison</span></a><span> for bribing a city council member.</span></p>
<p><span>The officer rates have skyrocketed, he said. He pays officers $150 to $160 an hour, and a “scheduler” also charges $15 to $20.</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the big payouts, when he calls the police for help, they don’t always respond, Sabri said. About six weeks ago, a man came into his office with a gun and said he was going to shoot someone. They called 911, but the police never came, Sabri said.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>An MPD spokesman said “Going back to July 1, all calls we found relating to guns at Karmel Mall did have a police response, and none of the calls match the details” of Sabri’s account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jonathan Soto, owner of EME Antro night club at Fifth Avenue and Lake Street, hired MPD officers — including Chauvin — to monitor his parking lot for a couple of years, but stopped after Floyd’s murder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The officers wanted to be paid in cash, and would sometimes leave to respond to police calls, which benefited the city, he said.</span></p>
<p><span>“The city kind of liked that,” Soto said.</span></p>
<p><span>The FBI interviewed him after Floyd was killed, asking how much he paid officers.</span></p>
<p><span>Other business owners said the officers don’t always respond to problems right under their noses.</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria said the club next to her was tiny but “had to have their own cop,” who she described as an “old guy” who would refuse to help anybody from her club,</span></p>
<p><span>After several East African-owned stores on Franklin Avenue in Minneapolis were vandalized in September 2019, Capitol Café owner Abdirahman Awad called his friend KB Brown, owner of a north Minneapolis print shop and a member of the Main Street Alliance of Minnesota, a group of progressive business owners.</span></p>
<p><span>KB Brown said the detectives were rude and disrespectful to Awad. Awad said MPD later told him he’d have to pay off-duty officers $145 an hour to provide security. He returned the next night and saw almost no police presence despite the alleged hate crime. In his view, MPD was sending a message that the cafe would only get protection if it hired off-duty officers.</span></p>
<p><span>“I felt so angry about it,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Kevin Brown, another member of the Main Street Alliance, said Somali business owners have told him MPD pressured them to hire off-duty officers, but they’re afraid to go public because they’ve been threatened with being “blacklisted” by MPD — or ignored when they call police for help.</span></p>
<p><span>“They get to make the rules,” Kevin Brown said.</span></p>
<p><span>Not all business owners feel that way, however.</span></p>
<p><span>When John Wolf bought his liquor store, Chicago-Lake Liquors, in 2000, he inherited the off-duty officers who did security there and continued hiring them. Some officers preferred to be paid in cash, but he said he didn’t do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One officer scheduled all the shifts, which were 5 p.m. to closing. The cops roved around inside and outside the liquor store and sometimes left to respond to MPD calls — even though Wolf was paying them. Wolf didn’t mind.</span></p>
<p><span>“I had really, really good people working here,” said Wolf, who</span><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/nickhaltermpls/status/1295416454880219137?s=20"> <span>appeared</span></a><span> with Donald Trump at an August 2020 campaign stop.</span></p>
<p><span>But after Floyd’s murder, he made a business decision to stop hiring the officers because they were “pricey” and “hard to get.”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;“The situation became very complicated after George Floyd,” Wolf said.</span></p>
    <h4>
Former council member calls off-duty tactics ‘sleazy and illegal’
</h4>

	
<p><span>In the aftermath of Floyd’s killing, MPD went under a microscope, including off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>Some private businesses and school districts cut ties with the police. Within days, the Minneapolis Orchestra, Minneapolis Institute of Art and iconic club First Avenue said they’d no longer hire them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One of the few things the city does keep tabs on is sites for off-duty work, which must be approved. </span><span>Officers worked off-duty at about 500 sites in 2018, but that number has dropped to about 100 this year. About 200 officers have worked these gigs this year, according to </span><span>Regulatory Services Director Enrique Velazquez</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2020, the Minneapolis City Council stopped requiring off-duty officers at licensed events, and let them hire private security instead. In August 2020, </span><span>Velazquez </span><span>told the City Council only four businesses were being required to hire off-duty MPD officers. But some businesses were voluntarily hiring them because they were under the impression they had no choice, he said. Others thought if they hired police officers they would get “some level of preferential treatment,” he said.</span></p>
<p><span>Velazquez said this was discussed with Mayor Jacob Frey’s</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2020/01/31/mayor-frey-aims-to-rein-in-off-duty-police-work-creates-task-force/"> <span>off-duty task force</span></a><span>, which was launched in January 2020, met twice, and then dissolved.</span></p>
<p><span>Former Minneapolis City Council Member Cam Gordon said small businesses owned by immigrants told him they were led to believe they wouldn’t get police service if they didn’t hire officers. They didn’t want to speak publicly about it, he said, out of fear of retaliation.</span></p>
<p><span>Some people of color said they were told if they wanted to get police to respond to 911 calls, they would have to hire the cops for security, and it could cost, say, $800 per night in cash.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s “sleazy” and illegal, Gordon said.</span></p>
<p><span>Gordon said running a business using city resources — uniforms, guns, squad cars — without city management, should be considered a violation of the city ethics code, even though the city explicitly allows it, even paying insurance for off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>“It creates this whole system of unaccountability in terms of the money, especially if people are paid under the table in cash,” Gordon said.</span></p>
<p><span>A</span><a target="_blank" href="https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/File/2859/Police%20Off-Duty%20Work%20Audit%20Report_Revised%2010092019.pdf"> <span>2019 city audit</span></a><span> noted cash payment was preferred by some employers and officers. The audit recommended ending cash payments and putting the city in charge of the program, but like so many other MPD issues, change has been glacial. MPD policy was updated to limit hours — including off-duty gigs — and prioritize overtime over off-duty work. MPD is instituting a new timekeeping system to track off-duty hours.</span></p>
<p><span>The city’s insurance liability for officers working side gigs can get expensive: The city was forced to defend Lt. Mike Sauro after he arrested, handcuffed and beat a 21-year-old college student in a kitchen. Sauro was off duty, working at a club on New Year’s Eve in 1991. A jury awarded the victim over $1 million in damages, the largest civil award in a police misconduct case in the city’s history at the time, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports98/police/uspo86.htm"><span>according</span></a><span> to Human Rights Watch.</span></p>
<p><span>After that, former Police Chief Robert Olson vowed to limit officers’ off-duty time, saying the city didn’t have the responsibility to make sure private businesses run smoothly. But 28 years later, the off-duty work continues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Even amid the fury after Floyd’s police killing, the council made negligible changes to the off-duty program. Off-duty work is part of the police union contract. The Minneapolis Police Federation said during the last negotiation that any change to off-duty work was a non-starter. Now, negotiations are underway again on the next three-year contract.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
    <h4>City may challenge 1997 injunction that ties its hands on off-duty issues</h4>

	
<p><span>Weeks after Floyd’s death at the hands of his officers, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo withdrew from labor negotiations, saying the contract would be reviewed with the help of outside experts.</span></p>
<p><span>But even as crime spiked, MPD began hemorrhaging officers, and a judge</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/order-requiring-minneapolis-to-hire-more-cops-reversed-by-court-of-appeals/"> <span>ordered</span></a><span> the city to hire more cops to comply with the city charter. Negotiations were suddenly focused on recruiting and retaining cops.</span></p>
<p><span>A coalition of police reform groups called Minneapolis for a Better Police Contract formed in 2019 to push city officials to use the police labor contract as a tool for reform.</span></p>
<p><span>“Off-duty work is corrupt,” said Stacey Gurian-Sherman, a lawyer on the group’s steering committee.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The group made 22 recommendations for the contract, including limiting the number of days and hours officers can work, counting overtime and off-duty work. They recommended officers be paid for off-duty work the same way they’re paid for “</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/briefs/downtown-minneapolis-neighborhood-raising-money-for-more-police-patrols/"><span>buyback</span></a><span>” work in which neighborhoods or organizations pay for extra patrols. Those officers are paid $107 an hour, but payroll is handled by the city.</span></p>
<p><span>Aside from labor negotiations, the group says the City Council could make changes to make off-duty work centralized, fair and not subject to the whims of any one police officer. St. Paul, Duluth, Bloomington and Rochester all have such centralized systems.</span></p>
<p><span>In January, the City Council voted to review off-duty work, including how officers get jobs, how much they’re paid and how it affects MPD staffing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Council Member Robin Wonsley authored the legislative directive and is working on a policy that would charge businesses fees to recoup city costs, but the city is largely powerless given the 1990s era court injunction against changing the side gigs policy.</span></p>
<p><span>The 1997 injunction and settlement came after former Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton tried to put the system under the city’s control. The union argued changes to off-duty must be negotiated as part of the union contract, and the agreement says officers have the right to contract with outside employers. It also says officers aren’t allowed to act as brokers, though police seem to be ignoring the proscription.</span></p>

<p><span>It would be expensive for the city to take over the off-duty program, however, since officers would be paid through the city, at an overtime rate, and the pay would count toward their pension benefit calculation.</span></p>
<p><span>Mayor Jacob Frey told the </span><i><span>Reformer</span></i><span> off-duty work is “one of the more difficult and intractable” issues facing MPD, and the 1997 injunction is a major roadblock to change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asked whether the city might try to get it revoked, he said, “We’re talking.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The police contract doesn’t give the city much authority over off-duty work, but ideally the city would have more managerial oversight, Frey said.</span></p>
<p><span>“It will be a topic that is covered,” during negotiations, he said. “It would make the process more fair and equitable both to police officers and businesses hiring them. We could better ensure officers aren’t overworked by factoring off-duty shifts into work scheduling. It would also streamline the process.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Frey said the city needs its officers working more on-duty, rather than off-duty, which he acknowledges will cost more. In other words, pump up their regular pay so they’re less inclined to take the lucrative off-duty work.</span></p>
<p><span>Minneapolis police officers start out making about $73,000 annually, but many are working mega overtime hours due to short staffing, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/06/15/minneapolis-police-officers-continue-to-rack-up-hefty-overtime-as-understaffing-continues/"><span>pushing their salaries sky-high</span></a><span>; 70% of officers made six figures last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neither the police union nor MPD responded to multiple requests for comment.</span></p>
    <h4>MPD system mirrors New Orleans, before reforms</h4>

	
<p><span>Many of the concerns about MPD’s off-duty system mirror those federal investigators found in New Orleans when the U.S. Department of Justice</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2011/03/17/nopd_report.pdf"> <span>found</span></a><span> their off-duty work — what they call paid details — facilitated abuse and corruption, contributed to officer fatigue and inequitable policing and was a financial drain on the city.</span></p>
<p><span>A vestige of the days when NOPD’s starting pay was among the lowest in the nation, paid details became so enticing — with some cops paid $300 to $500 a night to provide security for professional athletes — that some officers were more committed to the side hustles than their actual jobs.</span></p>
<p><span>NOPD Officers would “ghost” work after roll call, leave in the middle of an investigation, and double dip or use sick leave to do details, the DOJ found.</span></p>
<p><span>Last summer, the MPD — down 300 officers —&nbsp;struggled to cover shifts. Some officers were doing off-duty shifts rather than overtime for the city.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Only a dozen cops were patrolling downtown on weekend night shifts.</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/08/25/policing-minneapolis-amid-a-staffing-shortage/"> <span>One night</span></a><span>, as a police dispatcher tried to find a cop to respond to reports of a man pointing a gun at people, Lt. Kelly O’Rourke, who was in charge of policing the downtown area,</span> <span>pulled into a parking lot where an off-duty officer was sitting in a squad car, monitoring the lot near nightclubs.</span></p>
<p><span>The officers make two to four times as much pulling an off-duty shift, so they prefer to do that, O’Rourke</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2022/08/25/policing-minneapolis-amid-a-staffing-shortage/"> <span>said</span></a><span> at the time.</span></p>
<p><span>The DOJ said MPD’s system</span><a target="_blank" href="https://minnesotareformer.com/2023/08/16/doj-mpd-off-duty-work-system-undermines-supervision/"> <span>undermines</span></a><span> supervision of officers because patrol officers manage disbursement of the gigs, deciding who gets the work — including supervisors. That creates a disincentive for supervisors to hold those officers accountable for misconduct, the DOJ said.</span></p>
<p><span>In New Orleans, the officers scheduling off-duty work got extra pay from businesses, making up to $200 per week, the DOJ found. MPD officers also get paid for scheduling off-duty officers.</span></p>
<p><span>And as in Minneapolis, some New Orleans business owners felt pressured to hire the police.</span></p>
<p><span>“Businesses sometimes feel they must pay for details to obtain the police services that should be provided by NOPD as a matter of routine policing,” the DOJ said. “In addition, businesses have no way to hold officers accountable when they do not show up for their contracted detail or perform poorly while on detail.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, New Orleans banned cash payments and began centralizing the system, with</span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.police1.com/local-government/articles/judge-new-orleans-cops-can-work-more-off-duty-details-to-combat-crime-tAg98hZYnlbfFplt/"> <span>mixed results</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If the city of Minneapolis fails to reform off-duty work, Gurian-Sherman, the lawyer pushing for MPD reforms, hopes the DOJ forces its hand.</span></p>
<p><span>“This is happening in full view,” Gurian-Sherman said. “The city has to stop looking the other way.”</span></p>
    <h4>‘It’s a racket’</h4>

	
<p><span>When it became clear that Chauvin and Floyd knew each other because they both worked at El Nuevo Rodeo, the whole world wanted to hear from Santamaria about her two former employees — one dead and one a cop charged with killing him.</span></p>
<p><span>Later, Chauvin was charged with evading taxes on what she’d paid him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Prosecutors said Chauvin failed to pay taxes on $95,920 he earned doing security for El Nuevo Rodeo between 2014 and 2019. In addition to EME Antro Bar, where prosecutors said Chauvin was paid $250 cash for 3.5 hours, he also worked off-duty shifts at Cub Foods and Midtown Global Market.</span></p>
<p><span>Chauvin pleaded guilty to two crimes in March, saying he didn’t report the payments due to financial problems, and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Santamaria — who owns a Spanish language radio station, La Raza 95.7FM — was interviewed by state investigators about her work with MPD.</span></p>
<p><span>She looks back on those days with disgust. She sensed the city licensing division was in cahoots with MPD to make minority business owners hire the police.</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s a racket,” she said. “You were damned if you did, damned if you didn’t … you were always having to break the law.”</span></p>

<p>We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.6 to the Python Package Index (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/mypy/">PyPI</a>). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:


</p><pre>    python3 -m pip install -U mypy
</pre>

<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href="http://mypy.readthedocs.io/">Read the Docs</a>.

</p><h2>Introduce Error Subcodes for Import Errors</h2>

<p>Mypy now uses the error code <tt>import-untyped</tt> if an import targets an installed library that doesn’t support static type checking, and no stub files are available. Other invalid imports produce the <tt>import-not-found</tt> error code. They both are subcodes of the <tt>import</tt> error code, which was previously used for both kinds of import-related errors. 

</p><p>Use <tt>--disable-error-code=import-untyped</tt> to only ignore import errors about installed libraries without stubs. This way mypy will still report errors about typos in import statements, for example.

</p><p>If you use  <tt>--warn-unused-ignore</tt> or <tt>--strict</tt>, mypy will complain if you use <tt># type: ignore[import]</tt> to ignore an import error. You are expected to use one of the more specific error codes instead. Otherwise, ignoring the <tt>import</tt> error code continues to silence both errors.

</p><p>This feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15840">15840</a>, PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14740">14740</a>).

</p><h2>Remove Support for Targeting Python 3.6 and Earlier</h2>

<p>Running mypy with <tt>--python-version 3.6</tt>, for example, is no longer supported. Python 3.6 hasn’t been properly supported by mypy for some time now, and this makes it explicit. This was contributed by Nikita Sobolev (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15668">15668</a>).

</p><h2>Selective Filtering of <tt>--disallow-untyped-calls</tt> Targets</h2>

<p>Using <tt>--disallow-untyped-calls</tt> could be annoying when using libraries with missing type information, as mypy would generate many errors about code that uses the library. Now you can use <tt>--untyped-calls-exclude=acme</tt>, for example, to disable these errors about calls targeting functions defined in the <tt>acme</tt> package. Refer to the <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-untyped-calls-exclude">documentation</a> for more information.

</p><p>This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15845">15845</a>).

</p><h2>Improved Type Inference between Callable Types</h2>

<p>Mypy now does a better job inferring type variables inside arguments of callable types. For example, this code fragment now type checks correctly:


</p><pre>    def f(c: Callable[[T, S], None]) -&gt; Callable[[str, T, S], None]: ...
    def g(*x: int) -&gt; None: ...
    
    reveal_type(f(g))  # Callable[[str, int, int], None]
</pre>

<p>This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15910">15910</a>).

</p><h2>Don’t Consider None and TypeVar to Overlap in Overloads</h2>

<p>Mypy now doesn’t consider an overload item with an argument type <tt>None</tt> to overlap with a type variable:

</p><pre>    @overload
    def f(x: None) -&gt; None: ..
    @overload
    def f(x: T) -&gt; Foo[T]: ...
    ...
</pre>

<p>Previously mypy would generate an error about the definition of <tt>f</tt> above. This is slightly unsafe if the upper bound of <tt>T</tt> is <tt>object</tt>, since the value of the type variable could be <tt>None</tt>. We relaxed the rules a little, since this solves a common issue.

</p><p>This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR <a href="https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15846">15846</a>).

</p><h2>Improvements to <tt>--</tt><tt>new-type-inference</tt></h2>

Reading through the anonymous and semi-anonymous woes and tips from the Glassdoor community, it's clear that many laid-off techies and new STEM grads are struggling to find work, applying to more open roles, and in some cases, lowering their expectations for pay and job satisfaction.&nbsp;</p><p>One data analyst in Glassdoor's #JobsInTech group recently wrote: "Cannot believe how difficult it has been this year to get a job. Applied for well over 600 jobs since 1st June, had a fair few interviews, but not getting any further. This is killing me." A <a href="https://joinfishbowl.com/post_c1uc1myi35" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">project manager</a> expressed similar frustration: "I have been looking for over a year now. 25 years in IT. Sent out more than 900 applications. Reduced my rate in half. Do I just give up at this point and switch professions." These often raw sentiments stand in sharp contrast to the Goldilocks outlook painted by official labor-market data for the broader economy.&nbsp;</p><p>While there are plenty of explanations for this sudden vibe shift — from rising interest rates to stock-market swings — an inconvenient truth is that much of the tech sector's problems stem from the fact that the industry strayed from its roots of listening to the front lines. The collaborative culture at tech companies not only kept employees happy but also helped create better products for customers. The buildup of layers of management without also adding tech-savvy workers that build core products has resulted in a sclerotic environment that is weighing on employees. If the tech industry wants to get back to the flow zone of innovation, productivity, and workplace happiness, executives must restart conversations with the front-line workers that make their products — or risk losing what made Silicon Valley so desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Big tech, big money, big worries</h2><p>The easiest way for tech companies to explain away the sudden <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-job-site-blind-anxiety-burnout-recession-stock-crash-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">sentiment shift</a> among tech workers is to place the blame on the curdling of the broader economic climate.</p><p>For over a decade, low-interest rates, steady consumer confidence, and an increasingly educated workforce created a business ecosystem that encouraged companies to make bold bets on the future. Tech companies, with visions of new ways of connecting the world and living our lives, were uniquely positioned to take advantage of this appetite for growth. To be credible, these bold bets required a patina of scientific innovation — Silicon Valley needed a phalanx of smart, savvy knowledge workers to deliver on the underlying promise of their new products. To woo these potential employees, tech companies had to lure them with cash or a better quality of life than the grueling but lucrative workplace culture of Wall Street firms. Over the past decade, the influx of investor cash facilitated by the favorable economic environment made those promises easy to keep.</p><p>That fertile ground was slowly salted over the past two years as the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates higher. By increasing the cost of borrowing money to fund risky ideas, rate hikes forced businesses across the economy to reevaluate the bets on their balance sheets and cut projects deemed unlikely to bring in profits in the short term. In an industry like tech, where companies regularly make multibillion-dollar bets on emerging technology that may not produce real profits for years, that's a lot of reevaluation.&nbsp;</p><p>Several prominent tech companies have taken an uncompromising stance to limit growth in compensation costs and enforce in-office work mandates: Microsoft <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-wont-raise-salaries-for-full-time-employees-this-year-2023-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">announced</a> in May that full-time employees would not receive raises this year, and Amazon has <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-andy-jassy-rto-office-policy-employee-jobs-2023-8" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">notified</a> employees reluctant to return to the office that their jobs might be at stake. Winter and spring layoffs this year stretched some teams thin, and the looming threat of <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-ai-technology-end-of-coding-software-developers-jobs-2023-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">generative AI</a> is sparking fears of job insecurity among workers who long viewed themselves as the winners in the enduring race between man and machine.&nbsp;</p><p>This turn in the economy is starting to weigh on the tech job market. Despite largely pristine <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jobs-unemployment-rate-labor-market-september-report-2023-10" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">headline jobs data</a>, the tech job market has become a distinct pocket of weakness. The labor market has softened sharply in at least two prominent tech communities — <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/conversation-starter-tech-metro-recessions" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">the California Bay Area and Austin, Texas</a> — where the local unemployment rate has increased by more than half a percentage point over the past year, a common signal of imminent recession. <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/jobs-report-preview-september-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">Unemployment claims</a> from information-sector workers have doubled compared to a year ago — and, pandemic aside, are now on par with the highest levels since 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>But the truth is that the pressures of the broader economy are not the main cause of a sag in tech-worker satisfaction. Many other industries have felt the squeeze of higher interest rates and their spillover to consumer spending, but none have seen their employees' satisfaction dip as significantly as Silicon Valley. The underlying reasons for the unhappiness among tech workers have been building for some time — and they strike at the very heart of the industry's once-vaunted conventions.</p><h2>From hoodies to neckties</h2><p>At the core of the tech industry's current malaise is an aging corporate culture. Glassdoor employee-satisfaction data reveals two big changes that have been unfolding over the past several years, predating but accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>First, the "<a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/research/jobs-report-preview-february-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">managementization</a>" of tech. Over the past five years or so, the ratio of front-line workers to managers has deteriorated — meaning there are more managers for every "maker" in tech than before. Earlier this year, before layoffs aimed to flatten organizational hierarchies, the number of front-line jobs was more or less where it stood on the eve of the pandemic, while the number of managerial jobs was 9% higher. Economy wide, there were on average 6.6 front-line workers per manager in 2018 and 2019, but post-pandemic, the ratio dropped to 6 to 1.</p><p>While the trend is not unique to the tech industry — it's also visible in industries like finance and healthcare — it's a sharp contrast from the historically flat hierarchies at companies that fueled the 1990s tech boom and a jarring shift for employees who were used to a more direct line to the top. Of course, many tech managers also perform front-line tasks such as coding or data analysis, and some managers manage processes instead of people (for instance, transportation managers). It's possible that as tech companies have grown into more complex organizations, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/middle-managers-great-flattening-organization-meta-tech-layoffs-firing-2023-3" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">more management layers</a> are necessary. But the underlying result is the same: The people building the products are increasingly removed from the people making strategic decisions.</p><p>Second, it's an open secret that the best jobs in tech aren't necessarily technical. The workers at big tech companies who report the highest job satisfaction in Glassdoor reviews aren't in technical or builder roles like engineering or science. While non-STEM roles — for instance, in human resources and marketing — can and often do contribute to cutting-edge technological innovations, they are more likely to focus on supporting and enabling the core technology.</p><p>It's worth asking why the employees furthest from the technical frontier are happier in their jobs than those making the actual products. Perhaps it's that they are more grateful for the opportunity, suspecting that their job opportunities might be bleaker in other industries — a sentiment suggested by the writer Kristi Coulter in her recently published <a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374600907/exitinterview" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-product-module="body_link">memoir</a> about her decade-long career at Amazon. Or perhaps the rankings reflect overextended and under-resourced technical ranks.&nbsp;</p><p>The unavoidable truth is that working at the most familiar standard-bearers of tech has become a lot like working elsewhere in the economy: High pay is usually justified by a more demanding schedule and longer workdays (and often "work weekends"). This evolution isn't unusual — it's the well-trodden path for past generations of industry innovators. With time, they become bigger, more stable, and more routine. The tech titans of prior generations — from Ford Motor Company in the 1920s to Intel in the 1990s — were once workplace innovators but came to be known as boring, corporate giants as they aged into staples of the global economy.</p><h2>Can tech turn it around?</h2><p>All is not lost for the tech industry, however. Recapturing the spark of innovation among employees will require executives to recalibrate their organizational compass: flatten org structures, focus on the long horizon so that employees have the opportunity to feel stable in their roles, and re-prioritize investment in the core technical talent that drives the development of crucial products.&nbsp;</p><p>Fundamentally, it's about listening to and elevating the voices of front-line employees. When the workers directly involved in creating the technology are allowed to speak up, unconventional, bold ideas tend to bubble up. By asking questions beyond the senior management echo chamber, engaging employees one-on-one, and creating spaces for employees to voice their hopes and hunches in psychologically safe forums, tech companies can not only reignite their workplace culture but also better serve customers.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of productive communication has perhaps become harder in an era of remote work — but we shouldn't pretend that it comes effortlessly in the office either. It's a starkly different, humbler skill set from the TED Talk theatrics and fundraising prowess that drove tech success over the past decade. To shake tech workers out of their recent funk and get the industry back on a path of innovation, companies need to start listening to their builders again and empower them to do what they do best.</p><hr><p><em><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/author/aaron-terrazas" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Aaron Terrazas</a> is chief economist at Glassdoor, providing research, analysis and commentary on today's evolving workplace and fast-changing labor market.</em></p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>A Medium story first popped in to my feed last year and it got me thinking about the state of how the tech industry interviews and evaluates candidates.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-1.png" alt="Medium article focused on why many senior devs fail leetcode interviews">
<em><a href="https://medium.com/the-coding-diaries/why-experienced-programmers-fail-coding-interviews-b22210ba343">https://medium.com/the-coding-diaries/why-experienced-programmers-fail-coding-interviews-b22210ba343</a></em></p>
<p>Recently, a friend shared with  me his plans to take some time off to study for common leetcode problems to practice as he was planning his applications for FAANG companies.</p>
<p>Is that really what one wants to select for when hiring for a new member of an engineering team - the person that had the most free time to invest in studying leetcode challenges?</p>
<p>Having been on both sides of the coin, I have always had a dislike for leetcode exercises as an evaluation mechanism for technical candidates for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>As much as solving algorithmically complex problems is fun and rewarding, the reality is that for most productive developers, most of our coding time isn’t really focused on this type of work.</li>
<li>Most of us regularly reference StackOverflow, documentation, and other online resources when solving challenging coding problems day-to-day. We’ll chat with peers and whiteboard different ideas. With the explosion of AI coding tools, many devs are already including Copilot and ChatGPT into their workflows.</li>
<li>Many types/classes of complex problems, we may only code once or twice in a blue moon. For example, I have a complex Firestore abstraction layer that I wrote once, that I just keep reusing. The point of writing complex, high-abstraction code is so that you only write this type of code once.</li>
<li>It creates an artificial situation that induces stress. Few of us code while others are watching over our shoulders. And fewer of us are coding against a fixed time constraint in real life. For hard problems, I may go for a walk, talk to a co-worker, research algorithms, build small toy codebases first, etc. Quite honestly, most of us probably create our best code in isolation when we’re in a flow state; the exact opposite of a high-stakes interview.</li>
<li>Developers code best in their own environments with their own tools. Using an unfamiliar tool can be disorienting and again, add to stress and anxiety as someone watches.</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this means that <em>using this approach could end up measuring for all the wrong metrics or measuring for metrics that have very little impact on how well a candidate can productively fit into a team</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not only that, as teams become more reliant on generated code to increase productivity - whether Copilot or GPT-I think that the ability to quickly read that code and identify subtle defects in the context of the larger application or domain space becomes more valuable.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-2.gif" alt="GPT generating a solution to N-Queens">
<em>GPT generating the solution to a common leetcode challenge N-Queens</em></p>
<p>A while back, I had the opportunity to participate in an interview which was structured around <em>reviewing code</em> rather than writing code. It was a revelation. Rather than focus on coding exercises, using code reviews as interview can be a better way to evaluate software engineering candidates.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="8-reasons-to-consider-code-review-as-interview">8 Reasons to consider code review as interview</h2>
<p>There are a few reasons why I think code reviews make for an inherently better technical interview experience:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the age of AI, an emerging reason is that using AI generated code is a source of risk in terms of performance, security, and internal best practices (especially important in regulated industries).  Being able to effectively evaluate code in the context of the larger codebase becomes an even more important skill when relying on piecemeal generated code.</li>
<li>It is a better reflection of the day-to-day activities that engineers - especially more senior roles - engage in. Providing effective guidance and quality feedback to peers and especially junior team members can improve overall productivity and output quality in the long run.</li>
<li>It provides a more holistic view of how a candidate reasons, thinks, and communicates; in other words, it provides a better picture of the candidate as a teammate on the whole. This includes insights into the candidate’s depth of experience.</li>
<li>Code reviews are inherently more collaborative whereas writing code tends to be a more isolated activity (personally, I tend to code best in complete silence in evening hours). Code reviews are perhaps a better indicator of how it feels to work together with a candidate rather than having the candidate solve a technical puzzle.</li>
<li>There is more subjectivity to a code review; it’s not black or white. It naturally provides more opportunities for discussion and interpretation. It also provides more opportunities to arrive at outliers since there’s no single “solution”. For 5 candidates, you’ll get 5 unique variations whereas common algorithmic challenges may have a small number of optimal responses.</li>
<li>It is hard to “cheat” using generative AI or studying for leetcode problems.&nbsp;</li>
<li>It is better suited for evaluating technical roles that have a bias towards reading code versus writing code. This includes engineering managers, architects, and support staff.</li>
<li>It better reflects how a candidate is going to be spending their first few days or weeks anyways: learning the existing system by reading through the code. Doesn’t it make sense to measure how well they can do this rather than how quickly they can solve N-Queens?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="strategies">Strategies</h2>
<p>If you’re convinced, the next step is to think about different strategies to use when setting up your code review. There are a few strategies that you can mix and match to measure the range of a candidate.</p>
<p>A common thread to each of the strategies is that rather than inventing - or worse finding - a time-boxed puzzle to solve, an approach focused on code reviews lends itself to using bits and pieces of an existing codebase and actual problems that a team has been working on.</p>
<h3 id="au-naturel">“Au naturel”</h3>
<p>Take actual, relevant and interesting parts of an active codebase as-is and use those as the context for review. Data access, exception handling, input handling - these all make for great points of focus to see a candidate’s feedback on an existing codebase and how quickly they can read and understand your existing code.</p>
<h3 id="bug-hunter">Bug hunter</h3>
<p>Intentionally introduce some logical flaw or defect and see if a candidate can spot it. A good idea is to go back and find recent bugs that were solved and pull the source before the fix was applied. Can the candidate identify the root cause? How would the candidate suggest resolving the defect? How does that response differ from the one that was implemented?</p>
<h3 id="refactor-andredesign">Refactor and&nbsp;redesign</h3>
<p>Recently completed a refactor or planning a refactor? Use the code prior to the refactor as the context and see how the candidate thinks about the code before the refactor and what strategies a candidate would use to plan and execute the refactor. See if the candidate can identify why a refactor would be desired and evaluate the sophistication of their approach; you might be surprised and find an entirely novel alternate approach!</p>
<p>This is particularly useful when a candidate is joining a brownfield project.</p>
<h3 id="performance-oriented">Performance oriented</h3>
<p>Find code that was recently fixed for a performance issue and see if the candidate can spot why a piece of code might be slow. See if the candidate can propose an algorithm, alternate design, or fix to improve the performance of the code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Include existing SQL DDL schema and common natural language queries that the application will perform.  Remove the index definitions and see if the candidate can propose indices or alternate designs to improve performance.</p>
<p>Instead of asking about the principles of Big-O notation, see if the candidate can actually spot some <code>O(n^2)</code> code or <code>N+1</code> issues in data access code!</p>
<h3 id="test-focused">Test focused</h3>
<p>Share a fragment of code and a set of unit tests for the code. Are all the cases covered? Are there cases not covered? How could the unit tests be improved? This perspective may be more important in the coming age of AI generated code: understanding the domain space and use case and how to write high coverage unit tests - or evaluating the completeness of generated unit tests - becomes a key skill.</p>
<h3 id="security-hawk">Security hawk</h3>
<p>Use code that has subtle security flaws and see if the candidate can identify said flaws. Rather than merely asking what an XSS or SQL injection attack is, see if the candidate can identify such flaws in code by using code that lacks protection against said attacks. Again, as teams come to rely on AI-generated code, having the experience to identify potential security flaws in the generated code becomes more important.</p>
<h3 id="best-practices">Best practices</h3>
<p>For more senior positions, focusing on best practices is a great way to find candidates that can identify, communicate, and teach best practices to more junior candidates and direct reports.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="try-coderevapp">Try CodeRev.app</h2>
<p>If you’re sold on the idea like me, check out my new project <a href="https://coderev.app/">CodeRev.app</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrlschn.dev/img/code-review-as-interview/coderev-3.png" alt="CodeRev screenshot">
<em>CodeRev.app candidate workspace.</em></p>
<p>CodeRev.app is a (free) lightweight tool that’s designed to facilitate code review as interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why use it instead of CodeSandbox, Stackblitz, or GitHub?</p>
<ul>
<li>CodeRev is tightly focused on reading and commenting rather than coding whereas GitHub only has comments on PRs</li>
<li>CodeRev works great with fragments of code and you can mix and match different files without trying to make the project as a whole actually run. Just throw in whatever files make for interesting discussion!</li>
<li>CodeRev eliminates boilerplate that is inherent in modern projects one might be tempted to load into CodeSandbox or Stackblitz. Just pick the interesting source files and put them into CodeRev.</li>
<li>CodeRev lets you quickly toggle between the responses from different candidates so you can compare and see the insights and feedback they provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s still early stage so let me know if you run across bugs or you have ideas!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>In <em>The End of Average</em>, Todd Rose writes:</p>
<blockquote>
Just about any meaningful human characteristic - especially talent - consists of multiple dimensions. The problem is that when trying to measure for talent, we frequently resort to the average, reducing our jagged talent to a single dimension like a score on a standardized test or grades or a job performance ranking.
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if we select for a narrow set of problem solving skills, then we end up selecting against an “average” of candidates who have simply studied and prepared to achieve against those dimensions and miss out on many candidates whose <em>jagged talents</em> contribute to the character and productivity of a team.</p>
<p>Incorporating code reviews as interview as part of a team’s repertoire can help better measure a wider range of a candidate’s skill than leetcode alone.</p>
<p>As our industry shifts and the profession comes to rely more on AI tools like Copilot and GPT to generate code for productivity gains, there is a greater importance on finding ways to identify jagged talent; robotically solving algorithmic puzzles becomes the lesser of the qualities we want in a candidate. Instead, perhaps the key skill is the ability to read and review that code for correctness, best practices, and security.</p>
<p>Replacing leetcode with code reviews as interview can help teams not only better measure candidates on the whole, but also prepare for this shift in how we approach building software by focusing on more relevant skills and those aspects of a candidate that make for a better <em>human</em> teammate.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_Union_member_states_by_political_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a heterogeneous group of 27 countries</a>.
Some of its member states, like Hungary and Poland, are still immature barely-liberal regimes with more than
a whiff of political repression
(<a href="https://pages.eiu.com/rs/753-RIQ-438/images/DI-final-version-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<!-- -->flawed democracies<!-- -->”</a>).
As recently as last year there was strong evidence of
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/10/eu-close-to-launching-committee-of-inquiry-into-pegasus-spyware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<!-- -->attempts by national security services to illegally access information on political opponents through their phones<!-- -->”</a>
in those two countries.
But not even
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway#Politics_and_government" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the most robust democracy in the world (another European country)</a>
should be trusted with a fundamentally unethical law like Chat Control.</p><p>In light of alarming proposals like Chat Control, everyone should make the effort to escape the opaque protocols and
the convenient Trojan Horses that are popular social networks and messaging services,
and make their daily communication truly private.
We should make strong encryption a staple of our digital life.</p><p>We should all use PGP, SSL or equivalent tools; VPNs, Tor and/or SSH tunnelling; IPFS, or other distributed
file systems<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->—<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->and ditch proprietary OS's in favour of Linux or truly free Android distros.
We should switch to Protonmail or similar webmail;
to Matrix, Signal or similar messaging.
Ad-blocking, URL cleansing and third-party cookie rejection should be the default for everyone.
Those tools and techniques should cease to be arcane nice-to-haves for nerds:
we must get more non-technical people onboard.</p><p>All this is a moral imperative to those of us who have the ability and the means to follow this strategy and to educate others about it.</p><p>As long as we still have access to computing resources, free software and some form of encrypted tunnelling,
we can resist: those are the minimum requirements for a humanist digital environment to sustain itself.
In the future it might be that by developing and using some software and exchanging certain sequences of bits we will be breaking some law.
Such a law would be wrong and unjust.</p><p>More than twenty years ago, some of us were sprinkling our regular e-mail with words like <!-- -->“<!-- -->iraq<!-- -->”<!-- -->,
<!-- -->“<!-- -->bomb<!-- -->”<!-- --> and <!-- -->“<!-- -->attack<!-- -->”<!-- -->, often on a line appended to the end of messages, in response to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talk about <abbr title="Three Letter Agencies">TLAs</abbr> scanning all digital communication</a>
in the wake of the <!-- -->“<!-- -->war on terror<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
I don't know if that strategy was effective in the end, but the goal we pursued with it was right.</p><p>In the same spirit, today everyone should communicate safely in private, if only to erect
a collective smoke screen that will confuse the mass surveillance apparatus and protect the most vulnerable among us.</p><p>(For similar reasons, everyone should choose free software when that's feasible;
demand open source and open standards and document formats from all public institutions;
and defend blockchains<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->—<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->including cryptocurrencies<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->—<!-- -->&nbsp;<!-- -->and
the <!-- -->“<!-- -->right to repair<!-- -->”<!-- -->.
Strategically though, it may be better to stick to a minimum set of common demands for the sake of building
the largest coalition possible now.)</p><p>There is strength in numbers: that's how civil disobedience works.
It would be naive to think that we can get everyone in the EU to understand the imminent threat of (even deeper)
mass surveillance and to act on it.
But if a significant fraction of European citizens recognised the seriousness of the situation and made
the little effort required to secure their data and their communications, there is no way a law like Chat Control
could be enforced.</p><ul><li><abbr title="Electronic Frontier Foundation">EFF</abbr>'s <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">surveillance self-defence guide</a></li><li>Bruce Schneier: <a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“<!-- -->The Value of Privacy<!-- -->”</a></li><li><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StopChatControl.eu</a> campaign (<code>#StopChatControl</code>)</li></ul><p><a href="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" src="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/1-1-1024x1024.png" alt="https://stopchatcontrol.eu/"></a></p><div><p>Glass building image by Stable Diffusion <!-- -->&amp;<!-- --> tripu</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>In August 1996, US president Bill Clinton made a portentous announcement from the White House. He was talking about a rock.</p>
<p>‘Today, rock 84001 speaks to us across all those billions of years and millions of miles’, he said. ‘It speaks of the possibility of life. If this discovery is confirmed, it will surely be one of the most stunning insights into our universe that science has ever uncovered.’</p>
<p>The Martian meteorite ALH84001, picked up at Allan Hills in Antarctica in 1984, was then in the process of acquiring notoriety for revealing the Martians that never were. Researchers at NASA claimed in 1996 that inspection of the meteorite under the electron microscope revealed weird, wormlike nodules which could be <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5277.924">‘fossil remains of a past martian biota’</a>.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>In fact, ALH84001 had a different message for us: about the danger of inferring life from morphology. It has never become clear what processes created the peculiar microstructures of the meteorite, but there’s no strong reason to believe they involved Martian microbes, and plenty of evidence that non-living processes can generate comparable shapes and forms. Perhaps chief among these are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b03018">reaction-diffusion systems</a>, of which the periodic precipitation process discovered in 1896 by German chemist Raphael Eduard Liesegang may be a variant.<sup>2</sup> It’s now widely believed that some of the oldest putative microfossils on Earth,<sup>3</sup> showing filamentary structures once thought to be fossil bacteria, are also in fact inorganic.</p>
<p>Perhaps a little chastened by the damp squib of ALH84001, NASA scientists began in the late 1990s to develop an artificial-intelligence system that would be able to distinguish the living from the non-living on the basis of morphology. They called it the D’Arcy Machine, after Scottish zoologist D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson, whose epic 1917 book <em>On Growth and Form</em> was one of the most comprehensive early efforts to understand how complex morphologies arise in both living and abiotic systems.</p>
<p>The project was led by chemist David Noever of NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. The idea was that a neural network would be trained on all known biological forms on Earth to find features diagnostic of life. ‘By repeatedly comparing and contrasting learnable imagery’, NASA claimed, ‘a D’Arcy machine would… give us an interplanetary version of D’Arcy Thompson’s classic [book].’</p>
<p>It seems that nothing notable came from the project. But might that be because there isn’t really any reliable morphological distinction between the living and abiotic?</p>
<p>That question was raised in a recent meeting in Tokyo, Japan, titled ‘Diversity of Biological Patterns and Forms in Nature’ and hosted by the Meiji Institute for Advanced Study of Mathematical Sciences. While most of the presentations discussed the dizzying array of forms that the living world produces – few are more astonishing than those of South American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treehopper">treehoppers</a> – chemist <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/4017782.article">Oliver Steinbock</a> of Florida State University offered a reminder of how shape alone is a poor guide.</p>
<h3>In the chemical garden</h3>
<p>Steinbock described the complex and often beautiful forms of chemical gardens, made by precipitating salts within a solution of sodium silicate (water glass). The repeated formation of soft inorganic membranes followed by their breaching due to osmotic pressure gives rise to twisting, bulbous mineral columns. Isaac Newton studied such structures in the 17th century and proclaimed that they had something ‘vegetative’ about them.</p>
<p>Shape is one thing – but even the kind of complex motion we might intuitively associate with life doesn’t necessarily provide clinching evidence. Steinbock showed that short lengths of the tubular structures in manganese chemical gardens can act as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpcb.1c09088">self-propelled particles</a> – active matter – in solutions of hydrogen peroxide, catalytically generating oxygen that bubbles out of the tube end and propels it forward.<sup>4</sup> The trajectories of these particles can be surprisingly complicated, especially when several interact hydrodynamically with one another. In particular, the particles, typically a few millimetres long, can appear to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SM00395C">congregate like microbes</a> into a ring pattern – driven by the surface tension and buoyancy of a collective oxygen bubble in the ring’s centre.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>These little tubules can also show <a href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2SM01681H">periodic cycles of ascent and descent</a> in the liquid due to the buoyancy of an oxygen bubble and its release at the surface.<sup>6</sup> It’s tempting to read this motion visually as some kind of purposeful behaviour. The fact is that we seem naturally inclined to infer life and purpose in all manner of complexity: we are prone to what you might call ‘biotic pareidolia’, the analogue of our impulse to see faces in non-living structures (including the rocks of Mars!).</p>
<p>Can today’s immensely powerful deep-learning AI, potentially free from such cognitive biases, do better in identifying what is truly life-like? Given recent developments that have exposed how strongly we project life and thought onto AI itself, I wonder about that. If AI can persuade us that it’s alive, it might not have much trouble convincing us that something else is.</p></div><div><h3>References</h3><p>1 D S McKay <em>et al.</em>, <em>Science</em>, 1996,&nbsp;<strong>273</strong>, 924 (DOI: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.273.5277.924">10.1126/science.273.5277.924</a>)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The University of Turku in Finland is developing an artificial language corpus proficient in all European languages, including Estonian, to preserve minor languages in the post-ChatGPT era. The Estonian Language Institute (EKI) supports the initiative but warns that an operational language model requires digitizing substantially more Estonian texts than is currently available.</p><div><p>"The English ChatGPT stunned the world with its ability to comprehend and respond to a person&nbsp;in a manner resembling natural speech. It wasn't a miracle technology; it was given an unprecedented amount of text to identify patterns in and learn to mimic human communication," Eleri Aedmaa, a natural language processing engineer at the Institute of the Estonian Language, said.</p><p>"In the new era of language technologies, the quantity of texts matters. To reach this critical mass with Estonian as many texts as possible must be digitized and made available: the entirety of the National Library, all of its archives, as much current and historical news as possible, including online communication. The more Estonian is readily accessible on the Internet, the more secure the language's future will be," the linguist said.</p><p>University of Turku and language technology company SiloGen <a href="https://www.silo.ai/blog/silo-ai-launches-a-consortium-to-build-the-worlds-largest-open-llm">are spearheading</a> the creation of the largest open language model in the world, covering all official European languages, on one of the pan-European supercomputers, LUMI, is located in Kajaani, Finland. It is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. The quantity of distinct and original digital Estonian texts that can be made available for this and future language learning models, according to Aedmaa, is a fundamental issue for training the model in Estonian.</p><p><strong>ChatGPT only thinks in English</strong></p><p>Aedmaa said that one of the shortcomings of the increasingly prevalent large language models is that they are trained almost exclusively in English. This implies that although GPT-4 appears to comprehend Estonian, it is still limited to translation. The machine, so to say, thinks in English and translates the conversation at the last moment into Estonian. "This is really dangerous for the Estonian language in the long run," Aedmaa said.</p><p>"The value of these new tools lies in the fact that they comprehend not only individual words and sentences, but also the cultural context as a whole. If a language model is trained solely on the basis of English content, it will inevitably lack cultural knowledge of Estonia," she said.</p><p>"The situation is comparable to when the printing press was invented - what would have become of the Estonian language if books had been printed only in the major languages, but not in Estonian?" She asked. According to Aedmaa, the problem now affects nearly all of the world's languages.</p><p>The language model being developed by the Finns is a GPT-like digital&nbsp;machine that has been trained on a wide range of languages from the ground up. "The objectives are European linguistic sovereignty and the democratization of language technology. Unlike the majority of its predecessors, the new language model will be open source; its logic is transparent and can be utilized by anyone developing new language technology applications," Aedmaa said.</p><p>The Finns' project is supported by Business Finland, a body similar to the Estonian Business and Innovation Agency (EISA). It has also been supported by the EU Horizon program. LUMI provided a number of free training hours to the developers so that they could test the model.</p><p><strong>There are too few sources in Estonian to train a large language model</strong></p><p>Kadri Vare, head of the EKI's language and speech technology department, said the agency&nbsp;is presently exploring additional ways to help Finns. "We intend to work with them and have taken preliminary steps in that regard. Then we will be able to specify more precisely what and how much we can contribute to this endeavor. We have already contributed by making all of our legally permissible language data available to them," Vare told ERR.</p><p>In particular, Vare said, even more data could be digitized and made public to contribute to the success of the initiative. "The large language models use the entirety of the internet and every written word. Right now, we do not know exactly what they have taken and from where; we do not know if they have access to potentially more sensitive data. It would be important to us to find out," she said.</p><p>There is a shortage of available Estonian content for the large language model at present, however. "There are approximately three billion words of Estonian public data in the main language corpora, according to our knowledge. In contrast, English contains over 800 billion words. Three billion may seem like a lot, but in reality it is still insufficient. Training an artificial intelligence to comprehend Estonian language and culture is insufficient. It is simply too little," Vare said.</p><p>At the moment, the EKI is in the process of compiling a large Estonian language corpus. "These datasets are public, and we are pleased to share them. Participating in large open language models and collecting data for them is, in my opinion, one of the most important goals for Estonian language preservation," she concluded.</p><p>--</p><p><em>Follow ERR News on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ERRNews/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/errnews">Twitter</a> and never miss an update!</em></p>									</div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p><span>Officials in a small Iowa town twice arrested a young man for criticizing the police department and saying it violates people's civil rights. Now the town is facing a lawsuit for violating <em>his</em> civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ECF-No.-1-Complaint-and-Jury-Demand-FILE-STAMPED-10.12.23.pdf"><span>federal lawsuit</span></a><span> filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Iowa, Noah Petersen says the town of Newton violated the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments when the police chief arrested him for speaking during the public comment period of a City Council meeting. Petersen is represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public interest law firm.</span></p> <p>"The mayor and police chief had Noah arrested, jailed, strip-searched, and criminally prosecuted simply because they didn't like what Noah had to say," the lawsuit states. "This suit is filed to vindicate the fundamental right to criticize the government without fear of retaliation and to ensure the constitutional accountability of all government officials."</p> <p><span>Petersen was prompted to speak at an October 3, 2022, Newton City Council meeting after the release of </span><a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/watch-newton-man-says-police-wrongfully-arrested-him-at-traffic-stop/41069939"><span>body cam footage</span></a><span> showing Newton officers arresting a college football player, Tayvin Galanakis. Galanakis was arrested for driving under the influence, despite blowing a 0.00 on a Breathalyzer and passing roadside sobriety tests. He was taken to the police station for further drug tests, all of which came back negative, before eventually being released.</span></p> <p>Petersen approached the microphone and said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>Hello. This is my public comment for [the] City Council meeting, now October 3rd, 2022. Defund Newton Police Department. They are a violent, civil and human rights–violating organization who do not make your community safer. They are also pro–domestic abuse because they are currently employing a domestic abuser and choosing to not release the records about that domestic abuser.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>At that point, the Newton mayor ordered Petersen to stop speaking, although his allotted three minutes of time had not expired. When Petersen refused, the mayor ordered the police chief to remove Petersen for violating a council rule forbidding "derogatory statements or comments about any individual."</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was handcuffed, arrested, and jailed until his parents could post bond for him<strong>.</strong> He returned to the next City Council meeting to speak during the public comment period and was once again arrested after calling the police chief and mayor fascists.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was charged both times with disorderly conduct for disrupting a lawful assembly. However, as </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/02/06/an-iowa-town-charged-a-man-with-disorderly-conduct-because-he-called-a-cop-a-domestic-abuser/"><span>reported</span></a><span> in February, those charges did not stick:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Last Wednesday, Petersen was found not guilty of his disorderly conduct charge. Adding to his victory, the judge overturned the rule barring "derogatory" statements about individuals during city council meetings.

"My initial criticism was about the way they treat citizens in our community. They arrested me for exercising my right to free speech—for standing up for what I believe is right.

    <p>I’m excited to share a 3 state, 3 symbol Turing Machine that cannot be proven to halt or not (when starting on a blank tape) without solving a Collatz-like problem. Therefore, solving the \(BB(3, 3)\) problem is at least as hard as solving this Collatz-like problem, a class of problem for which Paul Erdős famously said: “Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.”</p>

<p>Last year, in <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/04/03/mother-of-giants.html">Mother of Giants</a>, I described a family of TMs which require efficient simulation or complete solution of a Collatz-like problem in order to prove if they “quasihalt” or not. These were found in the search for <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2021/03/06/beeping-busy-beaver/">“Beeping” Busy Beavers</a>, a variant of the Busy Beavers introduced by Scott Aaronson in his 2020 <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916">Busy Beaver survey article</a>. Since then I have been looking for an example in the normal Busy Beaver game.</p>

<p>There have been many wonderful TMs produced by hand over the years which provide such results for the Busy Beaver game. For example, proving:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(BB(745)\) <a href="https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-undecidability-bb748.pdf">requires</a> proving the consistency of ZFC</li>
  <li>\(BB(27)\) <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6">requires</a> proving the Goldbach Conjecture</li>
  <li>\(BB(15)\) and \(BB(5, 4)\) <a href="https://dna.hamilton.ie/2021-08-10-busy-beaver-15.html">require</a> proving an Erdős conjecture (that for all \(n &gt; 8\), the base 3 representation of \(2^n\) has at least one digit 2).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, none of these Busy Beaver values are really within reach of us mere mortals yet. In the last 60 years, we have only been able to prove values \(BB(2), BB(3), BB(4)\) and \(BB(2, 3)\) and it is known that <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/21/bb-6-2-t15.html">\(BB(6) &gt; 10 \uparrow\uparrow 15\)</a>. Until I analyzed this TM, I thought that we might have a chance to prove \(BB(3, 3)\)!</p>

<h2 id="the-machine">The Machine</h2>

<p>I’ll call this TM “Bigfoot” (I’ll explain the name at the end of the article). It is defined by the transition table:</p>

This specific TM was first <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960643023006490684/1084047886494470185/1163168233445130270">shared and analyzed</a> by @savask on 14 Oct 2023 on that same Discord channel.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Consider the general configuration:</p><p>

\[A(a, b, c) = 0^\infty \; 12^a \; 11^b \; \text{ &lt;A } \; 11^c \; 0^\infty\]

</p><p>We can prove the following rules:</p><p>

\[\begin{array}{l}
  A(a, &amp; 6k,   &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+1, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 3)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+2, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a-1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; a \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+3, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+1, &amp; 5)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+4, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+5, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+5, &amp; 3)   \\
\end{array}\]

\[A(0, 6k+2, c) \to \text{Halt}(16k+2c+7)\]

</p><p>In fact, these rules are exhaustive. Once Bigfoot enters such a \(A(a, b, c)\) config (with \(c \ge 1\)), these rules describe the exact behavior it will follow forever (or until it halts).</p>

<p>Looking at the rules above we can see that they are iterating a Collatz-like function on parameters \(b\) and \(c\) while \(a\) keeps a sort of running total. Every time \(b \equiv 1 \pmod{6}\) or \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is incremented and every time \(b \equiv 2 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is decremented. Bigfoot only ever halts if \(a\) would be decremented below 0.</p>

<h3 id="trajectory-from-blank-tape">Trajectory from Blank Tape</h3>

<p>Starting from a blank tape, Bigfoot reaches config \(A(2, 1, 2)\) at step 69. Simulating this forward, \(a\) appears to grow steadily over time. After 24 million iterations, we have \(a = 3\,999\,888\).</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-random-walk">Pseudo-Random Walk</h3>

<p>Let’s consider the sequence of remainders of \(b\) mod 6. If we imagine that this sequence is uniformly randomly distributed, then this process is simulating a biased random walk on the number line where (for each step) the chance of stepping right is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the chance of stepping left is \(\frac{1}{3}\).</p>

<p>This is a famous problem in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a> and it can be proven that if you are at position \(a = n\), there is a \((\frac{1}{2})^{n+1}\) chance you will ever reach the position \(a = -1\) in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, the sequence of remainders of \(b\) are not random, they are completely deterministic. (In fact, they even follow the consistent pattern of odd, odd, even, even, …) However, on a broad scale they do appear to follow a trajectory roughly like the random Markov chain. We can see that in the trajectory listed above where after 24 million steps, the Markov chain would be expected to move to the right 8 million times and to the left 4 million leading to a value very close to the actual \(a\) around 4 million.</p>

<h3 id="probviously-not-halting">Probviously Not Halting</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the random Markov chain would have about a \((\frac{1}{2})^{4\,000\,000}\) chance of ever reaching \(a = -1\) at this point which is a number so small that any scientist would happily declare this guaranteed to fail. Likewise, this is where I will say that Bigfoot “probviously” never halts (using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.192">words of John Conway</a>). Meaning that if it operates anything close to the Markov Chain it will never halt.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of statement says nothing in a rigorous Mathematical sense. Instead it is sort of an experimental heuristic which I am using to guide my intuition in this case. There is always the chance that after a googolplex iterations Bigfoot will halt. In fact, Conway coined this term to describe the heuristic argument for why the Collatz conjecture should be “probviously” true and yet a proof of Collatz is nowhere in sight.</p>

<h2 id="two-worlds">Two Worlds</h2>

<p>We live in one of two worlds, either Bigfoot halts or it runs forever. If it halts, then that could be proven by accelerating iterations of this Collatz-like function enough that it is tractable to simulate it to completion. If it runs forever, then proving that requires proving that this Collatz-like function will never reach the \(a = 0\) halting transition.</p>

<p>Based on the Markov chain argument above, I believe we are living in this second world and it seems to me that this is the much harder case to prove.</p>

<h2 id="cryptids">Cryptids</h2>

<p>What do we call these sorts of machines? Ones whose behavior has been distilled into a relatively simple Mathematical rule that falls into a class of open Mathematical problems. These machines seem to be a sort of legendary creature, rumors have it that they either halt or do not, but nobody has been able to provide any concrete evidence to support either conclusion. I propose calling them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids">“Cryptids”</a>, drawing parallels to the legendary creatures like the Loch Ness Monster or Chupacabra. And well, since this TM appears to randomly walk about, I thought Bigfoot would be an apt name.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-collatz-like-behavior-really-hard">Is This Collatz-like Behavior Really Hard?</h2>

<p>I imagine that some of you might be wondering: Is the behavior of this specific Collatz-like function really hard to analyze? Am I overselling this behavior simply by it’s association with the famously difficult Collatz problem? I think it is safe to say that nobody aside from me has ever looked at the dynamics of this specific problem. So perhaps with a little bit of number theory and elbow grease, someone will be able to find a clever Mathematical property that applies to this problem (but not to the broader set of Collatz-like problems). This is certainly possible and I am excited to hear if anyone has any ideas as to how to attack this problem. It would be lovely to know that proving \(BB(3, 3)\) remains within reach!</p>

<p>However, in my (limited) experience analyzing and reading about Collatz-like problems there seem to be only two types of questions that one can ask: (1) Ones that are relatively trivial to prove and (2) Ones which no Mathematician knows how to prove. In the first category we have patterns like the fact that \(b\) repeats consistently through the pattern (odd, odd, even, even, …) in Bigfoot’s Collatz iterations or that every time you apply the traditional \(3n+1\) Collatz rule you always end up with an even number which will then be divided by 2 on the next step. Examples of the second category include basically all other questions we might ask about the behavior of these Collatz systems.</p>

With a way to store ideas permanently and externally, they would no longer need to memorise. It is tempting to dismiss him as an old man complaining about change. Socrates did not have a stack of peer-reviewed science to make his case about the usefulness of learning concepts by heart.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Today a different debate is raging about the dangers of another technology—computers—and the typing people do on them. As primary-school pupils and <small>P</small>h<small>D</small> hopefuls return for a new school year in the northern hemisphere, many will do so with a greater-than-ever <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2014/06/07/taking-the-learning-tablets">reliance on computers</a> to take notes and write papers. Some parents of younger students are dismayed that their children are not just encouraged but required to tote laptops to class. University professors complain of rampant distraction in classrooms, with students reading and messaging instead of listening to lectures.</p><p data-component="paragraph">A line of research shows the benefits of an “innovation” that predates computers: <a href="https://www.economist.com/1843/2012/10/08/handwriting-an-elegy">handwriting</a>. Studies have found that writing on paper can improve everything from recalling a random series of words to imparting a better conceptual grasp of complicated ideas.</p><p data-component="paragraph">For learning material by rote, from the shapes of letters to the quirks of English spelling, the benefits of using a pen or pencil lie in how the motor and sensory memory of putting words on paper reinforces that material. The arrangement of squiggles on a page feeds into visual memory: people might remember a word they wrote down in French class as being at the bottom-left on a page, <i>par exemple</i>.</p><p data-component="paragraph">One of the best-demonstrated advantages of writing by hand seems to be in superior<b> </b>note-taking. In a study from 2014 by Pam Mueller and Danny Oppenheimer, students typing wrote down almost twice as many words and more passages verbatim from  lectures, suggesting they were not understanding so much as rapidly copying the material.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Handwriting—which takes longer for nearly all university-level students—forces note-takers to synthesise ideas into their own words. This aids conceptual understanding at the moment of writing. But those taking notes by hand also perform better on tests<i> </i>when students are later able to study from their notes. The effect even persisted when the students who typed were explicitly instructed to rephrase the material in their own words. The instruction was “completely ineffective” at reducing verbatim note-taking, the researchers note: they did not understand the material so much as parrot it.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Many studies have confirmed handwriting’s benefits, and policymakers have taken note.<b> </b>Though America’s “Common Core” curriculum from 2010 does not require handwriting instruction past first grade (roughly age six), about half the states since then have mandated more teaching of it, thanks to campaigning by researchers and handwriting supporters. In Sweden there is a push for more handwriting and printed books and fewer devices. England’s national curriculum already prescribes teaching the rudiments of cursive by age seven.</p><p data-component="paragraph">However, several school systems in America have gone so far as to ban most laptops. This is too extreme. Some students have disabilities that make handwriting especially hard. Nearly all will eventually need typing skills. And typing can improve the quality of writing: being able to get ideas down quickly, before they are forgotten, can obviously be beneficial. So can slowing down the speed of typing, says Dr Oppenheimer.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Virginia Berninger, emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Washington, is a longtime advocate of handwriting. But she is not a purist; she says there are research-tested benefits for “manuscript” print-style writing, <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/09/06/the-comeback-of-cursive">for cursive</a> (which allows greater speed) but also for typing (which is good practice for composing passages). Since students spend more time on devices as they age, she argues for occasional “tuning up” of handwriting in later school years.</p><p data-component="paragraph">And perhaps even into adulthood.

            <p>Computational approaches are emerging as powerful tools for the discovery of antibiotics. A study now uses machine learning to discover abaucin, a potent antibiotic that targets the bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.</p>
            

                
                    
                
            
                
                <p>Traditionally, antibiotics were discovered by the screening of soil microorganisms, seeking secondary metabolites. From these initial molecules, numerous derivatives were synthesized, showing improved bioactivities and greater potential to meet clinical standards. Until recently, discovery efforts relied on the painstaking screening of large compound libraries for antibiotic activity<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Wright, G. D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 34, 694–701 (2017)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01448-6#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d8857608e293">1</a></sup>. Phenotypic screening approaches do not require advanced knowledge of the mechanism of action; however, the extensive and unexplored chemical space in the search for drug-like molecules poses considerable challenges, as the screening of numerous potential combinations (of both compounds and different bacterial strains) is both expensive and time-consuming. Thus, the discovery process of a new antibiotic has consistently depended on chance and serendipity. Recent advances that incorporate cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and other computational approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in accelerating the identification of new drugs with desired properties<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Porto, W.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a reminder: <strong>Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.</strong> Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.</p>
<p>Ruff is used in production by tens of thousands of
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#whos-using-ruff">open source projects</a> and major enterprises.
In the last year, we've been working to expand Ruff's feature set and improve stability for those
that depend on Ruff in their daily workflows.</p>
<p>Today, we're excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff v0.1.0</a> is out! This

<h2><span id="a-growing-feature-set"></span>A growing feature set<!-- --> <a href="#a-growing-feature-set">#</a></h2>
<p>Earlier this year, Charlie looked back on
<a href="https://notes.crmarsh.com/ruff-the-first-200-releases">the first 200 releases of Ruff</a>, at which
point 376 lint rules were supported. <strong>Ruff now supports over 700 rules</strong>, with new rules being
added in every release. In case you missed it, we've released some exciting features this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.285#stabilized-support-for-jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebook support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.292#support-for-pep-701">Python 3.12 f-string syntax support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.283#ruff-supports-pep-695">Python 3.12 type alias and generics syntax support</a></li>

<li>Improvements to the <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/">Ruff playground</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/7310">released an alpha version</a> of our
Black-compatible code formatter. Expect more news on that front soon!</p>
<h2><span id="introducing-preview-mode"></span>Introducing preview mode<!-- --> <a href="#introducing-preview-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.289">v0.0.289</a>, we added a new preview mode
to enable the use of unstable features when running Ruff.</p>
<p>Since new rules often benefit from a trial period, we want to be able to release them in a staged
manner. Previously, we used a "nursery" rule category to do this, a concept taken from Clippy,
Rust's linter.</p>
<p>However, the nursery required opt-in for each rule using their exact code, e.g., if you'd selected
<code>F</code> and we released an unstable rule <code>F999</code>, you'd need to update your selection to <code>[F, F999]</code>.
Requiring opt-in for each rule reduced exposure of new rules and could be tedious for users to
update. Furthermore, as Ruff grows, we want a global concept for use of unstable features — the
nursery concept doesn't scale beyond rule selection.</p>
<p>Preview mode will be used to enable new rules, unstable fixes, and experimental code analysis.
Releasing these features — but gating them to users who opt-in — will allow us to collect community
feedback and gain confidence that changes are a net-benefit.</p>
<p>Preview mode can be enabled per-invocation with the <code>--preview</code> flag or by updating your
configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>preview</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/preview/">docs</a> for preview mode and give it a try!</p>
<h2><span id="respecting-fix-safety"></span>Respecting fix safety<!-- --> <a href="#respecting-fix-safety">#</a></h2>
<p>Ruff's ability to automatically fix violations is one of its most powerful features. However, given
Python's dynamic nature, it's not always possible to guarantee that a fix is "safe". Since May,
we've been labeling a subset of Ruff's fixes as unsafe. When applying safe fixes, the meaning and
intent of your code will be retained; when applying unsafe fixes, the meaning could change.</p>
<p>For example,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element"><code>unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element</code></a>
is a rule which checks for potentially unperformant use of <code>list(...)[0]</code>. The fix replaces this
pattern with <code>next(iter(...))</code> which can result in a drastic speedup:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = list(range(99999999))[0]</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>1 </span><span>loop,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.69</span><span> </span><span>sec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = next(iter(range(99999999)))</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>5000000 </span><span>loops,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>70.8</span><span> </span><span>nsec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, when the collection is empty, this fix changes the raised exception from an <code>IndexError</code> to
<code>StopIteration</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>list(range(0))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>

<span><span>IndexError: </span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>index</span><span> </span><span>out</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>range</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>next(iter(range(0)))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>File </span><span>"</span><span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>modul</span><span>e</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>StopIteration</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since this could break error handling, this fix is categorized as unsafe.</p>
<p>Previously, the safety of a fix was only an internal note, but in v0.1.0, Ruff will only use safe
fixes by default to increase confidence when applying fixes and highlight fixes that need additional
review.</p>
<p>Unsafe fixes can be enabled by passing the <code>--unsafe-fixes</code> flag to <code>ruff check</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span># Show unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Apply unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--fix</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or by setting
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#unsafe-fixes"><code>unsafe-fixes</code></a> in your configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>unsafe-fixes</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When working with Ruff in an IDE (via our LSP), we will no longer apply unsafe fixes with the "Fix
all" action. Instead, unsafe fixes can be applied individually with the "Quick fix" action allowing
review of each fix. If you opt-in to unsafe fixes, they'll be applied during "Fix all". See the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp#fix-safety">LSP docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The safety of fixes can be adjusted per rule using the
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-safe-fixes"><code>extend-safe-fixes</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-unsafe-fixes"><code>extend-unsafe-fixes</code></a> settings, allowing
you to customize safety levels for your use-case.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#fix-safety">docs</a> for more details on fix
safety.</p>
<h2><span id="ruffs-versioning-policy"></span>Ruff's versioning policy<!-- --> <a href="#ruffs-versioning-policy">#</a></h2>
<p>Thus far, Ruff releases have only involved incrementing the patch version number. This versioning
scheme suffers from a few core problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no documented policy and little room for a meaningful policy</li>
<li>Rules are added in most releases, resulting in significant new violations for users on upgrade</li>
<li>Users cannot get bug fix upgrades with confidence that they will not need to do other work</li>
<li>Ruff is not perceived as stable</li>
</ul>
<p>With the promotion to v0.1.0, Ruff can adopt a meaningful rules around versioning to ensure that
users know what to expect from each release. With the addition of a minor version number, we hope
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the frequency of large changes</li>
<li>Give rules a period for stabilization before enabling</li>
<li>Differentiate between breaking and non-breaking releases</li>
<li>Move towards stronger stability guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of 0.1.0, Ruff includes a full versioning policy. Briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>minor</strong> version will be used for stabilization of <strong>preview</strong> features, changes to
<strong>stable</strong> behavior, and breaking changes.</li>
<li>The <strong>patch</strong> version will be used for bug fixes and <em>any</em> changes to rules or fixes in
<strong>preview.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/">docs</a> for a full description of the policy.</p>

Look south-east, towards Canada, and you see a skyline thick with cranes. New towers are shooting up, old ones being rebuilt, and the pavements below are thick with pedestrians. Cross to the other bedroom, however, and you get quite a different view. Right up to the edge of a highway entire city blocks are occupied by nothing but tarmac. At 11am an ocean of surface parking is uninterrupted by even a single car.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Just over a decade ago Detroit became the biggest American city to go bankrupt. Since then its city centre has made a remarkable recovery. The Book Tower, which was completely derelict in 2009, has been rebuilt at a cost of over $300m by Bedrock, a property firm owned by Dan Gilbert, Michigan’s richest man. Yet though downtown is humming, huge parts of the city remain blighted.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The city now has a more ambitious plan to reduce the amount of vacant land. It intends to tax it. A lot. Will it work?</p><p data-component="paragraph">The idea, proposed by Mike Duggan, the city’s pugnacious mayor, is to replace Detroit’s current property tax with a split tax. In essence, assessors will distinguish between the value of its land and of the buildings on it. This done, the city’s property tax will be reduced from 2% for every $1 of assessed value (which is less than market value) to 0.6%. To make up for the revenues lost, land will be taxed at a new rate of 11.8%, whether or not it has anything built on it. In Michigan changes to property-tax rates have to be approved by voters. A law to allow that cleared its first hurdle in the state House in late September. A referendum could happen in February.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The principle of taxing land instead of buildings has a long history. Over a century ago Henry George, a liberal economist, argued that the rich used land ownership to hoard the wealth being created by progress. His most dedicated fans adopted the slogan “Do you see the cat?” (based on a convoluted metaphor), to refer to his ideas that land ownership underpinned high inequality. Yet George’s proposal—a single tax on land value—has barely been tried. If Mr Duggan’s scheme becomes law, Detroit will be one of the first big cities anywhere in the world to implement one.</p><p data-component="paragraph">How come Detroit is able to try something so radical? One advantage, says Jay Rising, the city’s chief financial officer, is that the city now raises very little from its current system. In 1959, according to a study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think-tank in Massachusetts, the city’s property tax raised over $1bn, adjusted for inflation. By 2019, after decades of economic decline, the figure had fallen to just $119m. “If this was 80% of our revenues, we’d be a lot more nervous,” says Mr Rising. In fact it is just 16%. Moreover, the value of residential land is very low, which makes it an easier sell to voters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The hope is that taxing land more will in fact spur development. Right now, says Alex Alsup of Regrid, a data firm, Detroit has “a very pure version of speculation”. As downtown booms, people who bought land nearby years ago—such as the owners of the car parks—merely have to wait for investment nearby to raise the value of their own land. Higher taxes might force them to sell up to people who will build on it. “It is entirely possible that this land tax has the ability to free up properties,” says Kofi Bonner, the <small>ceo</small> of Bedrock.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The bigger immediate benefit, though, comes from reducing taxes on most residents. The city argues that 97% of homeowners will get a tax cut. Lower tax rates on improvements ought to encourage people to invest in properties—and help some avoid falling behind on their taxes. Though they raise little, Detroit’s property taxes are punishing to poor homeowners. Between 2011 and 2015, according to a study published in 2019, one in four city properties went into tax foreclosure, their owners having fallen behind on payments.</p><p data-component="paragraph">But Bernadette Atuahene, one of the authors of that study, suggests that high rates were not the only problem. What mattered more was that after the great financial crisis, Detroit’s assessor systematically overvalued the homes of the poorest residents. When people could not pay, Wayne County, which includes the city, added interest at 18%. Homes ended up auctioned, with any excess over the tax owed banked by the county. Ms Atuahene worries that the proposed new tax does nothing to fix this problem—and if residential land ends up overvalued, may exacerbate it. “We currently have an assessment division that’s not doing its job,” she says.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Getting assessments right is one of the long-standing challenges of land-value taxes, and explains why they are so rare. Still, if the city can do that well, there will be real gains. Gabriel McNeil, a 61-year-old former chef who now lives on disability benefits, says that even a small tax cut would help him a lot. Having bought his home for just $8,000 in 2013, he struggles with tax payments of thousands of dollars each year. “The property tax is not designed for lower-income people at all,” he says. “It’s not easy to keep up.” For some, any cut is better than nothing. <span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Stay on top of American politics with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance" target="_blank">Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which&nbsp;examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "By George!"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/">United States</a> <span>October 7th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/the-sacking-of-kevin-mccarthy-will-make-supporting-ukraine-harder"><span>Kevin McCarthy’s sacking deepens the chaos in American government</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/travelling-to-and-from-america-has-become-a-waiting-game"><span>Travelling to and from America has become a waiting game</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/republican-parties-in-important-swing-states-are-falling-behind"><span>Republican parties in important swing states are falling behind</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/the-post-title-42-lull-in-border-crossings-is-over"><span>The post-Title-42 lull in border crossings is over</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/detroit-wants-to-be-the-first-big-american-city-to-tax-land-value"><span>Detroit wants to be the first big American city to tax land value</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/what-america-should-really-learn-from-dianne-feinstein"><span>What America should really learn from Dianne Feinstein</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Are free markets history?

</figure> <p>John says he pressed representatives of Tesla on whether he or Rob were at fault for the damage, to which he claims he was told that it was a weather issue.</p> <p>He continued: “They said that the battery is effectively submerged in water. How can that be our fault?</p> <p>“After finally getting to speak to a manager, he told me it had water in it due to the fact the weather in Scotland has been so bad. That was the issue. They said it’s not necessarily my fault but it’s not Tesla’s to pay under warranty. He reminded me there was a yellow weather warning in some parts of Scotland.</p> <p>“I pushed him on this and said I’ve never heard or something like this happening. He said it can happen with Range Rovers and Mercs but I’m just not buying it.</p> <p>“To date, it’s been a disaster of a service and the stress and worry of this is excruciating. I said to the manager, ‘so, my understanding is, Teslas are unfit for purpose in Scotland?.”</p> <p>I’ve been driving for 30 years and this is my most premium car to date and this is what it does when Edinburgh’s roads get puddles or a little wet!”</p> <p><i>Edinburgh Live</i> has seen correspondence between the couple and Tesla which confirms the £17,374 bill. </p> <p>Furthermore, an email from Tesla customer relations also commits to an investigation into the complaint and a response on behalf of the business.</p> <p>John added: “If I had known the customer service would be so bad I’m not sure I would have bothered buying the car. Do they know that we’re in Scotland? That weather was not abnormal for living here.</p> <p>"I can only see the number of claims on problems like this going up.

If 1-on-1s were your fulltime job you could at most do 80 per week (2 per hour x 40 hrs). Thats just rotating through 1x1s. That's not doing anything else.</p><p>He claimed "team leads" did 1x1s, which is fine, but its hard to call them a direct report if you're not even aware of their daily work. Theres just no way you can adequately manage 200 people. As mentioned above, you are just a glorified HR person, you're no longer in engineering.</p><p>I would never hire a manager below Director level that isn't themselves an individual contributor. I know its possible to have that but I wouldnt hire it, because we expect IC on our teams.

Your friend is a big old racist”.</p><p>Moving on from that reflexive thought, I'll attempt to answer your question of:</p><p>&gt; I’m asking is there a perceptual issue due to some factor that’s obvious to the typical Nth-generation American?</p><p>Well, perhaps. There are a bunch of factors:</p><p>- The H1B program is terrible in that it ties your immigration status to your current employer. Couple this with the “you can be legally fired because your boss doesn't like the color of your shoes” climate in the US and you have a pretty stressed-out bunch of people.
- A lot of consulting companies seem to pay just enough wages that attract Indian H1B employees of a average to low caliber of talent, and hire them out for random software projects. The Americans on the other side of those contractors get mad at the contractors, who happen to be all Indian.
- There is a genuine cultural gap where Indians are more deferential to someone they perceive as having higher authority. It is sometimes possible that a young Indian employee might call you “Sir”, because that was how they addressed superiors.</p><p>So...all these are perceptual issues of the sort you are looking at. But honestly, these sorts of cultural misunderstandings are not exactly uncommon among Europeans and Americans as well. Big Tech tends to have far fewer of the issues above. Salaries are high (I don't even work in Big Tech and my salary as an H1B was verifiably higher than some of my American coworkers), and IMO there isn't a huge difference between Indians and the N other cultures that make up the boiling pot of tech.</p><p>But then that brings me to the part about “friend who works big tech and he has no chill for <i>Indians</i>”. Like, Indians period? What does he think about Sanjay Ghemawat? What about Vinod Khosla? How about Amit Patel, who came up with Google's “Don't Be Evil”? What about the engineers/PMs/etc. in big tech to whom those issues don't apply?</p><p>All of this leads me to conclude (this time after some reflection) that your friend is actually just a...big old racist if he has a problem with <i>all</i> Indians in general, especially those working in Big Tech.</p><p>Take from that what you will. Hope you find better friends :)

Firstly you now have a bunch of highly paid technical employees completely removed from how things actually work. But what’s worse is you created a culture where you’re incentived to follow - a senior engineer who wants to get promoted should write less code because coding is associated with being a low level employee.</p><p>The fundamental root cause is a misunderstanding of code as low level factory work and not intrinsically tied to the design and architecture. But it’s one of many ways in which traditional business structures and software engineering do not mesh and you need an extremely strong engineering leader to keep software culture on track, which very few organizations have.

We didn't have much meetings, rather lots of one-on-ones or 3-4 people discussing. Most of us were just out of college. So, when we had strong opinions on the product features, they not only heard us, but helped formulate a proper argument that we could present. He was  also a good mentor, helping me reframe my viewpoint, when I didn't agree with one of my very senior colleagues (Later turned out the senior colleague was right. In retrospect, I really pity that colleague for he had to work with a big bunch of naive college graduates with no coding discipline :) )</p><p>It helps that the whole environment in the company was one of openness, camaraderie and a real desire to make a difference.

<p>Cisco is urging customers to protect their devices following the discovery of a critical, actively exploited zero-day vulnerability that’s giving threat actors full administrative control of networks.</p>
<p>“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to create an account on the affected device with privilege level 15 access, effectively granting them full control of the compromised device and allowing possible subsequent unauthorized activity,” members of Cisco’s Talos security team <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-exploitation-of-cisco-ios-xe-software/">wrote Monday</a>. “This is a critical vulnerability, and we strongly recommend affected entities immediately implement the steps outlined in Cisco’s PSIRT advisory.”</p>
<h2>Under exploitation for 4 weeks</h2>
<p>The previously unknown vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2023-20198, carries the maximum severity rating of 10. It resides in the Web User Interface of Cisco IOS XE software when exposed to the Internet or untrusted networks. Any switch, router, or wireless LAN controller running IOS XE that has the HTTP or HTTPS Server feature enabled and exposed to the Internet is vulnerable. At the time this post went live, the Shodan search engine showed that as many as 80,000 Internet-connected devices could be affected.</p>
<p>Cisco said that an unknown threat actor has been exploiting the zero-day since at least September 18. After using the vulnerability to become an authorized user, the attacker creates a local user account. In most cases, the threat actor has gone on to deploy an implant that allows it to execute malicious commands at the system or iOS level, once the web server is restarted. The implant is unable to survive a reboot, but the local user accounts will remain active.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Monday’s advisory went on to say that after gaining access to a vulnerable device, the threat actor exploits a medium vulnerability, CVE-2021-1435, which Cisco patched two years ago. The Talos team members said that they have seen devices fully patched against the earlier vulnerability getting the implant installed “through an as of yet undetermined mechanism.”</p>
<p>The implant is saved in the file path “/usr/binos/conf/nginx-conf/cisco_service.conf.” It contains two variable strings composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal characters</a>. The advisory continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The implant is based on the Lua programming language and consists of 29 lines of code that facilitates the arbitrary command execution. The attacker must create an HTTP POST request to the device, which delivers the following three functions (Figure 1):</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">The first function is dictated by the “menu” parameter, which must exist and must be non-empty. This returns a string of numbers surrounded by forward-slashes, which we suspect might represent the implant’s version or installation date.</li>
<li>The second function is dictated by the “logon_hash” parameter, which must be set to “1”. This returns an 18-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant.</li>
<li>The third function is also dictated by the “logon_hash” parameter, which checks to see if the parameter matches a 40-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant. A second parameter used here is “common_type”, which must be non-empty, and whose value determines whether the code is executed at the system level or IOS level. If the code is executed at the system level, this parameter must be set to “subsystem”, and if it is executed at the IOS level, the parameter must be “iox”. The IOX commands are executed at privilege level 15.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png" data-height="638" data-width="984" alt="Implant code"><img alt="Implant code" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code-640x415.png" width="640" height="415" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png 2x"></a><figcaption><div><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png" data-height="638" data-width="984">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Implant code</p></div><p>Cisco</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In most instances we have observed of this implant being installed, both the 18-character hexadecimal string in the second function and the 40-character hexadecimal string in the third function are unique, although in some cases, these strings were the same across different devices. This suggests there is a way for the actor to compute the value used in the third function from the value returned by the second function, acting as a form of authentication required for the arbitrary command execution provided in the third function.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Talos team members strongly urge administrators of any affected gear to immediately search their networks for signs of compromise. The most effective means is by searching for unexplained or newly created users on devices. One means of identifying if an implant has been installed is by running the following command against the device, where the "DEVICEIP” portion is a placeholder for the IP address of the device to check:</p>                                            
                                                        
<pre>curl -k -X POST "https[:]//DEVICEIP/webui/logoutconfirm.html?logon_hash=1"</pre>
<p>Admin accounts may have the names cisco_tac_admin or cisco_support. IP addresses Cisco has seen so far exploiting the zero-day are 5.149.249[.]74 and 154.53.56[.]231.<br>
Additional guidance from Cisco:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Check the system logs for the presence of any of the following log messages where “user” could be “cisco_tac_admin”, “cisco_support” or any configured, local user that is unknown to the network administrator:</li>
</ol>
<pre>%SYS-5-CONFIG_P: Configured programmatically by process&nbsp;SEP_webui_wsma_http from console as user on line</pre>
<pre>%SEC_LOGIN-5-WEBLOGIN_SUCCESS: Login Success [user:&nbsp;user] [Source: source_IP_address] at 03:42:13 UTC Wed Oct 11 2023</pre>
<p>Note: The %SYS-5-CONFIG_P message will be present for each instance that a user has accessed the web UI. The indicator to look for is new or unknown usernames present in the message.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the system logs for the following message where <strong>filename </strong>is an unknown filename that does not correlate with an expected file installation action:</li>
</ol>
<pre>%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename It should go without saying but the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on internet-facing systems as is consistent with long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the guidance in Monday’s advisory.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It should go without saying, but the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on Internet-facing systems as is consistent with long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the guidance in Monday’s advisory.</p>
<p>This vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit and gives hackers the ability to take all kinds of malicious actions against infected networks. Anyone administering Cisco gear should carefully read the advisory and the above-mentioned <a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-iosxe-webui-privesc-j22SaA4z">PSIRT advisory</a> and follow all recommendations as soon as possible.</p>

    </div>
<p>For the past couple of decades, tens of thousands of people living in rural Sri Lanka have been devastated by kidney failure due to unclear causes, also known as CKDu. Similar incidences of mysterious kidney diseases have emerged in tropical farming communities around the world.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>A massive field study of the wells supplying drinking water to the Sri Lankan communities, conducted by researchers at Duke University, has identified a possible culprit—glyphosate, the active compound in Roundup, the most widely used herbicide in the world.
</p><p>The results of the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00504">study</a> were published in <i>Environmental Science and Technology Letters</i> on September 13, 2023.
</p><p>Roundup is a glyphosate-based herbicide used to control weeds and other pests. Because it is supposed to break down in the environment within a few days to weeks, its use is relatively under-regulated by most public health agencies. But when glyphosate encounters certain trace metal ions that make water hard—like magnesium and calcium—glyphosate-metal ion complexes can form. Those complexes can persist up to seven years in water and 22 years in soil.
</p><p>"It was always thought that this chemical would break down very quickly in the environment, but it seems to stick around a lot longer than we expected when it complexes in hard water," said Nishad Jayasundara, the Juli Plant Grainger Assistant Professor of Global Environmental Health at Duke. "We have to consider how glyphosate is interacting with these other elements, and what happens to glyphosate when you take that into your body as a complex."
</p><p>In certain agricultural areas of Sri Lanka, the high, dry climate combined with its geological formations creates the perfect conditions for hard water. It is also in these regions that CKDu has reached <a href="https://phys.org/tags/epidemic+levels/" rel="tag">epidemic levels</a>, with as many as 10% of children aged 5–11 years exhibiting signs of early onset kidney damage.
</p><p>Jayasundara, who is from Sri Lanka himself, believed that glyphosate may play a role in CKDu incidence because of the region's hard water, even though Sri Lanka has banned use of the herbicide. To test his hypothesis, Jayasundara teamed up with environmental chemist Lee Ferguson, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Duke and his Ph.D. student Jake Ulrich. In collaboration with Mangala De Silva, a professor at the University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka, the Duke team sampled more than 200 wells across four regions in Sri Lanka.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>Ferguson's lab at Duke employs high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry to identify contaminants—even the barest trace of them—by their molecular weights. It's a highly sensitive method of identification and quantitation that allows a broad view into the pollutants present in a water system.
</p><p>Through this technique, the researchers found significantly higher levels of the herbicide in 44% of wells within the affected areas versus just 8% of those outside it.
</p><p>"We really focused on drinking water here, but it's possible there are other important routes of exposure—direct contact from <a href="https://phys.org/tags/agricultural+workers/" rel="tag">agricultural workers</a> spraying the pesticide, or perhaps food or dust," said Ferguson. "I'd like to see increased study with more emphasis looking at the links among these exposure routes. It still seems like there might be things we're missing."
</p><p>To this point, Ulrich also found elevated levels of fluoride and vanadium—both of which are linked to kidney damage—in the drinking water of most all of the communities with high incidence of CKDu. The researchers agree that more attention must be paid to the potential contributions each of these contaminants is playing, either individually or in concert with others. But given the reasoning for their glyphosate-based hypothesis going into the study and the herbicide's high levels of use worldwide, they also believe these results should serve as a serious warning when considering risk of exposure to glyphosate.
</p><p>Part of Ferguson's concern, he said, is that glyphosate's fate profile resembles a contaminant that he's studied closer to home—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are also called "forever chemicals" because of their persistence in the environment.
</p><p>"We think of PFAS as being a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/drinking+water/" rel="tag">drinking water</a> contaminant because it's mobile and persistent. Now we're realizing that glyphosate may also be quite persistent in hard water areas," said Ferguson. "This gives me concerns about exposures here in the United States."

<p><strong>Airplanes Africa Limited (AAL), an aircraft manufacturer based in Morogoro, has unveiled Tanzania’s first locally-assembled aircraft, the Skyleader 600.</strong></p>
<p>This unveiling took place at the Tanzania International Manufacturers Expo 2023 (TIMEXPO) in the nation’s capital at the Diamond Jubilee Hall in Dar es Salaam.</p>


<p>Skyleader 600 is designed to accommodate two passengers, including the pilot, and is very ideal for business travelers on longer journeys.</p>

<p>David Grolic, the AAL director disclosed that his organization decided to take advantage of Tanzania’s favorable business climate, and willingness to adopt new technologies, by setting up the aircraft assembling outfit in the country.</p>
<p>“We conducted thorough research to understand the requirements of business travelers who frequently undertake long-distance trips. In response to the research, we decided to present an aircraft that would enable business people to travel more conveniently and attend various meetings outside of the region before returning to the city for other activities.” He said.</p>
<p>AAL stands as the only company of its kind in the East African country. It boasts the only aircraft manufactured with commercial intent.</p>


<p><strong>What’s Next For AAL?</strong></p>
<p>According to the company, they are already working on a new aircraft called Skyleader 500, which will be a follow-up to Skyleader 600. Skyleader 500 according to the company is set to be completed by next year, 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike the Skyleader 600 which is meant for business purposes, the impending Skyleader 500 is intended for argricultural use as well as other rural commersial activities</p>
<p>According to the AAL director, a team of Tanzanian and Czech workers are working with the AAL to manufacture the Skyleader 500. It goes without saying that this business venture has provided employment opportunities for locals in the country.</p>


<p>David Grolic also noted that these aircraft are affordable and paying for one is comparable to paying for a car. They also have low operational costs, consume little energy, and are easily maintainable.</p>
<p>The director noted that the initial plan revolves around domestic sales before eventually pivoting to selling to the international market.</p>
