<p>U.S. prosecutors are recommending to senior Justice Department officials that criminal charges be brought against Boeing after finding the planemaker violated a settlement related to two fatal crashes, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Justice Department (DOJ) must decide by July 7 whether to prosecute Boeing. The recommendation of prosecutors handling the case has not been previously reported.</p>
<p>In May, officials determined the company breached a 2021 agreement that had shielded Boeing from a criminal charge of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019 involving the 737 MAX jet.</p>
<p>Under the 2021 deal, the Justice Department agreed not to prosecute Boeing over allegations it defrauded the Federal Aviation Administration so long as the company overhauled its compliance practices and submitted regular reports. Boeing also agreed to pay $2.5 billion to settle the investigation.</p>
<p>Boeing declined to comment. It has previously said it has "honored the terms" of the 2021 settlement, which had a three-year term and is known as a deferred prosecution agreement. Boeing has told the Justice Department it disagrees with its determination that the company violated the settlement, Reuters reported this month.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment.</p>
<p>The two sides are in discussions over a potential resolution to the Justice Department's investigation and there is no guarantee officials will move forward with charges, the two sources said. The internal Justice Department deliberations remain ongoing, and no final decisions have been reached, they added.</p>
<p>Criminal charges would deepen an unfolding crisis at Boeing, which has faced intense scrutiny from U.S. prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers after a panel blew off one of its jets operated by Alaska Airlines mid-flight Jan. 5, just two days before the 2021 settlement expired.</p>
<p>The sources did not specify what criminal charges Justice Department officials are considering, but one of the people said they could extend beyond the original 2021 fraud conspiracy charge.</p>
<p>Alternatively, instead of prosecuting Boeing, the DOJ could extend the 2021 settlement by a year or propose new, stricter terms, the sources said.</p>
<p>In addition to financial penalties, the strictest settlements typically involve installing a third party to monitor a company's compliance. The DOJ can also require the company to admit its wrongdoing by pleading guilty.</p>
<p>Boeing may be willing to pay a penalty and agree to a monitor, but believes a guilty plea, which typically incurs additional business restrictions, could be too damaging, said one of the sources. Boeing derives significant revenue from contracts with the U.S. government, including the Defense Department, which could be jeopardized by a felony conviction, one of the sources said.</p>
<p>Relatives of the victims of the two fatal 737 MAX crashes have long criticized the 2021 agreement, arguing that Justice Department officials should have prosecuted the company and its executives.</p>
<p>At a Senate hearing in June, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun acknowledged the company's shortcomings on safety and apologized to the families who lost loved ones.</p>
<p>Last week, the families pressed prosecutors to seek a fine against the planemaker of nearly $25 billion and move forward with a criminal prosecution.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In early 2015, Apple started stealth semiconductor fabrication activities in a facility located at 3250 Scott Boulevard in Santa Clara, California.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> &nbsp;Like some sort of Skunkworks, Apple codenamed the facility “ARIA” and even tried to use the codename on regulatory paperwork.</p><p>The ARIA semiconductor fabrication facility operated less than three hundred feet from thousands of homes where Gjovik lived in 2020. Also within 300 from the building were two public parks (Creekside Park and Meadow Park), picnic tables, outdoor fitness stations, and a children’s playground. Within 1,000 feet of ARIA there was also a church, a school, an elder care facility,&nbsp; and the San Tomas Aquino Creek and public trail. (San Tomas Aquino Creek flows to the Bay and then into the Pacific Ocean).</p><p>Apple intentionally vented its fabrication exhaust – unabated – and consisting of toxic solvent vapors, gases, and fumes – into the ambient outdoor air. The factory was one story, while the apartments were four stories tall, creating a high likelihood that Apple’s factory exhaust entered the interior air of the apartments through open windows and the 'fresh air intake' vents.</p><p>Apple was fully aware of this facility and its operations, including the vast amount of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, as every year, Apple submitted a financial assurance document to the Santa Clara Fire Department and HazMat agency, which detailed hazardous waste treatment and disposal operations, and is personally signed by Apple’s Chief Financial Officer, Luca Maestri – including affixing a company seal. Each financial assurance filing also attached a detailed confirmation letter from Apple’s third-party auditor, E&amp;Y, on behalf of Apple. Maestri was also on the email distribution list for notification of hazardous waste violations at the facility.</p><p>Upon initiating operations at ARIA, Apple was quickly cited for building, environmental, health, safety, and fire code violations in at least 2015 (stop work order due to construction without permits), 2016 (spill of cooling water into storm drains, fire code and CalASPA violations, health and safety code violations, failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge), 2019 (wastewater testing violations), 2020 (fire code violations, using two EPA identification numbers, inaccurate hazmat inventory data, no spill plans or training, no business permit, no signature from supervisor on records, and failure to properly monitor wastewater discharge again).</p><p>In February 2020, Gjovik moved into a large, new apartment complex at 3255 Scott Blvd (adjacent to ARIA) and quickly became severely ill. Gjovik suffered severe fainting spells, dizziness, chest pain, palpitations, stomach aches, exhaustion, fatigue, and strange sensations in her muscles and skin. Gjovik also suffered bradycardia (slow heart rate), volatile blood pressure with both hypertension and hypotension and a high frequency of premature ventricular contractions (an arrhythmia). From February 2020 through September 2020, Gjovik was screened for multiple severe and fatal diseases and disorders, including Multiple Sclerosis, brain tumors, deadly arrhythmias, and Neuromyelitis Optica – instead, all of Gjovik’s symptoms were consistent with chemical exposure. Due to the solvent exposure, Gjovik also suffered skin rashes, burns, and hives, and her hair fell out and she had a shaved head for nearly a year as the bald patches slowly grew back.</p><p>Due to the sudden illness, Gjovik visited the Emergency Room on February 13 2020, and Urgent Care (at AC Wellness, Apple’s for-profit in-house clinic) on February 20 2020. Gjovik subsequently consulted with dozens of doctors, who screened her for all sorts of diseases, subjecting Gjovik to extensive blood draws, urine samples, injections, and scans – including potentially dangerous procedures like MRI and CT scans with contrast, of which Gjovik had multiple. Gjovik was too sick to work and went on disability.</p><p>Gjovik transitioned her medical care to a different clinic and provider after her Apple primary care provider at AC Wellness refused to help her triage her 2020 medical issues (due to exposure to Apple’s factory exhaust). Instead she suggested Gjovik could be suffering from anxiety, and enrolled Gjovik in an Apple internal user study related to blood pressure, requiring Gjovik share her iPhone medical and fitness data with Apple, and participate in weekly life coaching sessions (while being exposed to Apple’s solvent vapor and gas exhaust).</p><p>While sick in 2020, Gjovik would wake up occasionally at 3 AM feeling like she was dying and with symptoms of heart failure and asphyxia. Heart monitoring showed arrhythmias, bradycardia, and low blood pressure. On September 2 2020, Gjovik discovered elevated levels of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) in her indoor air. What immediately captured Gjovik’s attention was the arge spike in VOCs had occurred the night prior, around 3 AM, while she had been suffering from one of these “dying” spells.</p><p>Gjovik sought out multiple occupational and environmental exposure doctors, who told Gjovik that all of her symptoms were consistent with solvent and other chemical exposures. After Gjovik discovered her medical issues at the apartment were due to a chemical emergency, Gjovik quickly filed complaints with Santa Clara City HazMat/Fire Department, California EPA DTSC and Air Resources Board, and US EPA. She also called Poison Control, who said what she described also sounded like Benzene exposure. (Apple reported it was exhausting Benzene into the air).</p><p>City Fire Department records for ARIA contain at least sixteen chemical spill/leak incident reports at ARIA within only three years. These incident reports included eight confirmed leaks/spills: leaks of phosphine and silane on June 1 2019 at 9:17 AM; a phosphine leak on October 21 2019 at 11:06 PM; a 17.5 PPM Tetraethyl Orthosilicate (“TEOS”) leak on July 17 2020 at 8:58 AM; a major phosphine leak on April 30 2021 at 8:29 AM (peaking at 32 PPB and 0.0001145 pounds of the gas vented into the exterior ambient air); a 5% fluorine gas leak on April 18 2022 at 10:42 AM, a Hexafluorobutadiene leak on May 29 2022 at 2:19 PM, and leaks of two unnamed toxic gases on September 20 2022 at 7:44 AM and December 21 2022 at 1:40 AM.</p><p>Notably, almost all of the reported toxic gas leaks during the time frames Gjovik had complained n 2020 that her symptoms seemed to always be the worst around 8-9 AM, 10-11 PM, and sometimes around 2-3 AM. One of the chemical spills that did not occur during those times of concern was root caused to an Apple engineer “accidently” turning on lethal fluorine gas. Similarly, another incident, the TEOS leak, was root caused to an Apple engineer accidently installing the gas for a tool “backwards.” Further, less than two weeks following the April 30 2021 phosphine leak, Apple’s manifests included sixty pounds of “v<em>acuum filters contaminated with glass dust</em>,” implying there may have also been a phosphine explosion.</p><p>Further, later in 2021-2022, Apple reported to the government. that in the year 2020, Apple released at least 7.8 tons (15,608 pounds) of VOCs and 260 pounds of the combustible solvent N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) into the exterior air around ARIA. Per a review of Apple’s manifests, Apple did not replace the carbon/charcoal in its exhaust system for over five years, with the first replacement occurring December 14, 2020 – only after Gjovik had notified Apple EH&amp;S and environmental legal about what occurred to her near ARIA.</p><p>In 2022, the US EPA severely restricted the legal use of NMP as <em>“it presents an unreasonable risk of injury to human health</em>” under TSCA. Apple also reported that in at least 2019-2021, that ARIA exhausted reportable amounts of mercury, arsenic, carbon monoxide, and formaldehyde into the ambient air around the factory. &nbsp;Further, Apple reported to the Bay Area Air Quality Management Board that ARIA exhausted an average of 16 pounds a day of isopropyl alcohol vapors.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik hired an industrial hygienist to test the indoor air at her apartment. She purchased an inspection, soil testing, and a two-hour sorbent tube-based TO-17 air panel. Only half the total contaminants were accounted for in the test and the California EPA informed her that testing with Summa canisters for 24 hours is superior and would have yielded better results. Still, Gjovik’s limited testing returned results showing a number of the chemicals in use by Apple at ARIA including Acetone, Acetonitrile, Acetaldehyde, Benzene, 1,2-Dichloroethane, Ethanol, Ethylbenzene, Hexane, Isopropanol, Isopropyl toluene, Methylene Chloride, Toluene, and Xylene.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik set up additional air monitors to observe the levels of VOCs in her apartment next to the ARIA factory (though she was not aware of the factory exhaust at that time). The results of the data validated what Gjovik had noticed with her symptoms and ad hoc testing – that the VOCs mostly spiked early in the morning and late at night as if they were being exhausted from an automated mechanical system (which it was). Gjovik notified several Apple executives of her findings and activities, including her managers Powers.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik’s blood and urine medical tests returned results with industrial chemicals, including arsenic, mercury, Toluene (Hippuric Acid), and Xylenes (2-3-4 Methyl hippuric Acid. Also noteworthy are the symptoms of Gjovik’s 3 AM attacks, (including both subjective reporting and physical real-time heart monitoring) match Phosphine and Arsine gas exposure. Both Phosphine and Arsine are very dangerous, exposure can be fatal, and there are no antidotes. Apple has a significant quantity of Arsine gas on site, and Gjovik’s medical tests from September 2020, on the morning after one of the 3 AM attacks, revealed significant arsenic in her blood with no other explanation than Arsine gas exposure within the prior eight hours.</p><p>Apple’s leaks, spills, and releases were not limited to the air. Apple’s wastewater discharge monitoring repeatedly showed the presence of heavy metals and organic solvents. In 2017, the government mandated testing revealed the presence of 29 μg/L of 1,1-Dichloropropane, 24 μg/L of &nbsp;Trichloroethylene (“TCE”), and 6.7 μg/L of Ethyl tertiary-butyl ether (ETBE). Among other issues, it’s unclear why Apple had TCE on site but not in any of its chemical inventories, and then, in addition, why exactly Apple was pouring that TCE down the drain.</p><p>&nbsp;ARIA reported an average daily water usage of around 44,000 gallons per day and the sewer pipes carrying ARIA’s discharges flowed downhill and directly around the apartment where Gjovik lived in 2020. In 2020, the government had already started investigating the plumbing at her apartment as a possible vector for some unknown solvent vapor pollution.</p><p>In September 2020, Gjovik noticed an Apple facility at 3250 Scott Boulevard across the street, which was also on the Superfund groundwater plume. Gjovik mentioned the facility to Apple on at least September 8, 9, 10, and 13, 2020 – inquiring if anyone was familiar with the area because Apple had an office there. Apple EH&amp;S and Gjovik had at least two phone calls. The woman who responded who was also actually in charge of Real Estate/EH&amp;S teams involved in Gjovik’s Superfund office at 825 Stewart Drive (“Stewart 1”) and the activities at ARIA.<br>​<br>In September 2021, the Apple EH&amp;S manager, Elizabeth, suggested that Gjovik use a special paid leave to move out of the apartment called ‘<em>extreme condition leave’</em> designated for disasters. Later, in September 2021, Apple Employee Relations conferred with Elizabeth about Gjovik’s environmental concerns only hours before Gjovik was abruptly terminated.</p></div><div><p>On February 21 2023, Gjovik discovered the semiconductor fabrication activities at ARIA. Gjovik posted on Twitter in real-time as she learned about it, expressing severe distress.[1] Until that day, Gjovik did not know it was Apple who was responsible for making her so ill in 2020. Further, until that day, Gjovik did not know the chemicals she was exposed to in 2020 were potentially lethal to human life.</p><p>Gjovik began researching the site and Apple's activities, with the findings making Gjovik feel compelled to file a formal complaint about Apple’s illegal conduct at ARIA. On June 23 2023, Gjovik filed complaints about ARIA to the US EPA, CalEPA, the city of Santa Clara, and Santa Clara County. Gjovik drafted a 28-page memo with dozens of exhibits. Gjovik also posted on Twitter that she did so and provided a public link.</p><p>The US EPA responded and took the lead on an investigation. Gjovik met with the US EPA’s RCRA Enforcement &amp; Compliance team several times before they then inspected Apple’s factory in August 2023 and January 2024. The August 17, 2023 inspection was coded as an RCRA “<em>Compliance Evaluation Inspection,</em>” defined as “<em>primarily an on-site evaluation of the compliance status of the site about all applicable RCRA Regulations and Permits</em>.”[2] The January 16, 2024 inspection was coded as a “<em>Focused Compliance Inspection</em>.”[3]&nbsp; Gjovik is still awaiting a report on the results. The US EPA notified her they finalized the report but are currently unable to share it with her as Apple apparently declared the report of their (assumed) numerous environmental violations is <em>Apple Confidential. </em>Gjovik has a pending FOIA request as well.</p></div><div><p><strong>Creation &amp; Maintenance of a Private Nuisance at 3250 Scott Blvd</strong></p><p>Apple created and maintained a condition in violation of Cal.Civ.C. § 3479. This nuisance was demonstrably injurious to health, which was indecent and offensive to the senses and obstructed the free use of property. By acting and failing to act, Apple created a condition or permitted a condition to exist that was harmful to health, offensive to the senses, an obstruction to the free use of property, and a fire, explosion, and poisoning hazard. Apple’s conduct in acting or failing to act was intentional, unreasonable, negligent, and reckless.</p><p>Apple is continuously casting pollution upon the property of the owner and tenants of adjacent properties, as it knew it would do when it constructed its exhaust and HVAC systems and hazardous waste handling systems. It knew then, as it knows now, that so long as it would continue its operation, the pollution would continue to fall, not by accident or mishap, but in conformity with the knowledge it had before the construction of the systems. Apple should be presumed to have intended its act's natural, known, and reasonable consequences.</p><p>Apple’s interference would and did substantially annoy or disturb persons of normal health and sensibilities in the same community. Apple’s operations at the factory and Superfund site are both continuing nuisances, and every continuation of the nuisance or trespass gives rise to separate damages claims. Apple has the agency and ability to stop the nuisance (it is not permanent), so until it does, the nuisance Apple created is continuous. &nbsp;Apple’s conduct was a substantial factor in causing Gjovik’s harm. Gjovik did not consent to a defendant’s conduct, and the seriousness of the harm outweighs the social utility of Apple’s conduct. Apple damaged Gjovik’s property and injured Gjovik’s person. Due to Apple’s actions, Gjovik’s property was destroyed, the leasehold degraded, she became very ill, and she suffered severe emotional distress.</p><p>In or about 2015, Apple constructed, or caused to be constructed, exhaust vents and open tanks at ARIA in Santa Clara, near the common border line of the defendant's and Gjovik’s property. The exhaust vents were installed and maintained negligently, recklessly, and unskillfully. Apple exhausted through the vents and emptied various materials or substances into the open tanks that caused a foul, obnoxious, and disagreeable odor and polluted the atmosphere / ambient air of Gjovik’s leasehold property.</p><p>Apple’s facility emits large quantities of vapors, dust, chemicals, and other contaminants into the air, which are carried by the natural winds and air currents onto Gjovik’s property and collect Gjovik’s chattel property and are generally injurious to Gjovik’s health, are offensive to the senses, and interfered with Gjovik’s comfortable enjoyment of life and property. Apple created the nuisance due to unnecessary, unreasonable, and injurious methods of operation of their business. The emissions were a business decision to be able to report reduced waste sent to landfills.</p><p><strong>Strict Liability for Ultrahazardous Activities at 3250 Scott Blvd</strong></p><p>Apple’s fabrication activities at ARIA provided a high degree of risk of significant harm to people and property, and the exercise of reasonable care could not eliminate the risk; the activity's benefits do not outweigh the risks, and these activities are inappropriate for the location, Apple’s activities at ARIA, directly adjacent to High-Density Residential and numerous sensitive receptors (including parks, schools, and playgrounds) is in violation of city and county zoning rules.</p><p>&nbsp;Apple’s facility was originally registered simply as an “R&amp;D Facility” (it appears Apple went to much effort to ensure no one knew they were doing semiconductor fabrication at the location). The ARIA building is located on “Light Industrial” zoned land (18.48), however semiconductor fabrication is expressly not allowed on any land other than “Heavy Industrial” zoned land (18.50). &nbsp;The state Fire Code also includes numerous other regulations targeted at the semiconductor fabrication processes (see, <em>e.g.</em>, Cal. Fire Code Ch. 17 – “Semiconductor Fabrication Faculties”).</p><p>Santa Clara City Code, Santa Clara County Code, and California Fire Code all explain that facilities which process raw materials (10.60.090) and require hazardous material and hazardous waste management, must be located in Heavy Industrial zoned land, must go through an application/review process, and may still be denied if their activities (and emissions) would create a nuisance for other industrial facilities in that area. Further, Santa Clara City Code requires that any industrial zoned properties be located at least 500 feet away from any Residential zoned properties.</p><p>Apple stored, used, treated, and released a large quantity of lethal gases at ARIA. Apple possessed and used substantial amounts of arsine, phosphine, silane, fluorine, chlorine, hydrogen chloride, and phosphorus trichloride. In addition, many of Apple's chemicals at the plant were characterized as “<em>extremely hazardous substances</em>,”[1] “<em>highly toxic gases</em>,”[2] and/or “<em>acute and extremely hazardous wastes</em>.”[3] Regardless of other considerations, California Fire Code requires that any storage or processing of highly toxic gases occur no less than twenty feet away from the property lot line and public sidewalks.</p><p>Further, California Fire Code strictly prohibits the storage, use, or treatments of toxic gases within 75 feet of air intakes in adjacent buildings. This rule applies in Heavy Industrial zoning, where these activities should have been conducted. Apple intentionally venting unabated toxic gases and lethal chemicals into the ambient air only 250 feet from an open-air children’s playground – is exactly the policy justification for Ultrahazardous Activities tort enforcement as a common law zoning mechanism.<br>Apple conducted semiconductor fabrication activities, with extremely dangerous substances, openly dumping its unabated chemical exhaust into the ambient air, only 150 feet from High-Density Residential with thousands of apartments, and 250 feet away from two public parks and a children’s playground. The storage, use, treatment, and release of large quantities of highly toxic, extremely poisonous, acutely lethal gases – directly adjacent to an unsuspecting, High Density Residential area – and directly adjacent to public parks and children’s playgrounds –&nbsp; is an activity which, even when conducted with the greatest of care and prudence, can still cause severe injuries, fatalities, and mass human suffering (<em>e.g.</em> Bhopal). Thus, these activities – in this location, scenario, and context – are Ultrahazardous Activities.</p><p>Apple’s use, storage, and release (intentional and unintentional” of highly toxic gases can produce a dense cloud of lethal gas that would be large enough to engulf the apartments. Such an emissions could easily cause mass fatalities and severe suffering. The condition Apple created and permitted to exist resulted from Ultrahazardous Activities and for which strict liability should also exist.<br>Apple violated the spirit of the Clean Air Act, if not the law, which “<em>criminalizes knowing or negligent “releases into the ambient air [of] any hazardous air pollutant . . . or extremely hazardous substance” that give rise to imminent danger,</em>” [42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(4)– (5)]. Similarly, Apple’s activities likely violated RCRA when Apple “<em>knowingly transports, treats, stores, disposes of, or exports any hazardous waste identified or listed under this subchapter . . . in violation of … of this section [and] knows at that time that he thereby places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury</em>.” [42 U.S.C. § 6928(e)].</p><p>Apple also released chemicals categorized by Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93000 as “<em>Substances Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants</em>,” of which there is no safe level of exposure without “<em>significant adverse health effects</em>. “Apple released into the air chemicals categorized under 42 U.S.C. Section 7412(b) as “<em>Hazardous Air Pollutants</em>” and Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 17, § 93001 as “<em>Hazardous Air Pollutants Identified as Toxic Air Contaminants</em>.”</p><p>Apple was engaged in Ultrahazardous Activities that caused Gjovik to be harmed. Apple’s activities were the proximate cause of that harm, and Apple is responsible for that harm. People who engage in ultrahazardous activities are responsible for the harm these activities cause others, regardless of how carefully they carry out these activities. Apple damaged Gjovik’s chattel property (discoloring, weakening, dissolving glues, causing reactions), degraded her extremely expensive leasehold conditions, and harmed Gjovik’s mind and body.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                With LINQPad, you can interactively query databases directly in LINQ (as well as SQL). The big win with LINQ is having <b>association properties automatically generated for all relationships</b>
                (inferred from foreign key constraints), so you can access related rows without joining! LINQPad uses a custom high-performance scaffolding engine behind the scenes, and includes drivers for SQL Server, SQL Azure,
                Oracle, SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL.
            </p>

            <p>
                When dumped, association properties appear as lazy hyperlinks that can be expanded <b>just by clicking on them</b>. You can walk your entire database interactively!

            <p>
                    And when you need to, you can <b>still query in good old-fashioned SQL</b>. Use LINQPad to query SQL Server, SQLite, Oracle, MySQL or PostgreSQL — without installing any client software!

                        With LINQPad, you can cache intermediate data with <b>Util.Cache</b>. Edit and re-run your query
                        without recomputing previous results.
                    </p>

                        Tuned with numerous heuristics, it intelligently walks object graphs for the best possible output. It even turns lazy objects into hyperlinks

            <span>Abstract:</span>The expression problem describes how most types can easily be extended with new ways to produce the type or new ways to consume the type, but not both. When abstract syntax trees are defined as an algebraic data type, for example, they can easily be extended with new consumers, such as print or eval, but adding a new constructor requires the modification of all existing pattern matches. The expression problem is one way to elucidate the difference between functional or data-oriented programs (easily extendable by new consumers) and object-oriented programs (easily extendable by new producers). This difference between programs which are extensible by new producers or new consumers also exists for dependently typed programming, but with one core difference: Dependently-typed programming almost exclusively follows the functional programming model and not the object-oriented model, which leaves an interesting space in the programming language landscape unexplored. In this paper, we explore the field of dependently-typed object-oriented programming by deriving it from first principles using the principle of duality. That is, we do not extend an existing object-oriented formalism with dependent types in an ad-hoc fashion, but instead start from a familiar data-oriented language and derive its dual fragment by the systematic use of defunctionalization and refunctionalization. Our central contribution is a dependently typed calculus which contains two dual language fragments. We provide type- and semantics-preserving transformations between these two language fragments: defunctionalization and refunctionalization. We have implemented this language and these transformations and use this implementation to explain the various ways in which constructions in dependently typed programming can be explained as special instances of the phenomenon of duality.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">In September 2020, the Federal Trade Commission joined regulators in four states to sue four men behind a notorious telemarketing company called Outreach Calling. The FTC alleged that the company, which it described as a “sprawling fundraising operation,” had raised millions on the promise of helping the needy — cancer patients, veterans, firefighters — but instead used the money to line its pockets.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">The case was meant to put fundraisers on notice. The FTC would not only go after charities that improperly spent donor dollars, but it would “aggressively pursue their fundraisers who participate in the deception,” a news release said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">The executives and corporate entities behind the operation were fined more than $58 million. They were also banned from all charitable fundraising for life. But regulators kept one door open in most of the settlements: the ability to continue fundraising for political purposes.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">For Thomas Berkenbush, who was a co-manager at Outreach, that provision would prove to be a windfall.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">Before the deal with the FTC was even finalized, Berkenbush filed paperwork to establish a new company, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Office+Edge&amp;toggle=expenditures">Office Edge LLC</a>. Since then, Office Edge has been paid about $866,000 for fundraising from organizations that similarly claim to be working on behalf of cancer patients, veterans and firefighters. The difference? These groups are not charities, they’re political nonprofits that claim to use donations to influence elections and support broad political causes.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">The groups that are hiring Berkenbush are <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/">known as 527s</a>, after a section of the tax code. They include federal political action committees — organizations that raise money to elect or defeat candidates and are regulated by the Federal Election Commission — but also a lesser-known group of nonprofits. These 527 groups limit their direct support to political candidates, removing them from the jurisdiction of the FEC or similar state agencies and leaving their regulation to the IRS. They do not have restrictions on how much donors can contribute, but the donations are not tax deductible.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">A ProPublica investigation has connected Berkenbush to a network of at least 10 of these 527 groups that have raised more than $33 million on the promise of supporting admirable causes, but that have spent little on activities that could be construed as having a political purpose. Most of the money goes to fundraisers who have only been paid by 527s in the group ProPublica identified.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Experts say that it’s hard for the public to follow the business practices of 527 groups because of how difficult it is to access the records that the IRS publishes about their activity. Data about 527 organizations is published on an <a href="https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/political-organizations/political-organization-filing-and-disclosure">IRS website</a> in a hard-to-use data file with a limited search interface. On top of that, experts said that there is lax oversight by the federal agencies in charge of regulating the groups.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“There is no enforcement whatsoever,” said William Josephson, the former head of the charities bureau within New York’s attorney general’s office. “It’s just not a big enough issue for the IRS.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">None of the organizations responded to ProPublica’s requests for comment.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">“We advocate for the needs of veterans, by informing voters of these needs and asking them to take action. This is our only purpose,” the <a href="https://www.disabledvetspac.org/transparency-statement.html">statement</a> for the National Coalition for Disabled Veterans reads. It also says, “When you make a contribution, we want you to know that a minimum of 90 cents of every dollar will be dedicated to covering our fundraising costs and outreach efforts.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">The IRS did not respond to questions from ProPublica about our findings in any detail. The FTC declined to comment on why some of the settlement agreements in its case against Outreach Calling permitted political fundraising. The New York attorney general’s office, whose lawyers played a significant role in the case, told ProPublica that it can’t prohibit political fundraising because of First Amendment protections. But it maintained that the settlement agreements forbid the defendants from engaging in any fraudulent conduct while fundraising, regardless of the organization’s tax status or stated purpose.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">Under the terms of the settlements, the defendants — who did not admit or deny any of the allegations in the FTC complaint — were required to submit yearly compliance reports to New York, disclosing all fundraising activity for five years after the agreement was reached. The office confirmed that some of the defendants have reported business activity with 527 groups but did not say whether this prompted any investigations. Berkenbush did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">Eggers has given at least $1,500 to the nonprofit in the past three years. He said his phone rings two to three times a day with different causes asking him for money.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="28.0">The American Breast Cancer Coalition, for example, has taken in nearly $9 million from donors since 2019 and has spent less than half of 1% of that on “voter advocacy and outreach.” The rest of the money — millions of dollars — goes to companies with names like <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Action+Committee+Marketing+LLC&amp;toggle=expenditures">Action Committee Marketing</a>, <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Capital+Vendor+Management+Inc&amp;toggle=expenditures">Capital Vendor Management</a> and Berkenbush’s Office Edge. Berkenbush’s company pulled in $222,000 just from this one organization.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">The network has paid millions to a handful of other vendors, including one of Berkenbush’s former colleagues at Outreach Calling, whose company brought in more than $3.4 million in expenditures. He and his firm did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">Another man, Alan Bohms, was paid more than $575,000 by the American Breast Cancer Coalition through a company he controlled named <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=%22Campaign+Marketing+Inc.%22&amp;toggle=expenditures">Campaign Marketing Inc.</a>, which also did business under the names <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=%22Insight+Data+Management%22&amp;toggle=expenditures">Insight Data Management</a> and <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/search?search=Prestige+Tax+%26+Payroll&amp;toggle=expenditures">Prestige Tax &amp; Payroll</a>. The company has taken in close to $1.5 million from the network of nonprofits ProPublica identified. Bohms was not a member of Outreach Calling or subject to the FTC order, but he has previously paid the company millions to fundraise for one of his nonprofits.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">In an email, Bohms defended the money that the groups spend on fundraising, writing that the phone calls are central to “educating and engaging the community about the PAC’s mission and objectives.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">At least half of the organizations ProPublica identified worked with the same Morristown, Tennessee-based accounting firm on their IRS filings, Purkey, Carter, Compton, Swann &amp; Carter. Bohms also uses the firm for his own nonprofit, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/465432355">Volunteer Firefighter Alliance</a>, telling ProPublica that the firm maintained high standards of integrity. The firm did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">Fire departments across the country warned people against donating to Bohms’ charity, and both he and the charity were written about in a 2020 <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/12/09/meet-the-man-at-the-center-of-a-shadowy-multimillion-dollar-scam-pac-network/">Salon story</a> that connected Bohms to a network of “scam PACs.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">“VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER ALLIANCE is a FRAUD!” exclaimed one 2021 post on Facebook from the Alpha Fire Company in Centre County, Pennsylvania. “Do not give money to this organization! They are not your local fire company.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Records show that one of the charity’s main fundraisers was Outreach Calling, the company shut down by the FTC. The Volunteer Firefighters Alliance paid $4.8 million to the company for fundraising in total. Bohms defended Outreach’s work, telling ProPublica that he “found Outreach Calling to be very professional and had never experienced any problems with them.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">Bohms’ family members also appear to help run the nonprofits that pay his companies. His sister, Julie Forsythe, is listed as the treasurer of the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/843763242/">National Cancer Alliance</a>, which “works to establish the end of childhood cancer by making it a state and national priority.” Another organization, the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/853307234">National Coalition for Disabled Veterans PAC</a>, reports its treasurer as Bohms’ aunt, Judith Gragert. In the last five years, these two organizations have raised over $7 million from more than 700 donors around the country.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Like all of these groups, neither used much of the money they raised in support of their stated efforts. Effectively all of the expenditures that both groups reported were for either fundraising or other administrative costs. Together, the organizations paid more than $300,000 to Campaign Marketing Inc., the company owned by Bohms.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Gragert and Forsythe did not respond to requests for comment. Bohms told ProPublica that he works with 527 groups “strictly in the capacity of a vendor,” and that the payments made to his companies were for legitimate services. He denied any involvement in decision-making at the groups that listed his aunt and sister as treasurer.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">“It is important to understand that the payments made to fundraisers encompass more than just fundraising activities,” Bohms wrote in an emailed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24762422-alan-bohms-response">response</a>. “These funds support a broad range of outreach efforts, including phone calls and direct mail campaigns that are designed to inform the public about the PAC’s goals and initiatives.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">At least one of the groups ProPublica identified has been sued over its fundraising practices. A pair of call recipients filed a lawsuit seeking class-action status in 2022 against the <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/527-explorer/orgs/854325630">National Police &amp; Sheriffs Coalition PAC</a>. Lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged that the group used prerecorded voice calls to contact potential donors without their consent, in violation of FCC rules that are meant to protect consumers from telemarketers.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">“Many of these PACs are illegitimate,” said Eric Weitz, whose law firm is on the team representing plaintiffs. “They prey on people’s political leanings.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">One of the defendants named in the lawsuit was Frank Pulciani, the organization’s treasurer. Pulciani maintained that prerecorded messages were not improperly used in calls to donors, and that the fundraising company the group hired was responsible for ensuring that calls complied with the law.

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">For Eggers, the donor who gave to the American Breast Cancer Coalition, the revelation that some of the organizations he’s been supporting are using almost none of what they raise for their stated purpose was discouraging.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">“I feel like I’m being used and they’re being abused,” he said, referring to those he aimed to help with his donations.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">On the mantle above Eggers’ fireplace rests a selection of plaques, framed photographs and certificates that showcase his commitment to giving. One award from 2012, titled “Lending a Helping Hand,” recognizes his 31 years of volunteering for a local organization providing services to the homeless. Another, from a regional branch of the American Red Cross, celebrates his donations to a blood platelet program.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">He showed ProPublica a letter he received from the American Breast Cancer Coalition this past April.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">“Through your much-needed support, we hope to educate the public about our nation’s important Breast Cancer health bills,” reads the letter, thanking him for his donation. It noted that the group was not a charity —&nbsp;key to the FTC order against former Outreach Calling employees.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="Sec5-content"><p>Semantic entropy as a strategy for overcoming confabulation builds on probabilistic tools for uncertainty estimation. It can be applied directly to any LLM or similar foundation model without requiring any modifications to the architecture. Our ‘discrete’ variant of semantic uncertainty can be applied even when the predicted probabilities for the generations are not available, for example, because access to the internals of the model is limited.</p><p>In this section we introduce background on probabilistic methods and uncertainty in machine learning, discuss how it applies to language models and then discuss our contribution, semantic entropy, in detail.</p><h3 id="Sec6">Background</h3><h4 id="Sec7">Uncertainty and machine learning</h4><p>We aim to detect confabulations in LLMs, using the principle that the model will be uncertain about generations for which its output is going to be arbitrary.</p><p>One measure of uncertainty is the predictive entropy of the output distribution, which measures the information one has about the output given the input<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Lindley, D.

The predictive entropy (PE) for an input sentence <b>x</b> is the conditional entropy&nbsp;(<i>H</i>) of the output random variable <i>Y</i> with realization <i>y</i> given <b>x</b>,</p><div id="Equ1"><p><span>$${\rm{PE}}({\bf{x}})=H(Y| {\bf{x}})=-\sum _{y}P(\,y| {\bf{x}})\mathrm{ln}P(\,y| {\bf{x}}).$$</span></p><p>
                    (1)
                </p></div><p>A low predictive entropy indicates an output distribution which is heavily concentrated whereas a high predictive entropy indicates that many possible outputs are similarly likely.</p><h4 id="Sec8">Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty</h4><p>We do not distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in our analysis. Researchers sometimes separate aleatoric uncertainty (uncertainty in the underlying data distribution) from epistemic uncertainty (caused by having only limited information)<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Der Kiureghian, A. &amp; Ditlevsen, O. Aleatory or epistemic? Does it matter? Struct. Saf. 31, 105–112 (2009)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d292441206e1295">46</a></sup>. Further advances in uncertainty estimation which separate these kinds of uncertainty would enhance the potential for our semantic uncertainty approach by allowing extensions beyond entropy.</p><h4 id="Sec9">Joint probabilities of sequences of tokens</h4><p>Generative LLMs produce strings of text by selecting tokens in sequence. Each token is a wordpiece that often represents three or four characters (though especially common sequences and important words such as numbers typically get their own token). To compute entropies, we need access to the probabilities the LLM assigns to the generated sequence of tokens. The probability of the entire sequence, <b>s</b>, conditioned on the context, <b>x</b>, is the product of the conditional probabilities of new tokens given past tokens, whose resulting log-probability is <span>\(\log P({\bf{s}}| {\boldsymbol{x}})={\sum }_{i}\log P({s}_{i}| {{\bf{s}}}_{ &lt; i},{\boldsymbol{x}})\)</span>, where <i>s</i><sub><i>i</i></sub> is the <i>i</i>th output token and <b>s</b><sub>&lt;<i>i</i></sub> denotes the set of previous tokens.</p><h4 id="Sec10">Length normalization</h4><p>When comparing the log-probabilities of generated sequences, we use ‘length normalization’, that is, we use an arithmetic mean log-probability, <span>\(\frac{1}{N}{\sum }_{i}^{N}\log P({s}_{i}| {{\bf{s}}}_{ &lt; i},{\boldsymbol{x}})\)</span>, instead of the sum. In expectation, longer sequences have lower joint likelihoods because of the conditional independence of the token probabilities<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Malinin, A. &amp; Gales, M.

The joint likelihood of a sequence of length <i>N</i> shrinks exponentially in <i>N</i>. Its negative log-probability therefore grows linearly in <i>N</i>, so longer sentences tend to contribute more to entropy. We therefore interpret length-normalizing the log-probabilities when estimating the entropy as asserting that the expected uncertainty of generations is independent of sentence length. Length normalization has some empirical success<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 48" title="Murray, K. &amp; Chiang, D.

For example, even if the model is confident in the meaning of a generation, there are still usually many different ways for phrasing that generation without changing its meaning. For the purposes of detecting confabulations, the uncertainty of&nbsp;the LLM over meanings is more important than the uncertainty over the exact tokens used to express those meanings.</p><p>Our semantic uncertainty method therefore seeks to estimate only the uncertainty the LLM has over the meaning of its generation, not the choice of words. To do this, we introduce an algorithm that clusters model generations by meaning and subsequently calculates semantic uncertainty. At a high level this involves three steps:</p><ol>

We can formalize semantic equivalence mathematically. Let the space of tokens in a language be <span>\({\mathcal{T}}\)</span>. The space of all possible sequences of tokens of length <i>N</i> is then <span>\({{\mathcal{S}}}_{N}\equiv {{\mathcal{T}}}^{N}\)</span>. Note that <i>N</i> can be made arbitrarily large to accommodate whatever size of sentence one can imagine and one of the tokens can be a ‘padding’ token which occurs with certainty for each token after the end-of-sequence token. For some sentence <span>\({\bf{s}}\in {{\mathcal{S}}}_{N}\)</span>, composed of a sequence of tokens, <span>\({s}_{i}\in {\mathcal{T}}\)</span>, there is an associated meaning. Theories of meaning are contested<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 51" title="Speaks, J. in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (ed.

However, for specific models and deployment contexts many considerations can be set aside. Care should be taken comparing very different models and contexts.</p><p>Let us introduce a semantic equivalence relation, <i>E</i>( <span>⋅</span> , <span>⋅</span> ), which holds for any two sentences that mean the same thing—we will operationalize this presently. Recall that an equivalence relation is any reflexive, symmetric and transitive relation and that any equivalence relation on a set corresponds to a set of equivalence classes. Each semantic equivalence class captures outputs that can be considered to express the same meaning. That is, for the space of semantic equivalence classes <span>\({\mathcal{C}}\)</span> the sentences in the set <span>\(c\in {\mathcal{C}}\)</span> can be regarded in many settings as expressing a similar meaning such that <span>\(\forall {\bf{s}},{{\bf{s}}}^{{\prime} }\in c:E({\bf{s}},{{\bf{s}}}^{{\prime} })\)</span>.

This requires access to a dataset of ground-truth answers to the questions. Rather than fine-tuning the entire LLM in this way, we simply take the final hidden units and train a logistic regression classifier to make the same prediction. By contrast to their method, this is much simpler because it does not require fine-tuning the entire language model, as well as being more reproducible because the solution to the logistic regression optimization problem is not as seed-dependent as the fine-tuning procedure.

                    <p>Answer the following question in a single brief but complete sentence.</p>
                    <p>Question: {question}</p>
                    <p>Answer:</p>
                  </div></blockquote><h4 id="Sec21">Metrics and accuracy measurements</h4><p>We use three main metrics to evaluate our method: AUROC, rejection accuracy and AURAC. Each of these is grounded in an automated factuality estimation measurement relative to the reference answers provided by the datasets that we use.</p>
                    <h3 id="FPar1">AUROC, rejection accuracy and AURAC</h3>
                    <p>First, we use the AUROC curve, which measures the reliability of a classifier accounting for both precision and recall. The AUROC can be interpreted as the probability that a randomly chosen correct answer has been assigned a higher confidence score than a randomly chosen incorrect answer. For a perfect classifier, this is 1.</p>
                    <p>Second, we compute the ‘rejection accuracy at <i>X</i>%’, which is the question-answering accuracy of the model on the most-confident <i>X</i>% of the inputs as identified by the respective uncertainty method. If an uncertainty method works well, predictions on the confident subset should be more accurate than predictions on the excluded subset and the rejection accuracy should increase as we reject more inputs.</p>
                    <p>To summarize this statistic we compute the AURAC—the total area enclosed by the accuracies at all cut-off percentages <i>X</i>%. This should increase towards 1 as given uncertainty method becomes more accurate and better at detecting likely-inaccurate responses but it is more sensitive to the overall accuracy of the model than the AUROC metric.</p>
                    <p>In Supplementary Note&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">5</a>, we provide the unaggregated rejection accuracies for sentence-length generations.</p>
                  
                    <h3 id="FPar2">Assessing accuracy</h3>
                    <p>For the short-phrase-length generation setting presented in Supplementary Note&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">7</a>, we simply assess the accuracy of the generations by checking if the F1 score of the commonly used SQuAD metric exceeds 0.5. There are limitations to such simple scoring rules<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 63" title="Kane, H., Kocyigit, Y., Abdalla, A., Ajanoh, P. &amp; Coulibali, M. Towards neural similarity evaluators. In Workshop on Document Intelligence at the 32nd conference on Neural Information Processing (2019)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#ref-CR63" id="ref-link-section-d292441206e3098">63</a></sup> but this method is widely used in practice and its error is comparatively small on these standard datasets.</p>
                    <p>For our default scenario, the longer sentence-length generations, this measure fails, as the overlap between the short reference answer and our long model answer is invariably too small. For sentence-length generations, we therefore automatically determine whether an answer to the question is correct or incorrect by using GPT-4 to compare the given answer to the reference answer. We use the template:</p>
                    <blockquote><div>
                      <p>We are assessing the quality of answers to the following question: {question}</p>
                      <p>The expected answer is: {reference answer}</p>
                      <p>The proposed answer is: {predicted answer}</p>
                      <p>Within the context of the question, does the proposed answer mean the same as the expected answer? Respond only with yes or no.</p>
                    </div></blockquote>
                    <p>We make a small modification for datasets with several reference answers: line two becomes “The following are expected answers to this question:” and the final line asks “does the proposed answer mean the same as any of the expected answers?”.</p>
                    <p>In Supplementary Note <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">6</a>, we check the quality of our automated ground-truth evaluations against human judgement by hand. We find that GPT-4 gives the best results for determining model accuracy and thus use it in all our sentence-length experiments.</p>
                  <h3 id="Sec22">Detecting confabulations in biographies</h3><p>In this section we describe the application of semantic entropy to confabulation detection in longer model generations, specifically paragraph-length biographies.</p><p>We introduce a biography-generation dataset—FactualBio—available alongside this paper. FactualBio is a collection of biographies of individuals who are notable enough to have Wikipedia pages but not notable enough to have large amounts of detailed coverage, generated by GPT-4 (v.0613). To generate the dataset, we randomly sampled 21 individuals from the WikiBio dataset<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 64" title="Lebret, R., Grangier, D. &amp; Auli, M. Neural text generation from structured data with application to the biography domain. In Proc. 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (eds Su, J. et al.) 1203–1213 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#ref-CR64" id="ref-link-section-d292441206e3144">64</a></sup>. For each biography, we generated a list of factual claims contained in each biography using GPT-4, with 150 total factual claims (the total number is only coincidentally a round number). For each of these factual claims, we manually determined whether the claim was correct or incorrect. Out of 150 claims, 45 were incorrect. As before, we apply confabulation detection to detect incorrect model predictions, even though there may be model errors which are not confabulations.</p><h4 id="Sec23">Prompting and generation</h4><p>Given a paragraph-length piece of LLM-generated text, we apply the following sequence of steps:</p><ol>
                    <li>
                      <span>1.</span>
                      
                        <p>Automatically decompose the paragraph into specific factual claims using an LLM (not necessarily the same as the original).</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>2.</span>
                      
                        <p>For each factual claim, use an LLM to automatically construct <i>Q</i> questions which might have produced that claim.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>3.</span>
                      
                        <p>For each question, prompt the original LLM to generate <i>M</i> answers.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>4.</span>
                      
                        <p>For each question, compute the semantic entropy of the answers, including the original factual claim.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <span>5.</span>
                      
                        <p>Average the semantic entropies over the questions to arrive at a score for the original factual claim.</p>
                      
                    </li>
                  </ol><p>We pursue this slightly indirect way of generating answers because we find that simply resampling each sentence creates variation unrelated to the uncertainty of the model about the factual claim, such as differences in paragraph structure.</p><p>We decompose the paragraph into factual claims using the following prompt:</p><blockquote><p>Please list the specific factual propositions included in the answer above. Be complete and do not leave any factual claims out. Provide each claim as a separate sentence in a separate bullet point.</p></blockquote><p>We found that we agreed with the decompositions in all cases in the dataset.</p><p>We then generate six questions for each of the facts from the decomposition. We generate these questions by prompting the model twice with the following:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>Following this text:</p>
                    <p>{text so far}</p>
                    <p>You see the sentence:</p>
                    <p>{proposition}</p>
                    <p>Generate a list of three questions, that might have generated the sentence in the context of the preceding original text, as well as their answers. Please do not use specific facts that appear in the follow-up sentence when formulating the question. Make the questions and answers diverse. Avoid yes-no questions. The answers should not be a full sentence and as short as possible, e.g. only a name, place, or thing. Use the format “1. {question} – {answer}”.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>These questions are not necessarily well-targeted and the difficulty of this step is the main source of errors in the procedure. We generate three questions with each prompt, as this encourages diversity of the questions, each question targeting a different aspect of the fact. However, we observed that the generated questions will sometimes miss obvious aspects of the fact. Executing the above prompt twice (for a total of six questions) can improve coverage. We also ask for brief answers because the current version of GPT-4 tends to give long, convoluted and highly hedged answers unless explicitly told not to.</p><p>Then, for each question, we generate three new answers using the following prompt:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>We are writing an answer to the question “{user question}”. So far we have written:</p>
                    <p>{text so far}</p>
                    <p>The next sentence should be the answer to the following question:</p>
                    <p>{question}</p>
                    <p>Please answer this question. Do not answer in a full sentence. Answer with as few words as possible, e.g. only a name, place, or thing.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>We then compute the semantic entropy over these answers plus the original factual claim. Including the original fact ensures that the estimator remains grounded in the original claim and helps detect situations in which the question has been interpreted completely differently from the original context. We make a small modification to handle the fact that GPT-4 generations often include refusals to answer questions. These refusals were not something we commonly observe in our experiments with LLaMA 2, Falcon or Mistral models. If more than half of the answers include one of the strings ‘not available’, ‘not provided’, ‘unknown’ or ‘unclear’ then we treat the semantic uncertainty as maximal.</p><p>We then average the semantic entropies for each question corresponding to the factual claim to get an entropy for this factual claim.</p><p>Despite the extra assumptions and complexity, we find that this method greatly outperforms the baselines.</p><h4 id="Sec24">Entailment estimator</h4><p>To compute semantic entailment between the original claim and regenerated answers, we rely on the DeBERTa entailment prediction model as we find empirically that DeBERTa predictions result in higher train-set AUROC than other methods. Because DeBERTa has slightly lower recall than GPT-3.5/4, we use a modified set-up for which we say the answers mean the same as each other if at least one of them entails the other and neither is seen to contradict the other—a kind of ‘non-defeating’ bidirectional entailment check rather than true bidirectional entailment. The good performance of DeBERTa in this scenario is not surprising as both factual claims and regenerated answers are relatively short. We refer to Supplementary Notes <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">2</a> and <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0#MOESM1">3</a> for ablations and experiments regarding our choice of entailment estimator for paragraph-length generations.</p><h4 id="Sec25">Baselines</h4><p>We implement two baselines. First, we implement a variant of the <i>P</i>(True) method, which is adapted to the new setting. For each factoid, we generate a question with answers in the same way as for semantic entropy. We then use the following prompt:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>Question: {question}</p>
                    <p>Here are some brainstormed ideas:</p>
                    <p>{list of regenerated answers}</p>
                    <p>Possible answer: {original answer}</p>
                    <p>Is the possible answer true? Respond with “yes” or “no”.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>As we cannot access the probabilities GPT-4 assigns to predicting ‘yes’ and ‘no’ as the next token, we approximate this using Monte Carlo samples. Concretely, we execute the above prompt ten times (at temperature 1) and then take the fraction of answers which was ‘yes’ as our unbiased Monte Carlo estimate of the token probability GPT-4 assigns to ‘yes’.</p><p>As a second, simpler, baseline we check if the model thinks the answer is true. We simply ask:</p><blockquote><div>
                    <p>Following this text:</p>
                    <p>{text so far}</p>
                    <p>You see this statement:</p>
                    <p>{proposition}</p>
                    <p>Is it likely that the statement is true? Respond with ‘yes’ or ‘no’.</p>
                  </div></blockquote><p>It is interesting that this method ought to perform very well if we think that the model has good ‘self-knowledge’ (that is, if “models mostly know what they don’t know”<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Kadavath, S. et al.

<p>Huber’s Butchery, in Singapore’s upscale Dempsey Hill neighborhood, has long drawn shoppers looking for more than just cold cuts. Starting last month, the deli’s freezer section has stocked shredded chicken grown from cells in a lab, the first time anywhere in the world that cultivated meat can be bought in a store, its manufacturer said.</p>



<p>Cultivated meat has been available at a handful of restaurants in Singapore and the U.S. for a couple of years. But the <a href="https://www.goodmeat.co/all-news/good-meat-begins-the-worlds-first-retail-sales-of-cultivated-chicken">launch</a> of Good Meat 3 — from California-based food technology firm Eat Just&nbsp; — at Huber’s is a high point for the industry that has been in the doldrums lately. Investor interest is flagging, and cultivated meat has been banned in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/italys-parliament-approves-ban-lab-grown-food-amid-tensions-2023-11-16/">Italy</a>, and in the U.S. states of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/13/lab-grown-meat-ban-alabama/73678952007/">Alabama</a> and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/05/05/florida-lab-grown-meat-ban/73569976007/">Florida</a>.</p>



<p>The retail launch “is more than a milestone for the company, it is also a milestone for the cultivated meat industry,” Josh Tetrick, Eat Just’s co-founder and chief executive, told <em>Rest of World</em>. The formulation of its new product uses just 3% cultivated chicken in order to sell at a lower price point so more people can try it, he said. “Singapore’s population has always demonstrated a remarkable openness to new technologies in food and elsewhere, making it the perfect marketplace for novel foods like cultivated meats.”</p>



<p>Unlike plant-based meats that have become commonplace with brands such as Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat, cultivated meat has struggled to get off the ground after an initial wave of enthusiasm.</p>



<p>The tissue-engineering techniques behind cultivated meat have long been used in making vaccines and drugs: Animal fat and tissue are grown in a lab from cells, then processed into a variety of proteins. The obvious advantages are that it needs less land and water to produce, and can lower greenhouse gas emissions. But cultivated meat is expensive to produce and hard to scale, and has struggled to hold investor interest.</p>



<p>The more than <a href="https://gfi.org/resource/cultivated-meat-and-seafood-state-of-the-industry-report/">$3 billion</a> put into cultivated meat worldwide over the last decade is a fraction of the investments in other technologies, such as renewable energy, which are also aimed at reducing emissions.<strong> </strong>“The biggest obstacle to cultivated meat reaching the masses … is the broad underinvestment in R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure, especially from governments,” Mirte Gosker, managing director of the nonprofit Good Food Institute Asia Pacific, told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Singapore’s foray into alternative proteins began in earnest in March 2019, with its “<a href="https://www.ourfoodfuture.gov.sg/30by30/">30 by 30” vision</a> to sustainably produce 30% of its nutritional needs locally by 2030 — up from 10%. Alternative protein is a key part of this plan. But its strategy “goes beyond simply meeting its own domestic needs,” said Gosker.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“The biggest obstacle to cultivated meat reaching the masses … is the broad underinvestment in R&amp;D and manufacturing infrastructure.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>“As a small country with limited natural resources, Singapore cannot single-handedly feed the world,” she said. “But it can serve as the place where companies from all around the world come to work with top-tier research agencies and food-tech partners to refine their formulations, eliminate inefficiencies in their manufacturing process, and explore new techniques and ingredients that could help them drive down costs.”</p>



<p>Singapore was the first country to approve cultivated meat, with the nod for Eat Just’s chicken nuggets in December 2020. The Singapore Food Agency (SFA) recently <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/s-pore-approves-lab-grown-quail-for-consumption-here">greenlit</a> Australia-based Vow’s <a href="https://www.forgedbyvow.com/">cultivated quail</a> for restaurants — the second company to receive a local license, and just the fourth globally. Later this year, SFA is expected to approve cultivated chicken and pork from French firm Vital Meat and Dutch company Meatable, respectively.</p>



<p>There are about a dozen local alternative-protein startups in the country, and some 15 from Europe, the U.S., South Korea, Israel, and Hong Kong. While investments in other countries may be larger, “one of Singapore’s greatest strengths is the tight-knit innovation community which facilitates seamless collaboration between startups, researchers, and government agencies,” Gosker said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government has so far committed some $230 million towards alternative proteins — from grants to training researchers to building capabilities in bioprocessing and other complementary technologies. Singapore “invested very heavily in getting technological expertise into its government regulatory departments,” Simon Eassom, chief executive of Food Frontier, an Australia-based think tank, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “That means it’s able to fast-track a lot of these applications safely.” Applications only take half, or a third, of the time to process, compared to Australia or the U.S., he said.</p>



<p>Singapore is the “perfect spot” for testing, George Peppou, co-founder and chief executive of Vow,<strong> </strong>told <em>Rest of World</em>. The speed of approvals is the “driving reason” why Vow launched its cultivated quail in Singapore, he said. “We have an application with the FDA, but we’re not intending to launch in the U.S. anytime soon … It’s a very expensive market to launch in, and now it’s so politically sensitive, it wouldn’t be worth the investment.”</p>

<p>The United States and Israel approved the sale of cultivated chicken and beef in June 2023 and January 2024, respectively. Australia and New Zealand are <a href="https://www.foodstandards.gov.au/food-standards-code/applications/A1269-Cultured-Quail-as-a-Novel-Food">jointly assessing</a> Vow’s cultivated quail for approval. China added cultivated meat to its five-year plan for food in 2022, while South Korea set up a <a href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/south-korea-cultivated-meat-regulatory-approval-ministry/">regulatory framework</a> for cultivated meat this year. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dominicdudley/2022/09/30/vertical-farms-and-lab-grown-beef-gulf-investors-develop-a-taste-for-future-foods/?sh=5dbd58fe6334">investing heavily</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Singapore’s Islamic Religious Council <a href="https://www.muis.gov.sg/Media/Media-Releases/2024/2/3-Feb-24-Fatwa-on-Cultivated-Meat">declared</a> cultivated meat halal earlier this year, expanding the potential consumer base in the multiethnic country. In April, state-backed sustainable food firm Nurasa opened a <a href="https://www.edb.gov.sg/en/about-edb/media-releases-publications/nurasa-unveils-asia-premier-food-tech-nnovation-centre-to-enable-sustainable-nutrition-solutions.html">food innovation center</a> that offers food-tech startups facilities such as 100-liter bioreactors to help produce at scale. Some of Eat Just’s Good Meat 3 was produced there.</p>



<p>“Shared developmental resources like this can help solve specific problems in the value chain and bottlenecks that many companies share,” Mihir Pershad, who moved from the U.S. state of Maryland to Singapore, told <em>Rest of World. </em>Pershad’s <a href="https://umamibioworks.com/technology/">Umami Bioworks</a>, which makes cultivated seafood, has secured R&amp;D grants and meetings with potential overseas customers through the Singapore government, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worldwide, there are nearly 200 cultivated meat companies. Although prices in the nascent industry have declined since the first lab-grown beef burger debuted in 2013 at a staggering $330,000, they still need to fall to under $10 per kilo — roughly a tenth of current costs — to be competitive in the mass market, <a href="https://gfi-apac.org/2023-apac-state-of-the-industry-report/">estimates</a> the Good Food Institute.</p>



<p>Cultivated meat may reach <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/agriculture/our-insights/cultivated-meat-out-of-the-lab-into-the-frying-pan">cost parity</a> with conventional meat by 2030, with the market worth about $25 billion by then, according to McKinsey &amp; Company. But investor interest has flagged: The industry raised just $226 million last year, a steep fall from $922 million in 2022, according to the Good Food Institute. Several Silicon Valley startups have <a href="https://www.foodprocessing.com/ingredients/alternative-protein/news/33002716/cultivated-meat-startup-new-age-eats-shuts-down">collapsed</a> or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/upside-foods-glenview-illinois-factory-lab-grown-meat/">shelved expansion plans</a>. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eat-just-financial-problems/">Eat Just</a> is also under pressure in the U.S.</p>



<div><p>Startups are also still finding investors: Cellivate Technologies, a Singapore company focused on cell-based solutions for the cultivated meat industry, recently beat out nearly two dozen startups in Southeast Asia to win a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/brandstudio/cellivate-technologies-raises-eyebrows-it-secures-hefty-funding-final-round-big-spark-4214561">business reality TV show</a>, with commitments of about $3 million from venture capital firms.</p><p>“There is much more work to be done to prove that cultivated meat can be made at large scale,” said Eat Just’s Tetrick. “[But] this year, we will sell more servings of cultivated chicken than have been sold in any year prior.” As for its newest product, Huber’s Butchery is “pretty much selling most of what is supplied to us,” Andre Huber, the executive director, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “Response has been great.”</p></div>

<p>
  Like many Unix users,
  I long ago created a <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory in my home directory
  and added it to my <tt>PATH</tt>
  so that I could supplement
  the wonderfully rich set of basic Unix commands
  with some conveniences and shell scripts of my own devising.
</p>
<p>
  The problem, of course, was the chance of collision.
  Because my shell script names
  tended to be short and pithy collections of lowercase characters,
  just like the default system commands,
  there was no telling when Linux would add a new command
  that would happen to have the same name as one of mine.
  This was actually not very likely on,
  say, a System&nbsp;V Revision&nbsp;3 workstation in the 1980s,
  but the trouble became quite a bit more acute
  when I moved into the world of Debian.
  Red Hat never really worried me,
  because they packaged (comparatively) so little software.
  But Debian today supports a huge number of commands;
  my modest Ubuntu laptop shows several thousand available:
</p>
<div><pre><span>$</span> <span>apt</span><span>-</span><span>file</span> <span>search</span> <span>-</span><span>x</span> <span>'</span><span>^/</span><span>usr</span><span>/</span><span>bin</span><span>/</span><span>[</span><span>^/</span><span>]</span><span>*</span><span>$'</span> <span>|</span> <span>wc</span> <span>-</span><span>l</span>
<span>21733</span></pre></div>

<p>
  The solution was obviously to adjust my command names
  in such a way that they were still easy to type,
  but would never be chosen as system command names.
  For me, “easy to type” means not having to use the shift key,
  and very few characters turned out to be available,
  unshifted, on a modern keyboard.
  The lower-case letters
  are the very characters used in system commands;
  brackets, backslashes, the colon, the back-tick, and the single-tick
  all had a special meaning to the shell;
  and the slash and dot characters both mean something special
  in a filename.
  (The slash divides directory names from filenames,
  and thus cannot appear in a filename itself,
  while the dot means “hide this file from normal browsing”
  if it leads the name,
  and separates a file from its extension in many other cases.)
</p>
<p>
  There was but one character left: the simple, modest comma.
</p>
<p>
  A quick experiment revealed in a flash
  that the comma was <i>exactly</i> the character
  that I had been looking for!
  Every tool and shell that lay in arm's reach
  treated the comma as a perfectly normal
  and unobjectionable character in a filename.
  By simply prefixing each of my custom commands
  with a comma,
  they became completely distinct from system commands
  and thus free from any chance of a collision.
</p>
<p>
  And, best of all,
  thanks to the magic of tab-completion,
  it became very easy to browse my entire collection of commands.
  When trying to remember which of my commands
  are available in my <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory on a given system,
  or when simply trying to remember what
  some of my commands are called,
  I simply type a comma followed by <i>tab</i>
  and my list of commands appears:
</p>
<pre>$ ,<i>«tab»</i>
,complete-scp        ,go-thpgp            ,range
,complete-ssh        ,gr                  ,svn-store-password
,coreoff             ,hss                 ,umount
,coreon              ,mount-thpgp
,find                ,mount-twt</pre>
<p>
  I heartily recommend this technique
  to anyone with their own <tt>~/bin/</tt> directory
  who wants their command names kept clean, tidy,
  and completely orthogonal
  to any commands that the future might bring to your system.
  The approach has worked for me for something like a decade,
  so you should find it immensely robust.
  And, finally, it's just plain fun.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://www.righto.com/2024/06/montreal-mifare-ultralight-nfc.html">http://www.righto.com/2024/06/montreal-mifare-ultralight-nfc.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40769001">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-6125267763462084907" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>To use the Montreal subway (the Métro), you tap a paper ticket against the turnstile and it opens.
The ticket works through a system called NFC, but what's happening internally?
How does the ticket work without a battery? How does it communicate with the turnstile?
And how can it be so cheap that you can throw the ticket away after one use?
To answer these questions, I opened up a ticket and examined the tiny chip inside.</p>
<p>The image below shows the chip inside the ticket, highly magnified.
The four golden squares in the corner are the connections to the antenna.
The tan-colored lines are the metal wiring layer on top of the chip; the thickest lines wire the antenna to other parts
of the chip.
The darker region that takes up the majority of the
chip is the chip's digital logic. To the left is the analog circuitry that handles the signal from the antenna.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/die-raw.jpg"><img alt="The MIFARE Ultralight die under the microscope. (Click this image (or any other) for a larger view." height="427" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/die-raw-w500.jpg" title="The MIFARE Ultralight die under the microscope. (Click this image (or any other) for a larger view." width="500"></a></p><p>The MIFARE Ultralight die under the microscope. (Click this image (or any other) for a larger view.</p>
<p>The chip uses NFC (Near-Field Communication).
The idea behind NFC is that a reader (i.e. the turnstile) and an NFC tag (i.e. the ticket) communicate
over a short distance through magnetic fields, allowing them to exchange data.
The reader generates a magnetic field that both powers the tag and sends data to the tag.
Both the reader and the tag have coil-like antennas so the reader's magnetic field can be picked up by the tag.<span id="fnref:field"><a href="#fn:field">1</a></span>
When you tap your ticket on the turnstile, the NFC communication happens in 35 milliseconds, faster than an eyeblink.
The data provided by the NFC tag shows that you have a valid ticket and then you can enter the subway.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the subway ticket, made of printed paper.<span id="fnref:opus"><a href="#fn:opus">2</a></span>
At the right, the ticket appears to have golden smart-card contacts, like a
credit card with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMV">EMV</a> chip.
However, those contacts are completely fake, just printed onto the card with ink, and there is no chip there.
Presumably, the makers thought that making the card look like a smart card would help people understand it.
The card actually uses an entirely different technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/occasionnelle-card.jpg"><img alt="A Montreal subway card. This card is for occasional use and is disposable. Regular travel uses a rigid plastic card containing a different chip." height="313" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/occasionnelle-card-w500.jpg" title="A Montreal subway card. This card is for occasional use and is disposable. Regular travel uses a rigid plastic card containing a different chip." width="500"></a></p><p>A Montreal subway card. This card is for occasional use and is disposable. Regular travel uses a rigid plastic card containing a different chip.</p>
<p>Although the subway card is paper on the outside, its core is a thin plastic sheet, shown below.
The sheet has a coiled antenna made from a layer of metal foil.
If you look closely, you can see the tiny NFC chip in the lower right, a black speck
connected to two sides of the antenna wire.<span id="fnref:triple"><a href="#fn:triple">3</a></span>
The diagonal metal stripe in the upper left makes the antenna into a loop;
topologically, a spiral antenna won't work on a 2-D sheet, so the diagonal bridge completes the circuit.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize the absurdly small size of the chip: 570 µm × 485 µm.
The photo below shows that it is about the size of a grain of salt.
The chip is also extremely thin—75 µm or 120 µm—so you can't even feel the chip inside the ticket.</p>

I composited two images, one illuminated from above to show the die and one illuminated from below to show the salt.</p>
<h2>Functions of the chip</h2>
<p>There are many different types of NFC chips with varying levels of functionality. <span id="fnref:phone"><a href="#fn:phone">4</a></span>
This one is called the MIFARE Ultralight EV1,<span id="fnref:part"><a href="#fn:part">5</a></span> a low-cost chip designed
for one-time ticketing applications.
The basic function of the Ultralight chip is simple: providing a block of data to the reader.
The chip holds its data in a small EEPROM; this chip has 48 bytes of user memory, while another variant has 108 bytes of user memory.</p>
<p>The Ultralight chip lacks the cryptography support found in more advanced chips.
The Ultralight isn't much more secure than
a printed ticket with a QR code or barcode, like you'd download for a show.
It's up to the reader to validate the data and make sure the same ticket isn't being used multiple times.<span id="fnref:ticket"><a href="#fn:ticket">6</a></span></p>
<p>The Ultralight chip has a few features beyond a printed ticket, though.
The chips are manufactured with a unique 7-byte identification code (UID). Moreover, the UID is signed,
ensuring that fake UIDs cannot be generated.<span id="fnref:signed"><a href="#fn:signed">7</a></span>
The chip also supports password-protected memory access and locking of memory pages to prevent modification.
Since the password is transmitted without encryption, the security is weak, but better than nothing.<span id="fnref:upsell"><a href="#fn:upsell">8</a></span></p>
<p>Another interesting feature of the chip is the one-way counter. The chip has three 24-bit counters that can be incremented but not
decremented. The counters can be used to allow the ticket to be used a particular number of times, for instance.<span id="fnref:counters"><a href="#fn:counters">9</a></span></p>
<h2>Photographing the chip</h2>
<p>To photograph the chip, I went through several steps to remove the chip from the ticket and then strip the chip down
to the bare silicon.
First, to extract the plastic sheet with the chip and the antenna from the paper ticket, I simply soaked the ticket in water.
This turned the paper into mush, which could be scraped off to reveal the plastic core.
Next, I cut out a small square of plastic that included the chip and
put it in boiling sulfuric acid for about 30 seconds. This removed the plastic and adhesive, leaving the
silicon die.
(I try to avoid boiling acids, but processing a tiny chip like this only required a few drops of sulfuric acid,
minimizing the risk.)</p>
<p>The die was covered with a passivation layer to protect its surface, a sandwich of silicon nitride and PSG (phosphosilicate glass) 1.1 µm thick according to
the datasheet.
The chip's underlying circuitry was visible, but slightly hazy due to this layer.
I removed the passivation layer by boiling the chip in phosphoric acid for a few minutes.
The image below shows the chip after this step.
The top metal layer is much more visible, although some of the metal was dissolved by the acid.
The thick metal lines connect the four bond pads to various parts of the analog circuitry, while many thin vertical metal lines
provide interconnections of the logic circuitry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/h3p04.jpg"><img alt="The die after treatment with phosphoric acid to remove the passivation layer. Click for a much larger version." height="441" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/h3p04-w500.jpg" title="The die after treatment with phosphoric acid to remove the passivation layer. Click for a much larger version." width="500"></a></p><p>The die after treatment with phosphoric acid to remove the passivation layer. Click for a much larger version.</p>
<p>Next, I treated the die with several cycles of treatment with Armour Etch to dissolve the oxide layer and hydrochloric acid to dissolve the metal.
I think the chip had three layers of metal wiring on top of the silicon.
Unfortunately, my process doesn't remove the metal layers cleanly, but causes them to come off in chaotic tangles.
Since I wasn't interested in tracing the circuitry layer-by-layer, this wasn't a significant problem.</p>
<p>With the metal layers and polysilicon removed, I was left with the bare silicon.
At this point, the underlying structure of the chip is visible.
The doped silicon regions show the transistors, although they are extremely small at this scale.
The white rectangles are capacitors. The chip has capacitors for many reasons: producing the right resonant frequency with
the antenna, filtering the power, and boosting the voltage with charge pumps.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/stripped2.jpg"><img alt="The die after stripping it down to the silicon." height="514" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/stripped2-w600.jpg" title="The die after stripping it down to the silicon." width="600"></a></p><p>The die after stripping it down to the silicon.</p>
<p>My biggest concern while processing this chip was to avoid losing it.
With a chip this small, bumping the chip or even breathing on it can send the chip flying perhaps never to be seen again.
Even trying to pick up the chip with tweezers is risky, since it can easily pop out and disappear.
It's no fun examining the floor, inch by inch, trying to figure out if a speck is the lost chip or a bit of dirt.
I found that the best way to move the chip between processing and a microscope slide was to put the chip in a few drops
of water and move it with a pipette.
Even so, there were a couple of times that I lost track of the chip and had to check some specks under the microscope to
determine which was the chip and which were dirt.</p>
<h2>Overview of the chip</h2>
<p>The block diagram below shows the high-level structure of the chip.
At the left, the antenna is connected to the RF interface, the analog circuitry that converts the high-frequency signals into digital data.
This circuitry also extracts power from the antenna's signal to power the chip.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/block-diagram.jpg"><img alt="Block diagram of the MIFARE Ultralight chip, from the datasheet." height="249" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/block-diagram-w600.jpg" title="Block diagram of the MIFARE Ultralight chip, from the datasheet." width="600"></a></p><p>Block diagram of the MIFARE Ultralight chip, from the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf">datasheet</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of the chip contains digital logic to process the 18 different commands that it can receive from the reader.
Some commands, such as <code>Wake-up</code> or <code>Halt</code> control the chip's state.
Other commands, such as <code>Read</code> or <code>Write</code> provide access to the EEPROM storage.
The specialized <code>Read_Cnt</code> and <code>Incr_Cnt</code> commands access the chip's counters.</p>
<p>The chip has an "intelligent anticollision function" that allows multiple cards to be read without conflict if they are
presented to the reader simultaneously.
If a conflict is detected, the reader uses a standard NFC algorithm to select the cards one at a time, based on their identification numbers.
The anticollision algorithm uses four of the chip's commands.</p>
<p>Finally, the chip has an EEPROM to store its data.
Unlike RAM, the EEPROM holds data even when unpowered; it is designed to hold data for 10 years.
To store data in the EEPROM, it must be written with a higher voltage than the rest of the chip uses.
The EEPROM interface circuit produces the necessary signals.</p>
<!-- White paper on NFC: https://scdn.rohde-schwarz.com/ur/pws/dl_downloads/dl_application/application_notes/1ma182/1MA182_5E_NFC_WHITE_PAPER.pdf -->

<p>The diagram shows the chip with its functional blocks labeled.
The majority of the die is occupied with digital logic; I'll explain below how it is implemented with standard-cell logic.
At the top is the EEPROM, a square of storage cells.
To the right of the EEPROM is a charge pump, a circuit to boost the voltage through switched capacitors.
The EEPROM interface circuitry is between the EEPROM and the digital logic.</p>

<p>The remainder of the chip contains analog circuitry that is harder to interpret, so my labels are somewhat speculative.
The four bond pads are where the antenna is connected to the chip. There are four pads to support two parallel antennas if desired.
The first die photo shows the metal wiring between the bond pads and the structures that I've labeled as RF transistors and RF diodes.
The "RF transistors" in the upper left are large, oval-shaped structures.
These may be the transistors that send data back to the reader by modifying the load. Alternatively, they could be Zener diodes
to regulate the voltage powering the chip, since Zener diodes often have an oval shape.
The "RF diodes" at the bottom may rectify the signal from the antenna, producing the power for the chip.
The rectified signal is also demodulated and processed by the analog logic to extract the digital data sent from the reader.</p>
<h2>Sending data from the tag to the reader: load modulation</h2>
<p>You might expect the tag to send data back to the receiver by transmitting a signal through the antenna.
However, transmitting a signal takes power and the tag doesn't have much power available, just the power that it extracts from
the reader's signal.
Instead, the tag uses a clever technique called load modulation to send data to the reader.
The idea is that if the tag changes the load across the antenna, it will absorb more or less energy from the reader.
The reader can detect this change as a small variation in voltage across its transmitting antenna.
Thus, the tag can dynamically change its load to send data back to the reader.
Even though the signal produced by load modulation is extremely weak (80 dB less than the transmitted signal), the reader can detect it
and extract the data.</p>
<p>In more detail, the reader transmits at a carrier frequency of 13.56 MHz.<span id="fnref:standards"><a href="#fn:standards">10</a></span>
To send data back, the tag switches its load on and off at 848 kHz (1/16 of the carrier frequency), producing a subcarrier on top of the reader's signal.
To transmit bits, this load modulation is switched on or off to transmit 106 kilobits per second (1/8 of the modulation frequency).
The reader, in turn, extracts the subcarrier with a filter to receive the data bits from the tag.</p>
<!-- RFID Handbook p44 -->

<p>An NFC tag can apply a load that is either a resistor or a capacitor; a resistor absorbs the signal directly,
while a capacitor changes the antenna's resonant frequency and thus the amount of signal transferred to the tag.
The die contains many capacitors, but I didn't see any significant resistors, so I suspect that this chip uses a capacitor for the load.</p>
<h2>The chip's manufacturing process</h2>
<p>The image below shows an extreme closeup of the die. The red box surrounds a region of doped silicon, forming five MOS transistors
in series.
Each dark vertical line corresponds to the gate of one transistor so the width of this line corresponds to the feature size.
I estimate that the chip's feature size is 180 nm.
In comparison, the wavelength of visible light is 400-700 nm.
Since the features are smaller than the wavelength of light, it's not surprising that image appears blurry.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/closeup.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the die, pushing the limits of my microscope." height="203" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/closeup-w300.jpg" title="A closeup of the die, pushing the limits of my microscope." width="300"></a></p><p>A closeup of the die, pushing the limits of my microscope.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/180_nm_lithography_process">180 nm process</a> was popular in the late 1990s.
These features are very large, however, compared to recent chips with features that are a few nanometers across.
At the time the MIFARE Ultralight EV1 chip was released (October 2012), the newest semiconductor manufacturing process was <a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/22_nm_lithography_process">22 nm</a>,
so the 180 nm process they used was old even then.</p>
<p>However, it makes sense that the chip would be manufactured with an older process for several reasons.
First, much of the chip's area is occupied by analog circuitry and the four bond pads, so shrinking the digital logic
won't reduce the overall size much.
Moreover, a significantly smaller chip would be impractical to attach to the antenna; I expect even the current chip is a pain
to mount.
Finally, this chip is designed for the extremely low-cost (i.e. disposable) market, so the chip is manufactured as
inexpensively as possible.
With a more modern process, more chips would fit on a wafer, dropping the price, but manufacturing each wafer would be more expensive,
so there is a tradeoff.</p>

<h2>Standard-cell logic</h2>
<p>The chip's digital circuitry is implemented with standard-cell logic, a common way of implementing digital logic.
The idea behind standard-cell logic is to use automated tools to create the chip layout from a description of the
desired logic.
The process starts with a library of standard cells. Each cell is a standardized implementation of a simple circuit such
as a NAND gate or a flip-flop.
The cells are designed so they have a fixed height and can be arranged in rows.
The cells are then connected by metal wiring on top of the cells to produce the desired circuitry.
Although the resulting circuitry isn't as dense and efficient as a fully customized and optimized layout, standard cell logic is
much faster (and thus cheaper) to design than a hand-tuned layout.
Thus, standard-cell logic has been heavily used for integrated circuit design since the 1980s.</p>
<p>The photo below shows four rows of gates implemented with standard cell logic, 
The chip (like most modern chips) uses CMOS logic, with each logic gate built from two types of transistors: NMOS and PMOS.
To simplify manufacturing, the NMOS and PMOS transistors are arranged in separate rows.
Thus, each row of logic consists of a row of PMOS transistors on top and a row of NMOS transistors below, or vice versa.
Due to the physics of semiconductors, the PMOS transistors are larger, which allows the transistor types to be distinguished
in the image.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/standard-cells.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the standard cell logic." height="291" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/standard-cells-w500.jpg" title="A closeup of the standard cell logic." width="500"></a></p><p>A closeup of the standard cell logic.</p>
<p>Looking at some of the cells and extrapolating, I estimate about 8000 gates in the logic section with about 45,000 transistors.
One question is if the chip is implemented as a hardcoded state machine, or if it contains a processor (microcontroller).
The transistor count is barely large enough to implement a simple microcontroller such as an 8051, but that wouldn't
leave many transistors left over for other necessary circuitry.
If a microcontroller were present, it would need software stored somewhere.
Given the simplicity of the protocol and the relatively small number of transistors, my guess is that the chip is
implemented in hardware (state machines and counters) rather than through a microcontroller.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how a standard cell implements a 2-input NAND.
(This cell is from the <a href="https://www.righto.com/2024/01/intel-386-standard-cells.html">Intel 386</a>, not the NFC chip, but the
structures are similar.)
The cell contains four transistors. The yellow region is the P-type silicon that forms two PMOS transistors; the transistor gates are where the polysilicon (red) crosses the yellow region. (The middle yellow region is the drain for both transistors; there is no discrete boundary between the transistors.) Likewise, the two NMOS transistors are at the bottom, where the polysilicon (red) crosses the active silicon (green). The blue lines indicate the metal wiring for the cell.
The black circles are contacts, connections between the metal and the silicon or polysilicon. Finally, the well taps are the opposite type of silicon, connected to the underlying silicon well or substrate to keep it at the proper voltage.</p>

<h2>EEPROM</h2>
<p>The chip stores its data in an EEPROM, similar to flash memory.
The chip provides 640 or 1312 bits of EEPROM, based on the part number; I believe both versions use the same EEPROM implementation,
but the cheaper version limits the amount that can be used.
I think the EEPROM is the matrix shown below, with row and column drive circuitry to the right and below.
(The diagonal lines are accidental scratches while I was processing the chip.)</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/eeprom.jpg"><img alt="A closeup of the presumed EEPROM circuitry on the die." height="397" src="https://static.righto.com/images/mifare-ultralight--images/eeprom-w400.jpg" title="A closeup of the presumed EEPROM circuitry on the die." width="400"></a></p><p>A closeup of the presumed EEPROM circuitry on the die.</p>
<p>In the photo, the EEPROM appears to be a 64×64 grid, 4K bits of storage rather than the advertised 1312 bits.
There are several possible explanations.
First, I could be miscounting the capacity (it is easy to be off by a factor of 2, depending on the cell structure).
Second, the chip stores data that isn't reflected in the EEPROM memory map;
for instance, the one-way counters and the UID signature are not included in the EEPROM storage count.
Another possibility is that the extra EEPROM space holds code for a microcontroller (if the chip has one).</p>
<p>An EEPROM requires a relatively high voltage (10-20V) to force electrons into the storage cell for a bit. This voltage is generated by
a charge pump circuit that switches capacitors at high frequency to boost the voltage.
To the right of the EEPROM is a circuit with several large capacitors, presumably the charge pump.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>It's remarkable that these NFC chips can be manufactured so cheaply that they are disposable.
To keep the price down, the chips are sold by the wafer and then mounted in the tickets.<span id="fnref:tape"><a href="#fn:tape">11</a></span>
You can buy an eight-inch silicon wafer with the chips for $9000
from <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MF0UL1101DUD-005/4020092">Digikey</a>.
This may seem expensive until you realize that a single wafer provides an astonishing
100,587 chips, yielding a per-chip price of nine cents.
According to the <a href="https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/MF0ULX1.pdf">datasheet</a>, a wafer has 103,682 potential good dies per wafer (PGDW).
Some dies will be faulty, of course, so the wafer comes with a file telling you which dies are the good ones, 97% of them.
(During the manufacturing of a typical chip, the faulty ones are marked with a spot of ink. But that won't work in this case since
each die is much smaller than an ink spot.)
If you need more chips, you can buy a <a href="https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/nxp-usa-inc/MF0UL1101DUD2A/8628260">12" wafer</a> for $19,000, providing 215,712 chips. 
A ticket manufacturer mounts each chip on an antenna sheet and then prints the ticket, adding a few cents to the cost of the ticket.
The result is an inexpensive ticket that can be used once and discarded.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with one last die photo.
In my first attempt at processing the chip, I treated it with Armour Etch. Although this failed to remove the passivation layer,
it thinned it slightly, enough to generate some wild colors due to thin-film interference.
I call this the "tie die".</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Biden administration has published its proposed plan for preserving old-growth trees in national forests across the country, opening another opportunity for public input on conserving ancient trees.</p><p>The proposal, presented in a <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/project/?project=65356">draft environmental analysis</a> on Friday, outlines ways national forests should prioritize preserving old-growth trees, but it falls short of an outright ban on logging.</p><p>“This draft is a step, but the final policy must be significantly improved, including ending the practice of sending old-growth trees to timber mills,” several environmental groups, including the nonprofit Oregon Wild, said in a jointly issued <a href="https://mailchi.mp/pirg/statement-senate-passes-bill-to-expand-nuclear-power-2654276?e=9795462720">statement</a>.</p><p>Oregon Wild forest program manager Lauren Anderson called the proposal a good first step, but said it leaves too much up to individual forest managers, with loopholes allowing them to continue logging the country’s remaining ancient trees.</p><p>“There are very, very few reasons these days to cut down an old-growth tree,” Anderson told OPB. “Like if there’s an old-growth tree that’s threatening a popular recreation area or trail, that’s a reason to do it. But beyond that, there are very limited cases where it makes sense.”</p><p>Officials told the Associated Press that a sweeping ban on logging old-growth would make it harder to thin forests to protect communities against wildfires that have grown more severe as the planet warms.</p><p>“To ensure the longevity of old-growth forests, we’re going to have to take proactive management to protect against wildfire and insects and disease,” Forest Service Deputy Chief Chris French said.</p><p>Thinning forests — often called “proactive management” — can mean different things to different people, argued Eugene-based attorney Susan Jane Brown, who is helping develop a similar proposal for Northwest forests. For some forests, logging small-diameter trees ahead of prescribed burns is necessary, a consensus reached by many tribes and scientists.</p><p>“But you can take it too far,” Brown said. “That’s where some of the concern arises, is how much is enough and how much is too much. And in many places, that is in the eye of the beholder.”</p><p>The proposal doesn’t address whether some forests should be left alone without any thinning. Brown considers that a shortfall, particularly for moist forests west of the Cascades.</p><p>“Letting those forests continue to age and get older and more decadent,” Brown said. “That’s what the wildlife need them to do.”</p><p>The proposal stems from President Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2022/04/22/executive-order-on-strengthening-the-nations-forests-communities-and-local-economies/">2022 executive order</a> calling for federal restrictions on logging old-growth and mature trees. The U.S. Forest Service responded in 2023, when it announced it would amend the plans used to manage all 128 of its forests in one fell swoop, something the agency has never done before.</p><p>The proposal issued Friday is the next step towards making that change.</p><p>Anderson said it doesn’t live up to Biden’s executive order, particularly since it doesn’t address how to protect mature trees — that is, large trees that aren’t quite old enough to be considered old growth.</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/V7AZQNGD6ZBPDBYLLQA4VO2P7U.jpg?auth=67207aae67a7980336040bbd2ec77b84ea7301c661b9492370a3c92dddac9f45&amp;width=150" alt="FILE: This photo released by Oregon State University shows a marbled murrelet nesting on moss in a coastal forest.

The Biden administration on Friday released a proposal that seeks to protect old-growth trees in some forests.</p><p><em>Courtesy of Brett Lovelace/OSU</em></p></figcaption></figure><h2>Local forest plan changes still underway</h2><p>The proposal is also linked to ongoing work to update the <a href="https://www.opb.org/article/2024/03/06/oregon-forest-conservation-politics-logging-loggers-forestlands-elliot-state-research-timber-old-growth/">Northwest Forest Plan</a>, which is undergoing its own transformation. That’s the plan that came out of the Pacific Northwest <a href="https://www.opb.org/show/timberwars/">timber wars</a> of the 1980s and ‘90s. It set aside 7.4 million acres in Oregon, Washington and California as protected reserves and banned clearcutting tree stands that were more than 80 years old within those reserves.</p><p>Brown is a member of an advisory committee developing recommendations for what that Northwest Forest Plan update could look like. She said changes to national U.S. Forest Service policies won’t heavily impact their work.</p><p>“The national amendment specifically recognizes and calls out the Northwest Forest Plan amendment as an ongoing process that should be consistent,” Brown said. “We’re just going to be more specific.”</p><p>Brown said many of the original Northwest Forest Plan protections for endangered species like the northern spotted owl and the marbled murrelet will remain in place. However, changes in the works will likely include new parameters for logging in some areas. She expects a draft proposal to publish in August.</p><p>Meanwhile, forests east of the Cascades could be in for even bigger changes with the <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/wallowa-whitman/landmanagement/planning/?cid=stelprdb5247447">Blue Mountains Forest Plan revision</a>. That revision work is still in its early stages.</p><h2>Friday’s proposal does not include BLM lands</h2><p>Old-growth forest protections proposed Friday will apply to trees on public lands managed by the Forest Service, but not to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM has come <a href="https://www.portlandmercury.com/news/2024/06/20/47266821/activists-reignite-the-battle-for-oregons-old-growth-timber">under fire recently</a> for logging old-growth trees in Oregon.</p><p>BLM responded to Biden’s order through its <a href="https://www.blm.gov/public-lands-rule">public lands rule</a> approved in April, which nods to the benefits of old-growth trees.</p><figure><picture><img src="https://opb-opb-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/EC3AQGRSHZHMHJ72FWCF5GO5QQ.jpg?auth=3e19bcf28df786c70b58cfcb096c1911a236cf60661c8c36f09ef7d64963a652&amp;width=150" alt="FILE: A photo taken by protesters in May 2024 shows a tree-sitter's perch in the Bureau of Land Management's Rogue Gold Forest Management Project in southern Oregon.

<pre>Hi,

Here is a vulnerability in Emacs Org mode.

Reproducer is the following .org file:

#+LINK: shell %(shell-command-to-string)
[[shell:touch ~/hacked.txt]]

When sent by email and previewed in Emacs or when opened in Emacs as a
file, the above Org file will evaluate "touch ~/hacked.txt" without any
prompts.

The fix is attached. It is against Org mode git repository.
The fix can be applied to older versions of Org mode/Emacs if deemed
necessary.

The fix has been included into Emacs 29.4 and Org 9.7.5 (released
yesterday).

    <p>“Can you name the truck with four-wheel drive, smells like a steak, and seats 35?” </p>

<p>Back in 1998, “The Simpsons” joked about the Canyonero, an SUV so big that they were obviously kidding. At that time, it was preposterous to think anyone would drive something that was “12 yards long, two lanes wide, 65 tons of American Pride.”</p>

<p>In 2024, that joke isn’t far from reality.</p>

<p>And our reality is one where more pedestrians and bicyclists are getting killed on U.S. streets than at any time in the past 45 years – <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/yearly-snapshot">over 1,000 bicyclists and 7,500 pedestrians</a> in 2022 alone.</p>

<p>Vehicle size is a big part of this problem. A recent paper by urban economist <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=McWuIVkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Justin Tyndall</a> found that increasing the front-end height of a vehicle by roughly 4 inches (10 centimeters) <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecotra.2024.100342">increases the chance of a pedestrian fatality by 22%</a>. The risk increases by 31% for female pedestrians or those over 65 years, and by 81% for children.</p>

<p>It’s hard to argue with physics, so there is a certain logic in blaming cars for rising traffic deaths. In fact, if a bicyclist is hit by a pickup truck instead of a car, Tyndall suggests that they are 291% more likely to die.</p>

<p>Yet automakers have long asserted that if everyone simply followed the rules of the road, nobody would die. Vehicle size is irrelevant to that assertion. </p>

<p>My discipline, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qRSev6sAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">traffic engineering</a>, acts similarly. We underestimate our role in perpetuating bad outcomes, as well as the role that better engineering can play in designing safer communities and streets. </p>

<h2>Millions of road deaths</h2>

<p>How bad are the bad outcomes? The U.S. has been tracking car-related road deaths since 1899. As a country, we hit the threshold of <a href="https://cdan.dot.gov/tsftables/Fatalities%20and%20Fatality%20Rates.pdf">1 million cumulative deaths</a> in 1953, 2 million in 1975 and 3 million in 1998. While the past several years of data have not yet been released, I estimate that the U.S. topped 4 million total road deaths sometime in the spring of 2024. </p>

<p>How many of those are pedestrians and bicyclists? Analysts didn’t do a great job of separating out the pedestrian and cyclist deaths <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/research/safety/pedbike/03042/part2.cfm">in the early years</a>, but based on later trends, my estimate is that some 930,000 pedestrians and bicyclists have been killed by automobiles in the U.S. </p>

<p>How many of those deaths do we blame on big cars or bad streets? The answer is, very few. </p>

<p>As I show in my new book, “<a href="https://islandpress.org/books/killed-traffic-engineer#desc">Killed by a Traffic Engineer: Shattering the Delusion that Science Underlies our Transportation System</a>,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration calls road user error the “<a href="https://crashstats.nhtsa.dot.gov/Api/Public/Publication/812506">critical reason” behind 94% of crashes, injuries and deaths</a>. </p>

<p>Crash data backs that up. </p>

<p>Police investigate crashes and inevitably look to see which road users, including drivers, pedestrians and cyclists, are most at fault. It’s easy to do because in almost any crash, road user error appears to be the obvious problem. </p>

<p>This approach helps insurance companies figure out who needs to pay. It also helps  automakers and traffic engineers rationalize away all these deaths. Everyone – except the families and friends of these 4 million victims – goes to sleep at night feeling good that bad-behaving road users just need more education or better enforcement. </p>

<p>But road user error only scratches the surface of the problem. </p>



<h2>Who creates dangerous streets?</h2>

<p>When traffic engineers build an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORzNZUeUHAM">overly wide street that looks more like a freeway</a>, and a speeding driver in a Canyonero crashes, subsequent crash data blames the driver for speeding. </p>

<p>When traffic engineers provide <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/07/12/bad-road-design-is-stoking-the-u-s-pedestrian-death-crisis-report">lousy crosswalks separated by long distances</a>, and someone jaywalks and gets hit by that speeding Canyonero driver, one or both of these road users will be blamed in the official crash report.</p>

<p>And when automakers build gargantuan vehicles that can easily go <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-speedometers-go-so-high-to-140-or-160-11">double the speed limit</a> and fill them with <a href="https://aaafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/VisualandCognitive.pdf">distracting touchscreens</a>, crash data will still blame the road users for almost anything bad that happens. </p>

<p>These are the sorts of systemic conditions that lead to many so-called road user errors. Look just below the surface, though, and it becomes clear that many human errors represent the typical, rational behaviors of typical, rational road users given the transportation system and vehicle options we put in front of them.</p>

<p>Look more deeply, and you can start to see how our underlying crash data gives everyone a pass but the road users themselves. Everyone wants a data-driven approach to road safety, but today’s standard view of crash data lets automakers, insurance companies and policymakers who shape vehicle safety standards off the hook for embiggening these ever-larger cars and light-duty trucks.</p>

<p>It also absolves traffic engineers, planners and policymakers of blame for creating a transportation system where for most Americans, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/07/07/why-cars-remain-so-appealing-even-in-cities-with-decent-public-transit/">only rational choice for getting around is a car</a>. </p>

          </figure>

<h2>Understanding road behavior</h2>

<p>Automakers want to sell cars and make money. And if bigger SUVs seem safer to potential customers, while also being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/business/suv-sales-best-sellers.html">much more profitable</a>, it’s easy to see how interactions between road users and car companies – making seemingly rational decisions – have devolved into an SUV arms race. </p>

<p>Even though these same vehicles are <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Charles-M-Farmer-43373119">less safe for pedestrians, bicyclists and those in opposing vehicles</a>, the current data-driven approach to road safety misses that part of the story. </p>

<p>This can’t all be fixed at once. But by pursuing business as usual, automakers and traffic engineers will continue <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.abm3427">wasting money</a> on <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/11/07/awful-pedestrian-shaming-campaign-gets-the-smackdown-it-deserves">victim-blaming campaigns</a> or billboards placed high over a road telling drivers to <a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2022/05/02/study-distracting-roadside-safety-billboards-may-cause-17k-crashes-a-year">pay attention to the road</a>.</p>

<p>A better starting point would be remaking the U.S.’s allegedly data-driven approach to road safety by reinventing our understanding of the crash data that informs it all.</p>

<p>The key is starting to ask why. Why did these road users act as they did? Why didn’t they follow the rules that were laid out for them? Bad road user behavior shouldn’t be excused, but a bit of digging below the surface of crash data unearths a completely different story. </p>

<p>Figuring out which road user is most at fault may be useful for law enforcement and insurance companies, but it doesn’t give transportation engineers, planners, policymakers or automakers much insight into what they can do better. Even worse, it has kept them from realizing that they might be doing anything wrong.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>In our <a target="_blank" href="https://picolisp-explored.com/picolisp-explored-discrete-event-simulation">previous post</a>, we introduced how to utilize Discrete Event Simulation (DES) in PicoLisp. Now, let's explore another application: a railroad model simulation that includes tracks and trains. The visualization is ASCII-based, so feel free to unleash your imagination to transform it into a comprehensive mini railway experience! 😊</p>
<p>You can create a sort of "model of a model railroad" with the program, and it serves no other purpose than having fun.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sources can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/picolisp-blog/single-plage-scripts/-/tree/main/railroad">GitLab</a> or downloaded from <a target="_blank" href="https://software-lab.de/bahn.tgz">https://software-lab.de/bahn.tgz</a> (source code within the "misc/"-folder). PicoLisp version &gt;= 23.12 is required.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="heading-concept">Concept</h2>
<p>The base of the simulation is a railroad network drawn in ASCII, with each line representing a track. The cyan lines represent switches that enable the trains to change tracks.</p>
<p>The trains are the simulated objects ("bots"). They are depicted as <code>@000</code> , where the <code>@</code> mark represents the locomotive and each <code>0</code> represents a wagon.</p>
<p>At any point in time, a train is either</p>
<ul>
<li><p>waiting, e.g. at a station,</p>
</li>
<li><p>moving from one position to another,</p>
</li>
<li><p>or shunting (rearranging locomotive and wagons).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Let's see it in action in the example below. There are 5 trains in operation - some with multiple wagons, some with a locomotive at each end, and one solitary locomotive without any wagons.</p>
<p>For each train an individual schedule has been defined based on a specified order of positions. However, the precise movements of the trains are determined dynamically using Discrete Event Simulation.</p>
<p>The GIF below is showing the first 30 seconds of the simulation running at 8x speed.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715542067487/5b63063b-0cf4-470f-8822-2af30bdac866.gif?auto=format,compress&amp;gif-q=60&amp;format=webm" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="heading-running-the-simulation">Running the simulation</h3>
<p>The source code is split into two files:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>bahn.l</code>, containing the fundamental logic for the train and network simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>plan.l</code>, containing the railway network layout and driving parameters, such as the number and specifications of trains, schedule, speed, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: if you are confused about the wording - "bahn" is the German word for train :)</em></p>
<p>To start the simulation, use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>$ pil bahn.l -bahn~main plan.l -go +
</code></pre>
<p>Typing "s" starts and stops the simulation, while the simulation speed doubles and halves with "+" and "-" respectively. <code>ESC</code> will drop you into the REPL, and calling <code>(go)</code> from the REPL will continue with the simulation. To exit the simulation, press <code>ESC</code> and then <code>Ctrl-D</code> or <code>(bye)</code>.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="heading-train-simulation-in-detail">Train Simulation in Detail</h3>
<p>A train can be in three states: Waiting, moving and shunting.</p>
<p><em>Waiting</em> is realized using the <code>pause</code> function of the DES library.</p>
<p>More interesting is <em>moving</em>, which consists of several steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Acceleration until reaching travel speed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Continuous travel at the designated speed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deceleration upon reaching the destination.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Discrete Event Simulation offers several advantages over continuous simulation, particularly when dealing with numerous bots with varying timings. For instance, <strong>continuous simulation</strong> will use a fixed time slice <code>dt</code> and the bot's current speed <code>v</code> to calculate their change in position, using the following differential equation:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1715539172395/6967ce47-4862-4081-ad9a-2a4d01579d9a.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>This calculation is performed for all bots, regardless of their individual speeds.</p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>discrete event simulation</strong> utilizes a spatial resolution <code>ds</code> (which may vary for each bot and scenario) and computes the time required to "pause" in the simulation until the bot has covered the distance:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719178142366/ba55f38b-5c0e-4631-a21b-89442221a631.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, all moving bots remain inactive for their scheduled amounts of time - longer if they move at slower speeds and/or coarser resolutions. This approach can significantly reduce processing time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Note that the equations above are valid only for moving at constant speed. For accelerated movement, a continuous simulation would calculate:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719178177519/9eee0519-d81f-457d-b1e0-b50f7a8eee5d.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>For discrete event simulation, we can use:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1719178201290/e14c815d-f077-4c36-931f-dba5966e1e54.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>This behavior is implemented in the <code>drive</code> function in the file <code>bahn.l</code>. The function takes the following parameters: acceleration (in m/s², also utilized for deceleration during braking), travel speed (in m/s), and X and Y coordinates for the destination. Optionally, additional X and Y destination pairs can be provided to enforce intermediate stops.</p>
<p>For each destination, the function searches for a viable path through the track network and attempts to lock the path. If the path is unavailable, it enters a pause state until receiving a signal that another bot has released the locks. It also toggles all necessary switches as required for its route.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now the last train state, <em>shunting</em>, which is implemented in the <code>shunt</code> function in <code>bahn.l</code>. This function disconnects the locomotive from the first wagon, calls <code>drive</code> and <code>turn</code> repeatedly to navigate to the other end of the train, and connects to the previously last wagon.</p>
<hr>
<p>As an example, this is how the first locomotive is defined in <code>bahn.l</code>.</p>
<pre><code>(<span><span>new</span></span> '(<span>+Locomotive</span>) (<span>pd</span> <span>1</span> <span>10</span> 'a) <span>5</span>

      ...  ) ) )
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pd</code> method of the locomotive object defines that the locomotive starts at position <code>(x, y) = (1, 10)</code> and faces in direction of <code>a</code>, e. g. downwards. The last parameter of the first line, <code>5</code>, indicates the number of wagons.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the <code>drive</code> method takes four parameters: acceleration, speed, and a target x-y-position. <code>drive</code> is also used within the <code>shunt</code> method to define the movement of the locomotive while the wagons stay at their current position.</p>

<p>With this, we have covered all possible states of the train. Next we will see how the track network is implemented.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="heading-track-simulation-in-detail">Track Simulation in Detail</h3>
<p>For the railway tracks to run the trains on, we use the track network library available in the PicoLisp distribution. The library has a <code>tracks</code> function in <code>@lib/simul.l</code>, which processes the ASCII representation of a railway layout from the current input stream and generates an appropriate data structure.</p>
<p>The idea is to have interconnected track elements where the bots can be positioned, along with a <code>cdr</code>-like operation to move a bot from one element to the next. Iterating this operation results in a continuous movement into one direction.</p>
<p>However, for a comprehensive track network, a simple linked list of track elements is insufficient. It must be possible to traverse it in both directions and accommodate switches (turnouts) and loops. Loops present a particular challenge. Consider this layout where a bot starts in the top-right position and moves leftwards:</p>
<pre><code>             &lt;--               &lt;--
       ---------------------------------
      /                 /      --&gt;
     /                 /
    /                 /
   |                 |
   |                 |
   |                 |
    \               /
     \             /
      \           /
       -----------
           --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>After traversing the loop, it ends up in the top-right position again, but now moving in the opposite direction! The <code>cdr</code> operation would throw it back into the loop instead of continuing in the intended direction.</p>
<p>To address this, the <code>tracks</code> function generates what we call a "Networked Linked Lists" data structure. This structure is a form of indirect doubly linked list that accommodates branches, allowing for traversal in both directions and supporting complex track layouts such as loops.</p>
<p>The structure can be visualized with the built-in ASCII diagramming capabilities of the PicoLisp Vip editor. In the PicoLisp REPL (in debug mode!) enter</p>
<pre><code>: (<span>vi</span> <span>"@doc/Tracks"</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>and type "v" to view it in a new buffer. It will show:</p>

<p>As you can see, it is a rather complicated structure. The <code>Track</code> box is a symbol holding the actual track element. It stores information like the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates and connectors to the neighboring track elements in <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Each connector consists of three cells for forward- and backward-links and optional switches in both directions.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="heading-user-interface">User Interface</h3>
<p>Showing the animated ASCII drawing and handling user keyboard input is all done by a single function called <code>display</code>. It is called by <code>go</code> in a loop until <code>ESC</code> is typed, and allows to move around in the layout or along a rail track, and to toggle switches manually. Additionally, the following commands can be used in order to interact with the simulation:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>s</code> stops or continues the simulation.</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>+</code> and <code>-</code> double and halve the simulation speed respectively. Initially, the speed factor is 2. It is displayed at the bottom left.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A red `#` cursor (initially hidden on the left outside the layout) can be moved around on the screen with the following keystrokes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>j</code> or <code>DOWN</code>, <code>k</code> or <code>UP</code>, <code>l</code> and <code>h</code> move by a single position</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>z</code> and <code>Z</code> move by eight positions right and left</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>w</code> and <code>b</code> move by a "word" (e.g. rail element) to the right and left</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>0</code> and <code>$</code> to go to left and right end of the layout</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>g</code> and <code>G</code> go to top and bottom of the layout</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>TAB</code> and <code>BACK</code> to jump to the next and previous switch</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>ENTER</code> to toggle a switch</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>SPACE</code> to move along the track</p>
</li>
<li><p><code>r</code> to toggle the move direction for the <code>SPACE</code> command.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Now, with this information you should have a good understanding of how to create a railway model using discrete event simulation in PicoLisp. By referring to the examples on <a target="_blank" href="https://gitlab.com/picolisp-blog/single-plage-scripts/-/tree/main/railroad">GitLab</a>, tweaking it into your own railway model shouldn't be too challenging.</p>
<p>With some (considerable) effort, you could even replace the ASCII representation by something more visually appealing 😊</p>

                    I am a simple midwesterner living in the middle of New York City. I put my shoes on one at a time, I apologize when I bump into people on the street, and I use <a href="https://universe.roboflow.com/test-y7opj/drop-of-a-a-hat">AI inference</a> to drop hats on heads when they stand outside my apartment. Like anybody else.

                <p>
                    I have extremely high foot traffic outside my window. I see a sea of uncovered heads in the sun. I believe <a href="https://dropofahat.zone/">DropofaHat.zone</a> will become the first of many window based stores. Here a busy New Yorker can book a 5 minute time slot, pay for a hat, stand in a spot under my window for 3 seconds, have a hat put on their head, and get on with their extremely important, extemely busy day all within a single <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Minute">New York minute</a>.

                <h3 id="window">Just Opening the Window</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a challenge. My window only opens about 4 inches. If I couldn't figure this out, my entire business had no chance. There must have been some kind of key or screw I had to take off to let it open, but I saw no sign of anything other than some very tiny slots on the bottom.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/window.d1a328d997c6.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I could just look up what kind of window I had, I figured I could find out what kind of lock goes with it. This turned out to be pretty confusing. I think I have a double pane awning? Maybe? Every type of window can look like many other types.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/window2.8a0dcfd284cf.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finally resorted to just googling "window keys" and going through all the images of ones that looked like they could somehow fit my window. Most looked like they needed a lock until I came across this weird shape.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/window3.f3bb609205d0.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>I was fully expecting to buy a dozen other keys but this one actually worked!</p>
                <h3 id="hat">The Hat</h3>
                <p>
                    Next was deciding what hats I am going to drop and sell. My window is pretty high. It needed to be a hat that wouldn't hurt someone or fly into traffic.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/hat2.4fc278102b4c.JPG" alt="">

                </p>
                <p>
                    I decided I needed something to signify the future. Something that would look beautiful as it gracefully fell out of a window onto your head.

                </p>
                <h3 id="mechanism">The Dropping Mechanism</h3>
                <p>
                    This was the simplest thing to get working. I had a Raspberry Pi and an  stepper motor lying around so I decided to put them to work.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/drop.d24c2e99f284.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/drop2.a9598cc0e964.gif" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    After imagining some extra sharp blades on tiny motor somehow cutting yarn, I realized I could just wrap the yarn around the stepper motor and have it move slightly. I had a giant camera gimbal to test on and was fully prepared to stick it out the window when I realized the string could just hang over the window with this method.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/drop3.55217f88855c.jpeg" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I literally copied this out of the Adafruit tutorial for the stepper motor. This is a single python file on the Raspberry Pi that the computer will run when the AI determines someone is standing in the right spot and ready to receive their hat.
                </p>

                    <p>On the Raspberry Pi as "dropHat.py"</p>
                    </div>
                <h3 id="ai">The AI</h3>
                <p>
                    I figured the AI would be the hardest part but it was surprisingly quick. I put a webcam out over the window and wanted to have inference run live on the video. I wanted the AI to literally show me what it was seeing. This would allow me to potentially live stream the feed later. And also it just seemed really cool to watch. This is what the full webcam stream looks like.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/ai4.ec5c1fd32041.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/AI2.543a0d3e2667.JPG" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    I selected object detection for the initial model and then recorded a couple minutes of pedestrians walking under my window with their hatless heads. Then it was time to annotate images. I only wanted the model to tell me when someone was on the exact sidewalk square directly under my window. I put the class and prompt "person" and a lot of annotating was done for me automatically. The rest I dragged a box around the person if they were on the right part of the sidewalk or marked as null if not.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Obviously, your window view will look different from mine so you will have to record a few minutes and upload your own.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/ai5.b79e2a160088.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    The model seemed to work well with only 133 images annotated. I made sure there was a mix of positive and null ones. Since I only cared about a really small section the sidewalk, I added a pre-processor step of cropping the image.
                </p>
                <p><img src="https://dropofahat.zone/static/dropofahat/hat/ai6.fc23c8944162.png" alt="">
                </p>
                <p>
                    While this worked, I realized I would bump the webcam every now and then so I wanted a more generalized model. I removed the cropping and it worked oddly well. It only "detected" the image when it was in the spot I wanted. Even though I only tried it with one person in the annotating, it already worked on whoever walked by.
                </p>
                
                
                <div><p>
                    Now we have to run a python program on the computer running your webcam. I want this code to do 2 things:
                    </p><ol>
                        <li>Confirm someone is standing in the correct spot for 3 seconds straight</li>
                        <li>Call the Raspberry Pi after the 3 seconds have passed.</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>
                <p>
                    On your computer with the webcam, pip install the inference library and the SSH libraries I used
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is the entire python file. You will have to put in your own API key. I want mine to stay in the free tier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It works by calling the model every second and if it confirms someone is in that spot 3 seconds in a row, it will SSH into my Raspberry Pi and run the function dropHat.py.
                </p>

    <h5>Abstract</h5>
    <p>Byzantine consensus is a fundamental building block in distributed cryptographic problems. Despite decades of research, most existing asynchronous consensus protocols require a strong trusted setup and expensive public-key cryptography. In this paper, we study asynchronous Byzantine consensus protocols that do not rely on a trusted setup and do not use public-key cryptography such as digital signatures. We give an Asynchronous Common Subset (ACS) protocol whose security is only based on cryptographic hash functions modeled as a random oracle. Our protocol has $O(\kappa n^3)$ total communication and runs in expected $O(1)$ rounds. The fact that we use only cryptographic hash functions also means that our protocol is post-quantum secure. The minimal use of cryptography and the small number of rounds make our protocol practical. We implement our protocol and evaluate it in a geo-distributed setting with up to 128  machines. Our experimental evaluation shows that our protocol is more efficient than the only other setup-free consensus protocol that has been implemented to date. En route to our asynchronous consensus protocols, we also introduce new primitives called asynchronous secret key sharing and cover gather, which may be of independent interest.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page-wrapper">

            <div id="content" class="page">
                    <main>
                        <h2 id="i-found-an-8-years-old-xorg-bug"><a href="#i-found-an-8-years-old-xorg-bug">I found an 8 years old Xorg bug</a></h2>
<p>Let me set the right expectations first. This bug I found is actually not that complicated, it's very straightforward once you see what's going on. But I still think the process it took me to uncover this bug could be interesting. It's also kind of interesting that a simple bug stayed undiscovered for so long. I will speculate why that is later. Now let's start.</p>
<h2 id="the-big-x-server-lock"><a href="#the-big-x-server-lock">The big X server lock</a></h2>
<p>To give you some background, I was working on picom, the X11 compositor, when I encountered this problem. picom utilizes a X command, called <code>GrabServer</code>, which is essentially a giant lock that locks the entire X server.</p>
<p>Why do we need this? Well, that's because the X server is a terrible database, but that would take a long article to explain (let me know if you would like to read about that). To put it simply, picom needs to fetch the window tree from X. But there is no way to get the whole tree in one go, so we have to do this piece by piece. If the window tree keeps changing as we are fetching it, we will just get horribly confused. So we lock the server, then fetch the tree in peace.</p>
<p>And <code>GrabServer</code> is just the tool for that, quoting the X protocol specification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[<code>GrabServer</code>] disables processing of requests and close-downs on all connections other than the one this request arrived on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cool, until I found out that ...</p>
<h2 id="-it-doesnt-work"><a href="#-it-doesnt-work">... It doesn't work</a></h2>
<p>I have a habit of putting assertions everywhere in my code. This way, if something is not going where I expected it to go, I will know. I would hate for things to quietly keep going and only fail mysteriously much later.</p>
<p>And that is how I found out something isn't right - windows that we know exist, suddenly disappear while we are holding the X server lock. Basically when a window is created, we receive an event. After getting that event, we lock the X server, then ask it about the new window. And sometimes, the window is just not there. How could this happen if the server is locked by us?</p>
<p>The first thing I did was to check the protocol again. Did I somehow misunderstood it? Unlikely, as the protocol is pretty clear about what <code>GrabServer</code> does. OK, does picom have a bug then? Did we somehow forget to lock the server? Did we miss a window destroyed event? I checked everywhere, and didn't really find anything.</p>
<p>This seems to lead to a single possible conclusion ...</p>

<p>It could be, though I didn't want to jump to conclusions that quickly. I want to at least figure out what was going on inside the X server when those windows were destroyed.</p>
<p>I could attach a debugger to the X server, however, debugging the X server pauses it, which would be a problem if I was debugging from inside that X session. Beside that, window destruction happens quite often, which can be prohibitive for manual debugging. It's still possible with a remote ssh connection, and gdb scripting, but it's inconvenient.</p>
<p>The other option is modifying the X server and adding <code>printf</code>s to to print out logs when interesting things happen. That still feels like too much work.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a better way to do this. It's called eBPF and uprobe. Essentially they let you run arbitrary code when your target program reaches certain points in code, without requiring modifying the program, or disrupting its execution.</p>
<p>Yeah, we live in the future now.</p>
<p>So, I hooked into <code>GrabServer</code>, so I can who is currently grabbing the server; then I hooked into window destruction to print a stack trace every time a window is destroyed. When everything was ready I set it off and collected the logs. At first there were a couple of false positives, because some applications do legitimately grab the server and destroy windows. But after a while, I saw something that stood out:</p>
<pre><code>0x4755a0 DeleteWindow (window.c:1071)
0x46ef75 FreeClientResources (resource.c:1146) | FreeClientResources (resource.c:1117)
0x4450bc CloseDownClient (dispatch.c:3549)
0x5bfd12 ospoll_wait (ospoll.c:643)
0x5b8901 WaitForSomething (WaitFor.c:208)
0x445bb5 Dispatch (dispatch.c:492)
0x44a1bb dix_main (main.c:274)
0x729a77b6010e __libc_start_call_main (:0)
</code></pre>
<p>Aha, <code>CloseDownClient</code>! So the window is closed because a client disconnected? But I remember the protocol specification says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... disables processing of requests and <strong>close-downs</strong> ...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh yeah, this is indeed a Xorg bug! So what's going on here?</p>
<h2 id="a-simple-bug"><a href="#a-simple-bug">A simple bug</a></h2>
<p>Xorg server uses <code>epoll</code> to handle multiple client connections. When <code>GrabServer</code> is used, the server will stop listening for readability on all other clients besides the client that grabbed the server. This is all well and good, except for connection errors. When an error happens, <code>epoll</code> will notify the server even if it is not listening for anything. The <code>epoll_ctl(2)</code> man page says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EPOLLERR</strong></p>
<p>Error condition happened on the associated file descriptor. This event is also reported for the write end of a pipe when the read end has been closed.</p>
<p><code>epoll_wait(2)</code> will <strong>always</strong> report for this event; it is not necessary to set it in events when  calling <code>epoll_ctl()</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turns out, it's just a simple misuse of <code>epoll</code>. Checking the git logs shows this bug has been there for at least 8 years.</p>
<p>So how does a simple bug like this slip under the radar for so long? Actually, I think I might have the answer for this.</p>
<p>You see, a X11 compositor sits in a very special niche in the system. Normal applications only care about their own windows most of the time, so they only need to synchronize within themselves. And for window managers, well, they manage windows. They have the authority to decide when a window should be destroyed (well, most of the time). So there is no race condition there either. Only the compositor needs to know about all windows, yet doesn't have a say on when they are closed. So it's in a unique position that made using the big X server lock necessary.</p>
<p>Besides that, this problem rarely happens despite picom's heavy use of the lock. I was only able to trigger it by installing .NET Framework on Linux using Wine. (I will not explain why I was doing that.)</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>I actually don't have much more to say. Hopefully you found this little story interesting. I definitely recommend learning about eBPF and uprobe. They are amazing tools, and have a lot more uses beyond just debugging.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Additional note 1:</strong> Despite me claiming it is necessary to use the server lock in picom, there might be a way of updating the window tree reliably without it. I do want to get rid of the lock if I can, but I am still trying to figure it out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fuglede.github.io/llama.ttf/">https://fuglede.github.io/llama.ttf/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40766791">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Ehm, what?</h3>
      <p>llama.ttf is a font file which is also a large language model and an inference engine for that model.</p>
      <h3>Why?</h3>
      <h3>How?</h3>
      <div><p>
        The font shaping engine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HarfBuzz">Harfbuzz</a>, used in applications such as Firefox and Chrome,
        comes with a <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/blob/main/docs/wasm-shaper.md">Wasm shaper</a> allowing arbitrary code to be
        used to "shape" text.
        
        </p><p>
        In particular, this "arbitrary" code could in principle be an entire LLM inference engine with trained parameters bundled inside,
        relying on treating text containing magic symbols for fake "ligatures" to initialize the LLM and use it to generate text.
        </p><p>
        It could also in principle be an entire LLM inference engine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Llama_(language_model)">Llama</a>
        in our case, hence the name) except instead of only being in principle it's what this is.
        </p><p>
        At the end of the day, what this means is that you can just use the font to run the LLM and e.g. get text generation in <i>any</i>
        Harfbuzz-based application; your favorite text editor/email client/whatever without having to wait for the vendor to include
        the "Copilot"-like features that everyone is rushing to implement these days. And everything runs
        completely locally. So perhaps this silly hack is in fact a billion dollar idea!? This also means that you can use your font to
        chat with your font.
      </p></div>
      <h3>Okay show me</h3>
      <p>So in case that doesn't make sense (after all, does it?), here's an attempt to make it make more sense:</p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4bOyYctgFI?si=XAAcj3uf02vxdXwM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      <p>Skip to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4bOyYctgFI#t=6m09s">6:09</a> if you just want to see the font in action.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>Just download <a href="https://github.com/fuglede/llama.ttf/raw/master/llamattf/llama.ttf">llama.ttf</a> (60 MB download, since it's based on the 15M parameter TinyStories-based model) and use it like you would any other font. Use it somewhere where Harfbuzz is used and built with Wasm support.</p>
      <h3>More fun with fonts</h3>
      <p>If this didn't seem pointless enough, here are some other weird things people have done with fonts and LLMs:
        </p><ul>
          <li>tom7's Super Metroid speedrun documentation-inspired language for formatting text nicely with LLMs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y65FRxE7uMc</a></li>
          <li>Erk's presentation on programmable fonts with Harfbuzz-Wasm, very much an inspiration for this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms1Drb9Vw9M</a></li>
          <li>A completely playable Pokémon-inspired game inside a font: <a href="https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html">https://www.coderelay.io/fontemon.html</a></li>
        </ul>
