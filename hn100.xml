<p dir="auto">Dropflow is a CSS layout engine created to explore the reaches of the foundational CSS standards (that is: inlines, blocks, floats, positioning and eventually tables, but not flexbox or grid). It has a high quality text layout implementation and is capable of displaying many of the languages of the world. You can use it to generate PDFs or images on the backend with Node and <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas">node-canvas</a> or render rich, wrapped text to a canvas in the browser.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Supports over 30 properties including complex ones like <code>float</code></li>
<li>Bidirectional and RTL text</li>
<li>Hyperscript (<code>h()</code>) API with styles as objects in addition to accepting HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Any OpenType/TrueType buffer can (and must) be registered</li>
<li>Font fallbacks at the grapheme level</li>
<li>Colored diacritics</li>
<li>Desirable line breaking (e.g. carries starting padding to the next line)</li>
<li>Optimized shaping</li>
<li>Inherited and cascaded styles are never calculated twice</li>
<li>Handles as many CSS layout edge cases as I can find</li>
<li>Fully typed</li>
<li>Lots of tests</li>
<li>Fast</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Supported CSS rules</h2><a id="user-content-supported-css-rules" aria-label="Permalink: Supported CSS rules" href="#supported-css-rules"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Following are rules that work or will work soon. Shorthand properties are not listed. If you see all components of a shorthand (for example, <code>border-style</code>, <code>border-width</code>, <code>border-color</code>) then the shorthand is assumed to be supported (for example <code>border</code>).</p>

<p dir="auto">The fastest performance can be achieved by using the hyperscript API, which creates a DOM directly and skips the typical HTML and CSS parsing steps. Take care to re-use style objects to get the most benefits. Reflows at different widths are faster than recreating the layout tree.</p>

<p dir="auto">Generates a box tree for the element tree. Box trees roughly correspond to DOM trees, but usually have more boxes (like for anonymous text content between block-level elements (<code>div</code>s)) and sometimes fewer (like for <code>display: none</code>).</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>BlockContainer</code> has a <code>repr()</code> method for logging the tree.</p>
<p dir="auto">Hold on to the return value so you can lay it out many times in different sizes, paint it or don't paint it if it's off-screen, or get intrinsics to build a higher-level logical layout (for example, spreadsheet column or row size even if the content is off screen).</p>

<p dir="auto">Position boxes and split text into lines so the layout tree is ready to paint. Can be called over and over with a different viewport size.</p>
<p dir="auto">In more detail, layout involves:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Margin collapsing for block boxes</li>
<li>Passing text to HarfBuzz, iterating font fallbacks, wrapping, reshaping depending on break points</li>
<li>Float placement and <code>clear</code>ing</li>
<li>Positioning shaped text spans and backgrounds according to <code>direction</code> and text direction</li>
<li>Second and third pass layouts for intrinsics of <code>float</code>, <code>inline-block</code>, and <code>absolute</code>s</li>
<li>Post-layout positioning (<code>position</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Paint</h2><a id="user-content-paint" aria-label="Permalink: Paint" href="#paint"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This step paints the layout to a target. Painting can be done as many times as needed (for example, every time you clear and render all of your scene to the canvas).</p>
<p dir="auto">Canvas is currently the only seriously supported target, but other targets will be added, like pdf.js and SVG. There is also a toy HTML target that was used early on in development, and kept around for fun.</p>

<p dir="auto">Paint to HTML! Yes, this API can actually be used to go from HTML to HTML. It generates a flat list of a bunch of absolutely positioned elements. Probably don't use this, but it can be useful in development and is amusing.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other</h2><a id="user-content-other" aria-label="Permalink: Other" href="#other"></a></p>

<p dir="auto">Returns the inline size in CSS pixels taken up by the layout, not including empty space after lines or the effect of any <code>width</code> properties. <code>layout</code> must be called before this.</p>
<p dir="auto">The intended usage is this: after laying out text into a desired size, use <code>staticLayoutContribution</code> to get the size without any remaining empty space at the end of the lines, then <code>layout</code> again into that size to get a tightly fitting layout.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">HarfBuzz</h2><a id="user-content-harfbuzz" aria-label="Permalink: HarfBuzz" href="#harfbuzz"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Glyph layout is performed by <a href="https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz">HarfBuzz</a> compiled to WebAssembly. This allows for a level of correctness that isn't possible by using the <code>measureText</code> API to position spans of text. If you color the "V" in the text "AV" differently in Google Sheets, you will notice kerning is lost, and the letters appear further apart than they should be. That's because two <code>measureText</code> and <code>fillText</code> calls were made on the letters, so contextual glyph advances were lost. Dropflow uses HarfBuzz on more coarse shaping boundaries (not when color is changed) so that the font is more correctly supported.</p>
<p dir="auto">HarfBuzz compiled to WebAssembly can achieve performance metrics similar to <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code>'s <code>measureText</code>. It's not as fast as <code>measureText</code>, but it's not significantly slower (neither of them are the dominators in a text layout stack) and <code>measureText</code> has other correctness drawbacks. For example, a <code>measureText</code>-based text layout implementation must use a word cache to be quick, and this is what GSuite apps do. But a word cache is not able to support fonts with effects across spaces, and to support such a font would have to involve a binary search on the paragraph's break indices, which is far slower than passing the whole paragraph to HarfBuzz. Colored diacritics are not possible in any way with <code>measureText</code> either.</p>

<p dir="auto">dropflow doesn't have any <code>package.json</code> dependencies, but the work of many others made it possible. Javascript dependencies have been checked in and modified to varying degrees to fit this project, maintain focus, and rebel against dependency-of-dependency madness.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>
          I want to tell the story of a beautiful phenomenon in biology. In some
          sense it‚Äôs the prototype of much of the activity of life. The
          phenomenon is the way in which an individual cell of
          <em>E. coli</em> forages for nutrients. This process, known as
          ‚Äúchemotaxis‚Äù‚Äîthe ‚Äúchemo-‚Äù for chemical and the ‚Äútaxis‚Äù from the Greek
          œÑŒ¨ŒæŒπœÇ, for tactics‚Äîis intelligence in one of
          its most elemental forms. An individual <em>E. coli</em> has no brain,
          obviously, and is even many orders of magnitude simpler than a human
          cell, and yet already it possesses something like a sense of smell,
          drive, even a memory. Chemotaxis recasts <em>E. coli</em> not as some
          aimless gut-pest but rather as an exquisitely sophisticated
          <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300167849/wetware/#:~:text=This%20book%20offers%20a%20startling,is%20a%20form%20of%20computation.">physical computer</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm also telling this story because
          <a href="https://jsomers.net/i-should-have-loved-biology">I never liked the way biology was taught in high school</a>. It was too much about the names of things. A subject so vast is
          spoiled by a textbook, which can only point at the endless parade of
          stuff-there-is-to-know. It‚Äôs better approached with questions‚Äîlike
          ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs happening when you smell?‚Äù or ‚Äùwhat is a fever,
          actually?‚Äù‚Äîthat contemplate narrow, deep slices.
        </p>

        <p>
          Chemotaxis is a great slice: it‚Äôs a triumph of systems biology‚Äîwe
          understand it holistically but also in fine detail at almost every
          level. It acquaints you with many of the most important motifs in
          biology, including the way in which protein structure determines
          function; how membranes control the information flow into cells; and
          how chemical modifications store and communicate state. It involves
          one of the most sophisticated and beautiful pieces of molecular
          nanotechnology, the flagellar motor. And it helps give an intuition
          for how a bag of unthinking chemicals could possibly give rise to a
          being.
        </p>
        <h3>The 30,000-foot view</h3>
        <figure>
          
          <figcaption>
            Even with simple rules, the E. coli finds food more often than not
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The basic idea is this: <em>E. coli</em> ‚Äúsmells‚Äù chemicals it‚Äôs
          attracted to with a set of nose-like receptors and decides how to
          swim. Depending on what it senses, it can either use its flagellar
          tails to swim forward‚Äîthis is known as a ‚Äúrun‚Äù‚Äîor it can spin in a
          random direction (a ‚Äútumble‚Äù). By running when the getting is good and
          tumbling when it isn‚Äôt, the <em>E. coli</em> takes a meandering path
          toward the attractant.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little more detail now: there are half a dozen or so rotors on the
          <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> body, each controlling a long whip-like tail that
          flows behind it. When all the rotors are spinning in the same
          direction, the tails join together into a coil that torques the cell
          forward into a run. When even one rotor is spinning against the
          others, the coil unbundles and <em>E. coli</em> spins into a tumble.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a uniform chemical environment, the <em>E. coli</em> swims in a
          random walk by balancing runs with periodic tumbles. By default, a run
          lasts about a second, or ten times longer than a tumble. The rate of
          runs versus tumbles, and their relative duration, is carefully tuned
          to balance ‚Äúexploitation‚Äù and ‚Äúexploration‚Äù: if runs happened too
          often or lasted too long, <em>E. coli</em> would range too widely and
          zip past its food; too seldom or too short, and it‚Äôd likely never find
          food in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But how is this balance achieved? The crux of it is a signaling
          molecule called CheY (pronounced ‚ÄúKEY-why‚Äù). CheY is constantly
          bouncing around in the cytoplasm of the <em>E. coli</em>, interacting
          with both the receptor complex (the ‚Äúnose‚Äù) and the rotors, carrying
          information between them. In the steady state, when CheY encounters
          the receptor complex, it gets chemically modified, or
          ‚Äúphosphorylated,‚Äù at a certain rate to become CheY-p. Unlike the
          unmodified version, CheY-p has a strong affinity for the rotors, and
          when enough copies bind to one, it reverses its spin, causing a
          tumble.
        </p>

        <p>
          The trick is that when the nose detects an <em>increase</em> in the
          concentration of attractant, that steady turning of CheYs into CheY-ps
          is interrupted. As a result, fewer CheY-ps bind to the rotors; fewer
          reversals take place; and so the <em>E. coli</em> runs more and
          tumbles less. In other words, the all-important relative rate of runs
          versus tumbles is determined entirely by how often the
          CheY‚ÜíCheY-p process churns‚Äîand this, in turn, is determined by
          how much attractant is detected by the nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see this process in action in the interactive illustration.
          Try altering the ratio of CheY-p (white) to CheY (blue) by adding some
          attractant (pink). You‚Äòll end up inducing a long run.
        </p>
        
        <div>
          <p>Less attractant</p>
          <p>More attractant</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Why do you need all this complexity? You could imagine a system in
          which the motors themselves responded directly to attractant. We‚Äôll
          see later on that the stream of CheY-ps acts as a kind of adaptable,
          tunable chemical amplifier. ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/chemotaxis/#:~:text=In%20particular%2C%20bacterial,per%20cell%20volume!">Bacterial cells can amplify</a>
          signals more than 50-fold; that is to say, a 2% change in receptor
          occupancy can bring about a 100% change in the output of the system at
          the flagellar motors. This feature allows cells to sense minute
          changes in concentration‚Äîless than three molecules per cell volume!‚Äù
        </p>
        <h3>
          The story gets more complicated: adaptation
        </h3>
        <p>
          If the system were as described above, then
          <em>E. coli</em> wouldn‚Äôt have much dynamic range. Imagine: if the
          cell has a huge reaction to just three molecules of attractant,
          wouldn‚Äôt a thousand times as many just completely overwhelm it?
        </p>
        <p>
          In reality, the <em>E. coli</em> is able to respond sensitively across
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=58&amp;v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;feature=youtu.be">five orders of magnitude</a>
          of attractant concentration. The cell learns to treat whatever
          concentration it stumbles into as the new normal, so that the
          slightest increase triggers the same hypersensitive response as
          always.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mechanism powering this adaptation is extremely clever. You can
          think of each receptor as being equipped with ‚Äústruts‚Äù that have
          pockets in them. When the receptor is bound to attractant, its struts
          change shape so that these pockets open up, and become the targets for
          little molecules known as methyl groups. Methyl groups are ubiquitous
          in biochemistry: for instance, they help determine which parts of your
          DNA get expressed. Methyl groups bind to the structural proteins your
          DNA strands coil around, called histones; the ‚Äúmethylated‚Äù histone can
          kink the DNA strand into or out of view of your transcription
          machinery, turning it on or off.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this case, methylation serves to fill up the strut‚Äôs pockets,
          causing it to become more rigid. (I‚Äôm simplifying the actual physical
          details somewhat, as we‚Äôll see later.) With more rigid struts the
          receptor‚Äôs signaling power is dampened: it takes more attractant to
          elicit the same response. Because there are many methylation sites per
          strut and many struts per receptor, there‚Äôs a wide range of possible
          dampening values‚Äîas if those pockets were really the holes of an
          elaborate wind instrument.
          <span>[<a id="bray-maybe-referent" href="#bray-maybe">Bray</a>]</span>
          This wide dynamic range is what allows the bacteria not just to find a
          favorable environment but to keenly and speedily nose its way up a
          chemical gradient. No wonder a similar mechanism is used by cells in
          your immune system to track and hunt down invaders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Methylation of the receptors gives <em>E. coli</em> a ‚Äú<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2899694/#:~:text=The%20receptor%20methylation%20level%20also%20provides%20a%20simple%20chemical%20memory%20used%20to%20ascertain%20whether%20the%20current%20direction%20of%20swimming%20is%20favorable%20or%20unfavorable.">simple chemical memory</a>.‚Äù This is a powerful and somewhat profound idea: individual bacteria
          can model their environment and remember important features of it by
          encoding that information in internal chemical modifications.
          <em>E. coli</em> ‚Äúknows‚Äù whether attractant has become more or less
          concentrated in its surroundings going back
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2899694">several seconds</a>; that helps it determine whether it‚Äôs swimming in a good or bad
          direction. Which is not that different in principle from what brains
          do. In fact one reason that it requires an artificial neural network
          of about a
          <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627321005018">thousand</a>
          elements just to model the computational capabilities of a single real
          neuron is that the real neuron stores so much ‚Äústate‚Äù in its internal
          chemistry.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Here‚Äòs an aside: should we be surprised at how resilient people can
          be, given the mechanisms available to a single cell for accepting
          previously extreme conditions as ‚Äúa new normal‚Äù? No doubt our macro
          resilience is in some cases actually underwritten by similar cellular
          mechanisms.)

          The video above is a very legible overview of
          <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis, from a popular textbook. It layers in
          even more detail, including not just the proteins that phosphorylate
          CheY but those that dephosphorylate it; and not just the proteins that
          methylate the receptors but those that demethylate it. What you come
          to see is that these doers and undoers define a sort of equilibrated
          circuit whose activity can be conveniently dialed up or down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dennis Bray describes these sorts of circuits nicely in his book,
          <em>Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell</em>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            In a typical signaling pathway, proteins are continually being
            modified and demodified. Kinases and phosphatases work ceaselessly
            like ants in a nest, adding phosphate groups to proteins and
            removing them again. It seems a pointless exercise, especially when
            you consider that each cycle of addition and removal costs the cell
            one molecule of ATP‚Äîone unit of precious energy. Indeed, cyclic
            reactions of this kind were originally labeled ‚Äúfutile.‚Äù But the
            adjective is misleading. The addition of phosphate groups to
            proteins is the single most common reaction in cells and underpins a
            large proportion of the computations they perform. Far from being
            futile, this cyclic reaction provides the cell with an essential
            resource: a flexible and rapidly tunable device.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the cell really needs to change the concentration of the modified
            protein very quickly, it can. All it has to do is to switch on or
            shut off the phosphate-adding reaction and the concentration will
            fall precipitously‚Äîat the speed of the spinning cycle. There is no
            buildup of products or depletion of substrates to slow down the
            process, as there would be in a linear chain of enzyme reactions.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is a clever way to regulate the level of some protein or
          metabolite. Rather than producing the thing you want via a lengthy
          chain reaction, you just have this running cycle that activates and
          then de-activates it, for example via phosphorylation and
          de-phosphorylation. When you want more of the active version, you just
          tamp down the de-activating reaction in the cycle, as if sliding down
          the volume on a stereo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regulation in this manner via phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
          (by ‚Äúkinases‚Äù and ‚Äúphosphatases‚Äù respectively) is an extremely general
          feature of life. ‚ÄúAbout 30‚Äì50% of human proteins contain covalently
          attached phosphate. [. . .] A typical mammalian cell makes use of
          hundreds of distinct types of protein kinases at any moment.‚Äù
          <span>[<a id="alberts-referent" href="#alberts">Alberts</a>]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interactive figure above, phosphorylation is represented by the
          blue dots becoming white, and de-phosphorylation happens when they
          turn blue again. This cycle is constantly running. The speed of the
          cycle determines how quickly the cell can react to levels of
          attractant. Notice that when you add some, the blue‚Üíwhite
          reaction stops happening as much. But the blue‚Üêwhite reaction
          keeps going at the same rate. So blue CheY proliferates, and the cell
          runs more. (If the cycle spun more slowly, the blues wouldn‚Äòt take
          over so quickly.)
        </p>
        <h3>Down the rabbit-hole‚Ä¶</h3>
        <p>
          One thing I don‚Äôt love in presentations of chemotaxis‚Äîand of
          biological concepts generally‚Äîis that they often prominently feature
          flowcharts and network diagrams. In the case of chemotaxis, as you can
          gather from the video above, there are many players with nearly
          indistinguishable names: CheA phosphorylates CheY to become CheY-p,
          and CheZ dephosphorylates it back to CheY; CheW couples CheA to the
          receptors, and CheR methylates those receptors‚Äô struts; CheB,
          meanwhile, ‚Äúclips off‚Äù the methyl groups added to the struts by CheR.
          A network diagram is no doubt useful for organizing this sea of names
          but in a sense it foregrounds the most abstract view of the process.
          I‚Äôd rather try to get a sense of the parts as a living whole or in
          their individual physical detail.

          What does it mean for a receptor to detect attractant?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Almost every action in a cell depends on proteins changing shape and
          binding to each other. It‚Äôs no different in the
          <em>E. coli</em> receptor complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way it works is that there are stimulus-specific proteins embedded
          in the <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> cell membrane, protruding into what‚Äôs known
          as the periplasm. These proteins are ‚Äústimulus-specific‚Äù in the
          literal sense that they are shaped so as to bind favorably with
          individual molecules of attractant. <em>E. coli</em> has five or six
          of these, for instance one that detects a crucial amino acid called
          aspartate. This sensor protein has little clefts in it that are shaped
          just so for molecules of aspartate to fit snugly into them.
          <span>[<a id="falke-referent" href="#falke">Falke</a>]</span>
          In schematic form the aspartate receptor looks like this:
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          You can see that the sensory part‚Äîup top, where the aspartate binds‚Äîis
          connected to the signaling proteins CheW and CheA by a columnar
          structure that straddles the cell‚Äôs membrane. What does this protein
          complex ‚Äúactually‚Äù look like?
        </p>
        <p>
          An individual protein is small enough‚Äî<a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/how-big-is-the-average-protein/">like a few nanometers wide</a>‚Äîthat it can‚Äôt really be seen through a regular light microscope.
          This receptor from top to bottom measures about 350 angstroms, or 35
          nanometers. But modern biology is all about seeing the unseeable.
          Nowadays, we try to find out what nanostructures look like by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_crystallography">X-ray diffraction</a>
          or, more and more often, by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_electron_microscopy">cryo-freezing them</a>
          in an electron microscope. Once we determine a protein‚Äôs structure
          it‚Äôs usually rendered using ribbon diagrams, a style
          <a href="https://stories.duke.edu/sciences-mother-of-ribbon-diagrams-celebrates-50-years-at-duke">invented by the biochemist Jane Richardson</a>
          in the late 1970s. Here‚Äôs a ribbon diagram for the
          <em>E. coli</em> serine receptor (really it‚Äôs a ‚Äútrimer of dimers,‚Äù or
          a complex of six receptors):

          This whole thing is the receptor. (Those parts just inside the
          membrane, with little yellow methyl groups lingering stuck to them,
          are the struts.) How exactly it works is quite complex, and the
          subject of current research. But in simplified terms it acts like one
          big piston: when the asparate binds to the part in the periplasm, the
          columnar structure it‚Äôs attached to changes shape‚Äîa real biologist
          would call these subtle allosteric effects; to me it looks like
          dipping and tilting‚Äîin such a way to lock the thing that‚Äôs supposed to
          be phosphorylating CheY, the CheA kinase, into an inactive state.

          When I think of a cell I imagine a Rube Goldberg‚Äìtype contraption
          where an arm swings here, which drops a ball into a slide there, which
          rolls down and opens a trap door, which‚Ä¶ eventually turns on or off
          some important cellular function. Indeed, <em>E. coli</em>‚Äôs ‚Äúsense of
          smell‚Äù rests ultimately in a series of physical lock-and-key
          mechanisms, starting with literal molecules of e.g. aspartate nuzzling
          into a protein and transmitting that physical shape-change across the
          membrane.

        <p>
          This piston-shaped receptor complex is just one of a huge array
          arranged near the front of <em>E. coli</em>‚Äôs body. In cross section
          they appear almost to have been laid down through a lithography
          process, in a neat hexagonal pattern:

          Calling <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> receptor complex its ‚Äúnose‚Äù is no mere
          metaphor. Our own noses operate on a similar principle: when you smell
          a flower, it means that actual flower-molecules‚Äîpossibly only a tiny
          number of them‚Äîhave reached the inside of your nose and bound to some
          protein with a specific affinity for that very molecule. This signal
          is then transmitted via nerves to your brain. The human nose has
          several hundred receptor proteins for smell; a dog has
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5884888/#:~:text=The%20canine%20OR%20repertoire%20is%20composed%20of%201%2C094%20genes%2C%20approximately%20three%20times%20more%20than%20a%20human.">more than a thousand</a>.

        <p>
          Every one of our senses works like this. Touch is underwritten by
          proteins that get ‚Äúsquished‚Äù by tactile forces into cell membranes,
          triggering a set of downstream responses. Sight is my favorite
          example. There‚Äôs a protein called opsin that lives in the cells of our
          retina. What‚Äôs so cool about it is that the thing that changes its
          shape is a literal photon. That is,
          <a href="https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/147#:~:text=Rhodopsin%2C%20shown%20here,to%20the%20brain.">opsin converts the electromagnetic force of an incoming photon into
            a biomechanical / biochemical signal</a>. This is why I tend to think of molecular biology as the science of
          shapes bumping into each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think of <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> receptor complex as a protoversion of
          our own sensory apparatus. Its nose has only
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2596&amp;v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;feature=youtu.be">five or six</a>
          attractant-specific sensory proteins, but their signals are
          integrated, as if different sets of receptor-protein activations were
          playing different ‚Äúchords‚Äù on the
          <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> sensorium. ‚ÄúIn short, the chemosensory array
          functions as an ultrasensitive, ultrastable biological integrated
          circuit or sensory chip.‚Äù
          <span>[<a id="falke-referent-2" href="#falke-2">Falke</a>]</span>
        </p>
        <h3>How the signal is carried</h3>
        <p>
          So a bit of attractant binds one of the receptors, and lo, the
          equilibrium inside the cell begins to shift. Because the CheA kinase
          is now inactive, CheYs are no longer getting phosphorylated as
          quickly; the process that <em>de</em>-phosphorylates existing CheY-ps
          starts winning out. Recall that this is a response that is dynamic, a
          flow that is tuned. The net number of CheY-ps in the cell is carefully
          faded down. And then what?
        </p>
        <p>
          The CheY-ps had been binding to the flagellar rotors, flipping them,
          causing tumbles. That now no longer happens as much, because the
          unphosphorylated CheY doesn‚Äôt have the same affinity for the rotor as
          CheY-p. As a result, the cell tumbles less, runs more, and biases its
          random walk toward the attractant.
        </p>
        <p>
          There‚Äôs something really important worth dwelling on here. When we say
          that CheY-p has an ‚Äúaffinity‚Äù for the rotor protein, it‚Äôs not like it
          gets directed there; nor does it have some long-acting magnetic
          attraction for it. What this really means is that it has a strong
          inclination to bind to the rotor protein when it gets really really
          close to it. (And CheY, without the -p, doesn't have such an
          inclination.) Given how small a single CheY-p is in the scheme of the
          whole cell‚Äôs cytoplasm, it might seem improbable that it‚Äôll somehow
          sidle up right next to one of these rotor proteins somewhere on the
          other end of the <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> body. But that gets at the heart
          of

          Cells are dense with stuff, but everything in it is also

        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            To get an idea of how fast this motion is, imagine a typical
            bacterial cell, and place an enzyme at one end and a sugar molecule
            at the other. They will bump around and wander through the whole
            cell, encountering many molecules along the way. On average, though,
            it will only take about a second for those two molecules to bump
            into each other at least once. This is truly remarkable: this means
            that any molecule in a typical bacterial cell, during its chaotic
            journey through the cell, will encounter almost every other molecule
            in a matter of seconds.

        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Just to put this in perspective: imagine you took an
          <em>E. coli</em> cell and scaled it up so that it was the length of a
          football field. And imagine you kept all the physics the same. A water
          molecule would be about an inch wide; a protein would be about the
          size of a basketball.
          <span>[<a href="#bionumbers">BioNumbers</a>]</span>
          The proteins would be juddering violently due to the thermal motion of
          the water particles bombarding them‚Äîso violently in fact that if left
          unchecked they‚Äôd be moving at 500 meters per second. But they aren‚Äôt
          left unchecked: if you were in such an environment it would be so
          crowded as to be nearly impossible to see. What you really get, then,
          is an incredible ceaseless shaking and bouncing-into-each-other of all
          the component parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why shape changes that lead to different bonding affinities
          are so important in biology. It‚Äôs as if inside a cell everyone is
          constantly going up to everyone else, seeing if they fit together.
          Proteins sample the space of interactions with other proteins so
          quickly that for a long time, most biologists didn‚Äôt really
          contemplate where in the cytoplasm two reactants lived; they knew that
          you never had to wait too long for them to meet each other. In fact it
          was a
          <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-newfound-source-of-cellular-order-in-the-chemistry-of-life-20210107/">relatively recent discovery</a>
          that inside the cytoplasm certain proteins that share functional
          relationships do seem to keep especially close together, inside little
          oil drops known as ‚Äúphase-separated liquids.‚Äù Weak interactive forces
          between the floppy tails of different proteins cause them to
          spontaneously ‚Äúphase separate‚Äù into these more viscous pools, and this
          biases certain proteins to interact more frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rate-limiting step in <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> reaction to attractant is
          the time it takes for CheY-p to diffuse from the nose to the motor. It
          takes about a tenth of a second. The journey has actually been tracked
          on camera, using a fluorescent version of the protein:

          What happens when the signal reaches the motor?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Let‚Äôs talk about these motors. These things are so intricate and
          beautiful and seem so reminiscent of machines we‚Äôd engineer ourselves
          that they‚Äôre sometimes cited as evidence for intelligent design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The flagellar motor operates with close to 100% energy efficiency. It
          spins at about 1,500 rotations per second. And the craziest part is
          that like all molecular nanomachines it is entirely self-assembled.
          There‚Äôs an amazing 30-minute documentary
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw0-MHI_248">available on YouTube</a>
          that details the mechanics of the self-assembly process‚Äîand,
          refreshingly, profiles some of the scientists who figured it out,
          describing the methods they used to make their discoveries.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          My favorite part of the self-assembly process is that after building a
          base for the rotor, a sort of tunnel is built and the proteins that
          comprise the whip-like ‚Äúhook‚Äù of the flagellum are extruded through
          it‚Äîas if the flagellum were built by vomiting forth parts of itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, at the base of each rotor there are a series of proteins
          called FliG, FliM, and FliN‚Äîpronounced like ‚ÄúFly G,‚Äù ‚ÄúFly M,‚Äù ‚ÄúFly
          N‚Äù‚Äîto which CheY-p, our Frodo-esque bearer of the message from the
          nose, attaches once it finally arrives. CheY-p has a strong affinity
          for FliG and will readily glom onto it. We‚Äôll see how that actually
          affects the flagellum in a second. But for now it‚Äôs worth noting that
          there‚Äôs a thresholding mechanism here: just one CheY-p attaching to
          FliG won‚Äôt be enough to flip the motor from counter-clockwise to
          clockwise (thereby causing a tumble)‚Äîit actually takes a handful of
          CheY-ps conspiring to make that happen. In fact the motor has
          something like seven states, from rotating quickly counterclockwise at
          three discrete levels of decreasing speed‚Äîas if stepping through three
          gears on a bike‚Äîto stalling entirely, to starting back up again in the
          clockwise direction, also with three speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as the motor is in the process of changing direction, any CheY-ps
          that do attach to FliG are under constant threat of being removed by
          yet another player, CheZ. That is, the proteins that would reverse the
          motors are subject to removal by other proteins that un-reverse it.
          Again we have a responsive regulatory circuit reminiscent of the one
          that phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated CheY in the first place
          upstream at the receptor. The idea is that every effect is reversible,
          and in fact is reversed at a regular rate. This means that in the
          absence of further signal the cell will quickly return to baseline.
        </p>
        <h3>
          How does the motor actually change directions?
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a matter of pure mechanics this might be the most ingenious part of
          the story. It took quite a long time to figure out and even still it
          seems that we‚Äôre not entirely confident with our explanation. But one
          mechanism that‚Äôs been proposed is that CheY-p binds to a protein
          called FliM (‚ÄúFly EM‚Äù) embedded in that ring that defines the base of
          the rotor. This tilts it and causes a 90-degree rotation in an
          attached protein called FliGc. That protein sits at the interface
          between the rotating part of the motor and the so-called ‚Äústator,‚Äù
          which drives it from the part that‚Äôs anchored solidly in the cell
          membrane.

          When FliGc changes orientation, the stepper-motor-like cycle that
          normally drives the motor counterclockwise starts driving it clockwise
          instead. In the illustration below, Figure A shows the stator, i.e.,
          the driving mechanism of the motor. It works by stepping back and
          forth between the ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúclosed‚Äù states, schematized by the
          <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/articleImages/image14.png">
          and
          <img loading="lazy" alt="" src="https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/articleImages/image3.png">
          symbols respectively. In Figure B you can see how, in the normal CCW
          direction, the repeated cycling between these two states drives the
          ‚Äúteeth‚Äù of the motor‚Äîthe crucial FliGc proteins, here tilted
          left-to-right.

          When the CheY-p arrives at the rotor it has the effect of flipping the
          FliGc proteins so that now they tilt right-to-left. In that
          orientation the step-drive action works the opposite way, and the
          motor rotates clockwise:

          It would be nice if the original paper presenting this theory included
          an illustration like this. But even this crude version took me many
          hours to make. As Bret Victor argues in
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfytHvgHybA">Stop Drawing Dead Fish</a>, making moving pictures shouldn‚Äôt be so hard. If it were easier,
          such animations would spread everywhere in scientific communication,
          because so often what a paper describes is some kind of dynamic
          process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Dynamic illustrations would help readers grasp proposed mechanisms
          more quickly. As it is, someone who understands a complex mechanism
          usually has to explain it in patient detail to someone
          <em>else</em> who‚Äôs good at animating; this costs time and money; and
          most people simply opt not to go through with it. Perhaps someday the
          process will be democratized by better tools, or by a multimodal AI
          system.

          How the motor changing directions causes the <em>E. coli</em> to
          tumble
        </h3>
        <p>
          The final part of the story‚Äîfor me, anyway; there‚Äôs a lot more to
          explore!‚Äîis why exactly the clockwise rotation of just one of the
          flagellar motors would send the whole cell a-tumbling. It helps to
          understand how the thing works in ‚Äúrun‚Äù mode, when all the flagella
          are oriented the same way.

          Even though this bundle of flagella sort of looks like a propeller,
          when you actually think about it, that‚Äôs not really what it is. It‚Äôs
          more like a pig‚Äôs curly tail that spins with a whip-y sort of motion.
          How exactly does that propel the entire cell? A wonderful book called
          <em>Random Walks in Biology</em> gets into the physics in some detail:

        <h3>
          Individuality in the bacterial population
        </h3>
        <p>
          We tend to think of a colony of something like <em>E. coli</em> as an
          undifferentiated evil goo, each bacterium identical to its neighbors.
          But people who‚Äôve studied these organisms under the microscope observe
          a surprising amount of individual personality.
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/262467a0">A 1976 <em>Nature</em> paper</a>, ‚ÄúNon-genetic individuality: chance in the single cell,‚Äù explores
          variation in the context of chemotaxis using strains of Salmonella and
          Enterobacter bacteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper came out before the exact mechanism behind chemotactic
          regulation was well-understood; all the authors knew was that ‚Äúcontrol
          of tumbling can be rationalised as caused by changes in the levels of
          a tumble regulator.‚Äù They hypothesized that although bacteria of the
          same strain would all share the exact same DNA, there might be a
          relatively small number of copies of that ‚Äútumble regulator,‚Äù and
          natural variation in the transcription, translation, and destruction
          of these regulator proteins could account for differences in behavior.
          Their experiments were mostly at the behavioral level. They observed
          how different individuals‚Äîincluding those in a particularly ‚Äútumbly‚Äù
          mutant strain (I love that word)‚Äîreacted to environments with and
          without attractant, and found plenty of variance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their theory was spot-on. We talked above about how
          <em>E. coli</em> adapt to higher and higher concentrations of
          attractant via a clever methylation mechanism. Well, it turns out that
          the methylation of the receptor struts is governed by only about
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=3032&amp;v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;feature=youtu.be">100 CheR proteins</a>
          in the cell. The number of those proteins‚Äîalong with CheB, which
          un-methylates the struts‚Äîdetermines the speed of the ‚Äúfutile cycle‚Äù
          that reacts to changes in attractant concentration. That is, it
          affects how quickly the bacterium adapts when the concentration goes
          up and refracts when it goes down.
          <span>[<a href="#gore">Gore</a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;t=3989s">1:06:30</a>]</span>
          Because 100 copies of CheR is so extraordinarily tiny in the context
          of the full cell buzzing with something like ten million proteins,
          variation by just a handful can have a relatively large effect on the
          cell‚Äôs behavior.
          <span>[<a href="#gore">Gore</a>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cT855rpX8bc&amp;t=4390s">1:13:20</a>]</span>
          That helps account for why different <em>E. coli</em> with the exact
          same genetic sequence will tumble and adapt at different frequencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recent
          <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/27455">experiments</a>
          have used fluorescent microscopy to quantify the individuality of
          different E. coli cells, individuality that arises not from
          differences in gene expression but from the dynamics of signaling
          networks.
        </p>
        <h3>How did we figure all this stuff out?</h3>
        <p>
          We don‚Äôt yet have the technology to just observe all of the activity
          inside a living cell. That Goodsell painting above that shows the
          crowded cytoplasm packed with proteins is an artistic composite‚Äîbacked
          by rigorous research to be sure‚Äîbecause there‚Äôs no way to capture all
          the different players in situ at once. And obviously it‚Äôs a ‚Äústill
          life,‚Äù not a video. So how could we possibly know all this detail
          about what exactly a given protein looks like, and how and when it
          interacts with others to kick off some particular part of the
          chemotaxis process?
        </p>
        <p>
          There seem to be three or four major kinds of experiment. Probably the
          most common is genetic: you can selectively disrupt one gene at a time
          and, by observing how the mutant <em>E. coli</em> behaves, begin to
          get a grip on each gene‚Äôs function. All of the proteins ‚ÄúCheY,‚Äù
          ‚ÄúCheZ,‚Äù ‚ÄúCheW,‚Äù and so on are named simply because they are the
          products of genes that, when excised, ‚Äúcause a general defect in
          chemotaxis.‚Äù
          <span>[<a href="#blair">Blair</a>]</span> As you
          can imagine, identifying all of these is painstaking work, and
          involves a considerable amount of clever inference. For instance you
          might observe that without gene X the bacteria never seems to tumble;
          is that because that gene is involved in recognizing attractant or in
          forcing the rotor to run clockwise?
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have a hypothesis, a second kind of experiment involves
          purifying some subset of these proteins-of-interest in vitro to see
          how they work together to form a particular signaling pathway. For
          example you could put CheA and CheY along with some phosphate groups
          and other necessary reactants and observe whether and how much
          phosphorylation takes place. That‚Äôs what the authors did in
          <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(90)90429-I">this paper</a>
          in <em>Cell</em>, in 1990. They used a radioactive version of
          phosphate as a tracer. ‚ÄúIncorporation of [32P]phosphate into CheA or
          CheY was determined by excising the radioactive band out of the dried
          gel and quantitating in scintillation fluid or by analysis of the
          intact gel using a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA)
          and compare with known radioactive standards.‚Äù Another common method
          for observing in vitro dynamics is to genetically modify proteins to
          fluoresce; or to ‚Äúfind‚Äù a protein in solution using an antibody that
          recognizes some part of it‚Äîyou attach that antibody to another
          protein, and that one you fluoresce, so you can find the hidden one.
        </p>
        <p>
          To understand the literal lock-and-key mechanics at a particular
          binding site‚Äîfor instance how exactly a molecule of aspartate causes a
          receptor to deform, kicking off a signaling cascade‚Äîinvolves
          ‚Äústructural‚Äù biology work, i.e., taking pictures of individual
          proteins or, increasingly, ensembles of them in situ. For this you can
          use X-ray crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance imaging,
          cryo-electron microscopy, super-resolution light microscopy, or some
          combination.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <a href="https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/chemotaxis/">group</a> at
          University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne uses atomic-scale molecular
          dynamics simulations, in software, to understand structural
          details‚Äîlike the exact
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCobqYrE67w">way</a> that
          CheA changes shape to kick off a downstream signaling process‚Äîthat
          wouldn‚Äôt be apparent from high-resolution imaging alone. (Keith
          Cassidy, whose figures appeared above, now has a
          <a href="https://ckcassidy.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/">lab at the University of Missouri-Columbia</a>
          that‚Äôs studying the molecular dynamics of the receptor signaling
          complex.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes you can‚Äôt get a direct picture. It may require deduction to
          understand, say, how exactly a protein fits in.
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1326408/">One experiment</a>
          found that CheA didn‚Äôt bind to a receptor except in the presence of
          CheW; that plus the fact that adding too much CheW into the mixture
          actually led to a decrease in the ability of CheA‚ÄìCheW complexes to
          bind receptor suggested that CheW competed with that complex for the
          binding site on the receptor and that therefore it must sit between
          the receptor and CheW in the receptor‚ÄìCheW‚ÄìCheA trimer
          <span>[via <a href="#blair">Blair</a>]</span>.
          Biology is lousy with heroic inferences like that. It‚Äôs a world that‚Äôs
          hard to see; sometimes you just have to imagine what‚Äôs going on down
          there, and back up those imaginings with the right experiments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very idea that bacteria run and tumble came from experiments
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/239500a0">published in 1972</a>
          by Howard Berg and Douglas Brown, who used a special three-dimensional
          tracking microscope of their own design to watch the little suckers in
          action. (A fun fact is that they called the non-runs ‚Äútwiddles‚Äù
          instead of ‚Äútumbles.‚Äù) Some of the physics of flagellar
          propulsion‚Äîlike how much force the little tails generate‚Äî<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/An_Introduction_to_Systems_Biology/tcxCkIxzCO4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;pg=PAfrontcover&amp;printsec=frontcover">was discovered</a>
          later by tethering the flagella to a microscope slide: because it‚Äôs
          anchored, the ‚Äútail wags the dog‚Äú and you can measure how fast the
          <em>E. coli‚Äôs</em> body spins. We know that bacterial flagellar motors
          are powered by the
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-642-11274-4_141">proton motive force</a>
          from a
          <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC431412/">1977 paper</a>
          that measured how cells ran or ‚Äútwiddled‚Äù in the presence or absence
          of an electrical potential. But the research has become even more
          refined than that. Just by observing the strength of the rotation
          under various conditions‚Äîdifferent viscosities, temperatures, and so
          on‚Äîwe know that ‚Äúrotation is tightly coupled to proton flow, with a
          fixed number of protons (~500) used to drive each revolution.‚Äù
          <span>[<a href="#blair">Blair</a>]</span>
          Think of how detailed an understanding we‚Äôve gotten!
        </p>
        <p>
          One reason I‚Äôm particularly attracted to studies of
          <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis is that it‚Äôs an early star of what‚Äôs been
          called ‚Äúin silico‚Äù biology. It‚Äôs been the subject of many computer
          models. Dennis Bray, the author of that book that put me onto this
          stuff in the first place, made one of the more
          <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17208180/">popular models</a>. Here‚Äôs a nice screenshot of the model in action:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img loading="lazy" width="562" height="425" alt="" src="https://jsomers.net/e-coli-chemotaxis/articleImages/image16.jpg">
        </figure>
        <p>
          Maybe the chief role of a computer model is that to get it working in
          the first place you have to explicitly articulate every one of your
          assumptions. In much the same way that writing tends to clarify your
          thinking (or at least reveal how unclear it really is), a computer
          model forces you to synthesize what you know. If anything it‚Äôs even
          more exacting than a blank page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have a model, you can use it to explore variations on those
          assumptions. ‚ÄúThe program gives the correct phenotype of over 60
          mutants in which chemotaxis-pathway components are deleted or
          overexpressed,‚Äù Bray writes. At best, a good enough model lets you
          discover things you didn‚Äôt already know, or suggests your next
          experiment. ‚ÄúIn order to match the impulse response to a brief
          stimulus [. . .] we also had to increase the activities of the
          adaptational enzymes CheR and CheB at least an order of magnitude
          greater than published values.‚Äù
        </p>
        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <p>
          Why should you care about <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis? A typical
          answer to that sort of question‚Äîand I‚Äôm sure the answer given in many
          of the grant applications supporting the work cited here‚Äîis that there
          are medical and practical uses. For instance: if you understand the
          signaling pathways of bacterial chemotaxis you can disrupt them; that
          work might lead to a new kind of antibiotic, which, in an era of
          increasing resistance, is direly needed. Or you might hijack
          chemotaxis pathways to create ‚Äúintelligent sniffers‚Äù (Keith Cassidy‚Äôs
          phrase) that could home in on cancer cells or environmental waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          More generally you might say‚Äîand in fact I led with this up top‚Äîthat
          understanding this specific phenomenon equips you to understand all
          kinds of others. ‚ÄúBacterial two-component pathways
          <span>[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-component_regulatory_system">def‚Äôn</a>]</span>
          control a dazzling array of functions including cell division,
          virulence, antibiotic resistance, metabolite fixation and utilization,
          response to environmental stress, sporulation, and taxis.‚Äù
        </p>
        <p>
          But I don‚Äôt know, to me the real reason is that it‚Äôs neat. It‚Äôs just
          fun to find out about. ‚ÄúTo learn, and at due times to repeat what one
          has learnt, is that not after all a pleasure?‚Äù

          <strong>Bray, Dennis.</strong>
          <em>Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell</em>. 2009. This is the
          book that kicked off my interest in E. coli chemotaxis. Bray built
          computer models of the network of interacting parts that give rise to
          E. coli‚Äôs sophisticated foraging behavior‚Äîan early example of in
          silico ‚Äúsystems biology.‚Äù This is a very evocative book, giving you a
          newfound appreciation for the computational power of an individual
          cell.

        <p>
          ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgPDOSou1tw">Chemotaxis: Molecular Events</a>.‚Äù A superb video that gives an overview of everything you need to
          know about chemotaxis. I think this was prepared for Molecular Biology
          of the Cell, the textbook cited below. Is it sufficient to just watch
          this video and be done with it? Maybe, but for some reason I had a
          bunch of questions I still wanted answered that led me to all this
          other stuff.

<p>Vernor Vinge, author of many influential hard science fiction works, died March 20 at the age of 79.</p>



<p>Vinge sold his first science-fiction story in 1964, ‚ÄúApartness‚Äù, which appeared in the June 1965 issue of <em>New Worlds</em>.</p>



<p>In 1971, he received a PhD (Math) from UCSD, and the next year began teaching at San Diego State University. It wasn‚Äôt until almost thirty years later, in August 2000, that he retired from teaching to write science-fiction full time.</p>



<p>His 1981 novella&nbsp;<em>True Names</em> is often credited as the first story to present a fully fleshed-out concept of&nbsp;cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He won Hugo Awards&nbsp;for his novels&nbsp;<em>A Fire Upon the Deep</em>&nbsp;(1993 ‚Äî tie),&nbsp;<em>A&nbsp;Deepness in the Sky</em>&nbsp;(2000),&nbsp;<em>Rainbows End</em>&nbsp;(2007), and novellas&nbsp;<em>Fast Times at Fairmont High</em>&nbsp;(2002), and&nbsp;<em>The Cookie Monster</em>&nbsp;(2004). <em>A Deepness in the Sky </em>also won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and in translation won Spain‚Äôs Ignotus Award, Germany‚Äôs Kurd Lasswitz Preis, and Italy‚Äôs Italia Award.</p>



<p>Vinge was the guest of honor at ConJos√©, the 2002 Worldcon. He won the Prometheus Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2014. He won the Heinlein Award presented by The Heinlein Society in 2020.</p>



<p>He was married to Joan D. Vinge from 1972 to 1979.</p>



<p>David Brin has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AUTHORDAVIDBRIN/posts/804165974862720">posted a heartfelt tribute</a> on Facebook which says in part:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It is with sadness ‚Äì and deep appreciation of my friend and colleague ‚Äì that I must report the passing of Vernor Vinge. A titan in the literary genre that explores a limitless range of potential destinies, Vernor enthralled millions with tales of plausible tomorrows, made all the more vivid by his polymath masteries of language, drama, characters and the implications of science.</p>



<p>Accused by some of a grievous sin ‚Äì that of ‚Äòoptimism‚Äô ‚Äì Vernor gave us peerless legends that often depicted human success at overcoming problems‚Ä¶ those right in front of us‚Ä¶ while posing new ones! New dilemmas that may lie just ahead of our myopic gaze. He would often ask: ‚ÄúWhat if we succeed? Do you think that will be the end of it?‚Äù‚Ä¶</p>



<p>‚Ä¶We spanned a pretty wide spectrum ‚Äì politically! Yet, we KBs [Killer B‚Äôs] (Vernor was a full member! And Octavia Butler once guffawed happily when we inducted her) always shared a deep love of our high art ‚Äì that of gedankenexperimentation, extrapolation into the undiscovered country ahead.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      
      
      <p>The bicycle, as we know it today, was not invented until the late 1800s. Yet it was a simple mechanical invention. It would seem to require no brilliant inventive insight, and certainly no scientific background.</p>

<p>Why, then, wasn‚Äôt it invented much earlier?</p>

<p>I asked this question <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncrawford/status/1143622870477791233" target="_blank">on Twitter</a>, and read some discussion <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing" target="_blank">on Quora</a>. People proposed many hypotheses, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technology factors.</strong> Metalworking improved a lot in the 1800s: we got improved iron refining and eventually cheap steel, better processes for shaping metal, and ability to make parts like hollow tubes. Wheel technology improved: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_wheel" target="_blank">wire-spoke</a> (aka tension-spoked) wheels replaced heavier designs; vulcanized rubber (1839) was needed for tires; inflatable tires weren‚Äôt invented until 1887. Chains, gears, and ball bearings are all crucial parts that require advanced manufacturing techniques for precision and cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design iteration.</strong> Early bicycles were inconvenient and dangerous. The first version didn‚Äôt even have pedals. Some versions didn‚Äôt have steering, and could only be turned by leaning. (!) The famous ‚Äúpenny-farthing‚Äù design, with its huge front wheel, made it impossible to balance with your feet, was prone to tipping forward on a hard stop, and generally left the rider high in the air, all of which increased risk of injury. It took decades of iteration to get to a successful bicycle model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Quality of roads.</strong> Roads in the 1800s and earlier were terrible by modern standards. Roads were often dirt, rutted from the passage of many carts, turning muddy in the rain. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macadam" target="_blank">Macadam paving</a>, which gave smooth surfaces to roads, wasn‚Äôt invented until about 1820. City roads at the time were paved with cobblestones, which were good for horses but too bumpy for bicycles. (The unevenness was apparently a feature, assisting in the runoff of sewage‚Äîleading <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-come-bicycles-werent-invented-earlier-in-history-What-was-missing/answer/Chris-Crawford-6" target="_blank">one Quora answer</a> to claim that the construction of city sewers was what opened the door to bicycles.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Competition from horses.</strong> Horses were a common and accepted mode of transportation at the time. They could deal with all kinds of roads. They could carry heavy loads. Who then needs a bicycle? In this connection, it has been claimed that the bicycle was invented in response to food shortages due to the ‚Äú<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_Without_a_Summer" target="_blank">Year without a Summer</a>‚Äù, an 1816 weather event caused by the volcanic explosion of Mt. Tambora the year earlier, which darkened skies and lowered temperatures in many parts of the world. The agricultural crisis caused horses as well as people to starve, which led to some horses being slaughtered for food, and made the remaining ones more expensive to feed. This could have motivated the search for alternatives.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>General economic growth.</strong> Multiple commenters pointed out the need for a middle class to provide demand for such an invention. If all you have are a lot of poor peasants and a few aristocrats (who, by the way, have horses, carriages, and drivers), there isn‚Äôt much of a market for bicycles. This is more plausible when you realize that bicycles were more of a hobby for entertainment before they became a practical means of transportation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cultural factors.</strong> Maybe there was just a general lack of interest in useful mechanical inventions until a certain point in history? But when did this change, and why?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>These are all good hypotheses. But some of them start to buckle under pressure:</p>

<p>The quality of roads is relevant, but not really the answer. Bicycles can be ridden on dirt roads or sidewalks (although the latter led to run-ins with pedestrians and made bicycles unpopular among the public at first). And historically, roads didn‚Äôt improve until <em>after</em> bicycles became common‚Äîindeed it seems that it was in part the cyclists who called for the improvement of roads.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt think horses explain it either. A bicycle, from what I‚Äôve read, was cheaper to buy than a horse, and it was certainly cheaper to maintain (if nothing else, you don‚Äôt have to feed a bicycle). And it turns out that inventors were interested in the problem of human-powered vehicles, dispensing with the need for horses, for a long time before the modern bicycle. Even Karl von Drais, who invented the first two-wheeled human-powered vehicle after the Year without a Summer, had been working on the problem for years before that.</p>

<p>Technology factors are more convincing to me. They may have been necessary for bicycles to become practical and cheap enough to take off. But they weren‚Äôt needed for early experimentation. Frames can be built of wood. Wheels can be rimmed with metal. Gears can be omitted. Chains can be replaced with belts; some early designs even used treadles instead of pedals, and at least one design drove the wheels with levers, as on a steam locomotive.</p>

<p>So what‚Äôs the real explanation?</p>

<p>To understand this, I dug into the history of the bicycle.</p>

<p>The concept of a human-powered vehicle goes back many centuries. The earliest reference I have found is to Venetian engineer Giovanni Fontana, who in the early 1400s described a four-wheeled carriage powered by a driver pulling on a loop of rope connected by gears to the wheels (it‚Äôs unclear if he ever even attempted to build such a machine; Fontana sketched <a href="https://publicdomainreview.org/2018/01/24/the-dreams-of-an-inventor-in-1420/" target="_blank">a lot of strange things</a>).</p>

<p>Another early concept was described in the book <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/30/books/chapters/bicycle.html" target="_blank"><em>Bicycle</em> by David V. Herlihy</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>More than three centuries ago, the distinguished French mathematician Jacques Ozanam spelled out the theoretical advantages of a human-powered carriage ‚Äúin which one can drive oneself wherever one pleases, without horses.‚Äù Its owner could freely roam along the roads without having to care for an animal and might even enjoy a healthy exercise in the process. Moreover, this particular type of ‚Äúself-moving‚Äù vehicle, in contrast to those that called for wind or steam for propulsion, would run on that most abundant and accessible of all resources: willpower. But how to construct such a valuable vehicle? That was the twenty-third of some fifty ‚Äúuseful and entertaining‚Äù problems Ozanam identified and addressed in his famous <em>R√©cr√©ations Math√©matiques et Physiques</em>, published in 1696.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ozanam‚Äôs book presented a proposed solution from another inventor: another four-wheeled carriage, driven by two people (one to steer, one to power the vehicle by stepping up and down on large treadles connected to the wheels by ropes, pulleys, and gears).</p>

<p>It seems that for centuries, the carriage was the model for human-powered vehicles. Various inventors tried their hand at designs, and some were even built. There is a record in a London journal of an attempt in 1774 that went up to six miles an hour. French inventor Jean-Pierre Blanchard (who would later go on to fame in ballooning) built a human-powered carriage that went a dozen miles from Paris to Versailles. An American mechanic named Bolton built a version in 1804 that used mechanical leverage from interlocking gears. Presumably, all these attempts went nowhere because the machines were too large and heavy to be practical.</p>

<figure data-url="/img/draisine.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/draisine.jpg"></figure>

<p>The key insight was to stop trying to build a mechanical carriage, and instead build something more like a mechanical horse. This step was taken by the aforementioned Karl von Drais in the early 1800s. Drais was an aristocrat; he held a position as forest master in Baden that is <a href="https://regencyredingote.wordpress.com/2010/03/05/of-velocipedes-and-draisiennes-the-rise/" target="_blank">said</a> to have given him free time to tinker. His first attempts, beginning in 1813, were four-wheeled carriages like their predecessors, and like them failed to gain the support of authorities.</p>

<figure data-url="/img/pedestrian-curricle.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/pedestrian-curricle.jpg"></figure>

<p>But in 1817 (possibly motivated by the aforementioned food crisis and resultant shortage of horses, although this is unclear), he tried again with a new design: a two-wheeled, one-person vehicle that is a recognizable ancestor of the modern bicycle. It was made of wood, with iron tires. He called it the <em>Laufmaschine</em>, or ‚Äúrunning machine‚Äù; it had no pedals, and instead was powered by directly pushing off the ground with one‚Äôs feet. It was also called the ‚Äúvelocipede‚Äù (from the Latin for ‚Äúswift foot‚Äù) or the ‚Äúdraisine‚Äù (English) or ‚Äúdraisienne‚Äù (French) after its inventor; an improved version made by a London coachmaker was known in England as the ‚Äúpedestrian curricle‚Äù.</p>

<p>Without pedals or gears, this proto-bicycle couldn‚Äôt achieve the speed or efficiency of modern designs. But, like the scooters still used by children today, it allowed you to coast, especially downhill, and it held your weight as you moved forward. Drais got up to 12 miles per hour on his machine. It became a fad in Europe in 1818‚Äì19, then faded. It seems the reasons were a combination of the potential for injury and the general annoyance of the public that these things were being driven through pedestrian areas such as sidewalks and parks (some things never change; we‚Äôre repeating this today with the scooter wars in San Francisco and other cities).</p>

<p>The next key advance didn‚Äôt come until decades later, when someone put pedals on the bike. There are conflicting claims to first inventor (going back to 1839), but it was definitely done by the 1860s in France. In any case, it was in the 1860s that bicycle development really took off. Pedals allowed the rider to propel the machine faster and more efficiently. This model was manufactured in France, at first with wooden frames, later with iron, and became commonly known as the ‚Äúboneshaker‚Äù (which gives you an idea of how rough the ride still was).</p>

<p>At this point, though, there were still no gears or chains. The pedals were attached directly to the front wheel. This gave the rider little mechanical advantage: it‚Äôs the same as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-gear_bicycle" target="_blank">fixie</a> with a 1:1 gear ratio (vs. the ratios most commonly used today which are closer to 3:1). Think of what it‚Äôs like to pedal a bike that‚Äôs in too low a gear: you pump your legs a lot without going very fast.</p>

<figure data-url="/img/penny-farthing.jpg"><img src="https://rootsofprogress.org/img/penny-farthing.jpg"></figure>

<p>The only solution was to make the wheel larger, leading around 1870 to the ridiculous-looking ‚Äúpenny-farthing‚Äù or ‚Äúhigh-wheel‚Äù design with the huge front wheel, which you‚Äôve probably seen and may associate with the late 1800s. By around this time, bicycles were being made with metal frames, wire-spoke wheels, and solid rubber (not yet inflatable) tires. This design did give a faster ride, and a smoother one, since the large wheel absorbed shocks better. But it required acrobatic balance to ride, and as noted above it was prone to nasty spills and injuries, including ‚Äútaking a header‚Äù if you stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>The third and final key advance, then, was to separate the pedals from the wheel. Variations on this ‚Äúsafety bicycle‚Äù, including at least one driven by treadles and levers, were attempted from the 1870s if not before. The first commercially successful model, using the familiar crank and chain design, was produced in 1885 by John Starley. Finally, in 1888, inflatable (pneumatic) tires were introduced by John Dunlop, cushioning the ride and eliminating the last advantage of the penny-farthing.</p>

<p>So, by the end of the 1880s, bicycles had evolved into the form we know them today, with (approximately) equal-sized wheels, pedals, chains, metal frames, wire-spoke wheels, and inflatable rubber tires.</p>

<p>So what can we conclude?</p>

<p><strong>First, the correct design was not obvious.</strong> For centuries, progress was stalled because inventors were all trying to create multi-person four-wheeled carriages, rather than single-person two-wheeled vehicles. It‚Äôs unclear why this was; certainly inventors were copying an existing mode of transportation, but why would they draw inspiration only from the horse-and-carriage, and not from the horse-and-rider? (Some commenters have suggested that it was not obvious that a two-wheeled vehicle would balance, but I find this unconvincing given how many other things people have learned to balance on, from dugout canoes to horses themselves.) It‚Äôs possible (I‚Äôm purely speculating here) that early mechanical inventors had a harder time realizing the fundamental impractiability of the carriage design because they didn‚Äôt have much in the way of mathematical engineering principles to go on, but then again it‚Äôs unclear what led to Drais‚Äôs breakthrough.</p>

<p>And even after Drais hit on the two-wheeled design, it took multiple iterations, which happened over decades, to get to a design that was efficient, comfortable, and safe.</p>

<p><strong>Second, advances in materials and manufacturing were probably necessary for a commercially successful bicycle.</strong> It‚Äôs a bit hard, from where I stand, to untangle which advances in design were made possible by new materials and techniques, and which were simply sparks of inventive imagination that hadn‚Äôt been conceived or developed before. But the fact that people were willing to put up with the precarious high-wheeled design indicates to me that pneumatic tires were crucial. And it‚Äôs plausible to me that advanced metalworking was needed to make small, lightweight chains and gears of high and consistent quality, at an acceptable price‚Äîand that no other design, such as a belt or lever, would have worked instead. It‚Äôs also plausible to me that wooden frames just weren‚Äôt light and strong enough to be practical (I certainly wouldn‚Äôt be eager to ride a wooden bicycle today).</p>

<p>But we can go deeper, and ask the questions that inspired my intense interest in this question in the first place. Why was no one even experimenting with two-wheeled vehicles until the 1800s? And why was no one, as far as we know, even considering the question of human-powered vehicles until the 1400s? Why weren‚Äôt there bicycle mechanics in the 1300s, when there were clockmakers, or at least by the 1500s, when we had watches? Or among the ancient Romans, who built water mills and harvesting machines? Or the Greeks, who built the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism" target="_blank">Antikythera mechanism
</a>? Even if they didn‚Äôt have tires and chains, why weren‚Äôt these societies at least experimenting with draisines? Or even the failed carriage designs?</p>

<p>To even begin to answer this, we have to realize that it‚Äôs part of a much wider phenomenon. I asked the same question of the <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-cotton-gin">cotton gin</a>, which unlike the bicycle did not require advanced materials: it‚Äôs a wooden box, a wire mesh, and a drum with wire teeth; in fact, it was so simple that once the concept was out, plantation owners made bootleg copies by hand (depriving Eli Whitney of most of his patent royalties). The same question can be asked of all of the key inventions of <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/out-of-whole-cloth">textile mechanization</a>; Anton Howes, an economic historian who chimed in on the Twitter thread linked above, has <a href="https://medium.com/@antonhowes/is-innovation-in-human-nature-48c2578e27ba" target="_blank">noted of John Kay‚Äôs flying shuttle</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kay‚Äôs innovation was extraordinary in its simplicity. As the inventor Bennet Woodcroft put it, weaving with an ordinary shuttle had been ‚Äúperformed for upwards of five thousand years, by millions of skilled workmen, without any improvement being made to expedite the operation, until the year 1733‚Äù. All Kay added was some wood and some string. And he applied it to weaving wool, which had been England‚Äôs main industry since the middle ages. He had no special skill, he required no special understanding of science for it, and he faced no special incentive to do it. As for institutions, the flying shuttle was technically illegal because it saved labour, the patent was immediately pirated by competitors to little avail, and Kay was forced to move to France, hounded out of the country by angry weavers who threatened his property and even his life. Kay faced no special incentives‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe even innovated despite some formidable social and legal barriers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are also other stories in which an early attempt at invention was demonstrated, the idea found no backers if it wasn‚Äôt already fully viable, and then development was dropped for decades. Richard Trevithick‚Äôs early, failed experiments with locomotives come to mind.</p>

<p><strong>In light of this, I think the deepest explanation is in general economic and cultural factors.</strong> Regarding economic factors, it seems that there needs to be a certain level of surplus to support the culture-wide research and development effort that creates inventions. Note that Karl von Drais was a baron who apparently had a cushy job and invented in his spare time. This is common of researchers of that era: they were often aristocrats or otherwise independently wealthy (and those who weren‚Äôt had to scramble for support from wealthy patrons). Today we have research labs in both universities and corporations, plus venture capitalists to fund development of new products and services. The moment it becomes clear that a certain type of innovation <em>might</em> be possible, there are multiple teams funded and hustling to bring it to market. There are no multi-decade gaps in the innovation timeline anymore, or at least vastly fewer.</p>

<p>Looking at economic factors on the demand side, surplus also would seem to create markets for new products. Maybe GDP per capita just has to hit a certain point before people even have time, attention and energy to think about new inventions that aren‚Äôt literally putting food on the table, a roof over your head, or a shirt on your back.</p>

<p>Finally, there are cultural factors. Howes says that ‚Äúinnovation is not in human nature, but is instead received. ‚Ä¶ when people do not innovate, it is often simply because <em>it never occurs to them to do so.</em>‚Äù Joel Mokyr says, similarly, that ‚Äú<a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/the-idea-of-progress">progress isn‚Äôt natural</a>‚Äù (and his book on this topic, <a href="https://rootsofprogress.org/books/a-culture-of-growth"><em>A Culture of Growth</em></a>, helped inspire this blog). I agree with both.</p>

<p>Fully elucidating these economic and cultural factors is a major future project of this blog.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>I call it the ‚Äúapplication saturation loop.‚Äù My friend needs a new data analytics job. He refreshes his resume and searches online for ‚Äúdata science jobs Chicago,‚Äù trawling through four or five job aggregator sites ranging from somewhat legitimate to completely illegitimate. He collects about a dozen jobs that could match his skill set, more or less, and he applies. Their ‚Äúeasy apply‚Äù online systems make sending applications relatively painless. They mostly ask him to type out his resume, again and again, in the flattest and most generic way possible. But he doesn‚Äôt hear back from any of the jobs he‚Äôs applied for. He is running out of money. He sends dozens more applications for jobs over the next several weeks. Maybe even 100. He hears back from two companies. They are both obvious scams.</p><p><span>Meanwhile, one of my friend‚Äôs applications becomes one of approximately 200 applications in a hiring pool. (Many other people seem to have clicked the ‚Äúeasy apply‚Äù button.) The hiring manager in charge of the pool becomes overwhelmed ‚Äì no reasonable person could sift through so many resumes ‚Äì so she does what appears to be the smart, fashionable thing and employs an </span><a href="https://skillpool.medium.com/top-10-ai-based-resume-screening-softwares-6642e0b69569" rel="">‚ÄúAI-based screening tool‚Äù or ‚Äúonline resume parser‚Äù</a><span> to sift through her pool of applications.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The tool she selects claims to ‚Äúgo beyond keywords‚Äù to </span><a href="https://www.filtered.ai/blog/ai-resume-screening-fd" rel="">‚Äúidentify applicants based on aptitude.‚Äù</a><span> But of course she has no idea what it‚Äôs really doing.* After some fancy whizzing and whirring, it sends her five applications, deemed the ‚Äúbest‚Äù (By what metric?). My friend‚Äôs resume was not selected, but perhaps it will be by another hiring manager. Until then, his fate ‚Äì his ability to pay rent and, crucially, cover our next round of Miller High Lifes ‚Äì will be largely determined by job search aggregators, faceless algorithms, and the facetious whims of employers who will ask him for as many ‚Äú</span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/daniellaflores/handling-free-work-requests-job-interviews" rel="">sample assignments</a><span>‚Äù as they want before ghosting him forever. There is basically nothing he can do about it.</span></p><p>However unfashionable for me to admit around economists buoyed by ‚Äúgood jobs numbers,‚Äù I think the hiring part of the jobs market is broken. A job posted on one industry job board soon makes its way to 20 job aggregator sites, which are unaffiliated with the role and the firm who posted it. (They source job listings from job boards and company websites and display them on their own platform.) Unless you are lucky enough to have a pre-existing connection to a particular role, you are relying on the site to provide an active, accurate listing and to deliver your application directly to the hiring manager ‚Äî and for the hiring manager to have the time to read it. </p><p>These sites once promised easier access to postings and applications, but now create an opaque maze for candidates (quick‚Äîwhat‚Äôs the difference between Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn, Jobtrees, and Monster?) and a genuine headache for employers (Are you interested in reading dozens of cover letters today?). Looking ahead, I worry about how much these ‚Äútools‚Äù would make life harder in a recession, and about how other trends concerning the future of work might coalesce in harmful ways to candidates and employees. </p><p><span>Completely anecdotally, I‚Äôve observed these issues again and again in the last year. Job aggregator sites encourage candidates to send buckets of generalist applications against the interests of hiring managers who receive an overwhelming number of applications that they cannot distinguish from one another. Job postings are somehow everywhere but hiring managers complain they can‚Äôt find any qualified candidates. Layoffs at prestige firms are announced left and right as companies pivot away from the pandemic‚Äôs free-stimulus-money-for-everyone era (it </span><em>probably</em><span> isn‚Äôt indicating an imminent recession, despite what </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Layoffs/" rel="">r/layoffs</a><span> would have you believe). To me, concern feels like it‚Äôs growing everywhere except the cover of the </span><em>New York Times</em><span>. In fact, a recent survey of 1,500 job candidates by the staffing firm Aerotek found </span><a href="https://www.aerotek.com/en/about-us/news-and-events/news/2023/12/aerotek-fall-job-seeker-survey-job-seekers-say-job-hunt-more-difficult" rel="">70% of people</a><span> find their current job search more difficult than the last, even though people are more qualified than before. For the prospective job switchers out there, the path to a new role has never been more accessible in theory but frustrating in practice.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even traditional economic indicators have begun to tell a story about the worsening broader market. What was once the ‚ÄúGreat Resignation‚Äù during the late pandemic became the </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-07/the-great-resignation-is-now-the-big-stay" rel="">‚ÄúGreat Stay‚Äù</a><span> as employees stay within their own companies instead of switching firms, perhaps due to fears of an impending recession or, I would argue, an inability to secure a better job. It certainly doesn‚Äôt seem like a candidate‚Äôs market anymore, and instead it feels generally safer to stay and accept your mediocre raise that barely meets the annual cost-of-living inflation adjustment.&nbsp;</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png" width="1318" height="450" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:450,&quot;width&quot;:1318,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e621a00-b75a-48c0-b231-0d3a0ce61426_1318x450.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><em>Job postings on Indeed and the BLS‚Äôs own JOLTS data suggests job openings peaked sometime in mid-2022 and have decreased since.</em></figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Recently I read labor economist </span><a href="https://macromostly.substack.com/p/bls-jobs-report-recap-february?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2" rel="">Guy Berger</a><span> identify that unemployment increased to a 2-year high ‚Äî 3.9% ‚Äî in the BLS‚Äôs February jobs report, while Employ America economist </span><a href="https://twitter.com/PrestonMui/status/1765839472569291000" rel="">Preston Mui</a><span> noted that BLS quits and hires indicate </span><em>it actually has gotten harder to switch jobs</em><span> in the last six months.

Kyla Scanlon‚Äôs genius coining of the term ‚Äú</span><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-vibecession-the-self-fulfilling" rel="">vibecession</a><span>‚Äù and subsequent </span><a href="https://kyla.substack.com/p/its-more-than-just-vibes" rel="">analysis</a><span> of it speak to this phenomenon well. There are genuine divergences between economic expectations, theory, and reality. Plenty of understandable reasons contribute to this, which Scanlon notes might include misinformation, outsized media coverage, and conflating ‚Äúinflation going down‚Äù with ‚Äúprices going down.‚Äù But it is unmistakable that consumer sentiment feels much lower than indicators would have you believe. An </span><a href="https://apnorc.org/projects/many-are-uncertain-about-their-financial-futures-as-household-expenses-outpace-earnings/" rel="">AP-NORC poll</a><span> last Fall concluded that 73% of respondents described the current economic status as poor, 66% indicated that their expenses have risen, while only 25% indicated that their income had risen.&nbsp;That‚Äôs worth paying attention to.</span></p><p>Back to the hiring market. Even beyond what I call the ‚Äúapplicant saturation loop‚Äù of more job application tools and thus more job applications (which some people dumbly try to escape via ChatGPT cover letters), this hiring market has some fresh challenges for candidates.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Work from home has been great for a lot of people. But the unpredictability about its future has led firms to make wishy-washy demands about employee location at times and globalize the market beyond belief in others. One friend of mine finally secured a position, only to learn in a final round interview that his team‚Äôs actual location met deep in the suburbs once a week instead of the city. He couldn‚Äôt make it work. One recent&nbsp;</span><a href="https://datapeople.io/hiring-in-a-distributed-world/" rel="">study</a><span> found remote jobs receive over twice the number of applicants for a role than in-person jobs; I strongly suspect the true number is much higher. The pandemic rapidly accelerated the increasingly global nature of jobs. You‚Äôre not competing with software engineering graduates in San Jose for the Google internship; you‚Äôre competing with everyone in the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p>This, I‚Äôm sure, has harmful impacts to employees. Why invest in them long-term when they‚Äôre vastly more replaceable? There is always some person who is qualified in some place where the cost of living is lower. </p><p><span>As roles go global, employers must resort to being increasingly finicky about hiring. Gone is the ZIRP era, money is real again! Maybe there‚Äôs a recession around the corner! Hiring decisions seem more serious than they were just a couple years ago, and this means candidates are subject to more tests to validate their ability. Hence more rounds of interviews, more demand for free labor ‚Äì ahem, sorry, I mean ‚Äúsample project work.‚Äù </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/one-way-recorded-video-job-interviews-fair-legal-theresa-mcfarlane#:~:text=One%2Dway%2C%20recorded%20video%20job%20interviews%20are%20becoming%20increasingly%20popular,and%20legality%20of%20these%20interviews." rel="">One-way video interviews</a><span> are proliferating widely as the number of applicants for each role increases, making it easier for employers to stack up content (and effort) from candidates and take even longer to sift through it (Who wants to watch 100 videos of people talking about their college internship?) Then at the end, there‚Äôs no culture of providing meaningful applicant feedback, either. So for some candidates, the cycle repeats endlessly.</span></p><p><span>People will keep trying to job-hop because it‚Äôs generally in their best interest, even if it gives employers less incentive to invest in their employees. According to a recent Gallup </span><a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/231587/millennials-job-hopping-generation.aspx" rel="">report</a><span>, 21% of surveyed millennials reported changing jobs within the past year ‚Äì which is three times higher than any other generation. I am, maybe controversially, fairly opposed to job-hopping. I think meaningful work and growth take a lot of time. But I‚Äôm also increasingly aware that the single best way to get the salary increase you‚Äôre owed is by job-hopping (and it‚Äôs even getting harder to do that). New positions are typically market-rate salaries, while typical raises often </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20220720-the-case-for-job-hopping" rel="">don‚Äôt match market rates</a><span>. One study of </span><a href="https://money.yahoo.com/job-switchers-are-the-big-winners-202624616.html" rel="">18 million worker salaries</a><span> by Yahoo Finance showed job hopper wages in 2021 outpaced those who stayed in their role. (In some industries, workers received almost a 12% pay increase for job hopping.)</span></p><p>Job hopping and one‚Äôs experience of the hiring market more broadly can certainly be benefitted by networking. I‚Äôve never found it as painful as some people say, but I have the privilege of working in an industry that I‚Äôm genuinely interested in. But the ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù that‚Äôs generally most relevant here is the effective kind, where your friend or your Dad knows an employer or you who went to specific target school. In this way, networking will always favor the already-privileged. There‚Äôs maybe an argument that LinkedIn has flattened the playing field a bit, but I have personal doubts about the real value of such shallow connections. (But I‚Äôm happy to be proven wrong on this.)</p><p>If there is a better model out there for candidates, it is probably applying to fewer but more specific jobs (but being occasionally willing to take risks on yourself all the same!). Accepting that you will be relevant to fewer positions, but a greater value-add to those which you are a fit for, seems to be a better allocation of time. For employers, the picture is a bit more complicated. Reshaping how we apply for jobs means potentially advertising roles with more serious ‚Äúcandidate requirements‚Äù to limit applicants ‚Äî but not so serious that you significantly reduce the diversity of your hiring pool. We should also be working towards a cultural norm where work isn‚Äôt handed to candidates unless they are deemed very serious contenders for the position, and their work is fairly compensated. Asking someone to perform a day of unpaid labor for you is not just ‚Äúinformative,‚Äù it‚Äôs also exploitative.&nbsp;</p><p>As we continue to barrel into an uncertain economic future (don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs an election year!), it‚Äôs critical to consider how the current structure of our jobs market impacts those who are the least connected. Our attempts to bring universal access and universal candidacy may have backfired somewhat by adding layers of complication to people who just want to be considered for roles and compensated for their labor. But only once we acknowledge these challenges can we start to address them.</p><p><em>*Other ways this tool can be used, according to its marketing: ‚ÄúAI can authenticate candidates by analyzing public data that serve as proof of candidates‚Äô claims. Professional networks like LinkedIn, Meetup, AngelList, Github, and others can be checked for work experience and portfolios. Social media, including Facebook and Twitter, also serve as evidence to show that applicants are who they say they are.‚Äù Well, do you think it‚Äôs helping your candidacy?</em></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg" width="1456" height="819" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:819,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;office with cubicles in primary colors&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="office with cubicles in primary colors" title="office with cubicles in primary colors" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F578f2f10-9567-4d0b-9515-1270cef4b99b_2560x1440.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Like a Microsoft Teams meeting but in real-life (I love these retro office photos in </span><a href="https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/retro-offices-youll-either-love-or-hate" rel="">Architectural Digest</a><span>)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p><em>Future Redis releases will continue to offer free and permissive use of the source code under dual RSALv2 and SSPLv1 licenses; these releases will combine advanced data types and processing engines previously only available in Redis Stack.</em></p>



<p>Beginning today, all future versions of Redis will be released with source-available licenses. Starting with Redis 7.4, Redis will be dual-licensed under the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/">Redis Source Available License (RSALv2)</a> and <a href="https://redis.com/legal/server-side-public-license-sspl/">Server Side Public License (SSPLv1)</a>. Consequently, Redis will no longer be distributed under the three-clause Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD).</p>



<p>From day one, Redis has provided a foundation of performance and simplicity for the applications and data infrastructure that power the modern Internet. Now, 15 years later, we‚Äôre proud to serve millions of developers across the globe by supporting real-time applications the world depends on every day. We have already implemented dual licensing for our advanced Redis modules under the Redis Stack distribution, which has been well received by the community. In fact, more than 50% of redis.io downloads ‚Äì from Redis 6 and beyond ‚Äì&nbsp;come from Redis Stack. We now believe that extending this licensing to Redis itself will enable us to continue to evolve the most holistic set of data models, processing engines, and developer capabilities for our users.</p>



<p>The new source-available licenses allow us to sustainably provide permissive use of our source code. We‚Äôre leading Redis into its next phase of development as a real-time data platform with a unified set of clients, tools, and core Redis product offerings. The <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis">Redis source code</a> will continue to be freely available to developers, customers, and partners through Redis Community Edition. Future Redis source-available releases will unify core Redis with Redis Stack, including search, JSON, vector, probabilistic, and time-series data models in one free, easy-to-use package as downloadable software. This will allow anyone to easily use Redis across a variety of contexts, including as a high-performance key/value and document store, a powerful query engine, and a low-latency vector database powering generative AI applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The success of Redis has created a unique set of challenges. Redis has been sponsoring the bulk of development alongside a dynamic community of developers eager to contribute. However, the majority of Redis‚Äô commercial sales are channeled through the largest cloud service providers, who commoditize Redis‚Äô investments and its open source community. Despite efforts to support a community-led governance model, and our desire to <a href="https://redis.com/blog/redis-license-bsd-will-remain-bsd/">maintain the BSD license</a>, delivering multiple software distributions simultaneously ‚Äì&nbsp;across open-source, source-available, and commercial software optimized for different on-premises and cloud platforms&nbsp;‚Äì is at odds with our ability to drive Redis successfully into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the new license, cloud service providers hosting Redis offerings will no longer be permitted to use the source code of Redis free of charge. For example, cloud service providers will be able to deliver Redis 7.4 only after agreeing to licensing terms with Redis, the maintainers of the Redis code. These agreements will underpin support for existing integrated solutions and provide full access to forthcoming Redis innovations.</p>



<p>‚ÄúWe look forward to continuing our collaborative work to support developers with the latest data storage and management innovations,‚Äù said Julia Liuson, President, Developer Division at Microsoft. ‚ÄúOur collaboration continues to support integrated solutions like Azure Cache for Redis, and will provide Microsoft customers with exclusive access to expanded features within Redis offerings.‚Äù</p>



<p>In practice, nothing changes for the Redis developer community who will continue to enjoy permissive licensing under the dual license. At the same time, all the Redis client libraries under the responsibility of Redis will remain open source licensed. Redis will continue to support its vast partner ecosystem ‚Äì including managed service providers and system integrators ‚Äì with exclusive access to all future releases, updates, and features developed and delivered by Redis through its <a href="https://redis.com/partners/#becomeapartner">Partner Program</a>. There is no change for existing Redis Enterprise customers.</p>



<p>Our new licensing approach strikes the best balance between making Redis source code broadly available, supporting the developer community with minimal limitations, and protecting our ability to continue investing in feature-rich, free-of-charge software and enterprise products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we have always done, our team, our community, and our customers and partners will continue to lead the way in creating, advancing, and deploying Redis as the leading real-time data platform.</p>



<p>For more information, please read the FAQ on the license change below.</p>



<div>
<div>
<p>1. What did Redis announce today?</p>



<div>
<p>Redis announced a transition from the BSD 3-Clause License to a dual license approach for Redis core software, using the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/rsalv2-agreement/">Redis Source Available License version 2</a> (RSALv2) or the Server Side Public License version 1 (SSPLv1) starting with Redis v7.4 and for all future releases of Redis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RSALv2 is a permissive non-copyleft license, allowing the right to ‚Äúuse, copy, distribute, make available, and prepare derivative works of the software‚Äù and has only two primary limitations. Under RSALv2, you may not:</p>



<p>-Commercialize the software or provide it to others as a managed service; and</p>



<p>-Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices.</p>



<p>Our dual license approach is not new; we released Redis modules (including RedisJSON, Redis Stack, etc.) under the dual licenses on Nov. 15, 2022. Now, we are moving to dual licensing for all our freely available software. We believe that the permissive approach of RSALv2 and the standard wording we use to define its limitations solve many of the challenges raised by our community.</p>



<p>This dual-license approach allows users to choose between a permissive but less well-known license, RSALv2, or a more commonly used but copyleft license, such as SSPLv1.</p>



<p>To be clear, neither RSALv2 nor SSPL is an OSI-approved license, and each has its restrictions. Simply put, RSALv2 places some limits on commercializing the software. SSPLv1 requires that if you provide the product as a service, you must publicly release any modifications and the source code of your management layers under SSPL.</p>



<p>The necessity of source-available licenses in the cloud era has been discussed many times, and we are proud to contribute to this effort by adopting standards developers already know and use. We believe the dual license provides clarity and flexibility for Redis developers in how they can leverage our latest technologies.</p>



<p>Other permissively licensed technologies associated with Redis such as various language-specific client libraries, Terraform and Pulumi providers, and more are unaffected by this change.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, starting with Redis 8 we plan to include in our offerings, by default, new data types and processing engines which previously were licensed under the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 as part of Redis Stack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a result, we are also announcing the end of life for Redis Stack once Redis 8 is available, as a result of this change. It will no longer be necessary to provide a separate build of these capabilities as they will be part of Redis itself starting with Redis 8.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>2. Why is Redis Inc. making this change?</p>



<div>
<p>We want all developers to have access to the best technology we have to offer. But, we had to do all of these module gymnastics to advance things which honestly should be in the core of Redis itself. We weren‚Äôt being true to the original manifesto ‚Äî we‚Äôre against complexity. So, this change aligns the licensing in a way that we can simplify the packaging and release of additional data types and more in a way that is simple and consistent.</p>



<p>We strongly believe in the value of openly sharing source code and enabling practitioners to solve their problems, build communities, and create transparency. Redis provides feature-rich products to the community for free, and that development is made possible by our commercial customers who partner with us. By shifting to this license, Redis can better manage commercial uses of our source code and continue to invest in our thriving community of practitioners, some of whom are also contributors, in a manner that will not impede their work.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>3. What are the implications of this change for end users of Redis‚Äô open source products?</p>



<div><p>For end users who are using Redis‚Äô open source version of Redis and new releases using either of the dual licenses for their internal or personal usage, there is no change.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>4. What are the implications of this change for third-party libraries which leverage Redis?</p>



<div><p>For integration partners who built client libraries or other integrations with Redis, there is no change.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>5. What are the implications of this change for commercial customers of Redis?</p>



<div><p>For commercial customers of Redis there is no change. Those customers get our technology under separately negotiated licensing terms.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>6. Who is impacted by this change?</p>



<div><p>Organizations providing competitive offerings to Redis will no longer be permitted to use new versions of the source code of Redis free of charge under either of the dual licenses. Commercial licensing terms are available and can enable use cases beyond the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 license limitations. If you are building a solution that leverages Redis, but does not specifically compete with Redis itself, there is no impact. If you have specific concerns or questions that you wish to discuss, please email <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>7. What is a ‚Äúcompetitive offering‚Äù as defined under the Redis RSALv2 or SSPLv1 licenses?</p>



<div><p>A ‚Äúcompetitive offering‚Äù is a product that is sold to third parties, including through paid support arrangements, that is derived from the Redis‚Äô code-base and significantly overlaps the capabilities of a Redis commercial product. For example, this definition would include hosting or embedding Redis as part of a solution that is sold competitively against our commercial versions of Redis (either Redis Enterprise Software or Redis Cloud).&nbsp;Custom licensing terms are also available to provide more clarity and enable use cases beyond the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 limitations. If you need further clarification with respect to a particular use case, you can email <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>8. What products will be covered by RSALv2 or SSPLv1 in their next release?</p>



<div><p>This change effectively aligns the licensing of all of our source available modules with the core of Redis.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>9. What is the SSPLv1 License?</p>



<div><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Public_License">SSPL </a>is based on the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), with a modified Section 13 that requires that those making SSPL-licensed software available to third-parties (modified or not) as part of a ‚Äúservice‚Äù must release the source code for the entirety of the service, including without limitation all ‚Äúmanagement software, user interfaces, application program interfaces, automation software, monitoring software, backup software, storage software and hosting software, all such that a user could run an instance of the service using the Service Source Code you make available‚Äù, under the SSPL. MongoDB is the publisher of this license. You can find their original FAQ about the license <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq">here</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>10. If I modify the source code of software licensed under the SSPL, can I redistribute my modified version under another license?</p>



<div>
<p>No. Your modified version consists of the original software and your modifications, which together constitute a derivative work of the original software. The SSPL license does not grant you the right to redistribute under another license.</p>



<p>However, if you choose to use the RSALv2 license (under the dual license), you may modify and redistribute the code, provided that you don‚Äôt make the functionality of the Software or a Modified version available to third parties as a service or distribute the Software or a Modified version in a manner that makes the functionality of the Software available to third parties</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>11. Can I continue to use versions of the products that were provided under the original 3-clause BSD license?</p>



<div><p>Yes. The license change is not retroactive. This means all source code and releases prior to the change remain under the 3-clause BSD license. You may continue to use those versions indefinitely under the original license, as long as you abide by its terms and conditions. Redis plans to continue to provide security updates and address other critical defects within these releases until Redis Community Edition is available per our current <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/security/policy">security policy</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>12. Will Redis backport security patches to previous releases under the 3-clause BSD license?</p>



<div><p>Redis will continue to backport critical security patches, as available, to existing versions under the 3-clause license until Redis Community Edition 9.0 is released, consistent with the <a href="https://github.com/redis/redis/security/policy">current security policy</a>. Any patches after that date will be provided under the new dual license.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>13. Does Redis still believe in open source?</p>



<div>
<p>First, we openly acknowledge that this change means Redis is no longer open source under the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd/">OSI definition</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Second, we give away more technology than we monetize. Every day someone is using a free version of Redis in amazing and incredibly innovative ways and we applaud that. We will continue to invest to ensure that Redis remains a compelling and competitive platform for years to come.</p>



<p>Third, changing the license term to protect one‚Äôs brand and IP has become a natural part of the evolution of many open source projects in order for commercial entities which back those technologies to survive and thrive as businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, Redis remains a proponent of the open source philosophy and maintains a large number of open source projects, including many of the language specific client libraries (see https://github.com/redis) used with Redis, integration tooling such as the Redis Input-Output Tool (see https://github.com/redis-developer) and more. For those who wish to contribute, we remain open to accepting future contributions ‚Äì as we have done with our source available modules over the past five years.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div>
<p>14. How does Redis now refer to the freely available versions of products that were formerly known as open source (or OSS)?</p>



<div><p>We have referred to versions of our products as either open source (OSS), Enterprise, or Cloud. Redis v7.2 and prior releases will continue to be called Redis OSS. Starting with Redis v7.4, we will refer to the open, freely available versions as Redis Community Edition. Both the RSALv2 and SSPL v1 licenses provide open and free access to the underlying source code of Redis Community Edition. However, it does not meet the definition of open source as defined by OSI, and that is why we will refer to the products as the ‚Äúcommunity edition‚Äù rather than the ‚Äúopen source‚Äù edition, as we did previously. There are many references to open source on our websites, and we are actively working to clarify these language changes in the coming weeks.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>15. How do I work with Redis to offer managed services?</p>



<div><p>Integration and managed service provider partners can continue building, operating, and delivering solutions that leverage Redis Community Edition and Enterprise in a non-competitive offering by entering into a partnership with Redis. Community and Enterprise level partners will continue to benefit from incentives, technical training, certification, and sales training. Crucially, partners will receive exclusive access to forthcoming Redis technologies, features, and releases that will be protected under the dual license. To become a Redis partner or learn more about our partner benefits, please visit our <a href="https://redis.com/partners/#becomeapartner">Partner Program site</a>. For existing partners with any questions regarding the licensing change, please email <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>16. I‚Äôm building (or have built) a product that embeds Redis, and I‚Äôm concerned you may view it as competitive. How can I get clarity as to whether my product will violate the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 licenses?</p>



<div><p>Please reach out to us. We are happy to speak with you. The best way to begin the conversation is at <a href="mailto:redis_licensing@redis.com">redis_licensing@redis.com</a>. We can provide timely feedback to your questions and discuss constructive solutions, including potential exemptions and/or partnership arrangements.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>17. I am the author of an open-source project that uses Redis in a non-competitive way. If someone else uses my project to produce a competitive product or hosted service (e.g., starts using my project in their SaaS solution), am I at risk of being considered competitive and violating the dual license? Do I need to track all users of my project and report suspected infringing use?</p>



<div><p>Only those who are embedding or hosting Redis products in a competitive manner are in violation of the license. The violation does not extend to a project owner who is not doing so and does not require asking others to do so on its behalf. The project owner has no obligation to monitor or report on how others are using their project.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>18. Can I continue to provide professional services around Redis products?</p>



<div><p>Yes. We have a large ecosystem of systems integrator partners that provide consulting and professional services to help users deploy, manage, and operate our products for their internal use. The change to our license is not intended to deter partners from providing those services, and we will continue to encourage and support these types of systems integrator partners. Instead, the RSALv2 simply prevents embedding or hosting our community products in a manner competitive with ours.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>19. Can I mix the code made available under either RSALv2 or SSPLv1 with code provided under a different license (i.e., Apache, MPL, etc.) in my project?</p>



<div><p>Yes, provided that each of the components keep their own license, and you do not mix the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 code with strong copyleft licensed code such as GPL. With respect to some permissive licenses like Apache, you may also provide the whole program under RSALv2 or SSPLv1, but include a notice for the Apache portion (this is possible because Apache, unlike some other open source licenses, grants the right to sublicense). Keep in mind that if you mix code under different licenses, you may not be able to re-distribute it in a way that complies with all the licenses.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>20. Can I host Redis as a service internal to my organization?</p>



<div><p>Yes. The terms of the RSALv2 or SSPLv1 allow for all non-production and production usage, except for providing competitive offerings to third parties that embed or host our software. Hosting the products for the internal use of your organization is permitted. An organization includes its affiliates and subsidiaries. This means one division can host Redis for use by another internal division.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>21. What if Redis releases a new product or feature in the future that makes my project competitive?</p>



<div><p>If Redis creates an offering in the future that is competitive with a product you are already offering in production, your continued use of the hosted or embedded Redis product will not be considered a violation of the RSALv2 or SSPLv1, as long as the version you are using was released before Redis released its new offering.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>22. Are there updated requirements for the usage of ‚ÄúRedis‚Äù in my product name?</p>



<div><p>Yes, there are updated requirements on the use of ‚ÄúRedis‚Äù in product names. You can no longer use ‚ÄúRedis‚Äù or ‚Äúfor Redis‚Äù in your product name, but you can use the name ‚ÄúRedis‚Äù in your product descriptions or specify that your product is Redis-compatible or based on legacy-Redis. Additional information around usage of the Redis name and logo can be found in our <a href="https://redis.com/legal/trademark-policy/">Trademark Policy</a>.</p></div>
</div>



<div>
<p>23. Where can I learn more about this announcement or ask further questions?</p>




</div>



<div>
<p>24. Will Redis accept community contributions under the new license?</p>



<div><p>Redis remains a proponent of the open source philosophy and maintains a large number of open source projects. For those who wish to contribute, we remain open to accepting future contributions ‚Äì as we have done with our source available modules over the past five years.Going forward, acceptance of the <a href="https://redis.com/legal/redis-software-grant-and-contributor-license-agreement/">contributor license agreement</a> (CLA) by the contributor is necessary in order for us to consider the contribution.</p></div>

<p><b>Knowledge</b> is a web application that automatically extract content you interact with from various social media platforms, including GitHub, HackerNews, Zotero, and Twitter. It creates a search engine, coupled with a knowledge graph that enables to navigate through documents and automatically extracted tags.
</p>
<p dir="auto">A live version of <a href="https://raphaelsty.github.io/knowledge/" rel="nofollow">my personal knowledge graph</a> is available online.</p>
<p>
The web app is hosted with Fly.io, and its GitHub action workflow calls APIs from Twitter, GitHub, HackerNews, and Zotero on a daily basis to extract content from the user's starred repositories, upvoted posts, uploaded documents, and liked tweets. The extracted content is tagged to enhance the search experience, and the updated version of the web app is pushed automatically.
</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h3><a id="user-content-how-it-works" aria-label="Permalink: How it works" href="#how-it-works"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Twice a day, a dedicated github workflow extracts:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>GitHub stars</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Twitter likes</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>HackerNews upvotes</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Zotero records</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The data generated by the workflow of this tool is stored in various files located in the database directory. Specifically, the records are exported to the file <code>database/database.json</code>, while the knowledge graph of topics is saved in the file <code>database/triples.json</code>. Additionally, the workflow generates a search engine and saves it as <code>database/retriever.pkl</code>. Finally, the updated state of the application is pushed to the cloud provider Fly.io and the dedicated GitHub page is updated accordingly. The cost of hosting the application is under 8$ per month. It may increase if a large number of users query your bookmarks 24/7. Costs can be bounded via Fly.io and OpenAI dashboards.

<p>
To deploy this tool, the first step is to fork the repository and clone it locally. The next step involves defining secrets in the repository configurations (fork) for the different APIs that the system requests. The application requires several secrets to access the different APIs. While it is possible to skip some of the secrets, it is necessary to set <code>FLY_API_TOKEN</code> and <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code>. If you do not plan to use ChatGPT, you can leave <code>OPENAI_API_KEY</code> empty. It is important to set secrets as repository secrets and not as environment secrets.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="NOUVEAU" src="https://www.phoronix.com/assets/categories/nouveau.webp" width="100" height="100"></p><p>
Red Hat's display driver team has recently been devising plans for Nova, a new to-be-developed Linux DRM kernel driver written in Rust for open-source NVIDIA graphics support as the successor/replacement to Nouveau for newer NVIDIA GPU generations supporting the GPU System Processor (GSP). Making this effort all the more involved is being written in Rust at a time when various kernel abstractions are still being devised and not yet upstreamed.
</p><p>
Nova is ultimately aiming to be a modern open-source NVIDIA Linux DRM driver for Turing GPUs and newer (RTX 2000 series) where there is the GPU System Processor (GSP) support. The Nouveau DRM driver recently mainlined optional support for the GSP -- or mandatory support beginning with the latest RTX 40 series -- while Nova will be a modern replacement, written in Rust, and without the Nouveau baggage that's built up over the years in supporting NVIDIA GPUs going back to its early days.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2024&amp;image=nova" alt="Nova"></p>
<p>This Rust-based GSP-only driver is promising looking out well into the future for hopefully being more performant and capable than the Nouveau driver, similar to the forward-focused Intel Xe driver doing away with all the cruft built up over the years in the i915 Direct Rendering Manager code.
</p><p>
By going with Rust, the Red Hat developers involved hope it will boast better memory safety and in turn better maintainability and a lower barrier for new developers to become involved.</p><p>Focusing just on GSP-capable GPUs also simplifies the driver development with much of the hardware initialization/management left up to the GSP and its firmware/microcode rather than being programmed by the device driver. The Nouveau driver will continue to exist for those on older NVIDIA graphics cards.
</p><p>
While there is the Apple Silicon DRM driver being developed by the Asahi crew in Rust, that too is out-of-tree. The challenge with no upstream Rust DRM driver yet -- or other major full-featured Rust kernel driver -- is the lack of various abstractions. For some areas Rust kernel abstractions exist but haven't yet been upstreamed.
</p><p>
In beginning to work through the necessary abstractions for the Nova driver, Red Hat's Danilo Krummrich published a mailing list post entitled "<a href="https://lore.kernel.org/dri-devel/Zfsj0_tb-0-tNrJy@cassiopeiae/">Nova and staging Rust abstractions</a>" for walking through the different Git trees with Rust abstractions for DRM, device abstractions, PCI, etc.  The early stage Nova code itself continues to be developed via <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/drm/nova">drm/nova on FreeDesktop.org</a>. It will be interesting to see how Nova pans out over time.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">GritQL comes from our experiences with conducting large scale refactors and migrations.</p>
<p dir="auto">Usually, migrations start with exploratory work to figure out the scope of the problem‚Äîoften using simple grep searches. These are easy to start with, but most migrations end up accumulating additional requirements like ensuring the right packages are imported and excluding cases which don‚Äôt have a viable migration path.</p>
<p dir="auto">Eventually, any complex migration ends up being a full codemod program written with a tool like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift">jscodeshift</a>. This comes with its own problems:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Most of the exploratory work has to be abandoned as you figure out how to represent your original regex search as an AST.</li>
<li>Reading/writing a codemod requires mentally translating from AST names back to what source code actually looks like.</li>
<li>Most frameworks are not composable, so you‚Äôre stuck copying patterns back and forth.</li>
<li>Performance is often an afterthought, so iterating on a large codemod can be painfully slow.</li>
<li>Codemod frameworks are language-specific, so if you‚Äôre hopping between multiple languages‚Äîor trying to migrate a shared API‚Äîyou have to learn different frameworks.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">GritQL is our attempt to develop a powerful middle ground:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Exploratory analysis is easy: just put a code snippet in backticks and use <code>$metavariables</code> for holes you want to represent.</li>
<li>Incrementally add complexity by introducing side conditions with where clauses.</li>
<li>Reuse named patterns to avoid rebuilding queries, and use shared patterns from our <a href="https://github.com/getgrit/stdlib">standard library</a> for common tasks like ensuring modules are imported.</li>
<li>Written in Rust for maximum performance: rewrite millions of lines of code in seconds.</li>

	<p>
Hello! I‚Äôm Oleksandr Kaleniuk and I‚Äôm a C++holic. I have been writing in C++ for <span id="years1">17</span> years and for all those <span id="years2">17</span> years I‚Äôve been struggling to get rid of this devastating addiction.
	</p>
	
	<p>
It all started in late 2005 with a 3D space simulator engine. The engine had everything C++ had in 2005.  Three-star pointers, eight layers of dependency, and C-style macros everywhere. There were assembly bits too. Iterators Stepanov-style and meta-code Alexandrescu-style. The code had everything. Except, of course, for the answer to the most important question: why?
	</p>
	<p>
In a while, even that question was answered. Just not as ‚Äúwhat for‚Äù but rather as ‚Äúhow come‚Äù. As it turned out, the engine has been written for about 8 years by 5 different teams. And every team brought their favorite fad to the project wrapping the old code into fashionably styled wrappers but adding little value for the engine itself.
	</p>
	<p>
At first, I was honestly trying to grok every little thing. That was not a gratifying experience, not at all, and at some point, I gave up. I was still closing tasks, and fixing bugs. Can‚Äôt say that I was very productive, only productive enough not to get fired. But then my boss asked me: ‚ÄúDo you want to rewrite some of the shader code from Assembly to GLSG?‚Äù I thought god knows what this GLSL looks like but it couldn‚Äôt possibly be worse than C++ and said yes. It wasn‚Äôt worse.
	</p>
	<p>
And this kind of became a pattern. I was still mostly writing in C++ but every time someone asked me ‚ÄúDo you want to do that non-C++ thing?‚Äù I was ‚ÄúSure!‚Äù. And then I did do that thing whatever it was. I wrote in C89, MASM32, C#, PHP, Delphi, ActionScript, JavaScript, Erlang, Python, Haskell, D, Rust, and even that outrageously bad InstallShield scripting language. I wrote in VisualBasic, in bash, and in a few proprietary languages, I can‚Äôt even legally talk about. I even made one myself by accident. I made a simple Lisp-style interpreter to help game designers automate resource loading, and went on a vacation. When I was back, they were writing the whole game scenes in this interpreter so we had to support it for a while.
	</p>
	<p>
So for the last 17 years, I was honestly trying to quit C++ but every time, after I tried a new shiny thing, I was coming back. Nevertheless, I do think that writing in C++ is a bad habit. It is unsafe, not as effective as it is thought of, and it wastes a terrible amount of a programmer‚Äôs mental capacity on things that have nothing to do with making software. Do you know that in MSVC <b>uint16_t(50000) + uin16_t(50000) == -1794967296</b>? Do you know why? Yeah, that‚Äôs what I thought.
	</p>
	<p>
I believe that it is the moral responsibility of long-time C++ programmers to discourage the young generation from making C++ their profession pretty much as it is the moral responsibility of alcoholics who can‚Äôt quit to warn the youth about the danger.
	</p>
	<p>
But why can‚Äôt I just quit then? What‚Äôs the matter? The matter is, none of the languages, especially the so-called ‚ÄúC++ killers‚Äù give any real advantage over C++ in the modern world. All those new languages are mostly focused on holding a programmer on a leash for their own good. This is fine, except that writing good code with bad programmers is a problem of the XX century when transistor density grew twofold every 18 months, and programmers‚Äô headcount grew twofold every 5 years.
	</p>
	<p>
We‚Äôre living in the XXI century now. We have more experienced programmers in the world than ever before in history. And we need efficient software now more than ever too.
	</p>
	<p>
In the XX century, things were simpler. You have an idea, you wrap it into some UI and sell it as a desktop product. Is it slow? Who cares! In eighteen months desktops will become 2x faster anyway. What matters is to enter the market, to start selling features, and preferably without bugs. In that climate, sure, if a compiler keeps programmers from making bugs ‚Äì good! Because bugs don‚Äôt bring in the cash, and you have to pay your programmers whether they add features or bugs anyway.
	</p>
	<p>
Now things are different. You have an idea, you wrap it in a Docker container and run it in a cloud. Now you get your revenue from people running your software if it makes their problems go away. Even if it does one thing but does it right, you‚Äôll get paid. You don‚Äôt have to stuff your product with made-up features just to sell a new version of it. On the other hand, the one who pays for your code ineffectiveness is now yourself. Every suboptimal routine shows in your AWS bill.
	</p>
	<p>
So in the new climate, you now need fewer features, but you also need better performance for whatever features you have.
	</p>
	<p>
And suddenly it turns out that all the ‚ÄúC++ killers‚Äù, even those which I wholeheartedly love and respect like Rust, Julia, and D, do not address the problems of the XXI century. They are still stuck in the XX. They do help you write more features with fewer bugs, yes, but they are not of much help when you need to squeeze the very last FLOPS from the hardware you rent.
	</p>
	<p>
As such, they just have a competitive advantage over C++. Or, for that matter, even over each other. Most of them, for instance, Rust, Julia, and Cland even share the same backend. No one wins a car race if all the racers sit in the same car.
	</p>
	<p>
So, which technologies do give you a competitive advantage over C++ or, speaking generally, all the traditional ahead-of-time compilers? 
	</p>
	<p>
Good question!
	</p>
	<p>
Glad you asked.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
C++ killer number 1. Spiral
	</h2>
	<p>
But before we go with Spiral itself, let‚Äôs check how well your intuition works. Which do you think is faster: a standard C++ sine function, or a 4-piece polynomial model of a sine?
	</p>

	<div>
	<pre><span>// version 1</span>
auto y = std::sin(x);
 
<span>// version 2</span>
y = -0.000182690409228785*x*x*x*x*x*x*x
    +0.00830460224186793*x*x*x*x*x
    -0.166651012143690*x*x*x
    +x;
</pre>
	</div>
	
	

	<p>
Next question. What works faster, using logical operations with short-circuiting, or making the logical expression into an arithmetic one?
	</p>

	<div>
	<pre><span>// version 1</span>	
  if (xs[i] == 1 
   &amp;&amp; xs[i+1] == 1 
   &amp;&amp; xs[i+2] == 1 
   &amp;&amp; xs[i+3] == 1) // xs are bools stored as ints
 
<span>// version 2</span>
  inline int sq(int x) {
      return x*x;
  }
 
  if(sq(xs[i] - 1) 
   + sq(xs[i+1] - 1) 
   + sq(xs[i+2] - 1) 
   + sq(xs[i+3] - 1) == 0)
</pre>
	</div>
	
	

	<p>
And one more. What sorts triplets faster: a swap-sort with branching or a branchless index-sort?
	</p>

	<div>
	<pre><span>// version 1</span>
    if(s[0] &gt; s[1])
        swap(s[0], s[1]);
    if(s[1] &gt; s[2])
        swap(s[1], s[2]);
    if(s[0] &gt; s[1])
        swap(s[0], s[1]);
 
<span>// version 2</span>
    const auto a = s[0];
    const auto b = s[1];
    const auto c = s[2];
    s[int(a &gt; b) + int(a &gt; c)] = a;
    s[int(b &gt;= a) + int(b &gt; c)] = b;
    s[int(c &gt;= a) + int(c &gt;= b)] = c;
</pre>
	</div>
	
	
	<p>
If you answered all the questions decisively and without even thinking or googling, then your intuition failed you. You didn‚Äôt see the trap. None of these questions have a definite answer without context.
	</p>
	<p>
1. A polynomial model is <nobr><a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/challenge_your_performance_intuition_with_cpp_sine.html">3 times faster</a></nobr> than the standard sine if built with clang 11 with <b>-O2 -march=native</b> and ran on Intel Core i7-9700F. But if built with NVCC with <b>--use-fast-math</b> and on GPU namely GeForce GTX 1050 Ti Mobile, the standard sine is 10 times faster than the model.
	</p>
	<p>
2. Trading short-circuited logic for vectorized arithmetic makes sense on i7 too. Makes the snippet work twice as fast. But on ARMv7 with the same clang and <b>-O2</b>, the standard logic is <nobr><a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/using_logical_operators_for_logical_operations_is_good.html">25% faster</a></nobr> than the micro-optimization.
	</p>
	<p>
3. And with index-sort vs. swap-sort, the index-sort is 3 times faster on Intel, and swap-sort is <nobr><a href="https://wordsandbuttons.online/check_if_your_performance_intuition_still_works_with_cuda.html">3 times faster</a></nobr> on GeForce.
	</p>
	<p>
So the dear micro-optimizations we all love so much may both speed up our code by factor 3, and slow it down 90%. It all depends on the context. How wonderful it would be if a compiler could pick the best alternative for us so e. g. the index-sort would miraculously turn into swap-sort when we switch the build target. But a compiler can't possibly do that.
	</p>
	<p>
1. Even if we allow the compiler to reimplement sine as a polynomial model, to trade precision for speed, it still doesn‚Äôt know our target precision. In C++, we can‚Äôt say that ‚Äúthis function is allowed to have that error‚Äù. All we have are compiler flags like ‚Äú--use-fast-math‚Äù and only in the scope of a translation unit.
	</p>
	<p>
2. In the second example, the compiler doesn‚Äôt know that our values are limited to either 0 or 1 and can‚Äôt possibly propose the optimization we can. We could have probably hinted at it by using a proper bool type but that would have been a completely different problem.
	</p>
	<p>
3. And in the third example, the pieces of code are vastly different to be recognized as synonymous. We detailed the code too much. If it were just std::sort, this would already have given the compiler more freedom to choose the algorithm. But it wouldn‚Äôt have chosen either index-sort not swap sort since they are both inefficient on large arrays and std::sort works with a generic iterable container.
	</p>
	<p>
And that‚Äôs how we get to <a href="https://www.spiral.net/">Spiral</a>. It is a joint project of Carnegie Mellon University and Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule Z√ºrich. TL&amp;DR: signal processing experts got bored of rewriting their favorite algorithms for every new piece of hardware by hand and wrote a program that does this work for them. The program takes a high-level description of an algorithm, and a detailed description of the hardware architecture, and optimizes the code until it makes the most efficient algorithm implementation for the hardware specified.
	</p>
	<p>
An important distinction between Fortran and alikes, Spiral really solves an optimization problem in the mathematical sense. It defines run time as a target function and looks for its global optimum in the factor space of implementation variants limited by the hardware architecture. This is something compilers never actually do.
	</p>
	<p>
A compiler doesn‚Äôt look for the true optimum. It optimizes the code guided by the heuristics it was taught by the programmers. Essentially a compiler doesn‚Äôt work as a machine searching for the optimal solution, it rather works as an assembly programmer. A good compiler works like a good assembly programmer, but that‚Äôs it.
	</p>
	<p>
Spiral is a research project. It is limited in scope and budget. But the results it shows are already impressive. On the fast Fourier transform, their solution overperforms both MKL and FFTW implementations decisively. Their code is ~2x faster. Even on Intel.
	</p>
	<p>
Just to highlight the scale of achievement, MKL is the Math Kernel Library by Intel itself, so by the guys who know how to use their hardware the most. And WWTF A. K. A. ‚ÄúFastest Fourier Transform in the West‚Äù is a highly specialized library from the guys who know the algorithm the best. They are both champions in what they do and the very fact that Spiral beats them both twofold is astonishing.
	</p>
	<p>
When the optimization technology Spiral uses gets finalized and commercialized, not only C++ but Rust, Julia, and even Fortran will face competition they never faced before. Why would anyone write in C++ if writing in high-level algorithm description language makes your code 2x faster?
	</p>

	<h2>
C++ killer number 2. Numba
	</h2>
	<p>
The best programming language is the one you already know well. For several decades straight, the best-known language for most programmers has been C. It also leads TIOBE index with other C-likes tightly populating the top 10. However, only two years ago something unheard of happened. The C gave its first place to something else.
	</p>
	<p>
The ‚Äúsomething else‚Äù appeared to be Python. A language nobody took seriously in the 90s because it was yet another scripting language we already had plenty of.
	</p>
	<p>
Someone will say: ‚ÄúBah, Python is slow‚Äù, and will look like a fool since this is terminological nonsense. Just like an accordion or a frying pan, a language simply can not be fast or slow. Just like the speed of an accordion depends on who‚Äôs playing, the ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of a language depends on how fast its compiler is.
	</p>
	<p>
‚ÄúBut Python is not a compiled language‚Äù someone may continue, and misfire once again. There are plenty of Python compilers and the most promising of them is in its turn a Python script. Let me explain.
	</p>
	<p>
I once had a project. A 3D-printing simulation that was originally written in Python and then rewritten in C++ ‚Äúfor performance‚Äù, and then ported to GPU, all of that before I came in. I then spent months porting the build to Linux, optimizing the GPU code for Tesla M60 since it was the cheapest in AWS at the point, and validating all the changes in the C++/CU code to go along with the original code in Python. So I did everything except the things I normally specialize in namely devising geometric algorithms.
	</p>
	<p>
And when I finally had everything working, a student from Bremen a part-timer called me and asked: ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre good at heterogeneous stuff, can you help me run one algorithm on GPU?‚Äù Of course! I told him about CUDA, CMake, Linux build, testing, and optimizing; spent maybe an hour talking. He listened to all of that very politely, but at the end said: ‚ÄúThis is all very interesting, but I have a very specific question. So I have a function, I wrote @cuda.jit before its definition, and Python says something about arrays and doesn‚Äôt compile the kernel. Do you know what could be the problem here?‚Äù
	</p>
	<p>
I didn‚Äôt know. He figured it out himself in a day. Apparently, Numba doesn‚Äôt work with native Python lists it only accepts data in NumPy arrays. So he figured it out and ran his algorithm on GPU. In Python. He had none of the problems I spent months on. Do you want it on Linux? Not a problem, just run it on Linux. Do you want it to be consistent with the Python code? Not a problem, it is Python code. Do you want to optimize for the target platform? Not a problem again. Numba will optimize the code for the platform you run the code on since it doesn‚Äôt compile ahead of time, it compiles on demand when already deployed.
	</p>
	<p>
Isn‚Äôt that awesome? Well, no. Not for me anyway. I spent months with C++ solving problems that never occur in Numba, and a part-timer from Bremen made the same thing in a few days. It could have been a few hours if it wasn‚Äôt his first experience with Numba. So what is this Numba? What kind of sorcery it is?
	</p>
	<p>
No sorcery. Python decorators turn every piece of code into its abstract syntax tree for you, so you can then do whatever you want with it. <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> is a Python library that wants to compile abstract syntax trees with any backend it has and for any platform it supports. If you want to compile your Python code to run on CPU cores in a massively parallel fashion ‚Äì just tell Numba to compile it so. If you want to run something on GPU, again, <a href="https://numba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cuda/kernels.html">you should only ask</a>.
	</p>

	<div>
	<pre>@cuda.jit
def matmul(A, B, C):
    <span>"""Perform square matrix multiplication of C = A * B."""</span>
    i, j = cuda.grid(2)
    if i &lt; C.shape[0] and j &lt; C.shape[1]:
        tmp = 0.
        for k in range(A.shape[1]):
                tmp += A[i, k] * B[k, j]
        C[i, j] = tmp
</pre>
	</div>	

	<p>
Numba is one of the Python compilers that makes C++ obsolete. In theory, however, it‚Äôs not any better than C++ since it uses the same backends. It uses CUDA for GPU programming and LLVM for CPU. In practice, since it doesn‚Äôt require an ahead-of-time rebuild for every new architecture, Numba solutions adapt better to every new hardware and its available optimizations.
	</p>
	<p>
Of course, it would be better to have a clear performance advantage as is with Spiral. But Spiral is more of a research project, it might kill C++ but only eventually, and only if it‚Äôs lucky. Numba with Python strangles C++ right now, in real time. Because if you can write in Python and have the performance of C++, why would you want to write in C++?
	</p>

	<h2>
C++ killer number 3. ForwardCom
	</h2>
	<p>
Let‚Äôs play another game. I‚Äôll give you three pieces of code, and you‚Äôll guess which one of them, or maybe more, is written in assembly. Here they are:
	</p>

	<div>
	<pre>    invoke RegisterClassEx, addr wc     <span>; register our window class</span>
    invoke CreateWindowEx,NULL,
        ADDR ClassName, ADDR AppName,\

        invoke TranslateMessage, ADDR msg

   .endw
</pre>
	</div>
	
	
	<div>
	<pre>(module
  (func $add (param $lhs i32) (param $rhs i32) (result i32)
        get_local $lhs
        get_local $rhs
        i32.add)
  (export "add" (func $add)))
</pre>
	</div>
	
	
	<div>
	<pre>v0 = my_vector  <span>// we want the horizontal sum of this</span>
int64 r0 = get_len ( v0 )
int64 r0 = round_u2 ( r0 )
float v0 = set_len ( r0 , v0 )
while ( uint64 r0 &gt; 4) {
        uint64 r0 &gt;&gt;= 1
        float v1 = shift_reduce ( r0 , v0 )
        float v0 = v1 + v0
}
</pre>
	</div>
	
	

	<p>
If you guessed that all three examples are assembly, congratulations! your intuition has gotten much better already!
	</p>
	<p>
The first one is in <a href="http://www.masm32.com/">MASM32</a>. It‚Äôs a macroassembler with ‚Äúif‚Äùs and ‚Äúwhile‚Äùs people write native Windows applications in. That‚Äôs right, not ‚Äúused to write‚Äù but ‚Äúwrite‚Äù to this day. Microsoft zealously protects Windows‚Äô backward compatibility with Win32 API so all the MASM32 programs ever written work well on modern PCs too.
	</p>
	<p>
What is ironic, C was invented to make UNIX translation from PDP-7 to PDP-11 easier. It was designed as a portable assembler capable of surviving the Cambrian explosion of the 70s hardware architectures. But in the XXI century, the hardware architecture evolves so sluggishly, that the programs that I wrote in MASM32 20 years ago assemble and run perfectly today, but I have no confidence that a C++ application I built last year with CMake 3.21 will build today with CMake 3.25.
	</p>
	<p>
The second piece of code is <a href="https://github.com/mdn/webassembly-examples/blob/main/understanding-text-format/add.wat">WebAssembly</a>. It‚Äôs not even a macro assembler, it has no ‚Äúif‚Äùs and ‚Äúwhile‚Äùs, it is more of a human-readable machine code for your browser. Or some other browser. Conceptually, any browser.
	</p>
	<p>
Web Assembly code doesn‚Äôt depend on your hardware architecture at all. The machine it serves is abstract, virtual, universal, call it whatever you want. If you can read this text, you have one on your physical machine already.
	</p>
	<p>
But the most interesting piece of code is the third one. It‚Äôs ForwardCom ‚Äì an assembler Agner Fog, a renowned author of C++ and assembly optimization manuals, proposes. Just as with Web Assembly, the proposition covers not so much an assembler as the universal set of instructions designed to enable not only backward but forward compatibility. Hence the name. ForwardCom‚Äôs full name is ‚Äú<a href="https://www.forwardcom.info/">an open forward-compatible instruction set architecture.</a><a>‚Äù In other words, it‚Äôs not so much a proposition of assembly, as a peace treaty proposal.
	</a></p><a>
	<p>
We know that all the most common architectural families: x64, ARM, and RISC-V have different instruction sets. But no one knows a good reason to keep it this way. All the modern processors, apart from maybe the simplest, run not the code you feed it with but the microcode they translate your input into. So it‚Äôs not only M1 that has a backward compatibility layer for Intel, every processor essentially has a backward compatibility layer for all its own earlier versions.
	</p>
	<p>
So what prevents architecture designers from agreeing on a similar layer but for forward compatibility? Apart from the conflicting ambitions of companies being in direct competition, nothing. But if the processor makers will at some point settle to have a common instruction set rather than implement a new compatibility layer per every other competitor, ForwardCom will take assembly programming back to the mainstream. This forward compatibility layer would heal the worst neurosis of every assembly programmer out there: ‚ÄúWhat if I write the one-in-a-lifetime code for this particular architecture, and this particular architecture will make itself obsolete in a year?‚Äù
	</p>
	<p>
With a forward compatibility layer, it will never make itself obsolete. That‚Äôs the point.
	</p>
	<p>
Assembly programming is also held back by a myth that writing in assembly is hard and therefore impractical. Fog's proposition addresses this problem as well. If people think that writing in assembly is hard, and writing in C isn‚Äôt, well, let‚Äôs just make the assembler look like C. Not a problem. There is no good reason for a modern assembly language to look exactly the same as its grandfather looked in the 50s.
	</p>
	<p>
You just saw three assembly samples yourself. None of them looks like a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù assembly and none should be.
	</p>
	<p>
So, ForwardCom is the assembly in which you can write optimal code that will never go obsolete, and which doesn‚Äôt make you learn a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù assembly. For all practical considerations, it is the C of the future. Not C++.
	</p>
	
	<h2>
So when will –°++ finally die?
	</h2>
	<p>
We live in a postmodern world. Nothing dies anymore but people. Just as Latin never actually died, just like COBOL, Algol 68, and Ada, ‚Äì C++ is doomed to eternal half-existence between life and death. C++ will never actually die, it will only be pushed out of the mainstream by newer more potent technologies.
	</p>
	<p>
Well, not ‚Äúwill be pushed‚Äù but ‚Äúbeing pushed‚Äù. I came to my current job as a C++ programmer, and today my workday starts with Python. I write the equations, SymPy solves them for me, and then translates the solution into C++. I then paste this code into the C++ library not even bothering to format it a little, since clang-tidy will do that for me anyway. A static analyzer will check that I didn‚Äôt mess up the namespaces, and a dynamic analyzer will check for memory leaks. CI/CD will take care of cross-platform compilation. A profiler will help me understand how my code actually works, and disassembler ‚Äì why.
	</p>
	<p>
If I trade C++ for ‚Äúnot C++‚Äù, 80% of my work will remain exactly the same. C++ is simply irrelevant to most of what I do. Could it mean that for me C++ is already 80% dead?
	</p>

				<p id="speakable-summary">When OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/10/openai-launches-a-store-for-custom-ai-powered-chatbots/">GPTs</a>, custom chatbots powered by OpenAI‚Äôs generative AI models, onstage at the company‚Äôs first-ever <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai-devday/">developer conference</a> in November, he described them as a way to ‚Äúaccomplish all sorts of tasks‚Äù ‚Äî from programming to learning about esoteric scientific subjects to getting workout pointers.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBecause [GPTs] combine instructions, expanded knowledge and actions, they can be more helpful to you,‚Äù Altman said. ‚ÄúYou can build a GPT ‚Ä¶ for almost anything.‚Äù</p>
<p>He wasn‚Äôt kidding about the anything part.</p>
<p>TechCrunch found that the GPT Store, OpenAI‚Äôs official marketplace for GPTs, is flooded with bizarre, potentially copyright-infringing GPTs that imply a light touch where it concerns OpenAI‚Äôs moderation efforts. A cursory search pulls up GPTs that purport to generate art in the style of Disney and Marvel properties, but serve as little more than funnels to third-party paid services, and advertise themselves as being able to bypass AI content detection tools such as Turnitin and Copyleaks.</p>
<h2>Missing moderation</h2>
<p>To list GPTs in the GPT Store, developers have to verify their user profiles and submit GPTs to OpenAI‚Äôs review system, which involves a mix of human and automated review. Here‚Äôs a spokesperson on the process:</p>
<blockquote><p>We use a combination of automated systems, human review and user reports to find and assess GPTs that potentially violate our policies. Violations can lead to actions against the content or your account, such as warnings, sharing restrictions or ineligibility for inclusion in GPT Store or monetization.</p></blockquote>
<p>Building GPTs doesn‚Äôt require coding experience, and GPTs can be as simple ‚Äî or complex ‚Äî as the creator wishes. Developers can type the capabilities they want to offer into OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-building tool, GPT Builder, and the tool will attempt to make a GPT to perform those.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the low barrier to entry, the GPT Store has grown rapidly ‚Äî OpenAI in January said that it had roughly 3 million GPTs. But this growth appears to have come at the expense of quality ‚Äî as well as adherence to OpenAI‚Äôs own terms.</p>
<h2>Copyright issues</h2>
<p>There are several GPTs ripped from popular movie, TV and video game franchises in the GPT Store ‚Äî GPTs not created or authorized (to TechCrunch‚Äôs knowledge) by those franchises‚Äô owners. One GPT creates monsters in the style of ‚ÄúMonsters, Inc.,‚Äù the Pixar movie, while another promises text-based adventures set in the ‚ÄúStar Wars‚Äù universe.</p>

<p>These GPTs ‚Äî along with the GPTs in the GPT Store that let users speak with trademarked characters like Wario and Aang from ‚ÄúAvatar: The Last Airbender‚Äù ‚Äî set the stage for copyright drama.</p>
<p>Kit Walsh, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, explained it thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>[These GPTs] can be used to create transformative works as well as for infringement [where <em>transformative works</em> refer to a type of fair use shielded from copyright claims.] The individuals engaging in infringement, of course, could be liable, and the creator of an otherwise lawful tool can essentially talk themselves into liability if they encourage users to use the tool in infringing ways. There are also trademark issues with using a trademarked name to identify goods or services where there is a risk of users being confused about whether it is endorsed or operated by the trademark owner.</p></blockquote>
<p>OpenAI itself wouldn‚Äôt be held liable for copyright infringement by GPT creators thanks to the safe harbor provision in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which protects it and other platforms (e.g. YouTube, Facebook) that host infringing content so long as those platforms meet the statutory requirements and take down specific examples of infringement when requested.</p>

<p>It is, however, a bad look for a company embroiled in IP litigation.</p>
<h2>Academic dishonesty</h2>
<p>OpenAI‚Äôs terms explicitly prohibit developers from building GPTs that promote academic dishonesty. Yet the GPT Store is filled with GPTs suggesting they can bypass AI content detectors, including detectors sold to educators through plagiarism scanning platforms.</p>
<p>One GPT claims to be a ‚Äúsophisticated‚Äù rephrasing tool ‚Äúundetectable‚Äù by popular AI content detectors like Originality.ai and Copyleaks. Another, Humanizer Pro ‚Äî ranked No. 2 in the Writing category on the GPT Store ‚Äî says that it ‚Äúhumanizes‚Äù content to bypass AI detectors, maintaining a text‚Äôs ‚Äúmeaning and quality‚Äù while delivering a ‚Äú100% human‚Äù score.</p>

<p>Some of these GPTs are thinly veiled pipelines to premium services. Humanizer, for instance, invites users to try a ‚Äúpremium plan‚Äù to ‚Äúuse [the] most advanced algorithm,‚Äù which transmits text entered into the GPT to a plug-in from a third-party site, GPTInf. Subscriptions to GPTInf cost $12 per month for 10,000 words per month or $8 per month on an annual plan ‚Äî a little steep on top of OpenAI‚Äôs $20-per-month <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/openai-launches-chatgpt-plus-starting-at-20-per-month/">ChatGPT Plus</a>.</p>

<p>Now, we‚Äôve written before about how AI content detectors are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/most-sites-claiming-to-catch-ai-written-text-fail-spectacularly/">largely bunk</a>. Beyond our own <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/16/most-sites-claiming-to-catch-ai-written-text-fail-spectacularly/">tests</a>, a number of academic studies demonstrate that they‚Äôre neither accurate nor reliable. <em>However</em>, it remains the case that OpenAI is allowing tools on the GPT Store that promote academically dishonest behavior ‚Äî even if the behavior doesn‚Äôt have the intended outcome.</p>
<p>The OpenAI spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>GPTs that are for academic dishonesty, including cheating, are against our policy. This would include GPTs that are stated to be for circumventing academic integrity tools like plagiarism detectors. We see some GPTs that are for ‚Äòhumanizing‚Äô text. We‚Äôre still learning from the real world use of these GPTs, but we understand there are many reasons why users might prefer to have AI-generated content that doesn‚Äôt ‚Äòsound‚Äô like AI.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Impersonation</h2>
<p>In its policies, OpenAI also forbids GPT developers from creating GPTs that impersonate people or organizations without their ‚Äúconsent or legal right.‚Äù</p>
<p>However, there‚Äôs plenty of GPTs on the GPT Store that claim to represent the views ‚Äî or otherwise imitate the personalities of ‚Äî people.</p>

<p>Do these rise to the level of impersonation given that many of the targets are public figures and, in some cases, clearly parodies? That‚Äôs for OpenAI to clarify.</p>

<p>The company recently suspended the developer of a GPT mimicking long-shot Democratic presidential hopeful Rep. Dean Phillips, which went so far as to include a disclaimer explaining that it was an AI tool. But OpenAI said its removal in response to a violation of its policy on political campaigning <em>in addition to&nbsp;</em>impersonation ‚Äî not impersonation alone.</p>
<h2>Jailbreaks</h2>
<p>Also somewhat incredulously on the GPT Store are attempts at jailbreaking OpenAI‚Äôs models ‚Äî albeit not very successful ones.</p>
<p>There are multiple GPTs using DAN on the marketplace, DAN (short for ‚ÄúDo Anything Now‚Äù) being a popular prompting method used to get models to respond to prompts unbounded by their usual rules. The few I tested wouldn‚Äôt respond to <em>any</em> dicey prompt I threw their way (e.g. ‚Äúhow do I build a bomb?‚Äù), but they were generally more willing to use‚Ä¶ well, <em>less-flattering</em> language than the vanilla ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The spokesperson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>GPTs that are described or instructed to evade OpenAI safeguards or break OpenAI policies are against our policy. GPTs that attempt to steer model behavior in other ways ‚Äî including generally trying to make GPT more permissive without violating our usage policies ‚Äî are allowed.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Growing pains</h2>
<p>OpenAI pitched the GPT Store at launch as a sort of expert-curated collection of powerful productivity-boosting AI tools. And it <em>is</em> that ‚Äî those tools‚Äô <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-is-tutoring-students-but-still-struggles-with-basic-math-694e76d3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flaws aside</a>. But it‚Äôs also quickly devolving into a breeding ground for spammy, legally dubious and perhaps even harmful GPTs, or at least GPTs that very transparently runs afoul of its rules.</p>
<p>If this is the state of the GPT Store today, monetization threatens to open an entirely new can of worms. OpenAI has pledged that GPT developers will eventually be able to ‚Äúearn money based on how many people are using [their] GPTs‚Äù and perhaps even offer subscriptions to individual GPTs. But how‚Äôs Disney or the Tolkien Estate going to react when the creators of unsanctioned Marvel- or Lord of the Rings-themed GPTs start raking in cash?</p>
<p>OpenAI‚Äôs motivation with the GPT Store is clear. As my colleague Devin Coldewey‚Äôs written, Apple‚Äôs App Store model has proven unbelievably lucrative, and OpenAI, quite simply, is trying to carbon copy it. GPTs are hosted and developed on OpenAI platforms, where they‚Äôre also promoted and evaluated. And, as of a few weeks ago, they can be invoked from the ChatGPT interface directly by ChatGPT Plus users, an added incentive to pick up a subscription.</p>
<p>But the GPT Store is running into the teething problems many of the largest-scale app, product and service digital marketplaces did in their early days. Beyond spam, a recent <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-chatbot-app-store-is-off-to-a-slow-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> in The Information revealed that GPT Store developers are struggling to attract users in part because of the GPT Store‚Äôs limited back-end analytics and subpar onboarding experience.</p>
<p>One might‚Äôve assumed OpenAI ‚Äî for all its talk of curation and the importance of safeguards ‚Äî would‚Äôve taken pains to avoid the obvious pitfalls. But that doesn‚Äôt appear to be the case. The GPT Store is a mess ‚Äî and, if something doesn‚Äôt change soon, it may well stay that way.</p>

1. Integration tests are notoriously slow, the demo seemed to take some time to do basic actions; is it even possible to run these at scale?
2. &gt;Flaky UI tests suck; they can be flaky but it's often due to bad code and architecture. Any data to backup your tool makes the tests less flaky? I could see a scenario where there are 2 buttons with the same text, but under the hood we'd use different identifiers in-code to determine which button should be tapped in UI.<p>Overall I'm a bit skeptical because most UI tests are pretty easy to write today with very natural DSLs that are close to natural language, but definitely want to follow and hear more production use cases.

                  <p><span>Great questions.
1. Yes, running tests in parallel helps. We also cache actions so subsequent runs are much faster (this is disabled in the demo).
2. I agree that testing can be much more reliable and pleasant in some codebases than others. I have not been blessed with these types of codebases in my career. Flakiness is from personal experience automating UI tests specifically and having them break when a new nondeterministic popup modal is added or another engineer breaks an identifier/locator strategy.
That being said, if you like writing UI tests and your codebase supports easily maintaining them, there are some really cool DSLs like Maestro!</span></p></div></td></tr>

If a modal pops up on the screen in a test, how does CamelQA resolve this and how would it know if it's an actual regression or not? If a modal pops up on a screen at the wrong time that _could_ be a real regression, versus a developer forgetting to configure some local state.

      <h2 id="introducing-gnome46-kathmandu">Introducing GNOME&nbsp;46, ‚ÄúKathmandu‚Äù</h2>

<p><strong>March 20, 2024</strong></p>

<p>The GNOME project is excited to present the latest GNOME release, version 46. This latest version is the result of 6 month‚Äôs hard work by the GNOME community. Thank you to everyone who contributed!</p>

<p>GNOME 46 is code-named ‚ÄúKathmandu‚Äù, in recognition of the amazing work done by the organizers of GNOME.Asia 2023.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs dive in and explore what‚Äôs new in GNOME 46.</p>

<h2 id="search-everywhere">Search Everywhere</h2>

<p>Files comes with a <strong>new global search feature</strong> in GNOME 46. The feature is simple: activate it by clicking the new search button, or by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> shortcut, then enter your query to search all your configured search locations.</p>

<p>Global search is a great way to jump directly into search, without having to think about where the items you want are located. The new feature also leverages GNOME‚Äôs existing file search capabilities, including the ability to search the contents of files, and filter by file type and modification date.</p>

<p>Another great thing about global search is that it makes it possible to search multiple locations simultaneously, which can include locations that aren‚Äôt in your home directory. To set this up, go to the newly refined search locations settings, and add the locations that you want to be included.</p>

<h2 id="enhanced-files-app">Enhanced Files App</h2>

<p>In addition to global search, the Files app has had a serious upgrade for GNOME 46. Feedback about long-running file operations has been improved, with a new dynamic progress section at the bottom of the sidebar. This makes it possible to view the progress of individual operations, as well as see which operations are ongoing and which have finished.</p>

<p>Significant code refactoring during the development of GNOME 46 has also delivered a welcome performance upgrade in the Files app. In the past, switching between list and grid view would involve a delay and content would progressively load on screen. In GNOME 46, this is gone: changing view is instantaneous, making for a faster and more frictionless experience.</p>

<video nocontrols="" muted="" autoplay="" loop="">
  <p>Files 46: Improved performance when switching from grid and list views. Files 45 used to reload the view each time.</p>

  <source src="https://release.gnome.org/46/files-46.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

<p>Finally, Files in GNOME 46 also comes with a fantastic set of other smaller improvements:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Search for preferences:</strong> you can now search within the Files preferences to locate specific settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed date and time:</strong> the Files preferences now include an option to show the date and time in a more comprehensive and consistent format.</li>
  <li><strong>Location entry on click:</strong> quickly access the file location address bar by clicking on the file path area.</li>
  <li><strong>Starred favorites in grid view:</strong> quickly identify and access your starred files with visual markers in grid view.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved network discovery:</strong> more available networked devices now appear in the Other Locations view.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to explore the new features in Files and experience a whole new level of file management efficiency!</p>

<h2 id="upgraded-online-accounts-now-with-onedrive">Upgraded Online Accounts, Now With OneDrive</h2>

<p>GNOME‚Äôs Online Accounts feature have had a major upgrade for GNOME 46. The biggest improvement is the new <strong>support for Microsoft OneDrive</strong>. Setup a Microsoft 365 account from the settings, and your OneDrive will appear in the Files sidebar, where it can be easily browsed and accessed alongside your local files and folders.</p>

<p>A collection of additional improvements to Online Accounts have also been made, thanks to funding from the <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/11/09/gnome-recognized-as-public-interest-infrastructure/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The default web browser is now used when signing into accounts as part of account setup. This allows a <strong>wider range of authentication methods</strong> to be used, such as USB tokens.</li>
  <li>A <strong>new WebDAV account type</strong> has been added, providing a generic method for integrating online contacts, calendars and files into your GNOME experience.</li>
  <li>The Online Accounts <strong>settings have also had a complete revamp</strong>, and now have modern up to date designs.</li>
</ul>

<p>A necessary consequence of these changes is that Online Accounts are no longer included as part of the initial system setup assistant.</p>

<h2 id="remote-login-with-rdp">Remote Login with RDP</h2>

<p>GNOME‚Äôs remote desktop experience has been significantly enhanced for version 46, with the introduction of a new <strong>dedicated remote login option</strong>. This allows remotely connecting to a GNOME system which is not already in use. Connecting in this way means that the system‚Äôs display can be configured from the remote side, resulting in a better experience for the remote user.</p>

<p>The new remote login feature means that GNOME systems can be used as fully fledged remote resources. It can be found in the Remote Desktop settings, which provide information on how to connect.</p>

<h2 id="stepped-up-settings">Stepped-Up Settings</h2>

<p>The Settings app has received a comprehensive update in GNOME 46.</p>

<h3 id="navigation-improvements">Navigation Improvements</h3>

<p>The Settings app has been reorganized for GNOME 46, to make it <strong>easier to navigate</strong>. To this end, a new System section has been created, which contains preferences for <em>Region &amp; Language</em>, <em>Date &amp; Time</em>, <em>Users</em>, <em>Remote Desktop</em>, <em>Secure Shell</em>, and <em>About</em>. The Apps settings have also been consolidated, and now include the Default Apps and Removable Media settings.</p>

<p>These changes have the effect of reducing the total number of sections in the Settings app, giving you fewer places to browse and a faster path to the settings you need.</p>

<h3 id="new-touchpad-settings">New Touchpad Settings</h3>

<p>The touchpad settings have been expanded for GNOME 46, with two new settings. The first, called <strong>Secondary Click</strong> provides configuration for how secondary clicks (often called ‚Äúright click‚Äù) are performed with a touchpad, and includes options to use either two fingers on the pad, or to click in the corner of the pad.</p>

<p>The second new setting allows the <strong>Disable Touchpad While Typing</strong> behavior to be turned off. Doing this allows touchpad movement to be combined with key presses, which can be necessary for some apps and games.</p>

<h3 id="massive-polish-effort">Massive Polish Effort</h3>

<p>The Settings app has also received a vast amount of polish for GNOME 46. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>improved settings descriptions and tooltips</li>
  <li>more keyboard mnemonics, to enhance keyboard navigation (hold down Alt to see these)</li>
  <li>extensive UI modernization and refinement</li>
  <li>additional options for compose key assignment</li>
  <li>faster loading of the appearance settings, as well as sharper previews</li>
  <li>additional fine-grained control when setting Wacom stylus pressure</li>
</ul>

<p>Altogether, these improvements result in a Settings app which is clearer, easier to understand, and is fantastic to use.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility-improvements">Accessibility Improvements</h2>

<p>Accessibility has been a strong work theme for GNOME 46, with multiple aspects of accessibility seeing improvements. Much of this work has centered on the Orca screen reader:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Under the hood, a <strong>significant modernization effort</strong> has been under way. This will result in improved performance and reliability, and will enable compatibility with Wayland and sandboxed apps in the future.</li>
  <li>A <strong>new sleep mode</strong> feature has been added. This much requested feature allows users to temporarily disable Orca, using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Q</kbd> shortcut. Sleep mode is useful when using virtual machines that have their own screen readers, as well as self-voicing apps.</li>
  <li>New commands allow Orca to <strong>report system status</strong>, including battery status, CPU and memory usage.</li>
  <li><strong>Table navigation</strong> has been much improved, with more apps being supported and new commands added, including toggle table navigation (<kbd>Orca</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd>) and move to the final cell (<kbd>Orca</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>ü°∞</kbd>/<kbd>ü°≤</kbd>/<kbd>ü°±</kbd>/<kbd>ü°≥</kbd>).</li>
  <li>Orca now has <strong>experimental support for Spiel</strong>, an exciting next generation speech synthesis API. Those who are interested in this feature are <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/orca#experimental-features">invited to help test it</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Orca hasn‚Äôt been the only place where accessibility improvements have happened for GNOME 46. Other accessibility improvements include an <strong>high contrast mode</strong>  which is now more consistent and usable, and a <strong>new setting to show on and off symbols in switches</strong>.</p>

<p>Much of this accessibility work was funded by the <a href="https://foundation.gnome.org/2023/11/09/gnome-recognized-as-public-interest-infrastructure/">Sovereign Tech Fund</a> and <a href="https://www.igalia.com/">Igalia</a>.</p>

<h2 id="system-enhancements">System Enhancements</h2>

<p>GNOME 46 contains many small improvements and polish changes to the core GNOME experience:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Beautiful fallback avatars:</strong> if you don‚Äôt specify an avatar for your user account, GNOME generates one for you. These fallback avatars have been refreshed for 46, and look fantastic. If you are upgrading from a previous version, clear out your old avatar to see the new default avatars in action.</li>
  <li><strong>Enhanced notifications:</strong> with improved layouts, and a new header in each notification to show which app sent it. It is now also possible to expand notifications in the list, in order to use notification actions at a time that suits you.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://release.gnome.org/46/notifications-screenshot.png" alt="Enhanced Notifications"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>New app launching shortcuts:</strong> apps which have been pinned to the dash can now be launched using <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;Number&gt;</kbd>. For example, <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd> will launch the first app in the dash. GNOME 46 includes additional shortcuts to allow launching a new window, by adding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> modifier, for example: <kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;Number&gt;</kbd> to launch a new window for the first app in the dash.</li>
  <li><strong>Improved on-screen keyboard:</strong> with automatic capitalization and new keyboard layouts for entering phone numbers, email addresses, and URLs.</li>
  <li><strong>Tap to click is now enabled by default:</strong> for a more intuitive touch experience.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="better-apps">Better Apps</h2>

<p>Many of GNOME‚Äôs core apps have also been upgraded for GNOME 46. This includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Improved Software app:</strong> this now shows verified badges for Flathub apps whose developers have been verified, ensuring a trusted source for your software. The Software app also has redesigned preferences, better error messages, and a new keyboard shortcuts window.</li>
  <li><strong>Various Maps enhancements:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>An updated OpenStreetMap point of interest editing experience, as well as other user interface and routing improvements.</li>
      <li>New map style and support for dark mode</li>
      <li>Information about multiple floors is now shown for points of interest that have them</li>
      <li>Expanded public transit routing (now available for Norway)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Redesigned Extensions app:</strong> a cleaner list makes it easier to scan and toggle your installed extensions, and the modernized design is also adaptive. It is now also possible to turn off extensions which have been automatically deactivated.</li>
  <li><strong>Polished Calendar app:</strong> with improved visuals, modernized interfaces, and performance improvements.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick timers in Clocks:</strong> when starting a timer, click a duration in the quick start section to quickly start a timer.</li>
  <li><strong>Smarter Contacts:</strong> multiple VCard files can now be imported at the same time and, when importing new contacts, the confirmation dialog will also helpfully preview the names of the contacts to import.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitor disk usage:</strong> Disks has gained a new resource graph for disk I/O.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="improvements-under-the-hood">Improvements Under the Hood</h2>

<p>The improvements in GNOME 46 are not just skin deep, and the new version comes with deep technical enhancements which result in a more performant and refined experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Performance and resource usage improvements</strong>, including reduced memory usage for search, enhanced screen recording performance, and more intelligent use of system resources by the image viewer app. There have also been significant speed improvements in GNOME‚Äôs terminal apps.</li>
  <li><strong>Security improvements</strong> include enhanced protection from malware in the image viewer app and GNOME‚Äôs search technologies.</li>
  <li><strong>Rendering improvements</strong> include sharper app interfaces, crisper on-screen text, and clearer UIs when using fractional display scales. These rendering improvements are thanks to GTK‚Äôs new renderers, and are found in GNOME apps which use the latest GTK version.</li>
  <li><strong>Variable refresh rates (VRR)</strong> is a feature which can, under some circumstances, produce smoother video performance. This is included in GNOME 46 as an experimental feature, which needs to be enabled by entering the following from the command line using: <code>gsettings set org.gnome.mutter experimental-features "['variable-refresh-rate']"</code>. Once enabled, a variable refresh rate can be set from the display settings.</li>
</ul>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>If you read any personal finance forums late last year, there's a decent chance you ran across a question from someone who was desperately trying to lose money before the end of the year. There are a number of ways someone could do this; one commonly suggested scheme was to buy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option">put options that were expected to expire worthless</a>, allowing the buyer to (probably) take a loss.</p> <p>One reason people were looking for ways to lose money was that, in the U.S., there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act#Subsidy_Cliff_at_400%_FPL">a hard income cutoff for a health insurance subsidy</a> at $48,560 for individuals (higher for larger households; $100,400 for a family of four). There are a number of factors that can cause the details to vary (age, location, household size, type of plan), but across all circumstances, it wouldn't have been uncommon for an individual going from one side of the cut-off to the other to have their health insurance cost increase by roughly $7200/yr. That means if an individual buying ACA insurance was going to earn $55k, they'd be better off reducing their income by $6440 and getting under the $48,560 subsidy ceiling than they are earning $55k.</p> <p>Although that's an unusually severe example, <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/11-15-2012-MarginalTaxRates.pdf">U.S. tax policy is full of discontinuities that disincentivize increasing earnings and, in some cases, actually incentivize decreasing earnings</a>. Some other discontinuities are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Assistance_for_Needy_Families">TANF</a> income limit, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a> income limit, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Insurance_Program">CHIP</a> income limit for free coverage, and the CHIP income limit for reduced-cost coverage. These vary by location and circumstance; the TANF and Medicaid income limits fall into ranges generally considered to be "low income" and the CHIP limits fall into ranges generally considered to be "middle class". These subsidy discontinuities have the same impact as the ACA subsidy discontinuity -- at certain income levels, people are incentivized to lose money.</p> <blockquote> <p>Anyone may arrange his affairs so that his taxes shall be as low as possible; he is not bound to choose that pattern which best pays the treasury. There is not even a patriotic duty to increase one's taxes. Over and over again the Courts have said that there is nothing sinister in so arranging affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible. Everyone does it, rich and poor alike and all do right, for nobody owes any public duty to pay more than the law demands.</p> </blockquote> <p>If you agree with the famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_Hand">Learned Hand</a> quote then losing money in order to reduce effective tax rate, increasing disposable income, is completely legitimate behavior at the individual level. However, a tax system that encourages people to lose money, perhaps by funneling it to (on average) much wealthier options traders by buying put options, seems sub-optimal.</p> <p>A simple fix for the problems mentioned above would be to have slow phase-outs instead of sharp thresholds. Slow phase-outs are actually done for some subsidies and, while that can also have problems, they are typically less problematic than introducing a sharp discontinuity in tax/subsidy policy.</p> <p>In this post, we'll look at a variety of discontinuities.</p> <h3 id="hardware-or-software-queues">Hardware or software queues</h3> <p>A naive queue has discontinuous behavior. If the queue is full, new entries are dropped. If the queue isn't full, new entries are not dropped. Depending on your goals, this can often have impacts that are non-ideal. For example, in networking, a naive queue might be considered "unfair" to bursty workloads that have low overall bandwidth utilization because workloads that have low bandwidth utilization "shouldn't" suffer more drops than workloads that are less bursty but use more bandwidth (this is also arguably not unfair, depending on what your goals are).</p> <p>A class of solutions to this problem are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_early_detection">random early drop</a> and its variants, which gives incoming items a probability of being dropped which can be determined by queue fullness (and possibly other factors), smoothing out the discontinuity and mitigating issues caused by having a discontinuous probability of queue drops.</p> <p><a href="https://danluu.com/randomize-hn/">This post on voting in link aggregators</a> is fundamentally the same idea although, in some sense, the polarity is reversed. There's a very sharp discontinuity in how much traffic something gets based on whether or not it's on the front page. You could view this as a link getting dropped from a queue if it only receives N-1 votes and not getting dropped if it receives N votes.</p> <h3 id="college-admissions-and-pell-grant-recipients-https-www-insidehighered-com-admissions-article-2019-01-28-study-pressure-enroll-more-pell-eligible-students-has-skewed-colleges"><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/admissions/article/2019/01/28/study-pressure-enroll-more-pell-eligible-students-has-skewed-colleges">College admissions and Pell Grant recipients</a></h3> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant">Pell Grants</a> started getting used as a proxy for how serious schools are about helping/admitting low-income students. The first order impact is that students above the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly reduced probability of being admitted while students below the Pell Grant threshold had a significantly higher chance of being admitted. Phrased that way, it sounds like things are working as intended.</p> <p>However, when we look at what happens within each group, we see outcomes that are the opposite of what we'd want if the goal is to benefit students from low income families. Among people who don't qualify for a Pell Grant, it's those with the lowest income who are the most severely impacted and have the most severely reduced probability of admission. Among people who do qualify, it's those with the highest income who are mostly likely to benefit, again the opposite of what you'd probably want if your goal is to benefit students from low income families.</p> <p>We can see these in the graphs below, which are histograms of parental income among students at two universities in 2008 (first graph) and 2016 (second graph), where the red line indicates the Pell Grant threshold.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/pell-2008.jpg" alt="Histogram of income distribution of students at two universities in 2008; high incomes are highly overrepresented relative to the general population, but the distribution is smooth" height="816" width="1056"></p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/pell-2016.jpg" alt="Histogram of income distribution of students at two universities in 2016; high incomes are still highly overrepresented, there's also a sharp discontinuity at the Pell grant threshold; plot looks roughly two upwards sloping piecewise linear functions, with a drop back to nearly 0 at the discontinuity at the Pell grant threshold" height="816" width="1056"></p> <p>A second order effect of universities optimizing for Pell Grant recipients is that savvy parents can do the same thing that some people do to cut their taxable income at the last minute. Someone might put money into a traditional IRA instead of a Roth IRA and, if they're at their IRA contribution limit, they can try to lose money on options, effectively transferring money to options traders who are likely to be wealthier than them, in order to bring their income below the Pell Grant threshold, increasing the probability that their children will be admitted to a selective school.</p> <h3 id="election-statistics-https-arxiv-org-pdf-1410-6059-pdf"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.6059.pdf">Election statistics</a></h3> <p>The following histograms of Russian elections across polling stations shows curious spikes in turnout and results at nice, round, numbers (e.g., 95%) starting around 2004.

Not only would this reduce the incentive for authors to cheat on p values, there are other reasons to not want a bright-line rule to determine if something is "significant" or not.</p> <h3 id="drug-charges-http-econweb-umd-edu-tuttle-files-tuttle-mandatory-minimums-pdf"><a href="http://econweb.umd.edu/~tuttle/files/tuttle_mandatory_minimums.pdf">Drug charges</a></h3> <p>The top two graphs in this set of four show histograms of the amount of cocaine people were charged with possessing before and after the passing of the Fair Sentencing Act in 2010, which raised the amount of cocaine necessary to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for possession from 50g to 280g. There's a relatively smooth distribution before 2010 and a sharp discontinuity after 2010.</p> <p>The bottom-left graph shows the sharp spike in prosecutions at 280 grams followed by what might be a drop in 2013 after evidentiary standards were changed<sup id="fnref:R"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:R">1</a></sup>.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/cocaine-280.png" height="1118" width="1408"></p> <h3 id="high-school-exit-exam-scores-danluu-com-matura-2013-pdf"><a href="https://danluu.com/matura-2013.pdf">High school exit exam scores</a></h3> <p>This is a histogram of high school exit exam scores from the Polish language exam. We can see that a curiously high number of students score 30 or just above thirty while curiously low number of students score from 23-29. This is from 2013; other years I've looked at (2010-2012) show a similar discontinuity.</p> <p>Math exit exam scores don't exhibit any unusual discontinuities in the years I've examined (2010-2013).</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/matura-polish-2013.png" height="772" width="1416"></p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/1bqf9r/unusual_distributions_of_scores_on_final/c994zxt/">An anonymous reddit commenter explains this</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>When a teacher is grading matura (final HS exam), he/she doesn't know whose test it is. The only things that are known are: the number (code) of the student and the district which matura comes from (it is usually from completely different part of Poland). The system is made to prevent any kind of manipulation, for example from time to time teachers supervisor will come to check if test are graded correctly. I don't wanna talk much about system flaws (and advantages), it is well known in every education system in the world where final tests are made, but you have to keep in mind that there is a key, which teachers follow very strictly when grading.</p> <p>So, when a score of the test is below 30%, exam is failed. However, before making final statement in protocol, a commision of 3 (I don't remember exact number) is checking test again. This is the moment, where difference between humanities and math is shown: teachers often try to find a one (or a few) missing points, so the test won't be failed, because it's a tragedy to this person, his school and somewhat fuss for the grading team. Finding a "missing" point is not that hard when you are grading writing or open questions, which is a case in polish language, but nearly impossible in math. So that's the reason why distribution of scores is so different.</p> </blockquote> <p>As with p values, having a bright-line threshold, causes curious behavior. In this case, scoring below 30 on any subject (a 30 or above is required in every subject) and failing the exam has arbitrary negative effects for people, so teachers usually try to prevent people from failing if there's an easy way to do it, but a deeper root of the problem is the idea that it's necessary to produce a certification that's the discretization of a continuous score.</p> <h3 id="birth-month-and-sports">Birth month and sports</h3> <p>These are scatterplots of football (soccer) players in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Youth_League">UEFA Youth League</a>. The x-axis on both of these plots is how old players are modulo the year, i.e., their birth month normalized from 0 to 1.</p> <p>The graph on the left is a histogram, which shows that there is a very strong relationship between where a person's birth falls within the year and their odds of making a club at the UEFA Youth League (U19) level. The graph on the right purports to show that birth time is only weakly correlated with actual value provided on the field. The authors use playing time as a proxy for value, presumably because it's easy to measure. That's not a great measure, but the result they find (younger-within-the-year players have higher value, conditional on making the U19 league) is consistent with other studies on sports and discrimination, which ind (for example) that <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">black baseball players were significantly better than white baseball players for decades after desegregation in baseball, French-Canadian defensemen are also better than average (French-Canadians are stereotypically afraid to fight, don't work hard enough, and are too focused on offense)</a>.</p> <p>The discontinuity isn't directly shown in the graphs above because the graphs only show birth date for one year. If we were to plot birth date by cohort across multiple years, we'd expect to see a sawtooth pattern in the probability that a player makes it into the UEFA youth league with a 10x difference between someone born one day before vs. after the threshold.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/u19-age.png" height="1030" width="1758"></p> <p>This phenomenon, that birth day or month is a good predictor of participation in higher-level youth sports as well as pro sports, has been studied across a variety of sports.</p> <p>It's generally believed that this is caused by a discontinuity in youth sports:</p> <ol> <li>Kids are bucketed into groups by age in years and compete against people in the same year</li> <li>Within a given year, older kids are stronger, faster, etc., and perform better</li> <li>This causes older-within-year kids to outcompete younger kids, which later results in older-within-year kids having higher levels of participation for a variety of reasons</li> </ol> <p>This is arguably a "bug" in how youth sports works. But <a href="https://danluu.com/bad-decisions/">as we've seen in baseball</a> <a href="https://danluu.com/tech-discrimination/">as well as a survey of multiple sports</a>, obviously bad decision making that costs individual teams tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars can persist for decades in the face of people pubicly discussing how bad the decisions are. In this case, the youth sports teams aren't feeder teams to pro teams, so they don't have a financial incentive to select players who are skilled for their age (as opposed to just taller and faster because they're slightly older) so this system-wide non-optimal even more difficult to fix than pro sports teams making locally non-optimal decisions that are completely under their control.</p> <h3 id="procurement-auctions-http-www-keikawai-com-full-0804-pdf"><a href="http://www.keikawai.com/Full_0804.pdf">Procurement auctions</a></h3> <p>Kawai et al. looked at Japanese government procurement, in order to find suspicious pattern of bids like the ones described in <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4013">Porter et al. (1993)</a>, which looked at collusion in procurement auctions on Long Island (in New York in the United States). One example that's given is:</p> <blockquote> <p>In February 1983, the New York State Department of Transportation (DoT) held a pro- curement auction for resurfacing 0.8 miles of road. The lowest bid in the auction was $4 million, and the DoT decided not to award the contract because the bid was deemed too high relative to its own cost estimates. The project was put up for a reauction in May 1983 in which all the bidders from the initial auction participated. The lowest bid in the reauction was 20% higher than in the initial auction, submitted by the previous low bidder. Again, the contract was not awarded. The DoT held a third auction in February 1984, with the same set of bidders as in the initial auction. The lowest bid in the third auction was 10% higher than the second time, again submitted by the same bidder. The DoT apparently thought this was suspicious: ‚ÄúIt is notable that the same firm submitted the low bid in each of the auctions. Because of the unusual bidding patterns, the contract was not awarded through 1987.‚Äù</p> </blockquote> <p>It could be argued that this is expected because different firms have different cost structures, so the lowest bidder in an auction for one particular project should be expected to be the lowest bidder in subsequent auctions for the same project. In order to distinguish between collusion and real structural cost differences between firms, Kawai et al. (2015) looked at auctions where the difference in bid between the first and second place firms was very small, making the winner effectively random.</p> <p>In the auction structure studied, bidders submit a secret bid. If the secret bid is above a secret minimum, then the lowest bidder wins the auction and gets the contract. If not, the lowest bid is revealed to all bidders and another round of bidding is done. Kawai et al. found that, in about 97% of auctions, the bidder who submitted the lowest bid in the first round also submitted the lowest bid in the second round (the probability that the second lowest bidder remains second lowest was 26%).</p> <p>Below, is a histogram of the difference in first and second round bids between the first-lowest and second-lowest bidders (left column) and the second-lowest and third-lowest bidders (right column). Each row has a different filtering criteria for how close the auction has to be in order to be included. In the top row, all auctions that reached the third round were included; in second, and third rows, the normalized delta between the first and second biders was less than 0.05 and 0.01, respectively; in the last row, the normalized delta between the first and the third bidder was less than 0.03. All numbers are normalized because the absolute size of auctions can vary.</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/discontinuities/jp-procurement-bidding.png" height="1446" width="1682"></p> <p>We can see that the distributions of deltas between the first and second round are roughly symmetrical when comparing second and third lowest bidders. But when comparing first and second lowest bidders, there's a sharp discontinuity at zero, indicating that second-lowest bidder almost never lowers their bid by more than the first-lower bidder did. If you read the paper, you can see that the same structure persists into auctions that go into a third round.</p> <p>I don't mean to pick on Japanese procurement auctions in particular. There's an extensive literature on procurement auctions that's found collusion in many cases, often much more blatant than the case presented above (e.g., there are a few firms and they round-robin who wins across auctions, or there are a handful of firms and every firm except for the winner puts in the same losing bid).</p> <h3 id="restaurant-inspection-https-iquantny-tumblr-com-post-76928412519-think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres-scores-http-datafra-me-blog-calling-out-nyc-restaurant-violations"><a href="https://iquantny.tumblr.com/post/76928412519/think-nyc-restaurant-grading-is-flawed-heres">Restaurant inspection</a> <a href="http://datafra.me/blog/Calling-out-NYC-restaurant-violations">scores</a></h3> <p>The histograms below show a sharp discontinuity between 13 and 14, which is the difference between an A grade and a B grade.

<p>Touchscreens have long been integral to our everyday life ‚Äî humans use them to work, play, talk with loved ones and snag Lightning Deals on Prime Day. In recent years, they‚Äôve shown potential for the animal kingdom as well, leading to a growing body of <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2023/04/21/parrots-talking-video-calls/">academic research</a> and a proliferation of consumer products promising to leverage technology to enhance our relationships with our pets.</p>



<p>Northeastern assistant professor <a href="https://www.interactanimallab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">R√©becca Kleinberger and her collaborators</a> have been at the forefront of that exploration, using computer interaction to enrich and understand the lives of dogs, orcas and parrots. Their latest research begs the next logical question: If animals are going to use touchscreens, how should we design for them?</p>



<div data-direction="90"><p><img decoding="async" width="1200" height="674" alt="A hyacinth macaw (blue parrot) tapping at a tablet screen with its tongue." src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/03182024-parrotgame-4.gif" data-object-fit="cover"></p><div>
<p>Parrots are helping them find the answer ‚Äî by playing tablet games.</p>
</div></div>



<p>In a new <a href="https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:h989sd115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study </a>released Wednesday, Kleinberger; Megan McMahon, an undergraduate studying behavioral neuroscience; and collaborators Ilyena Hirskyj-Douglas at the University of Glasgow and Jennifer Cunha in Florida used a bare-bones, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/balloon-pop-toddler-baby-game/id1498726683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balloon Pop</a>-style tablet game to collect data on a group of 20 pet birds‚Äô tactile interactions with their touchscreens.</p>



<p>In doing so, they hoped to establish a framework to build tech intentionally designed for parrot use.</p>







<p>‚ÄúCognitive enrichment is a crucial component for parrot health and well-being, and tablet games are one method of providing this enrichment,‚Äù McMahon says. ‚ÄúDesigning apps specifically made for birds and their unique touchscreen tendencies makes this form of enrichment more accessible.‚Äù</p>



<p>The parrot participants ranged from small species, like a green-cheeked parakeet, to a hyacinth macaw, the world‚Äôs largest. All had prior experience using touchscreens and completed the study in their homes. With the help of their caregivers, they learned to use a basic app game on Samsung Galaxy tablets. Adapted by McMahon, the game challenged the birds to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EY5GiklaplM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tap multi-colored target circles</a> of different sizes on varying locations around their screens with their beaks and tongues.</p>



<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/03182024-parrotgame-3.gif" alt="A gray parrot taps at an iPad with its tongue, popping balloons on the screen."></figure>
</div>



<p>The birds engaged in short sessions (no longer than 30 minutes) each day, playing the game over the course of three months. Seventeen completed the study; three dropped out after showing slight signs of aggression or a lack of interest during the training period. The game collected information on the birds‚Äô accuracy, tap locations and frequency, as well as tactile elements like touch pressure and drag rate.</p>



<p>The team‚Äôs data evaluated how well existing, human-based touchscreen design principles translated to parrots. Specifically, they honed in on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fitts‚Äô Law</a>, a formula that predicts human pointing movement toward targets.</p>



<p>Some of the paper‚Äôs findings are intuitive enough: Parrots primarily use their tongues to work tablets, for example, which means their eyes are much closer to the screen than a human‚Äôs. As a result, they are quantifiably less accurate, and they fare better hitting larger targets. There was also a lot of variability in performance based on the birds‚Äô size ‚Äî smaller birds tended to have more trouble.</p>



<div data-direction="90">
<figure><img decoding="async" width="1164" height="654" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/03182024-parrot_own_pace.gif?w=1100" alt="A white parrot flicking its tongue at a tablet screen to play a game."></figure>
</div>



<p>But the data-based assessment revealed much about the parrots themselves, as well. Kleinberger was surprised ‚Äújust how fast some parrot species can control their tongue,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúSome parrots could touch the tablet up to 41 times in a row, resulting in a touch every few milliseconds.‚Äù</p>



<p>That led to a real-time ergonomic adjustment: the team added a ‚Äúmulti-tap threshold‚Äù to the app‚Äôs interface during the study, making it less frustrating for the birds to use. ‚ÄúThis ‚Ä¶is a good example of how studying animals‚Äô bodies can inform the design of new interfaces to empower animals,‚Äù Kleinberger says.</p>







<p>The findings, to be presented at the <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CHI conference</a> on Human Factors in Computing Systems in May, signal a next step for Kleinberger and her collaborators. Their past research has shown that parrots ‚Äî with their prodigious intelligence, high sociability and singular physical capabilities ‚Äî are uniquely poised to benefit from touchscreen technology.</p>



<p>Last year, the team showed a group of parrots how to video call one another, finding that the birds both overwhelmingly enjoyed the activity and could make the calls themselves, when given the option.</p>



<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="854" height="480" src="https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/multitouch40.gif" alt="A green parrot taps a red circle on a white screen that periodically changes location with its beak and tongue."></figure>
</div>



<p>The latest research further bolsters the case that touchscreens can enrich parrots‚Äô lives. In surveys after the study was completed, human handlers said the experience was positive for their birds, and that participating in the study together was a great bonding experience. Kleinberger says that is by design. She stresses that the systems her lab is developing are meant for humans and animals to use together, and as an enhancement to their interactions rather than as a replacement.</p>



<p>As with humans and touchscreens, there are potential drawbacks ‚Äî some familiar (‚ÄúParticipants in our study often emphasized the risk of their birds‚Äô overuse, likening their screen time needs to those of children,‚Äù the paper reads); others uniquely avian (‚ÄúWhen asked what risks tablet applications could pose to parrots, the most common answer was ‚Äòpotential damage to the tablet.‚Äô‚Äù)</p>



<p>In the longer term, the researchers hope the findings will serve as a starting point in adapting screen technologies for parrots and, eventually, other species. Kleinberger thinks it can bring some academic rigor to the booming ‚Äúpet tech‚Äù market, ‚Äúwith new products promising to improve animal welfare with often very little data and research to back up the claims,‚Äù she says.</p>



<p>‚ÄúMy goal is for these insights not only to benefit the pet tech industry but also to offer valuable guidance to the wider research community, technology developers, [and] pet owners,‚Äù Kleinberger says.</p>
