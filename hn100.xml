Auch, weil Deutschland keine Kontrolle hatte? Der Umweltausschuss nimmt Stellung.</p><p><strong>Update vom 12. Juni, 16.21 Uhr:</strong> Schwere Vorwürfe gegen das Umweltministerium des Bundes: Viel zu fahrlässig habe man chinesische Projekte zum Klimaschutz unterstützt. Dabei seien Millionen an Geldern geflossen, die aus der sogenannten THG-Quote stammten.  </p><p>„Seit August 2023 gibt es erhebliche Betrugsvorwürfe gegen Klimaschutzprojekte in China, welche zur Anrechnung auf die Treibhausgasminderungsquote genutzt werden“, sagte Daniel Rinkert (SPD) in einem Plenum des Umweltausschusses am Mittwoch. „In der heutigen Sitzung wurde das Thema ausführlich diskutiert und Vorwürfe ausgeräumt.“</p><p>Die Betrugsanschuldigungen bei den Upstream-Emission-Reduction-Projekten – kurz UER-Projekte – seien laut Parlamentarier erheblich und verlangten eine konsequente Aufklärung. Laut Umweltbundesamt stehen aktuell 40 von 60 Projekten in China unter einem Betrugsverdacht. „Das ist Wirtschaftskriminalität im großen Umfang“, sagte Rinkert. „Es ist mehr als offensichtlich, dass bei diesen Projekten keine Kontrolle auf anspruchsvollem Niveau sichergestellt werden kann. Daher wird die Förderung dieser Projekte auch durch die Bundesregierung Ende 2024 eingestellt. Die entsprechende Verordnung wurde am 8. Juni im Kabinett verabschiedet.“</p><h2>Umweltministerium will mit Auswärtigem Amt deutsche Kontrollen in China durchdrücken</h2><p>Das Bundesumweltministerium und das Umweltbundesamt hätten damit „sehr deutlich gemacht“, dass die zuständigen Stellen in Deutschland frühzeitig eine „vollumfängliche Aufklärung“ eingeleitet haben. „In aufwendigen Prüfungsschritten wird seit den ersten aufkommenden Betrugsvorwürfen jedes einzelne Projekt untersucht und überprüft“, betonte Rinkert.&nbsp; Die in diesem Zusammenhang immer wieder vorgebrachten Vorwürfe der Tatenlosigkeit der zuständigen Stellen hätten sich damit als haltlos herausgestellt. „Die Union sollte die Vorwürfe daher nicht wiederholen und Nebelkerzen werfen. Sie sollte vielmehr die Bundesregierung bei der Aufklärung unterstützen“, sagte Rinkert.</p><p>Gemeinsam mit dem Auswärtigen Amt dränge das Umweltministerium nun die chinesische Regierung dazu, eine unabhängige deutsche Kontrollmission in China zuzulassen. Nur dadurch könne ein vollumfänglicher Einblick in die Situation vor Ort gewonnen werden. „Für dieses Vorgehen gibt es die volle Unterstützung der SPD-Bundestagsfraktion“, sagte Rinkert zum Schluss.</p><h2>Millionen-Betrug in China: Haben Konzerne die deutschen Klimaschutzmaßnahmen unterwandert?</h2><p><strong>Erstmeldung vom 11. Juni: </strong>Berlin – Der Image-Schaden für den deutschen Klimaschutz dürfte fast schwerer wiegen, als die verlorenen Milliarden an Euros. Nagelneue Ölförderungsanlagen in China sollen angeblich CO₂ einsparen. Gebaut von internationalen Großkonzernen zur „grüneren“ Gewinnung von Öl. Die Bauvorhaben ermöglicht jeder, der in Deutschland tankt. Denn als Nutzer:in von fossilen Brennstoffen zahlt man beim Tanken Klima-Abgaben über die „Treibhausgasminderungsquote“ – kurz THG-Quote. Das Problem: Wahrscheinlich gibt es diese neuen und sauberen Anlagen in <a href="https://www.merkur.de/politik/china/" title="China" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;China&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:18,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">China</a> gar nicht, wie Recherchen von <em>ZDF frontal</em> ergaben. Und anscheinend ist es auch nicht möglich für das Umweltministerium des Bundes, den Betrugsvorwürfen effektiv nachzugehen, wie die <em>Welt</em> berichtet.</p><p>Doch von Anfang an: Verstrickt in den Skandal sind anscheinend mehrere Ölmultis, die die Anlagen angeblich gebaut haben. Die meisten dieser Projekte sollen auf den Öl- und Gasfeldern der Provinz Xinjang entstanden sein. Für die Konzerne ein lukratives Geschäft mit dem Handel von Umwelt-Zertifikaten. Denn für jede eingesparte Tonne Kohlendioxid konnten die Unternehmen bis zu 400 Euro in Deutschland kassieren. Viele Projekte waren nach Recherchen von „ZDF Frontal“ aber nur vorgetäuscht. </p><figure><p><img src="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBBG.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBb9.jpg 448w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OB73.jpg 768w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBBG.jpg 1100w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OB7d.jpg 1408w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795011-eigentlich-sollten-mit-der-umlage-oel-und-gasbohrungen-vor-allem-in-china-finanziert-werden-die-umweltfreundlicher-als-die-gewoehnliche-foerderung-OBPH.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 769px) 768px, 100vw" height="733" width="1100" alt="Eigentlich sollten mit der Umlage Öl- und Gasbohrungen vor allem in China finanziert werden, die umweltfreundlicher als die gewöhnliche Förderung sind.

Zuletzt im April meldete sich ein chinesischer Öl- und Gaskonzern von selbst bei dem von Steffi Lemke (Grüne) geführten Umweltministerium und erklärte deutlich, dass von Betrugsfällen auszugehen ist. „Wir vermuten, dass es eine hohe Wahrscheinlichkeit gibt, dass Dokumente gefälscht wurden und wir bitten dringend, dass Ihre Behörde dazu ermittelt“, teilte der chinesische Konzern dem Ministerium mit. Dieses wimmelte wohl ab, wie die <em>Welt</em> berichtet. Deutsche Prüfstellen haben anscheinend einige Daten der Anlagen des chinesischen Unternehmens geändert und ohne dessen Zustimmung verwendet. Das Ziel war, möglichst hohe CO₂-Einsparungen in Deutschland geltend zu machen. Allein in diesem offenbar gefälschten Projekt ging es laut <em>ZDF</em> um eine Million Tonnen Kohlendioxid, die angeblich eingespart wurden – der Marktwert: etwa 180 Millionen Euro.</p><p>Ein weiteres Beispiel: Deutsche Autofahrerinnen und Autofahrer zahlten mit ihrer Klima-Abgabe vermutlich rund 80 Millionen Euro für ein<a href="https://www.fr.de/thema/klima-sti162637/" title="Klima" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot; Klimaschutzprojekt&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:25,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}"> Klimaschutzprojekt</a> in der chinesischen Provinz der unterdrückten Uiguren. Am Ende stand dort laut <em>Welt</em> lediglich ein Hühnerstall. Recherchen deutscher Bioenergie-Unternehmen bestätigten den Vorfall.</p><p>Es existieren wohl mindestens 60 weitere und ähnlich gelagerte Verdachtsfälle in China. Der Schaden könnte sich auf mehr als 4,5 Milliarden Euro belaufen, wie das <em>Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie</em> schätzt. Beim Hauptstadtbüro Bioenergie handelt es sich um eine Vertretung der Branche in Berlin.</p><p>Der Kern des vermutlichen Betrugs liegt in den Klimaschutzauflagen für Öl-Konzerne. Sie sind gesetzlich dazu verpflichtet, die von etwa Benzin und Diesel verursachten Emissionen jährlich zu senken. Die Kennzahlen dafür legt die Bundesregierung fest. Dabei reicht es nicht mehr, biologische Anteile in die Kraftstoffe zu mischen. Da so die Quoten nicht mehr erfüllt werden können.</p><h2>Behörden können zur Kontrolle der Klimaschutz-Projekte nicht in China einreisen</h2><p>Ein anderer vom Gesetzgeber vorgesehener Weg zur Einhaltung der THG-Quote ist die Möglichkeit, als Alternative im Ausland CO₂-Sparmaßnahmen zu finanzieren. Bei der Öl- und Gasförderung gibt es verschiedene technische Möglichkeiten, die Emissionen zu drücken. Mit der Reduzierung dieser sogenannten „Upstream-Emissionen“ – kurz UER – dürfen Konzerne seit 2020 ein Fünftel ihrer THG-Quoten erfüllen. Um die UER zu bestimmen, wird eine mögliche Menge an Emissionen der „grünen Anlage“ mit dem Wert verglichen, der entstünde, wenn die Förderungsanlagen nicht mit einem Projekt zur Minderung der Abgase gebaut worden wäre. Der Wert wird dabei über genormte Grundsätze nach ISO 14065 ermittelt. </p><p>Ölkonzerne können aber auch Zertifikate kaufen, die für eine Klimaschutz-Investition in eine Raffinerie oder andere Förderanlage stehen. Die Ausgaben für alle Vorhaben werden auf den Kraftstoffpreis an der Tankstelle umgelegt.</p><p>Das <a href="https://www.fr.de/politik/tbl-china-klimapolitik-treibhausgas-emissionen-co2-klimawandel-cop-28-entwicklungsland-zr-92405505.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten &quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:33,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle genehmigten </a>75 dieser UER-Projekte – fast ausschließlich in China. Und das, obwohl weitere Hinweise dafür sprachen, besser nicht dort zu investieren. Denn China lässt unabhängige Kontrollen im eigenen Land nicht zu. Peking verweigert entsprechenden Prüfer:innen die Einreise.</p><p>„Das Ausmaß des Betrugs am Klimaschutz ist verheerend. Mehr als 7,6 Millionen Tonnen angeblicher CO₂-Einsparung hat es real nie gegeben. Das können wir jetzt nicht einfach mit einem Achselzucken abtun“, sagte Sandra Rostek dazu in einem Statement. Sie ist Leiterin des Hauptstadtbüros Bioenergie. „Hinweisgeber aus der Branche wurden von den Behörden abgewimmelt – noch vor wenigen Wochen wurden offenkundig gefälschte Projekte durchgewunken. Wir hoffen, dass vor dem Hintergrund der Recherche-Ergebnisse des <em>ZDF</em> die verantwortlichen Behörden endlich aufwachen.“</p><p>Was Rostek mit dem „Durchwinken“ meint, ist die anscheinend unzureichende Prüfung der Bauvorhaben durch das Umweltbundesamt und die Deutsche Emissionshandelsstelle. Über Satellitenbilder wäre einfach zu erkennen gewesen, dass einige der eingereichten chinesischen Vorhaben schon vor dem eigentlichen Baustart existiert haben. Dazu würden die Anlagen in keiner Weise den Vorgaben als UER-Projekt gerecht, wie das <em>ZDF</em> herausfand.</p><figure><p><img src="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkBG.jpg" loading="lazy" srcset="https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkb9.jpg 448w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullk73.jpg 768w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkBG.jpg 1100w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullk7d.jpg 1408w,https://www.fr.de/assets/images/34/795/34795078-in-ihrem-ministerium-soll-es-massive-fehler-in-der-zulassung-von-emissions-projekten-gegeben-haben-bundesumweltministerin-steffi-lemke-1JNwnsullkPH.jpg 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 769px) 768px, 100vw" height="733" width="1100" alt="In ihrem Ministerium soll es massive Fehler in der Zulassung von Emissions-Projekten gegeben haben: Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke"></p><figcaption>In ihrem Ministerium soll es massive Fehler in der Zulassung von Emissions-Projekten gegeben haben: Bundesumweltministerin Steffi Lemke (Grüne). ©&nbsp;Kay Nietfeld/dpa</figcaption></figure><h2>Möglicher Milliarden-Betrug: Verbraucherschützer, Opposition und Verbände üben Kritik</h2><p>„Durch <a href="https://www.op-online.de/offenbach/sieben-gasversorger-aus-der-region-nach-recherche-des-netzwerks-correctiv-unter-druck-93048646.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;fehlerhafte Zertifizierungen und schlampige Kontrollen&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:39,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">fehlerhafte Zertifizierungen und schlampige Kontrollen</a> deutscher Behörden ist nicht nur ein horrender finanzieller Schaden entstanden, sondern auch ein massiver Vertrauensverlust in Klimaschutzprojekte im Ausland“, kritisiert Anja Weisgerber, klimapolitische Sprecherin der Union den Vorfall im Bundestag.</p><p>Die THG-Quoten an sich sind dadurch laut <em>ADAC </em><a href="https://www.fr.de/wirtschaft/ablasshandel-fuers-klima-greenwashing-co2-kompensation-93020231.html" data-id-ec="{&quot;sht&quot;:&quot;Container&quot;,&quot;shn&quot;:&quot;Story&quot;,&quot;p&quot;:{&quot;containerType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph&quot;,&quot;displayType&quot;:&quot;Paragraph InlineLink&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;INLINE_LINK&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;kaum aussagekräftig&quot;,&quot;variant&quot;:&quot;standardLink&quot;,&quot;sponsored&quot;:false,&quot;storyElementPosition&quot;:41,&quot;storyElementCount&quot;:43}}">kaum aussagekräftig</a>.

The price of building material and construction labor can fluctuate, sure, but not by enough to explain the massive surge in housing costs. The key driver of housing scarcity is actually </span><em>land</em><span> scarcity – you can always build more houses, but there’s a limited amount of land to build them on, especially in desirable locations close to jobs where people actually want to live.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, those that already own land often become “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY" rel="">NIMBYs</a><span>” who lobby for restrictive building and zoning policies that restrict </span><em>other </em><span>landowners from building, because more housing could help meet demand, in turn lowering the market value of the NIMBY’s existing properties.</span></p><p><span>A land crisis is therefore a root cause of a housing crisis, and ultimately affects not just housing, but </span><a href="https://www.worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/" rel="">the entire economy at large</a><span>.

Any kind of durable upgrade or stationary investment counts as an “improvement.” Land Value Taxes tax </span><em>only</em><span> the land, and leaves the improvements untaxed.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Heavily tax squatting on land</strong><br><span>By placing a heavy tax on the land asset, you make it expensive to simply buy land and hold it for no reason, or for speculative reasons (waiting for the price to go up).</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Incentivizes adding profitable improvements to land</strong><br><span>Players should only want to buy land if they plan to build something productive on top of it that at the very least pays the land tax. This is a strong incentive to build useful stuff instead of just squatting and sucking up rent, or holding the land out of use and waiting for its value to go up.</span></p></li></ol><p><span>Note that Land Value Tax behaves differently from a conventional </span><em>Property Tax</em><span>. Property taxes tax both the land </span><em>and</em><span> its improvements, and can lead to perverse incentives (such as punishing you for building stuff, and rewarding you for keeping it vacant). The key is to tax the land and </span><em>only</em><span> the land.</span></p><p><span>But why just land? Because assets that are truly "land-like" are special - they gatekeep access to core features and/or economic privileges, and </span><em>you can't make any more of them</em><span>. That makes it easy for landowners to collectively corner the market on land and dictate terms to everybody else.</span></p><p><span>Without LVT – i.e., the typical status quo – It will be expensive to </span><em>buy</em><span> land, but cheap to </span><em>hold</em><span> land.

There are constructs that look and behave a lot like land. But this is an illusion and the details of how land is implemented matter immensely.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Rent</strong><span>: The mechanic of players renting to other players is rather rare in traditional games, but is becoming particularly popular in blockchain games. A common purpose of such a feature is to offer a way for players to engage with the economy when crucial assets have very high prices. Of course, those high prices are themselves often a symptom of a virtual world designed as a financial vehicle first and a game second. But suffice it to say, some games let you rent assets to other players, with the return of the asset upon expiry of the contract enforced by software rather than courts of law.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Taxes</strong><span>: Virtual worlds tend to use faucet-and-drain economies where digital assets can be created and destroyed on whim. Virtual taxes generally act as yet another arbitrary sink, often in service of a player incentive. Much of real-world concerns about levying taxes to pay for communal services barely apply.</span></p></li></ul><p>It is easy to just assume that everyone knows what “land” is. But in virtual worlds these need to be recreated from first principles. Certain assumptions become design choices. Is land finite? In the real world, that’s obviously true. In the virtual world, it is a choice. And how does “location” work? In the real world we take Euclidean geometry and conventional physics for granted – you can’t be in two places at once, you can’t instantly warp from one location to another, etc., but these need not be so in a virtual world.</p><p>With all that properly understood, let’s talk about how to actually implement a digital Land Value Tax in a virtual world.</p><p>There are four basic steps to implementing a digital Land Value Tax policy:</p><ol><li><p>Identify “land-like assets”</p></li><li><p>Separate “improvements” from “land”</p></li><li><p>Discover the full market value of land (ideally as both rental income and as selling value)</p></li><li><p>Levy a Land Value Tax that captures 85-100% of land rents</p></li></ol><p>There are a few other baseline requirements that your virtual world must first fulfill for this to work, of course:</p><ol><li><p>Land must be tradeable</p></li><li><p>There must be some kind of currency to levy the tax in</p></li></ol><p><span>Keep in mind that if </span><em>you</em><span> don’t make land tradeable, or provide some sort of currency for your economy, players may simply provide both features themselves. If land cannot be formally traded between accounts in-game, players will form a black market to buy, sell, and trade accounts out-of-game, or provide services that do whatever it takes to move an asset from one account and into another one. And if you don’t provide an official currency, players will find some other commodity in game to stand in for one and use that.</span></p><p>Your first step should be to evaluate your design and identify land-like assets. But what is a “land-like asset”? Generally speaking it’s any thing you can own that fulfills three requirements:</p><ol><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>strictly scarce</strong><span> and </span><strong>cannot be produced</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>necessary for production or gameplay</strong></p></li><li><p><span>Is </span><strong>more or less valuable because of its location</strong></p></li></ol><p>(Also, it goes without saying that the asset must have a significant degree of persistence and be identifiable to the community – if it’s ephemeral or highly instanced it’s not a good candidate for a land-like asset)</p><p><span>The asset must be something that players cannot make. It needs to be essentially finite in supply, pre-provided by the developers themselves as part of “the world,” and come with the </span><em>expectation that only a certain amount of it will be provided</em><span>.</span></p><p>Occasional expansions in the land supply weaken this property but don’t necessarily break it.

Taking our network graph from before, let's say each node represents a piece of land, the size of the node represents the market value of its "inherent" developer-provided resources and affordances, and lines connecting nodes represent travel connections. Let's say owning a plot entitles you to everything it produces as well as to charge a fee for people and goods to move across it.</p><p>Which one of these nodes is most valuable?

This is a textbook example of a digital land-like asset, despite the thematic set dressing of a “factory.”</span></p></div><p>Much of the value generated in a virtual world is social capital. We often think of value in terms of ‘stuff’ but in a virtual economy assets are mostly illusionary. What isn’t an illusion is our relative relationships inside the virtual world with other human beings. They are real, we are real and we care deeply about our standing with others.</p><div><p><span>Land-like assets have adjacency to those other people. They help codify and mediate relationships, status and social support.</span></p><p><span>If you look carefully, you can track large portions of location value to social network adjacencies with either strong benefits or lowered costs. To consider Manhattan again, the land is primarily valuable because of the proximity to all the people here and the services they provide.

In </span><em>CQXII</em><span>, resources are gathered from land, and all structures must be built on land. This makes access to land “necessary for production” because without land you can’t participate in major parts of the game. Finally, the location of the land matters. As other players regularly gather in particular locations, land closer to those settlements will become more valuable. This is due to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economies_of_agglomeration" rel="">agglomeration effect</a><span>. </span><em>CQXII</em><span> land is a fully land-like asset, and thus a prime asset for speculators that will yield the greatest returns.</span></p><p><span>These are tradeable deeds granted by in-game authorities and are similar to real-world </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxi_medallion" rel="">taxi medallions</a><span>. Players who wish to engage in certain economic activities such as building temples or brewing potions must first obtain the respective permit from the priest’s guild or the witch’s guild. Each guild issues only a fixed number of permits, but within its own category, one permit is as good as any other. In this sense permits are non-unique and thus “fungible.” Permits are necessary for production because the game will literally not allow you to do certain things without the right permit in your inventory. Permits have many properties in common with land in that they gate-keep access to the economy: an enterprising witch doesn’t have to brew her own potions, she can let an apprentice operate under her permit and charge the apprentice rent for the privilege. However, permits aren’t tied to a particular location and thus don’t obtain locational value the same way land does. They’re somewhat land-like, but not all the way there. There will be speculative interest in permits, but not as much as in land.</span></p><p><span>Unicorns are a special kind of mount in </span><em>CQXII</em><span>. They aren’t necessary for production, but they are very nice to have because they are swift, loyal, and impervious to all forms of harm. Only 10,000 unicorns exist on any given server, and the developers have sworn to never create any more. Since Unicorns aren’t tied to a particular location, they don’t obtain locational value. The only way unicorns are “land-like” is that they are scarce in supply. But because they aren’t truly necessary for production, it’s not a big deal if you don’t own a unicorn. There is some speculative interest in holding unicorns due to their scarcity. That said, in the long term most of the value of bids will be based on their inherent utility, given that unicorn ownership doesn’t gatekeep participation in the economy itself.</span></p><p>Horses are a common type of mount. They are very useful and nice to have, but they aren’t necessary for production, they aren’t scarce, and they don’t obtain locational value. If you want to buy a horse all you have to do is go to your local horse breeder and buy one. And if that particular breeder won’t sell you one, another one will. Worst case scenario, you can just go out into the wild and try to tame a wild stallion yourself. Horses have little speculative interest because owning one doesn’t grant you any real leverage over anybody else; their value is entirely derived from their utility.</p><p>The next step is to distinguish between land-like assets and “improvements” that have been made to or built upon them. In the real world the most typical example of an “improvement” is a building, but technically speaking anything that makes land more valuable that comes from applying labor or capital counts as an improvement. Plowing a field, irrigating it, or planting an orchard on it all count as improvements. In the context of a game both “upgrades” and “buildings” count as “improvements.”</p><p><span>If your game does </span><em>not </em><span>include any features whereby players may “improve” on land-like-assets, then there is nothing to be done here. In that case, all you need to do is ensure that there is a healthy sale and/or rental market so that you can derive land purchase prices and rental income directly from observation. If there are improvement mechanisms (such as building construction), then you must take special care in your implementation to make it as easy as possible to separate the market value of improvements from the market value of unimproved land.</span></p><p>In the real world, separating land from improvements is a complex but feasible task. You should therefore be able to implement a Land Value Tax in almost any kind of online multiplayer game with much less difficulty than in the real world. There are, however, certain choices that could make your job easier.</p><p>If you take good care to log all market transactions from the game’s first day of operation, you give yourself a huge advantage that would make real-world assessors green with envy. Having complete and comprehensive data makes any numerical estimation method much more powerful. This assumes of course that your economy is healthy and is not pushing a large volume of transactions off onto a black market that is invisible to you.</p><p>The greatest affordance we have in the digital world is that we can, in principle, move any player-created structure or improvement anywhere we want. We may still wish to constrain players’ ability to do this themselves, but the point is that the power is available to the game developers. It is perfectly feasible to let the player pluck the house off a plot of land, stuff it in their inventory, and sell the land bare.</p><p><span>In the real world, most houses can’t be trivially moved from one spot to another, and even then no two houses are </span><em>exactly </em><span>alike – especially considering varying amounts of wear and tear. In the digital world it is perfectly plausible for certain structures to be perfectly interchangeable commodities, and degradation of virtual goods doesn’t exist unless you explicitly implement it. This makes it much easier to assess the value of improvements as there is less variation to consider between assets.</span></p><p>In order to levy a Land Value Tax, we must first assess the value of land. And what do we mean by “land value?” There’s two different kinds:</p><ol><li><p><span>Land </span><em>selling</em><span> value</span></p></li><li><p><span>Recurring land </span><em>income</em></p></li></ol><div><p><span>Land income drives land selling value (aka land price), not the other way around. The amount someone is willing to pay for land is the </span><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/npv.asp" rel="">net present value </a><span>of the recurring income the land generates – the amount of money you expect the land to produce over some time horizon, adjusted for how patient you are. This income can be literal monetary income, benefits the land provides that someone is willing to pay money for, or a mix of both.</span></p><p><span>In any case, whether you’re assessing selling value or income, all assessments are based on a simple algebraic equation:</span></p></div><p><em><strong>T = I + L</strong></em><br><em><strong>T</strong><span>otal Market Value </span><strong>= </strong><span>(</span><strong>I</strong><span>mprovements Value) + (</span><strong>L</strong><span>and Value)</span></em></p><p>If you know any two of these values, you can derive the third, known as the “residual.”</p><div><p><span>But we must also take care to assess at </span><em>full market value. </em><span>Full market value specifically means the value an asset would obtain in the market under “fair and unconstrained” conditions. As a counter-example, if your dad sells you a valuable plot of land for $1, he’s intentionally selling it for less than full market value; he’s essentially giving you a gift. So we should exclude any such non-"arm’s length" transactions as a basis for assessments.</span></p><p><span>The goal is to discover the full market selling value of every land parcel in our virtual world. We have three main ways we can do this:</span></p></div><ol><li><p>Assessment</p></li><li><p>Short-term leases with auctions</p></li><li><p><span>Harberger taxes</span><br><span>a. Modified Harberger Taxes</span><br><span>b. Blood Taxes</span></p></li></ol><p><span>In the real world, property assessors use a variety of complex methods for estimating the value of land separately from that of buildings, typically something like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_regression" rel="">hedonic regression</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the digital world, we can just accept separate bids on the land and the improvements for any given property in the game, and thus generate cleanly separated valuations directly from the market. Any player may offer to buy </span><em>just the land</em><span> or </span><em>just the improvements</em><span>. If the land alone is sold, the improvements are stuffed into the owner’s inventory. If the improvements are sold, they go into the buyer’s inventory and the owner’s land becomes bare.</span></p><p>This allows you to collect true market data about how players value land and improvements separately.</p><p><span>To estimate the value of assets that have not had recent market transactions, you compare those to recently sold comparable properties in the area, making adjustments for differences. In practice you can automate this procedure with either a linear regression model or a machine learning model that uses a dataset built from your observed market transactions and the properties of your assets (with location being a highly salient property). You will want to ensure that your model not only has predictive value for the hold-out set of data you use to evaluate the model during training, but also that it </span><em>actually accurately predicts the value of future transactions</em><span>.</span></p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Good price discovery</p></li><li><p>Can be retrofitted into an existing land economy</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Requires you to do math and book-keeping</p></li></ul><p>There are other ways to perform price discovery of land-like assets for the purposes of levying an LVT, or even replacing LVT with a different kind of policy that achieves many of the same goals. Let’s look at those next.</p><p>In this model the “government” (ie the developer) “owns” the actual title to all the land in the game, and simply leases it out. Every player becomes a de-facto tenant and must renew their lease at the end of the rental term.</p><p><span>At the end of the rental term, the land goes up for auction, and the player who wins the auction becomes the next holder of the land. There are many, many, kinds of auctions, but a popular one for this sort of purpose is the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vickrey_auction" rel="">Vickrey Auction</a><span> – all bids are secret, the winner is whoever gives the highest bid, and the price the winner pays is the amount of the </span><em>second highest</em><span> bid. The advantage of this kind of auction is that each bidder is incentivized to bid the maximum amount the asset is actually worth to them, without worrying about what others are likely to bid. This is because if the bidder wins the auction, they will not pay the amount of their own bid, but the lower amount bid by whoever came in second place. In the event that there is only one bidder, that person wins the auction regardless of what they bid, the "next highest bid" is zero, and the asset may be had for free.</span></p><p>Although it is essential that bids are kept secret from other bidders, the game developer can and should access that information for purposes of price discovery. Once the auction has been conducted we have three things: 1) a willing buyer, 2) a winning market price, and 3) a range of bids.</p><p>The downside to this approach is that it’s more aggressive than an LVT. Land Value Taxes are an ongoing signal to the player to make the best use of their land or sell it to someone who will, but the choice is still ultimately theirs. When a short-term lease expires, the owner could lose the land simply by losing the auction. Also, land income values cannot be reassessed by this method on any more frequent time interval than the term of the lease itself, whereas the traditional methods could (in theory) reassess values on any schedule.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Simple to implement</p></li><li><p>Excellent price discovery</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Exposes the landowner to the risk of a forced sale at the end of the auction term</p></li><li><p>Harder to retrofit into an existing game, best implemented from the start</p></li></ul><div><p><span>This method was popularized by the book </span><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets" rel="">Radical Markets</a><span>. In this system everyone self-assesses the value of their own property. They just come up with a number and write it down, that’s the value of their property. In our case, we would only need to have players do this for land-like assets.</span></p><p><span>Two crucial things happen next:</span></p></div><ol><li><p>Players pay taxes based on that valuation</p></li><li><p><em>Anyone </em><span>has the right to purchase the asset for that valuation in a forced sale</span></p></li></ol><p>This unusual method is supposed to balance incentives: you have an incentive to not value your item too high to avoid paying taxes, but you also have an incentive to not value your item too low lest it be bought off of you. Ideally a rational player will be forced to discover the true market value of their asset in this way. A price that is not so high you can’t bear to pay the taxes, but is not so low that you’d be unwilling to take that much money in exchange for it.</p><p>To put it another way:</p><p>Most people would accept an offer to buy their house for a billion dollars, but not for 1 dollar.</p><div><p><span>Most people would be glad to pay an annual X% tax on 1 dollar, but not on a billion dollars.</span></p><p><span>The entire idea of Harberger taxes is to find the sweet spot in the middle of that range, for every piece of property. This could be one way for getting players themselves to conduct price discovery for land-like assets.</span></p><p><span>There are downsides. For one, it assumes a certain level of sophistication on the user’s behalf. One can easily imagine novice players under- or over- pricing assets and running into trouble. There could also be innocent mistakes with huge consequences such as misplacing a decimal point or a zero. If you try to ameliorate this with some auto-populated default value, players will probably heavily gravitate towards it, defeating the point of the self-assessment.</span></p><p><span>This method can also force the current landowner off the property with little notice and no recourse, which is a huge issue and likely makes it a non-starter for many virtual worlds.</span></p><p><span>There </span><em>are</em><span> proposed ways to modify Harberger Tax schemes to get around the abrupt forced sale problem, but they make the implementation even more complex.</span></p></div><p><span>In classic Harberger taxes, if a buyer is willing to pay more than the valuation, they get it right away. In a modified version proposed by </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FabricioNakata/status/1434081416778682374" rel="">Fabricio Nakata</a><span>, you instead make the prospective buyer put their offer money into an escrow account (this is an implementation detail that the game developer would manage). The owner may then decide to either accept the offer or reject it.</span></p><p>If they reject the offer, the property’s valuation immediately rises to match the value of the rejected offer, and the rejected buyer is rewarded with a bounty – an amount equal to the additional tax that will now be levied because of the increased valuation (for e.g. 1-2 months or whatever the appropriate duration of time is). If the owner of the property wants their assessment lowered, they may do so by changing their self-valuation, but must put money in a “bounty bond” account that is sufficient to pay out the bounty if someone comes along and offers a higher price for the property and the owner chooses to reject it.</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li><p>Excellent price discovery</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Exposes the landowner to forced sales (in classic Harberger)</p></li><li><p>Larger complexity burden (in modified Harberger)</p></li><li><p>Punishes simple mistakes and unsophisticated players</p></li></ul><p>There’s another way to modify the concept of Harberger Taxes, specifically in the context of video games, which we call “Blood Taxes.”</p><div><p><span>If you squint, Harberger Taxes look a little bit like balancing the costs of attacking and defending territory, only with money instead of weapons. The player wants to invest a certain amount in “defense” to protect their land, but not so much that they consume more resources than the land is worth, defeating the point of holding it in the first place. Since we’re talking about video games here, there’s no reason you couldn’t implement such a system with actual attacking and actual defending.</span></p><p><span>Redirecting a portion of land income to building fortifications and garrisoning defenders is akin to paying taxes, and funding an invading army to seize the land is akin to offering a buyout price. Since it is typically much cheaper to defend something than to attack it, the attacker must spend proportionately more to seize the land than it costs for the defender to protect it. The attacker is willing to do this because the ultimate prize is the recurring income of the land. If the attacker can push the defender to the point where all their income is gobbled up by defense spending, the defender may even choose to simply abandon the territory rather than keep up the fight.</span></p><p><span>The “price” here is ultimately paid in “blood” rather than in money, and the “taxes” aren’t collected by anyone, but this is a video game where taxes often just go straight into a sink, so there’s not much difference on that score.</span></p><p><span>Naively, “blood taxes” are more akin to a </span><em>property </em><span>tax rather than a land tax, because if invaders can capture improvements built by the defenders, that could serve to increase the price attackers are willing to pay and that defenders must respond to. To make sure blood taxes only fall on land, one would need to modify the gameplay such that improvements cannot be seized by an invading army, only the bare land. There are two ways to do this. One is to instantly raze all improvements on conquered land (a hefty transaction cost to the “seller” that imposes significant deadweight loss). Another way would be to pluck the vanquished defender’s castle off the land, stick it in the defender’s pocket as a consolation prize, and send them on their way. Giving defeated players some portion of the value of their destroyed base is a fairly common mechanic already, so this fits in.</span></p><p><span>Virtual world economies are driven by faucets and drains and must constantly sink value to stave off the ever-present specter of runaway inflation, so this particular implementation isn’t as outlandish as it first appears.</span></p><p><span>The biggest limitation to blood taxes is that the thematic set dressing and PVP framing is not appropriate for every type of game and should thus not be regarded as a universal solution.</span></p><p><span>Pros:</span></p></div><ul><li><p>No worrying about market transactions and taxes, just let people fight</p></li><li><p>Don't bore players to death with tax policy, just kill them to death</p></li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li><p>Needs modification otherwise it’s just a property tax</p></li><li><p>Exposes the landowner to straight-up violent conquest</p></li><li><p>Inefficiency of war causes “assessment errors” for both attackers and defenders</p></li><li><p>Requires a battle and conquest mechanic</p></li><li><p>Changing the battle system could have unintended economic consequences</p></li></ul><p>Every game is different so we can't point to any specific price discovery solution as universally appropriate. But generally speaking we rank them in this order:</p><ol><li><p>Short-term leases</p></li><li><p>Assessment</p></li><li><p>Harberger Taxes</p></li></ol><p>Short-term leases with Vickrey auctions are simple and give you direct access to land income market values, but they can be harder to retrofit into existing games.</p><p>Assessment can work well and can be used to drop an LVT policy into an existing game, but you'll need to do some math and carefully track transaction records.</p><p>Harberger Taxes are interesting and theoretically brilliant, but are probably a hard sell to players and raise UX concerns.</p><p>That said, all of these are excellent candidates, and you should evaluate all of the choices and make the right decision for your particular game. Even better, get your game economist to run a controlled A/B experiment. If you do, write to us and tell us the results!</p><div><p><span>Okay, so we’ve identified the land-like assets, we’ve separated land from improvements, and we’ve accurately assessed the full market selling value of all the land. What’s next?</span></p><p><span>The next step is to actually levy the tax. Decide on a time interval (say, once a month), pick a tax rate to apply, and then charge landowners the tax. If someone doesn’t pay their tax, the land is confiscated and sold at auction to the public (throw in a grace period if you feel like, it's your virtual world).</span></p></div><p><span>Orthodox Georgism proposes a tax rate of 85-100% on the </span><em>recurring rental income </em><span>generated by land. The basic idea is that the </span><strong>selling price of land should approach zero</strong><span>. Let that be your north star: if land still has a large selling price, your LVT is too low. If land is being abandoned and players have to be paid to hold it (the selling price is negative), then your LVT is too high.</span></p><p>Wait! That’s weird!</p><p>If we levy a Land Value Tax, and we get it exactly right, and the price of the land goes to zero, and we base the tax on the land value, which is now zero… isn’t there a problem here?</p><p>This is a common point of confusion, but it's actually not that hard to disentangle it. First let's nail down some precise terms:</p><p><strong>Land Selling Value</strong><span>, refers to the actual selling price of land in the market, which “prices in” any taxes the holder of the land has to pay.</span></p><div><p><strong>Land Income</strong><span>, is the market value of the recurring benefit that the land itself produces. </span><em>It is land income that drives land selling value, not the other way around. </em><span>Land Income is </span><em>unchanged</em><span> by Land Value Tax. The land’s productivity doesn’t go down. But the Land Selling Value </span><em>does</em><span> change.</span></p><p><span>Bear with us while we step through some math and explain. Here's the formula for Land Selling Value:</span></p></div><p><em><strong>S = (I - T) / D</strong></em></p><div><p><em><span>Land </span><strong>S</strong><span>elling Value = (Land </span><strong>I</strong><span>ncome - Land </span><strong>T</strong><span>axes) / </span><strong>D</strong><span>iscount Rate</span></em></p><p><strong>Discount Rate</strong><span> represents how much one values a dollar today versus a dollar tomorrow. Even if some land could theoretically generate an infinite amount of benefits if I held on to it forever, I'm not going to live that long. I care about my investment's value tomorrow, and next year, and maybe even over the next few decades, but I don't care about it's value in 5,000 years. The less patient I am, the higher my discount rate, and the less I'm willing to pay for the same piece of income-generating land.</span></p></div><p>Here are some example calculations using a 5% annual discount rate, showing how a change in land taxes affects the selling value:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png" width="1028" height="331" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:331,&quot;width&quot;:1028,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27348,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f9223f-221e-410e-af68-2a02df0a4219_1028x331.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><div><p><span>What this example hopefully makes clear is that </span><strong>LVT is a tax on the recurring land income</strong><em><strong>, </strong></em><strong>not the selling price</strong><span>. We are not proposing a recurring tax anywhere close to the actual full purchase price of a plot of land.</span></p><p><span>If your game has a rental mechanic then you should have lots of transaction records for the rental price of land. This should allow you to build a model that gives you an accurate assessed rental income value for every piece of land. Tax that at 85-100%, and adjust accordingly until you observe that the land’s selling price is approximately zero. You don’t need to get it perfect, in fact it’s preferable to undershoot the Land Value Tax by a little bit just to be safe (hence the 85% lower bound).</span></p></div><p><span>Evidence suggests you can see good results even without a perfectly calibrated 100% LVT. Economist Ramin Shokrizade, with no formal knowledge of Georgist theory, </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">fixed </a><em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">EVE Online</a></em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-i-used-eve-online-to-predict-the-great-recession" rel="">’s land recession</a><span> simply by directing CCP Games to assess a “high enough” holding fee to land-like spaceship factories, which had the effect of dissuading speculators.</span></p><p>But what if you don’t have a rental mechanic or only have selling values in your transaction logs? In that case you’ll need to work out the land income indirectly.</p><p>The capitalization rate is the ratio between the selling price of land and how much income it generates for the owner. If you have a rental mechanic, you can calculate this ratio easily. But if you don’t, you’ll need to measure income in another way, such as assessing the market value of all the resources and other benefits that a player generates over a unit of time by holding the land.</p><p>For context, in the real world annual capitalization rates tend to be somewhere between 3-10% of the selling value of land. If you have absolutely no idea what an appropriate capitalization rate for your virtual world is, start by guessing somewhere in the 3-10% range, observe what happens to the selling price of land, and adjust up or down accordingly. Remember – your goal is to get the selling price of land to approach zero without going negative.</p><p>If you are levying a full 100% LVT, then the tax rate and the capitalization rate will be the same. If you are levying an 85% LVT, then the tax rate will be 85% of the capitalization rate.</p><p>Here are some examples of how land selling price and land rental income relate to the capitalization rate:</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png" width="1032" height="382" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:382,&quot;width&quot;:1032,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:27535,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae65cc76-f71c-4153-8ca8-0093ede7988b_1032x382.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>Note that in the real world capitalization rates tend to vary both by location and by property type (commercial vs. residential, urban vs. rural, etc) and we would expect to see similar results in the digital world.

Look at the price of land in the market. If it’s close to zero, you’re doing a good job. If it’s a lot more than zero, there’s still a lot of uncollected land income. And if it’s </span><em>less</em><span> than zero, meaning you have to </span><em>pay</em><span> people to get them to willingly hold land, you’re taxing it too much.

The land’s fundamental productivity doesn’t change if you tax it, but </span><em>who </em><span>is collecting that same amount of land income does. You have the privilege of observing both the amount that you, the “government,” are collecting, as well as what any tenants are being charged. From these two figures you can always know the total amount. It’s on this basis that you can calculate the full untaxed market value of the land.</span></p><p><span>That said, you can also just guess, and then iteratively adjust the land taxes until the market responds with land prices approaching zero, knowing this signals that your tax rates are appropriate. What’s the land income for a parcel of land whose price has been driven to exactly 0?

What are we gonna do we do with it? Well, first it depends what kind of money you raised.</span></p></div><p><span>Most traditional MMO’s that lack “real money” economies will simply delete the money raised by an LVT. This is for two reasons: 1) the in-game currency is useless for funding real world development costs, and 2) the primary economic challenge of traditional MMO’s is </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudflation" rel="">MUDflation</a><span>, where endgame players accumulate lots of money with nothing to sink it in, flooding the market with currency and driving down the market price of high-end items. Given that housing is a traditional end-game “money sink” mechanic, LVT is a natural solution to this problem.</span></p><p><span>By “real money” we mean a game in which you can cash </span><em>out </em><span>virtual currency for real world currency through any number of intermediaries (black markets, crypto, paypal, banks, etc). There are plenty of systems in which you can only cash </span><em>in</em><span> real money (Steam Wallets are a good example), and these don't count.</span></p><div><p><span>If your economy runs on “real money,” two things change.</span></p><p><span>The first is you are much more vulnerable to having criminals use your game for money laundering and your players become valuable targets for account theft, but that is beyond the scope of this particular paper.</span></p></div><p>The second thing that changes is that the same currency players use to trade in-game could also obtain real world value for you, the developer. What can you do with the money?</p><ol><li><p><strong>Keep it. </strong><span>Because why not?</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Employee bonuses. </strong><span>Give it to your employees, they deserve it.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Reinvest it.</strong><span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_George_theorem" rel="">The Henry George Theorem</a><span>, derived by Nobel Laureate Joseph Stiglitz, predicts that spending on “pure public goods” causes land values to rise proportionately, and other research suggests that a partial effect holds for other kinds of public spending. A real-money LVT game could use the stimulating effects of LVT on user generated content, and the tendency of “public spending” by the developer on new features to soak into land values, and set up a self-funding flywheel.</span></p></li><li><p><strong>Universal Basic Income.</strong><span> Henry George was an early proponent of what we now call UBI, called a “</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen's_dividend" rel="">Citizen’s Dividend</a><span>” in his time. You take the taxes collected by LVT and share them out equally among your players. In this way your player base, which is one of the key things that makes your game grow in value, are at least partially compensated for the value they are creating. In the digital world this immediately throws up some red flags about who gets to count as a player. You will have to avoid the problem of people signing up under 10 different accounts to get multiple UBI payments.</span></p></li></ol><p>If you're building a virtual world that includes land-like assets, you need to be careful about perverse incentives that can attract land speculators who will suck all the fun out of your game and crash your in-game economy.</p><p>To fix this, you must identify land-like assets, separate the value of "improvements" from that of "land," measure the selling value and/or recurring income of the land, and then levy a Land Value Tax that captures 85-100% of the land income. This creates a "use it or lose it" holding fee that properly aligns incentives, ensuring that only people who want to use land-like assets for their actual intended purpose will hold onto them.</p><p>But a few questions still linger.</p><div><p><span>The good news is that, having exhaustively investigated Blockchain and NFT technology, we conclude that there is nothing in current practice (and very little in theory) that can be done in games with these technologies that cannot be accomplished just as easily (or more easily) with conventional solutions.</span></p><p><span>So if you’re making a Blockchain or NFT game, anything in this policy paper should be just as applicable, with the exception that you are in a worse position for adjudicating disputes as you lack the power to reverse fraudulent transactions and </span><a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=axie%20infinity%20hack" rel="">hacks</a><span> that occur on an immutable blockchain. Also, the high valuations currently chasing blockchain games will also give you a much more aggressive set of financially motivated bad actors to contend with.</span></p><p><span>Good luck!</span></p></div><p><span>Yes, you certainly can. If land supply can increase as necessary, that makes it less scarce, which makes the asset less "land-like" economically speaking. This is </span><em><a href="https://secondlife.com/" rel="">Second Life</a></em><span>'s approach to land, more or less.</span></p><p><span>But creating more land isn't always a solution. Maybe your server cost structure has limits, so you can't just spin up tons of new housing blocks (as is commonly alleged about </span><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em><span>).</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, it's hard to escape the agglomeration effect. Land has value for three reasons: location, location, location. This comes from proximity to centers of economic activity, valuable resources, and most importantly, people. So even on an infinite plane, some locations will always be more valuable than others. America has plenty of empty land, but a patch of desert is no replacement for New York City. Likewise, </span><em>Ultima Online</em><span> has plenty of servers, but there's no replacement for the Atlantic shard.</span></p><p><span>This is the case for a lot of blockchain games like </span><em><a href="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/p/0c8f89fe-cf3f-4809-9eba-4fe050405ca5/decentraland.org/" rel="">Decentraland</a></em><span>, </span><em><a href="https://axieinfinity.com/" rel="">Axie Infinity</a></em><span>, and </span><em><a href="https://www.fortressofdoors.com/p/0c8f89fe-cf3f-4809-9eba-4fe050405ca5/sandbox.game/en/" rel="">The Sandbox</a></em><span>, who have sold millions of dollars worth of land in advance of most (or any) of their land-based features coming online.</span></p><p>We're sorry to say this, but you might be hosed.</p><p>When you pre-sell land, you attract a certain class of investor who expects a return on that asset. And because you've used both the metaphor and the mechanics of land from the real world, they're expecting it will play out the same way: buy land when it's cheap, wait for people to move in and start building stuff, and see the investment rise in value.</p><p>When the predictable land crisis hits, you are faced with two terrible choices:</p><p><span>1. Protect land scarcity, angering the landless and cutting off user growth, OR</span><br><span>2. Make concessions to the landless, sparking a landowner revolt</span></p><p><span>There's signs of the second one starting to bubble in the Axie Infinity community as we speak, it wasn't hard to find responses like these in the wake of a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOZN61kdnBI" rel="">Q&amp;A about their upcoming land gameplay</a><span>:</span></p><p><span>We don't envy anyone who has painted themselves into this corner</span><em>. </em><span>Our best advice to everyone else is to not put yourself there in the first place.</span></p><p>Building a virtual world is no easy task, but by George, you can do this.</p><p>And Land Value Tax can help.</p><p><em><span>Originally published on </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/land-value-tax-in-online-games-and-virtual-worlds-a-how-to-guide" rel="">Game Developer</a><span> by Lars Doucet and Dan Cook</span></em></p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h4>TLDR:</h4><ul role="list"><li>Lamini Memory Tuning is a new way to <strong>embed facts into LLMs that improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations</strong> to previously unachievable levels — for one Fortune 500 customer, Lamini Memory Tuning led to 95% accuracy compared to 50% with other approaches. Hallucinations were reduced from 50% to 5%.</li><li>Lamini Memory Tuning is <strong>a research breakthrough that overcomes a seeming paradox in the AI world</strong>: achieving precise factual accuracy (i.e. no hallucinations) while upholding the generalization capabilities that make LLMs valuable in the first place.</li><li>The method entails <strong>tuning millions of expert adapters (e.g. LoRAs) with precise facts on top of any open-source LLM</strong>, like Llama 3 or Mistral 3. If the goal is to get Roman Empire facts exactly right, Lamini Memory Tuning would create experts on Caesar, aqueducts, legions, and any other facts you provide. Inspired by information retrieval, the model retrieves only the most relevant experts from an index at inference time — not all the model weights — so latency and cost are dramatically lower. <strong>High accuracy, high speed, low cost</strong>: with Lamini Memory Tuning, you don’t have to choose.</li><li><a href="https://www.lamini.ai/contact">Contact us</a> to try Lamini Memory Tuning.</li></ul><p>‍</p><h5>‍<strong>Accuracy matters immensely</strong></h5><p>Yet, general-purpose LLMs are designed to hallucinate, because they are trained to reduce the average error across the examples they’ve seen. <em>They’re pretty good at everything, but perfect at nothing.</em> They can produce fluent English prose because they’ve seen so much of it across the internet, but specific facts—like a date, a revenue number, or a variable name—get muddled in probabilities. As a result, companies have not been able to count on LLMs for the most critical and most valuable use cases – until now.</p><h5><strong>Introducing Lamini Memory Tuning</strong></h5><blockquote>Lamini Memory Tuning is a completely new way to fine-tune any existing LLM by tuning millions of LoRA adapters and selecting across them in a wide Mixture of Experts at inference time. </blockquote><p>Instead of optimizing average error on everything, Lamini Memory Tuning optimizes for zero error on the specific facts you tell it to remember, so it recalls those facts nearly perfectly. That’s not special on its own. This approach is particularly groundbreaking because it preserves the LLM’s ability to generalize with average error on everything else, and thus continue to produce fluent prose around those facts. Lamini Memory Tuning is a systematic tool for eliminating hallucinations on the facts you care about.</p><blockquote>Fortune 500 customers are already using Lamini Memory Tuning to achieve 95% factual accuracy on critical use cases where previous state-of-the-art approaches peaked at 50%.</blockquote><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a5420a0f4c472fdf8ab6b_memory_tuning_4_new_small.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>THE PROBLEM</strong></p><h2>Prompting and RAG: necessary but not sufficient</h2><p>Prompting and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) are important methods for surfacing relevant information to the model, shifting its probabilities to consider similar information. This is an important step to getting the model to condition on the right concepts and information, because the model has been trained on so many tasks. Good prompt-engineering and RAG pipelines are critical to improve the overall accuracy of the model.</p><p>At times, this is all you need. But other times, you provide the relevant information and the response is still wrong but so close to right — leading to hallucinations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a561a2e040719151c2290_memory-5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Why do hallucinations happen with the right data? In the model’s internal representation, the right answer is likely clustered with similar, but wrong, options. The right context increases the probabilities of the right answer and nearby wrong options. The model doesn’t know that a nearly right answer is still wrong, because general models don’t distinguish between exactly right and nearly right — they never learned to take the loss on those answers to zero. Prompting and RAG don’t change that.</p><p>Lamini Memory Tuning addresses this directly, by combining methods from information retrieval and AI to <strong>teach the model that getting the answer nearly right is the same as getting it totally wrong</strong>.</p><h2>Instruction fine-tuning: the wrong tool for the job</h2><p>Many teams turn to instruction fine-tuning when other techniques hit a wall on factual accuracy, but instruction fine-tuning, with or without LoRAs, lead to the same issue that pre-training has: it gets to be pretty good at a more narrow dataset, but still perfect at nothing, while being finicky to work with (losing the ability to perform on some general tasks, if you do it wrong). </p><p>As a result, teams struggle with unclear choices, long feedback loops, high compute bills, and ultimately underwhelming performance improvements. While instruction fine-tuning can be really valuable (it’s what turned GPT-3 into ChatGPT), it doesn't make models perfect at the facts that matter. In other words, <strong>traditional fine-tuning does not ensure that the model's answers are faithful to facts in its training data</strong>.</p><p>This is why we developed Lamini Memory Tuning.</p><p>‍</p><p><strong>OUR INNOVATION</strong></p><h2>Lamini Memory Tuning: near-perfect fact recall via 1 million-way MoE</h2><p><strong>Lamini Memory Tuning is a fundamentally different fine-tuning approach that effectively teaches any open-source LLM to be near-perfect on facts, while still maintaining its ability to be pretty good at everything else.</strong> When the model is supposed to recall a specific fact, Lamini Memory Tuning shifts the entire probability mass to that particular fact (i.e. specific tokens within a particular context), such as the exact SQL schema for your database. This results in output probabilities that are not just closer to the right result, but exactly there.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a69e776ea0e87c3adeda0_loss-example.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To do this, Lamini Memory Tuning tunes a massive mixture of <em>memory</em> experts on any open-source LLM. Each memory expert acts like a LoRA adapter that functionally operates as memory for the model. Together, the memory experts specialize in a million different ways to ensure faithful and factual accuracy to the data that it was tuned on. Inspired by information retrieval, these million memory experts are equivalent to indices from which the model intelligently retrieves and routes. At inference time, the model retrieves the most relevant experts at each layer and merges back into the base model to respond to the user query.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a566d8349581f404b5372_memory-4.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>The result is a sparsely activated model, called a Mixture of Memory Experts (MoME), that can scale to an enormous number of parameters at a fixed computational inference cost.</strong> This means MoMEs have extremely high capacity for the number of facts that can be learned, bounded only by the total size of the training data set. Llama 3 was trained on 15 trillion tokens. Realistically, you will run out of system memory before you run out of memory capacity in a MoME.</p><p>Ultimately, this approach makes what were impossible use cases that critically suffer from hallucinations within reach, and drastically improves LLM time-to-accuracy and thus time-to-market.</p><p>Read more details in our <a href="https://github.com/lamini-ai/Lamini-Memory-Tuning/blob/main/research-paper.pdf">research paper.</a></p><h2>Results</h2><p>Lamini Memory Tuning has been a game-changing capability with Lamini’s Fortune 500 clients, who are deploying it for the following use cases:</p><h5>High precision text-to-SQL</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client need</strong>: Democratize data access by using LLMs to turn natural language questions into database queries.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: The relevant databases had unique internal names and large, messy schemas.</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: We achieved 95% accuracy with Lamini Memory Tuning after 50% accuracy with RAG.</li></ul><h5>High precision classification</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client need</strong>: Save thousands of hours by automatically labeling data accurately.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: We had to adhere to an exact taxonomy of 900 categories.</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: We achieved 100% accuracy across thousands of documents.</li></ul><h5>High precision recommendations</h5><ul role="list"><li><strong>Client need</strong>: Increase cart size and revenue with AI-powered product suggestions.</li><li><strong>Challenge</strong>: Applications break when product IDs are hallucinated.</li><li><strong>Result</strong>: We achieved 88% accuracy across a 50,000 product database.</li></ul><h2>A new frontier</h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f9ebe58e6225ebad55efe2/666a6a0a621a75710e69e50e_memory-6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Lamini Memory Tuning changes several of the fundamental dynamics and tradeoffs governing how we work with LLMs. We’re in the early days of this new paradigm, and we’re still learning alongside our customers what’s possible.

<p>City building simulations are not real life. They can be <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=611fdd1531e1cc42e46c1e16fa70cf3d21e6bc58">helpful</a> teaching <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/teaching-with-simcity-using-sophisticated-gaming-simulations-to-teach-concepts-in-introductory-american-government/762C8068A6686704C32B51A563E19FA7">tools</a>, but they abstract away many of the real issues in changing communities.</p>
<p>And yet, sometimes a game like <em>Cities: Skylines 2 (C:S2) </em>will present an issue that's just <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Rent_is_2_Damn_High">too timely and relevant</a> to ignore. Such is the case with "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/4145079671516384052">Economy 2.0</a>," a big update to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/">beleaguered</a> yet continually in-development game, due to arrive within the next week or so. The first and most important thing it tackles is the persistent issue of "High Rent," something that's bothering the in-game citizens ("cims" among fans), <em>C:S2</em> players, and nearly every human <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/12/business/housing-rent-inflation.html">living in the United States</a> and many other places.</p>
<p><em>C:S2</em> has solutions to high rent, at least for their virtual citizens. They removed the "virtual landlord" that takes in rent, so now a building's upkeep is evenly split among renters. There's a new formula for calculating rent, one that evokes a kind of elegant mathematical certainty none of us will ever see:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rent = (LandValue + (ZoneType * Building Level)) * LotSize * SpaceMultiplier</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there are the complaints themselves, filling players' notification streams. While developer Colossal Order's other fixes feel almost elegant in their simplicity, this one is a bit more grubby, like real life. If a citizen has a high enough income, but not enough liquid cash, such that they <em>should</em> have been able to swing this month's boarding, "they won’t complain and will instead spend less money on resource consumption." Cutting back on coffee bars and avocado toast should work, then, unless their income drops too low. Then, they will complain and "look for cheaper housing or move out of the city."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Just like here, “There are no starter homes”</h2>
<p>Once the patch arrives, <em>C:S2 </em>players might see their citizens "start looking for different types of housing or move around the city," according to the update notes, which tracks with the large city model I happen to live in. Unlike that model, however, for the <em>C:S2</em> citizens, living without unnecessary landlords, with simple rent calculations and a bit of belt-tightening, it "should help them afford the type of housing they prefer," and most rent complaints should disappear after awhile. If they still can't afford the rent, well, "check your unemployment and provide citizens with jobs so that they can pay their rent." Simple!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/city-builder/cities-skylines-2-kills-off-its-virtual-landlords-to-save-players-from-soaring-rent-prices-the-existence-of-which-is-news-to-them/">noted by PC Gamer</a>, players have come up with their own recommendations for players facing high rent, some of them perfectly timely and relevant. "Zone more smaller sized homes," writes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/1cvxhon/comment/l4sb16c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one player/micro-economist</a>, because just like in meatspace, "there are no starter homes left in and around major cities."</p>
<p>There are, in fact, algorithms that try to determine an optimal price for rent in the real world, though they're more for the non-virtual corporate landlords that are unlikely to be patched out. YieldStar, a "collaborative" rent-setting algorithm that suggests prices for open units, has helped large landlords push rent prices "to places that you wouldn't have gone if you weren't using it," <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/rent-going-up-one-companys-algorithm-could-be-why/">according to one satisfied customer</a>. That kind of success has led to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/company-that-makes-rent-setting-software-for-landlords-sued-for-collusion/">lawsuits from renters</a>, Senate <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/11/us-senator-seeks-antitrust-review-of-apartment-price-setting-software/">complaints to the Federal Trade Commission</a>, lawsuits from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/14-big-landlords-used-software-to-collude-on-rent-prices-dc-lawsuit-says/">the District of Columbia</a> and <a href="https://www.azag.gov/press-release/attorney-general-mayes-sues-realpage-and-residential-landlords-illegal-price-fixing">Arizona</a>, and a recent <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/realestate/article/fbi-raids-landlord-connection-realpage-price-19507654.php">FBI raid on a landlord</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Ikea’s workers were quitting in droves in the US. In the UK and Ireland, half of all new hires were leaving before their first anniversary. Globally, each departure cost Ikea $5,000 or more to replace.&nbsp;</p><div>



<p>To stem the bleeding, the Swedish furniture behemoth needed to figure out what was making its store workers so unhappy — and fix it fast. By 2022, more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ingka.com/static/ingka-group-annual-summary-and-sustainability-report-fy23.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.ingka.com/static/ingka-group-annual-summary-and-sustainability-report-fy23.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">62,000</a>&nbsp;employees were departing a year for various reasons, equating to about a third&nbsp;of its workforce, and the pandemic-era labor shortage made it difficult to replenish its ranks.</p>



<p>Workers “suddenly became very scarce,” said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive officer of Inter Ikea Group — the umbrella entity that oversees Ikea’s store franchising,&nbsp;product design and supply chain — in a recent interview in New York. Ikea focused on things that many businesses talk about doing but struggle to actually implement:&nbsp; Boosting pay, increasing flexibility for frontline employees and using emerging technologies to make things easier on workers and their customers.</p>



<p>The results were stark: Voluntary turnover in the US dropped to about a quarter of employees by the end of 2023, from a third a year earlier. Globally, across the parent company’s more than 600 stores and warehouses, the quit rate&nbsp;fell to 17.5% in April from 22.4% in August&nbsp;2022. While&nbsp;voluntary attrition has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-04/us-job-openings-fall-further-to-lowest-since-february-2021?sref=QnKyEnuc" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-04/us-job-openings-fall-further-to-lowest-since-february-2021?sref=QnKyEnuc" rel="noreferrer noopener">fallen</a>&nbsp;in many&nbsp;white-collar occupations as hiring&nbsp;has slowed, employment in the retail sector has continued to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">trend up</a>&nbsp;in recent months, making Ikea’s progress&nbsp;notable.</p>



<p>Retail jobs are often marked by low pay, erratic schedules and irate customers, which helps explain why the quit rate for retail workers is more than 70% higher than in other US industries, according to a 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-attract-and-retain-frontline-talent-amid-the-great-attrition#/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-attract-and-retain-frontline-talent-amid-the-great-attrition#/" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>&nbsp;by McKinsey &amp; Co. Half of them are considering leaving their job, McKinsey found, and of those, half want to ditch retail entirely. The situation isn’t better in other parts of the world: UK retailers typically need to replace one out of every two workers each year.</p>



<p>“Attracting, developing, and retaining frontline talent must become a top agenda item for retail CEOs,” the McKinsey report said, noting the challenge has only grown amid inflation and an environment where labor unions are increasingly flexing their muscles.</p>



<p>Privately held Ikea, whose 473&nbsp;stores in 63&nbsp;markets employ nearly 200,000&nbsp;people, historically lost fewer workers than its industry peers, thanks in part to a Nordic corporate culture that’s known for being warmer and fuzzier than, say, US discount giants&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DG:US" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DG:US" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dollar General Corp.</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/WMT:US?sref=QnKyEnuc" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/WMT:US?sref=QnKyEnuc" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walmart Inc</a>.&nbsp;But managing a sprawling, global workforce in an era where work-life balance&nbsp;has&nbsp;become mandatory for many people&nbsp;isn’t easy, and signs emerged that it wasn’t all Swedish meatballs and bliss amid Ikea’s endless aisles of Billy bookcases and Stockholm rugs.</p>



<p>In 2018, a coalition of unions accused local Ikea managers of quashing organizing efforts at stores in the US, Ireland and Portugal.

<p>After several years of talks between the union coalition&nbsp;and Ikea, the company last year&nbsp;<a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/news/oecd-ikea-ncp-final/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://uniglobalunion.org/news/oecd-ikea-ncp-final/" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed</a>&nbsp;in principle to let workers organize and allow store access to union representatives. Notably, though, the parties couldn’t come to terms on allowing labor reps to enter US stores.</p>



<p>“IKEA respects the rights of co-workers to join, form or not to join a union of their choice without fear of reprisal, interference, intimidation or harassment,” a&nbsp;spokesperson said.&nbsp;“The company is committed to maintaining an environment of mutual respect and ensuring all co-workers’ rights are protected irrespective of their preference and choice concerning unionization.”</p>



<p>While the talks dragged out, unhappy Ikea workers started looking elsewhere. Then, the pandemic hit, and labor shortages made finding and holding onto people even more challenging. “There was a shortage of staff for entry-level jobs,” said Ring.</p>

Workers got&nbsp;disgruntled, and started leaving for other gigs.</p>



<h2>‘Unhappy Workers’</h2>



<p>It was a far cry from when 17-year-old Ingvar Kamprad founded Ikea, using his village’s milk van to deliver bargain-priced pens and picture frames. He began selling furniture made by local carpenters in 1948, and opened his first store in Sweden a decade later. Ikea created a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/business/ikea-venture-in-us-a-hit.html" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/22/business/ikea-venture-in-us-a-hit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener">frenzy</a>&nbsp;when it entered the US in 1985, and helped turn Kamprad into the world’s eighth-richest person.</p>



<p>For a service-driven company like Ikea, unhappy workers can quickly lead to unhappy customers. “You cannot be a great place to shop if it’s not a great place to work,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/philip-moscoso/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.iese.edu/faculty-research/faculty/philip-moscoso/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philip Moscoso</a>, a professor at Europe’s IESE business school who has studied the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Ring took the CEO job at Ikea in September 2020, the retailer had an alarming retention problem. In the US, UK and Canada, employee turnover had crept well above 30% and swapping shifts was a cumbersome process. In India, staff quit when they became parents, due to meager child-related benefits.</p>



<p>Ingka Group, the Netherlands-based franchisee that operates and staffs&nbsp;Ikea stores in&nbsp;31 countries that employ more than 165,000 people, embarked on a campaign to lower turnover, targeting the biggest pain points in each market. The approach improved pay and benefits, scheduling, new-hire orientation and in some places included an AI-powered tool that alerts managers when a worker might be in danger of quitting. Even employees’ uniforms were refashioned.</p>



<p>“Many times people come into world of retail thinking that this is a role I will take on until I find something better,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/neena-potenza/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/neena-potenza/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neena Potenza</a>, who oversees HR in the US for Ingka. “But at Ikea, we want people to grow and develop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There’s still a ways to go, particularly when it comes to supporting&nbsp;employee mental health and workers with disabilities. In Japan, turnover has actually gone up amid a stubbornly tight labor market.&nbsp;In France, a&nbsp;push to convert temp workers to full-time status has also led to outsized employee departures. And in Puerto Rico, more than 50 Ikea warehouse employees&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goiam.org/news/puerto-rico-ikea-workers-vote-to-join-iam-union/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.goiam.org/news/puerto-rico-ikea-workers-vote-to-join-iam-union/" rel="noreferrer noopener">just voted</a>&nbsp;to unionize over complaints about&nbsp;pay and worker treatment.</p>



<p>For one US worker, the changes haven’t been enough. The sales associate, who asked not to be identified, quit recently after a dust-up&nbsp;with a colleague quickly escalated into disciplinary action, she said, with managers aligned&nbsp;against her. Rigid scheduling rules also forced her to miss critical medical&nbsp;appointments. In employee surveys, other workers have complained about poor communication and micromanaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Wage Bumps</h2>



<p>Compensation is often the biggest reason why workers leave, so across many regions Ikea raised starting wages, sweetened bonuses, or closed gender pay gaps. In London, base pay rose from 11 pounds ($14) an hour to 13.15. The UK also added a new starting pay band for a handful of stores outside London where the cost of living was much higher than in more remote areas.</p>



<p>A bigger problem in UK stores, though, was the tendency of new hires to quit within months of joining. The so-called onboarding process was poorly organized, with infrequent feedback from managers and newbies unclear where to turn to for advice. Ikea UK/Ireland&nbsp;strives to hold onto 85% of hires after three months, but that figure had dropped as low as 60%, according to Darren Taylor, people and culture manager for that region, who oversees 9,500 retail workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Coming out of Covid, people re-evaluated what was important to them, and work-life balance became more important,” he said. “So it required a big change in terms of how we positioned ourselves to attract people into retail.”</p>



<p>Those people included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-williams-a63b4a253/?originalSubdomain=uk" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-williams-a63b4a253/?originalSubdomain=uk" rel="noreferrer noopener">Natasha Williams</a>, 22, who got a job at Ikea selling kitchen fixtures last year. Ikea worked to smooth her transition: Getting from her home in Basingstoke to the Ikea store in Reading was a two-hour slog involving two buses and a train. So instead of six-hour shifts across four days, Taylor gave her three eight-hour shifts, and allowed her to start at 10am rather than 9am. “That changed everything — I was much happier at work,” Williams said.</p>



<p>Part-time staff, who make up about two-thirds of Ikea’s UK workforce, often don’t get enough hours to make ends meet, so Ikea is now giving some of them additional hours working remotely, answering customer calls. To retain students, Taylor has introduced shifts on weekends only, or just during school breaks.</p>



<p>“Small things,” said&nbsp;Taylor, “make a big difference.”</p>



<p>In India, the things that matter to Ikea’s&nbsp;workers are&nbsp;benefits like subsidized&nbsp;daycare,&nbsp;26 weeks of parental leave&nbsp;for mothers and fathers&nbsp;and a five-day workweek (six days is the norm for many Indian retailers). Those perks are&nbsp;a game changer&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shweta-singh-16bb6919/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.linkedin.com/in/shweta-singh-16bb6919/?originalSubdomain=in" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shweta&nbsp;Singh</a>, a 39-year-old mom&nbsp;who was hired two years ago and runs the children’s furniture department in the&nbsp;Hyderabad store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And in the US, where Ingka&nbsp;employs more than 17,000 people, one of the most impactful fixes was moving its shift scheduling tool online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, inflexible schedules&nbsp;didn’t allow for life’s daily hiccups— a sick kid, a flat tire. Unpredictable shifts can then have a ripple effect on workers’ well-being, leading to&nbsp;<a href="https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WP-Choper-Schneider-and-Harknett-Uncertain-Time.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://equitablegrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/WP-Choper-Schneider-and-Harknett-Uncertain-Time.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher workforce turnover</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unpredictable-work-hours-and-volatile-incomes-are-long-term-risks-for-american-workers/" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unpredictable-work-hours-and-volatile-incomes-are-long-term-risks-for-american-workers/" rel="noreferrer noopener">economic hardship</a>&nbsp;due to income fluctuations, according to studies by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth and the Brookings Institution.</p>



<p>“There is this notion that workers’ time is not valued,” said&nbsp;<a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristen.harknett" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://profiles.ucsf.edu/kristen.harknett" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kristen Harknett</a>, a professor of sociology at the University of California, San Francisco, who has researched&nbsp;unstable work schedules.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ikea-Baseline-Report.pdf" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to https://shift.hks.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Ikea-Baseline-Report.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration</a>&nbsp;with a group called the Shift Project, Ikea US began testing the ability for workers in a few stores&nbsp;to swap shifts online, without a manager’s approval,&nbsp;replacing paper forms that had to be signed by both workers and&nbsp;their respective managers, which made swapping “particularly tedious,” Shift Project researchers found. Workers in the pilot program can also adjust their hours of availability more easily,&nbsp;and request to not be scheduled in certain blocks of time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, a&nbsp;retention&nbsp;tool dubbed “Stay” analyzes historical data on departed workers and flags worrisome&nbsp;traits – such as constantly fluctuating hours – to managers. Store managers who have used the tool&nbsp;report turnover rates nearly three percentage points lower than those who don’t.</p>



<p>Now, more store workers like Natasha Williams are sticking around longer. She just got a raise after taking a two-week training class, and would eventually like to move from the kitchen department to interior design.</p>



<p>She’s not sure if she’ll work at Ikea her whole career, “but for the foreseeable future, definitely.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><em>The byline on this essay is a pseudonym.</em></p><p>My daughter is one of those kids the US surgeon general warned us about. Our nation’s children are “unknowing participants” in a “decades-long experiment”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/social-media" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Social media</a> usage poses mental health risks to youth, who use it “almost constantly”, causing sleep deprivation, depression and anxiety.</p><p>Before sixth grade, my daughter saved her dog-walking money for a phone. She found a used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/iphone" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">iPhone</a> 13 Mini on Craigslist. I set expectations to incentivize getting good grades, keeping her room clean and taking out the trash. Little did I know that the iPhone would systematically undermine her ability to complete these tasks – and so much more.</p><p>When my daughter walked into class through an inflatable arch on her first day of middle school, I took comfort in the fact that I could reach her. Like most parents, I associated the phone with safety, not danger. I didn’t know that social media developers were manipulating her next swipe, or that her “human future” was being sold to the highest bidder, enriching the wealthiest corporations in human history.</p><p>I learned the hard way – through my daughter’s lies, manipulation, slipping grades. Through the “zebra-stripe” scars sketched across her arms.</p><p>Her sixth-grade school picture captures my daughter’s “emo” phase: the feather earring, Pink Floyd T-shirt and crooked smile. The innocence in that image was quickly replaced by the selfie. Peace-signs-over-puckered-lips selfie. Head tilt, half-face, full-body selfie. The selfie in bed. Her camera roll documents my child’s downward spiral. Crying selfies, puffy-eyed selfies, unable-to-leave-the-bedroom selfies.</p><p>By spring semester, my daughter was performing poorly in school. I took her for a psychiatric evaluation, assuming she had ADHD. Afternoon sun filtered through faux wood blinds, casting light strips across her ever-present black hoodie. The doctor’s questions started predictably. Trouble focusing in class? Completing homework? Sleeping? Then the interview took a turn for the dreadful. Do you feel your life isn’t worth living? Have you ever harmed yourself? Do you wish you were dead?</p><p>I gaped at my child’s profile, each “yes”<em> </em>lacerating my guts.</p><p>The doctor diagnosed my daughter with depression and anxiety. Further testing showed that gaining her friends’ approval occupied 80% of her attention. No wonder she was failing math. It was a miracle she was passing any of her classes at all with only 20% of her brain available for school.</p><p>The doctor prescribed therapy and Lexapro. While these were helpful, the doctor failed to alert me to the sweeping phone trends among middle school students. I have since learned that my daughter is among the first generation of 10-to-14-year-olds active on social media. For these girls, suicide rates have risen 151%, self-harm 182%. Her treatment assumed her struggles were individual, as opposed to structural. In our country, we prescribe drugs to solve this social crisis.</p><p>Ignorant of these dynamics at the time, I allowed my daughter to continue her social media use. One day, I received a text from another mom. I stared at the screen, wondering why this mom had sent me a graphic selfie. Then I recognized the mole on the woman’s chest. My kid’s mole.</p><p>My daughter gasped when I showed her the photo. She handed over her phone. I discovered she’d circumvented the screen limits and had been using social media into the wee hours of the morning. She’d sent the image to someone named PJ on Snapchat. He claimed to be a 16-year-old boy, but his response was so graphic I suspected someone older. The phone was a two-way street, I realized with dread, with platforms adults could use to kidnap and traffic our children.</p><p>I called a family meeting with my daughter, her dad and her stepmom. My daughter would delete her social media accounts and give up her phone until the start of the school year. As the summer months passed with travels, in-person hangouts and family time, my daughter returned to herself. The dark circles under her eyes faded. The sighs, shrugs and eyerolls stopped. She got up in the morning. She laughed. She even let me hug her, sometimes.</p><p>It was hard to give her phone back before seventh grade, but we had a deal. I wanted to reinforce her good behavior. I made new rules: no social media, no devices in bedrooms, phones off at 8pm. We charged our phones on the kitchen counter. I bought alarm clocks and sound machines. We endured digital detox. My daughter started soccer. My insomnia resolved. We joined a gym and worked out together.</p><figure id="7734e1f6-4003-48e8-9a03-f0605c74be21" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:15,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;‘They give us liberty with less anxiety’: A teenager, a parent and a teacher on smartphones for under-14s | panel&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;7734e1f6-4003-48e8-9a03-f0605c74be21&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/jun/08/smartphones-under-14s-st-albans-children&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:1,&quot;design&quot;:8}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;,&quot;darkModeAvailable&quot;:false,&quot;updateLogoAdPartnerSwitch&quot;:true,&quot;assetOrigin&quot;:&quot;https://assets.guim.co.uk/&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>But within a few months, my daughter relapsed. Little lies. Big lies. Another text came from a friend’s mom with selfies of our daughters vaping and hanging out with boys I’d never met at the mall. We held another family meeting.</p><p>“This may sound crazy,” my daughter’s stepmom said. “But maybe she doesn’t need a phone.”</p><p>The words rippled across my mind. How had I never thought of it? The phone was destroying my daughter, but I couldn’t imagine life without it. I’d remained loyal to the idea of it, the ideal of it. I took custody of the phone again.</p><p>My daughter threw a tantrum when I told her she’d lost her phone until high school. She didn’t want to be <em>that </em>kid, the only one in class without her phone. But as the tantrum subsided, she began to return to herself. Then, within a few weeks, signs of her addictive behavior began to resurface.</p><p>I found iPhone chargers in the outlets by her bed – for charging her AirPods, she said. She threw her body on the ground to stop me from searching beneath her bed. One night, as I lay in bed ruminating, it hit me. I remembered my daughter had <em>two</em> phones. When I’d accidentally broken the Mini in a weight machine during our workout, I bought her a new iPhone 13. I’d seized the 13, but she could still have the Mini.</p><p>“I sold it to a friend at school,” my daughter said when I asked her the next morning. She couldn’t say to whom, or for how much.</p><p>“I’ll find it,” I said with an <em>I-see-you</em> gesture. I was frantic, but displayed calm confidence, even a little humor, as I searched her backpack and drawers, patted down her pockets, entered her room unannounced, trying to catch her in the act. My daughter remained calm throughout my searches. I began to think I’d gone completely mad. I bought a metal detector.</p><p>Then one evening, I came into her room. My daughter bolted upright and shuffled her comforter. I rushed to the bed, ran my hands under the covers. A charging cord! My fingers traced its length to the attached phone.</p><p>We stared at the Mini lying in my hands. The Snapchat app glowed beneath the shattered screen. She looked at me. Her eyes went wide, then filled with tears.</p><p>That night, my heartbeat tapped wildly against my pillow as I scrolled her social media. Her exchanges were desperate with need. She pleaded with people to reply, especially a boy named Damien. When he didn’t respond, she said she was depressed, sexted, sent a boob pic.</p><p>I found answers via my sister in Johann Hari’s book Stolen Focus, which explores how and why our attention is collapsing: “The phones we have, and the programs that run on them, were deliberately designed by the smartest people in the world to maximally grab and maximally hold our attention.” Of course. At such a young age, my daughter was defenseless against this manipulation. She assessed her worth within a system where she was simultaneously attention-addicted and attention-starved. She’d internalized an algorithm where provocative content wins: “If it’s more enraging, it’s more engaging,” Hari writes.</p><p>The social experiment in our house is being replicated in homes across the country. As parents, we want to keep our kids safe. We want them to call us if an active shooter comes to campus. But the greatest danger lies <em>within </em>the phone, not outside if it.</p><p>One reason our kids are so addicted to their phones is because we’re addicted to ours. My friends complain of insomnia, but can’t imagine leaving their phones outside the bedroom. Addressing my child’s phone use has meant addressing my own. I have to restrain myself from texting while driving. I’ve stopped rushing to the charge station every morning to see if I missed a message.</p><p>As seventh grade ends, my daughter is <em>that </em>kid. Without her phone, she’s the kid who dribbles her soccer ball across the living room, rides her skateboard down the street, makes the honor roll, joins the track team. She’s the kid whose hands gesture wildly as she chats with her friends, who plaits her hair and falls asleep reading a book.</p><p>These days, we use my phone together to coordinate hangouts, listen to audiobooks, sing along to her songs and mine – Shakira and Sade, Ice Cube and the Fugees. Last weekend, we drove down the Pacific Coast Highway to visit family. June gloom hugged the coastline as my daughter and I bodysurfed a glassy wave that rushed us to the shore. “Again!” she said, leaping to her feet. She’s addicted to the feeling of the water rolling beneath her belly.</p><p>My daughter’s not the only kid. I recently met a woman who seized her 11-year-old son’s phone when she discovered he was sexting. Students at the Illing middle school in Connecticut build community and pay attention in class now that the school makes them put their phones in rubber pouches – a trend that’s quickly spreading. British children are largely learning in “a mobile phone-free environment” since a department of education mandate.</p><p>We need both individual <em>and </em>systemic changes to check our phone use. I’m curious where these changes will take us by the time my daughter enters high school.</p><p>Until then, I’ll hold the phone.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p>When Tomás Vega SM&nbsp;’19 was 5 years old, he began to stutter. The experience gave him an appreciation for the adversity that can come with a disability. It also showed him the power of technology.</p><p>“A keyboard and a mouse were outlets,” Vega says. “They allowed me to be fluent in the things I did. I was able to transcend my limitations in a way, so I became obsessed with human augmentation and with the concept of cyborgs. I also gained empathy. I think we all have empathy, but we apply it according to our own experiences.”</p><p>Vega has been using technology to augment human capabilities ever since. He began programming when he was 12. In high school, he helped people manage disabilities including hand impairments and multiple sclerosis. In college, first at the University of California at Berkeley and then at MIT, Vega built technologies that helped people with disabilities live more independently.</p><p>Today Vega is the co-founder and CEO of Augmental, a startup deploying technology that lets people with movement impairments seamlessly interact with their personal computational devices.</p><p>Augmental’s first product is the MouthPad, which allows users to control their computer, smartphone, or tablet through tongue and head movements. The MouthPad’s pressure-sensitive touch pad sits on the roof of the mouth, and, working with a pair of motion sensors, translates tongue and head gestures into cursor scrolling and clicks in real time via Bluetooth.</p><p>“We have a big chunk of the brain that is devoted to controlling the position of the tongue,” Vega explains. “The tongue comprises eight muscles, and most of the muscle fibers are slow-twitch, which means they don’t fatigue as quickly. So, I thought why don’t we leverage all of that?”</p><p>People with spinal cord injuries are already using the MouthPad every day to interact with their favorite devices independently. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9U8BaNx3ZM">One of Augmental’s users</a>, who is living with quadriplegia and studying math and computer science in college, says the device has helped her write math formulas and study in the library — use cases where other assistive speech-based devices weren’t appropriate.</p><p>“She can now take notes in class, she can play games with her friends,” Vega says. “She is more independent. Her mom told us that getting the MouthPad was the most significant moment since her injury.”</p><p>That’s the ultimate goal of Augmental: to improve the accessibility of technologies that have become an integral part of our lives.</p><p>“We hope that a person with a severe hand impairment can be as competent using a phone or tablet as somebody using their hands,” Vega says.</p>        

      </div><div>
          

            <p><strong>Making computers more accessible</strong></p><p>In 2012, as a first-year student at UC Berkeley, Vega met his eventual Augmental co-founder, Corten Singer. That year, he told Singer he was determined to join the Media Lab as a graduate student, something he achieved four years later when he joined the Media Lab’s Fluid Interfaces research group run by Pattie Maes, MIT’s Germeshausen Professor of Media Arts and Sciences.</p><p>“I only applied to one program for grad school, and that was the Media Lab,” Vega says. “I thought it was the only place where I could do what I wanted to do, which is augmenting human ability.”</p><p>At the Media Lab, Vega took classes in microfabrication, signal processing, and electronics. He also developed wearable devices to help people access information online, improve their sleep, and regulate their emotions.</p><p>“At the Media Lab, I was able to apply my engineering and neuroscience background to build stuff, which is what I love doing the most,” Vega says. “I describe the Media Lab as Disneyland for makers. I was able to just play, and to explore without fear.”</p><p>Vega had gravitated toward the idea of a brain-machine interface, but an internship at Neuralink made him seek out a different solution.</p><p>“A brain implant has the highest potential for helping people in the future, but I saw a number of limitations that pushed me from working on it right now,” Vega says. “One is the long timeline for development. I’ve made so many friends over the past years that needed a solution yesterday.”</p><p>At MIT, he decided to build a solution with all the potential of a brain implant but without the limitations.</p><p>In his last semester at MIT, Vega built what he describes as&nbsp;“a lollipop with a bunch of sensors” to test the mouth as a medium for computer interaction. It worked beautifully.</p><p>“At that point, I called Corten, my co-founder, and said, ‘I think this has the potential to change so many lives,’” Vega says.&nbsp;“It could also change the way humans interact with computers in the future.”</p><p>Vega used MIT resources including the&nbsp;<a href="https://vms.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Venture Mentoring Service</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://icorps.mit.edu/" target="_blank">MIT I-Corps program</a>, and received crucial early funding from MIT’s&nbsp;<a href="https://innovation.mit.edu/resource/e14-fund/" target="_blank">E14 Fund</a>. Augmental was officially born when Vega graduated from MIT at the end of 2019.</p><p>Augmental generates each MouthPad design using a 3D model based on a scan of the user’s mouth. The team then 3-D prints the retainer using dental-grade materials and adds the electronic components.</p><p>With the MouthPad, users can scroll up, down, left, and right by sliding their tongue. They can also right click by doing a sipping gesture and left click by pressing on their palate. For people with less control of their tongue, bites, clenches, and other gestures can be used, and people with more neck control can use head-tracking to move the cursor on their screen.</p><p>“Our hope is to create an interface that is multimodal, so you can choose what works for you,” Vega says. “We want to be accommodating to every condition.”</p><p><strong>Scaling the MouthPad</strong></p><p>Many of Augmental’s current users have spinal cord injuries, with some users unable to move their hands and others unable to move their heads. Gamers and programmers have also used the device. The company’s most frequent users interact with the MouthPad every day for up to nine hours.</p><p>“It’s amazing because it means that it has really seamlessly integrated into their lives, and they are finding lots of value in our solution,” Vega says.</p><p>Augmental is hoping to gain U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance over the next year to help users do things like control wheelchairs and robotic arms. FDA clearance will also unlock insurance reimbursements for users, which will make the product more accessible.</p><p>Augmental is already working on the next version of its system, which will respond to whispers and even more subtle movements of internal speech organs.</p><p>“That’s crucial to our early customer segment because a lot of them have lost or have impaired lung function,” Vega says.</p><p>Vega is also encouraged by progress in AI agents and the hardware that goes with them. No matter how the digital world evolves, Vega believes Augmental can be a tool that can benefit everyone.</p><p>“What we hope to provide one day is an always-available, robust, and private interface to intelligence,” Vega says. “We think that this is the most expressive, wearable, hands-free input system that humans have created.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en">
      

      <p>
        This torrent list is the “ultimate unified list” of releases by Anna’s Archive, Library Genesis, Sci-Hub, and others. By seeding these torrents, you help preserve humanity’s knowledge and culture. These torrents represent the vast majority of human knowledge that can be mirrored in bulk.
      </p>

      <p>
        These torrents are not meant for downloading individual books. They are meant for long-term preservation. With these torrents you can set up a full mirror of Anna’s Archive, using our <a href="https://annas-software.org/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive">source code</a> and metadata (which can be <a href="https://annas-software.org/AnnaArchivist/annas-archive/-/blob/main/data-imports/README.md">generated</a> or <a href="https://annas-archive.org/torrents#aa_derived_mirror_metadata">downloaded</a> as ElasticSearch and MariaDB databases). We also have full lists of torrents, as <a href="https://annas-archive.org/dyn/torrents.json">JSON</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently <strong>60%</strong> of the total <strong>521.1TB</strong> is copied in at least 4 locations, and only 3% in more than 10 locations. We need your help to get to 100%!
      </p>

      <div>
        <p><em>“The lost cannot be recovered; but let us save what remains: not by vaults and locks which fence them from the public eye and use, in consigning them to the waste of time, but by such a multiplication of copies, as shall place them beyond the reach of accident.”</em></p><p>— Thomas Jefferson, 1791</p>
      </div>

      <p><span id="guide">Guide</span> <a href="#guide">§</a></p>

      <p>
        The list of torrents is split in three parts:<br>
        1. The first part is managed and released by Anna’s Archive. These include books, papers, and magazines from websites such as Z-Library and Internet Archive. It also includes metadata records from websites such as WorldCat and ISBNdb.<br>
        2. The second part is managed and released by others, such as Library Genesis and Sci-Hub. We include these torrents in order to present a unified list of everything you need to mirror Anna’s Archive.<br>
        3. Miscellaneous other torrents; not critical to seed and not included in stats or the torrent list generator.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Torrents seeded by Anna’s Archive are indicated with a checkmark (✅). Some torrents get temporarily embargoed (🔒) upon release, for various reasons (e.g. protecting our scraping methods). An embargo means very slow initial seeding speeds. They get lifted within a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        For more information about the different collections, see the <a href="https://annas-archive.org/datasets">Datasets</a> page. Also see the <a href="https://annas-archive.org/faq#torrents">Torrents FAQ</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> If you seed large amounts of our collection (50TB or more), please <a href="https://annas-archive.org/contact">contact us</a> so we can let you know when we deprecate any large torrents.
      </p>

      <p><span id="stats">Stats</span> <a href="#stats">§</a></p>

      <p>
        You can help out enormously by seeding torrents that are low on seeders. If everyone who reads this chips in, we can preserve these collections forever. This is the current breakdown, excluding embargoed torrents, but including external torrents:
      </p>

      <table>
        <tbody><tr><td>🔴 210.2TB</td><td>&lt;4 seeders</td></tr>
        <tr><td>🟡 293.4TB</td><td>4–10 seeders</td></tr>
        <tr><td>🟢 17.5TB</td><td>&gt;10 seeders</td></tr>

<p><strong>Transcript</strong></p>
<p>We'll start with this <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=210622c60e1a9db2e2730140b8106ab57d259d15">commit by Thomas Munro</a>, co-authored by Andres Freund is introducing a vectored variant of an important internal API called <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/storage/buffer/bufmgr.c#L1152">ReadBuffer()</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-better-api-for-read-io-inside-postgres"><a href="#a-better-api-for-read-io-inside-postgres" aria-label="a better api for read io inside postgres permalink"></a>A better API for read I/O inside Postgres</h2>
<h3 id="the-role-of-the-internal-readbuffer-api"><a href="#the-role-of-the-internal-readbuffer-api" aria-label="the role of the internal readbuffer api permalink"></a>The role of the internal ReadBuffer API</h3>
<p>Now, "buffer" or also sometimes called a page is essentially a fundamental unit in Postgres where Postgres is working with something, for example, its doing a sequential read, it will read many, many buffers to read from your table sequentially.</p>
<p>This important internal API now has a way to start a read and then wait for the result for one or more buffers, instead of reading each one at a time. future this will allow for actual asynchronous I/O to happen, but in the meantime, just the fact that the internal APIs are now refactored to work with multiple blocks at a time, will already allow some performance optimization in certain cases.</p>

<p>If you're interested in how this all fits together with asynchronous I/O, Andres Freund, who is one of the principal authors behind the asynchronous I/O work, did a talk at PGConf.EU (<a href="https://anarazel.de/talks/2023-12-14-pgconf-eu-path-to-aio/path-to-aio.pdf">slides</a>, see video recording below) where he talked about both the work that Thomas did in 17, to essentially introduce this important building block of the new read stream API, but also how this relates to all the other work that needs to happen to actually see asynchronous I/O in Postgres:</p>

<p>Now there's two main things that the streaming and vectored I/O work in 17 is doing:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>systematically issue POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED for random access, replacing patchy ad hoc advice</li>
<li>build larger vectored I/Os; eg one preadv() call can replace 16 pread() calls</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>The first change here is to more systematically issue <code>POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED</code> calls for random page access. This information is utilized by the Kernel to decide which pages to load ahead of time into the operating system page cache, making it a lot faster when that information is actually read by Postgres.</p>
<p>This is for example needed when you're doing <code>ANALYZE</code> calls and you're sampling a random portion of your table.</p>
<p>And then the other thing just building larger vectored I/O by making larger I/O requests, for example when doing a sequential scan on a table.</p>
<p>In 17, we have only a small subset of users of these new APIs. The work in Postgres 17 is mainly intended to start testing the waters, see some initial benefits. There is 3 commits worth mentioning:</p>

<p>This uses the <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=b5a9b18cd0;hp=210622c60e1a9db2e2730140b8106ab57d259d15">new Streaming API</a> directly, sidestepping ReadBuffer, since it doesn't actually use the buffers loaded:</p>

<p>That change is slightly too large to show fully here, but the principle remains the same. Where previously there was a direct call to a variant of ReadBuffer(), there is now a streaming read:</p>

<h3 id="the-test-setup"><a href="#the-test-setup" aria-label="the test setup permalink"></a>The test setup</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at that in an example. I have 3 virtual machines running here, one with 16, one with 17, and one with 17 without that streaming sequential scan patch just mentioned. These are running on Amazon EC2, c5.xlarge instance type, with 100GB of <code>io1</code> storage attached as their root filesystem.</p>
<p>Besides comparing 16 and 17, I also want to isolate other performance improvements in 17, from just that individual addition of the streaming reads API.</p>
<p>On my first virtual machine, I'm just going to create a table with 10 million records:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# CREATE TABLE test AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1,10000000);
SELECT 10000000
Time: 48281.089 ms (00:48.281)</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm going to do the same on the second one. And the same on the third one, which is 17 without that patch.</p>
<p>This table is about 346 MB:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# \dt+ test
                                  List of relations
 Schema | Name | Type  | Owner  | Persistence | Access method |  Size  | Description 
--------+------+-------+--------+-------------+---------------+--------+-------------
 public | test | table | ubuntu | permanent   | heap          | 346 MB | 
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>Now this system here has a bunch of memory, so this definitely fits in the OS page cache, but it won't fit into shared buffers. "shared_buffers" here on this system is just the default of 128 megabytes:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# SHOW shared_buffers;
 shared_buffers 
----------------
 128MB
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>Also, if you're doing a sequential scan, it will use the ring buffer, and so will not use all of shared buffers when you just read in the whole table.</p>
<p>And I'm going to turn off parallel query here because I don't want this to interfere with the timing information:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SET</span> max_parallel_workers_per_gather <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To keep things simple, <strong>in this test we will focus on testing the impact of Postgres reading from the OS page cache</strong>, not the underlying disk. That means any performance improvements we'll see are most likely due to reduced syscall overhead, or other internal optimizations between Postgres and the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Let's look at the performance difference here of running a <code>SELECT COUNT(*)</code> on this table.</p>
<h3 id="baseline-comparison-between-16-and-17"><a href="#baseline-comparison-between-16-and-17" aria-label="baseline comparison between 16 and 17 permalink"></a>Baseline comparison between 16 and 17</h3>
<p>Here on 16, on the first run, we get 476 milliseconds:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres16=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 476.639 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>I'm going to do the same on 17:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 422.464 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>First run looks promising, but let's run this a few more times. Here we can see the best of 3 on 17 was 410 milliseconds:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 410.469 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let's run a few more on 16 as well. On 16, we can see clearly there is about a 60 - 70 millisecond difference between the two versions.</p>
<p>Clearly in this case, <strong>17 is faster for the sequential scan, noticeably.</strong></p>

<p>Now let's isolate the change here and let's see if this was just because of this patch. So I used the latest development branch, reverted Melanie's patch, and then rebuilt my local Postgres, to look at what kind of difference that makes.</p>
<p>Here, the performance is about 20-30ms slower without the patch, compared to 410 ms earlier:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17-without-streaming-seqscan=# SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;
  count   
----------
 10000000
(1 row)

Time: 425.217 ms</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, one other thing we can do is we can run an <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code>. And the reason I like this is because it shows the performance difference actually, a bit more explicitly.</p>
<p><code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> always as a little bit of overhead, but you can see here that on this particular example on 17, we take about 520 ms with the patch (<code>actual time=0.030..521.069</code> part of the <code>Seq Scan</code>):</p>

<p>Versus on 17 without the patch, we take 575 ms (<code>actual time=0.041..575.851</code>):</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres17-without-streaming-seqscan=# EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT COUNT(*) FROM test;

<p>As we can see, in an EXPLAIN ANALYZE measurement, there is about 50 millisecond difference between just that patch being applied. This stays consistent across multiple runs.</p>
<h3 id="small-reads-are-a-big-problem-for-some-filesystems"><a href="#small-reads-are-a-big-problem-for-some-filesystems" aria-label="small reads are a big problem for some filesystems permalink"></a>Small reads are a big problem for some filesystems</h3>
<p>Additionally, sometimes there is actual performance overhead to doing small reads.</p>
<p>For example, last year around the time Thomas proposed this new patch series, there was <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CA+hUKGLisdw=PLn-cjtnUh7QQ_6o85vSH8bk_FjKwyEgqd2mPw@mail.gmail.com#e2f637652acf4ca53324687f9d5adbd7">a report from somebody</a> on the Postgres performance mailing list, who was using a <strong>zstd-compressed btrfs filesystem, that does not do any I/O merging</strong>. Clearly this can cause issues with the 8 kB reads that Postgres does today in 16, where the filesystem will have to do a lot of effort for each individual I/O operation.</p>
<p>Now on 17, instead of the reads being 8 kB reads, by default in this case, you'll get 128 kB reads:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres=# select count(*) from t;

preadv(46, ..., 8, 256237568) = 131072
preadv(46, ..., 5, 256368640) = 131072
preadv(46, ..., 8, 256499712) = 131072
preadv(46, ..., 5, 256630784) = 131072</code></pre></div>
<p>But you can go a step further, and use the new "io_combine_limit" Postgres setting to change the size of the I/Os. And so if you want larger I/Os, for in your file system, that makes a difference, you can, for example, say:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SET</span> io_combine_limit <span>=</span> <span>'256k'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this will cause the <code>read</code> calls that Postgres issues to the OS (for users of the new streaming I/O API), to actually be up to 256k reads:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>postgres=# set io_combine_limit = '256k';
postgres=# select count(*) from t;

preadv(47, ..., 5, 613728256) = 262144
preadv(47, ..., 5, 613990400) = 262144
preadv(47, ..., 5, 614252544) = 262144
preadv(47, ..., 5, 614514688) = 262144</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="in-conclusion"><a href="#in-conclusion" aria-label="in conclusion permalink"></a>In conclusion</h2>
<p>As shown, this already provides a nice benefit in 17, and I'm really excited of course about Postgres 18 and all of the asynchronous I/O work that we'll hopefully see there.</p>
<p>Well done, Thomas, Melanie, Nazir and everybody else who worked on this, I'm excited to see an important building block of the AIO work land in 17.</p>

<p>A new <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security issue</a> was discovered that affects the JetBrains <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13115-github" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub plugin</a> on the IntelliJ Platform, which could lead to disclosure of access tokens to third-party sites. The issue affects all IntelliJ-based IDEs as of 2023.1 onwards that have the JetBrains GitHub plugin enabled and configured/in-use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issue is now resolved and a fix has been provided for all IDEs based on the IntelliJ Platform from version 2023.1 onwards.</p>

</ul>







<p>The JetBrains GitHub plugin has also been updated with the fix, and previously affected versions have been removed from <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/" data-type="link" data-id="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JetBrains Marketplace</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have not updated to the latest version, we strongly urge you to do so.</p>



<h2>The Details</h2>



<p>On the 29th of May 2024 we received an external security report with details of a possible vulnerability that would affect pull requests within the IDE. In particular, malicious content as part of a pull request to a GitHub project which would be handled by IntelliJ-based IDEs, would expose access tokens to a third-party host. The CVE ID assigned to this vulnerability is <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-37051" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CVE-2024-37051</a>.</p>



<p>In addition to assessing the issue and starting work on a resolution, we also immediately contacted GitHub to assist us with mitigation. Please note that due to these mitigation measures, the JetBrains GitHub plugin in older versions of JetBrains IDEs may no longer work as expected.</p>



<h2>What is required of you</h2>



<p>First and foremost, we strongly recommend updating to the latest version available for your IDE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you have actively used GitHub pull request functionality in the IDE, we strongly advise that you revoke any GitHub tokens being used by the plugin. Given that the plugin can use OAuth integration or Personal Access Token (PAT), please check both and revoke as necessary:</p>



<ol>
<li>OAuth Integration Settings: go to <a href="https://github.com/settings/applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applications</a> → Authorized OAuth Apps and revoke access for the <strong><em>JetBrains IDE Integration</em></strong> application.</li>



<li>Personal Access Token Settings: go to the <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tokens</a> page and delete the token issued for the plugin. The default token name is <strong><em>IntelliJ IDEA GitHub integration plugin</em></strong>, but you may be using custom names as well.</li>
</ol>







<p>Please note that after the token has been revoked, you will need to set up the plugin again as all plugin features (including Git operations) will stop working.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We sincerely want to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.</p>



<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Just after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/computex">Computex 2024</a>, AMD CEO Lisa Su sat down with Stratechery to conduct an extended interview about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-about-solving-hard-problems/" data-url="https://stratechery.com/2024/an-interview-with-amd-ceo-lisa-su-about-solving-hard-problems/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">solving hard problems</a> throughout her career— including her time at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/ibm">IBM</a> and contributing to the legacy of PlayStation from both there and AMD afterward. As she notes, "I've been working on PlayStation for a long time, if you think about it. PlayStation 3, 4, 5...[like the common thread] across multiple companies, yes."</p><p>Now, even if you're familiar with the PlayStation 3 and its nature as being difficult to program thanks to its IBM PowerPC-based Cell processor, you most likely didn't know Lisa Su had any involvement with it before this week. Details are few and far between, but we did manage to find the earliest statement where pre-AMD CEO Lisa Su commented on the matter.</p><p>According to Lisa Su, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eetimes.com/ibm-sony-toshiba-team-on-processor-architecture-for-broadband/" data-url="https://www.eetimes.com/ibm-sony-toshiba-team-on-processor-architecture-for-broadband/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">then-Director of Emerging Products at IBM</a> in 2001, "We [IBM] started with a clean sheet of paper and sat down and tried to imagine what sort of processor we'd need five years from now." The decision that IBM, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>, and Toshiba made was to create a CPU with an extreme focus on parallelization.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, that approach is fairly common through multicore CPUs, Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT, or Hyper-threading under Intel marketing), and even dedicated Efficiency cores, but SMT wouldn't emerge until 2002, and the first <em>consumer</em> multicore CPUs from AMD and Intel wouldn't be seen until 2005. And, of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techspot.com/article/2363-multi-core-cpu/" data-url="https://www.techspot.com/article/2363-multi-core-cpu/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none">the first-ever multicore was released by IBM for workstation and server use in 2001</a>— the same year they were planning the PS3's Cell processor.</p><p>The interviewer points out that Sony's PlayStation 3 is viewed as one of its least successful consoles, which is true. The PlayStation 3 pretty much lost the generation handily to Nintendo's cheap, casual-friendly Wii and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s less powerful but easier Xbox 360. The complexity of the architecture meant that cross-platform games didn't always perform as well as they should on PS3, though as developers (particularly first-party devs) mastered the hardware, it did result in the most visually stunning console games of the latter half of the generation being Sony exclusives, like <em>Uncharted 3</em> and its ilk.</p><p>Lisa said, "The Cell processor was extremely ambitious at that time, thinking about the type of parallelism it was trying to get out there. Again, I would say, from a business standpoint, it was certainly successful. As you rank things, I think history will tell you that there may be different rankings."</p><p>"My perspective is, the console era has gone through phases [...] but once you went to HD, you had tremendous increase in cost of asset creation, you had developers heavily motivated to support multiple processors, you had game engines coming along. Suddenly, no one wanted to go to the burden of differentiating on the Cell; they just wanted to <em>run</em> on the Cell," Su explained.</p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6SfLwwcGyhc4B9pHSZ2DY4"><section><p>Get Tom's Hardware's best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p></section></div><p>Interestingly, the seventh generation of home consoles (PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii/Wii U) also marks a shift in AMD's allegiances to console manufacturers. AMD produced graphics chips for both Nintendo and Xbox, and all three console manufacturers used the PowerPC CPU architecture. But come to the eighth-gen (PS4, XB1, Switch), both Xbox and PlayStation had switched fully to AMD-powered x86 CPU and GPU architecture. The Switch also saw Nintendo pivot to an Nvidia-powered SoC design (with Arm CPU cores) for their new hybrid console focus.</p><p>With the added context of this interview, one can't help but wonder if Lisa Su's unifying thread throughout the last three generations of PlayStation hardware isn't a coincidence. It could just be corporate happenstance, but going from a humble Product Director and Engineer working on the PS3 at IBM to Senior vice president (in 2012, CEO in 2014) at AMD, setting the future course of both PlayStation and Xbox hardware, is truly impressive.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also a great win for AMD, in general, to provide the hardware behind the two biggest consoles on the market for two consecutive (and a third upcoming) console generations. No matter who wins between Sony and Microsoft and their console war, AMD wins, and that's the kind of thinking that earns you a CEO spot.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><span>At Meta, we support real-time communication (RTC) for billions of people through our apps, including WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We are working to make RTC accessible by providing a high-quality experience for everyone – even those who might not have the fastest connections or the latest phones.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>As more and more people have relied on our products to make calls over the years, we’ve been working on new ways to ensure all calls have a solid audio quality.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><span>We’ve built the Meta Low Bitrate (MLow) codec: a new tool that improves audio quality especially for those on slow-speed connections.</span></li>
</ul>
<figure id="attachment_21370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21370"><img decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png?w=663" alt="" width="350" height="295" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png 663w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png?resize=96,81 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Copy-of-Complexity-Properties-Triangle-1.png?resize=192,162 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21370">Figure 1: Increasing complexity or bitrate usually improves quality, but good codecs achieve higher quality while balancing the other two.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>RTC products use many building blocks to deliver the full experience, and one of the critical components is audio/video codecs. These codecs help compress the captured audio/video data so it can be sent across the internet efficiently to the recipient, keeping the experience real time. For example, the size of raw audio captured for a typical call is 768 kbps (mono, sampling at 48kHz, bit depth 16), which modern codecs are able to compress down to 25-30 kbps. Often this compression comes at the cost of some quality (loss of information), but good codecs can strike a balance among the trio of quality, bitrate, and complexity by exploiting deep knowledge about the nature of the audio signal as well as by using psychoacoustics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Building a good codec is quite challenging, and that is why we don’t see new codecs emerging very often. The last widely known, good open-source codec was Opus, released in 2012, which has become the codec of choice for the wide variety of applications on the internet. Meta has used Opus for all its RTC needs, and so far it has served us well – helping to deliver quality calls to billions of users across the globe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ypsZUNRjI4?si=Jo_8nGuviRGzo-4f" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h2><span>Our motivation for building a new codec</span></h2>
<p><span>Given the massive scale of RTC usage in Meta products, we get to see how a codec performs in a range of network scenarios and how it impacts the end user’s experience. In particular, we’ve observed that a significant chunk of calls have poor network connections throughout or for part of a call. Typically a bandwidth estimation module (BWE) detects the quality of the network, and as the network quality degrades, we need to lower the codec operating bitrate to avoid congesting the network and keep the audio flowing – impacting the trio balance referenced above. Complicating matters, conducting a video call despite poor network quality leaves little room for audio and pushes the audio bitrate further down. The lowest operating point for Opus is 6 kbps, at which it runs in NarrowBand mode (0 – 4kHz) and does not adequately capture all the sound frequencies produced by human voices—and so doesn’t sound as clear or natural. Here is an example of how Opus sounds at 6kbps and the corresponding reference file for comparison.</span></p>
<p><span>Raw reference signal:&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Opus @ 6 kbps NarrowBand (NB):&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Over the last two years, we have seen development of some new machine learning (ML)-based audio codecs that provide good quality audio at very low bitrates. In October of 2022, Meta released </span><a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-powered-audio-compression-technique/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Encodec</span></a><span>, which achieves amazingly crisp audio quality at very low bitrates. While these AI/ML-based codecs are able to achieve great quality at low bitrates, it often comes at the expense of heavy computational cost. Consequently, only the very high-end (expensive) mobile handsets are able to run these codecs reliably, while users running on lower-end devices continue to experience audio quality issues in low-bitrate conditions. So the net impact of these newer computationally expensive codecs is actually limited to a small portion of users.</span></p>
<p><span>A significant number of our users still use low-end devices. For example, more than 20 percent of our calls are made on ARMv7 devices, and 10’s of millions of daily calls on WhatsApp are on 10-year-old-plus devices. Given the readily available codec choices and our commitment to ensure that all users – regardless of what device they’re on – have a quality calling experience, we clearly need a codec with very low-compute requirements that still delivers high-quality audio at these lowest bitrates.</span></p>

<p><span>We broke ground with our development of a new codec in late 2021. After nearly two years of active development and testing, we are proud to announce </span><b>M</b><span>eta </span><b>Low</b><span> Bitrate audio codec, aka MLow, which achieves two-times-better quality than Opus (POLQA MOS 1.89 vs 3.9 @ 6kbps WB). Even more importantly, we are able to achieve this great quality while keeping MLow’s computational complexity </span><b>10 percent lower</b><span> than that of Opus.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Figure 2 below shows a MOS (Mean Opinion Score) plot on a 1-5 scale and compares the POLQA scores between Opus and MLow at various bitrates. As the chart makes evident, MLow has a huge advantage over Opus at the lowest bitrates, where it saturates quality faster than Opus.</span></p>

<p><span>We have already fully launched MLow to all Instagram and Messenger calls and are actively rolling it out on WhatsApp—and we’ve already seen incredible improvement in user engagement driven by better audio quality.</span></p>

<p><span>Being able to encode high-quality audio at lower bitrates also unlocks more effective Forward Error Correction (FEC) strategies. Compared with Opus, with MLow we can afford to pack FEC at much lower bitrates, which significantly helps to improve the audio quality in packet loss scenarios.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are two audio samples at 14 kbps with heavy 30 percent receiver-side packet loss.</span></p>
<p>Opus:</p>

MLow:</p>

<p><span>Note that at these bitrates, Opus is not able to encode any inband FEC. It needs a minimum of 19 kbps to encode any inband FEC at 10 percent packet loss, which hurts the audio recovery.</span></p>
<h2><span>MLow internals</span></h2>
<p><span>MLow builds on the concepts of a classic CELP (Code Excited Linear Prediction) codec with advancements around excitation generation, parameter quantization, and coding schemes. Figure 3 is a high-level visual of how the codec works internally. On the left we have an input signal (raw PCM audio) feeding into the encoder, which then splits the signal into two low and high-frequency bands. Then, each band is encoded separately while making use of shared information to achieve better compression. All the output is passed through a range encoder to further compress and generate an encoded payload. The decoder does the exact opposite when given the payload to generate output audio signals.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_21288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21288"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?w=1024" alt="" width="1024" height="242" srcset="https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png 1484w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=916,217 916w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=768,182 768w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=1024,242 1024w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=96,23 96w, https://engineering.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MLow-image-3.png?resize=192,45 192w" sizes="(max-width: 992px) 100vw, 62vw"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-21288">Figure 3: High level MLow encoder and decoder architecture.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span>With these split-band optimizations, we are able to encode the high band using very few bits, which lets MLow deliver SuperWideBand (32kHz sampling) using a much lower bitrate.</span></p>
<h2><span>What’s next?</span></h2>
<p><span>MLow has greatly enhanced audio quality on low-end devices while still ensuring calls are end-to-end encrypted. We are really excited about what we have accomplished in just the last two years—from developing a new codec to successfully shipping it to billions of users around the globe. We’re continuing to work on improving the audio recovery in heavy packet loss networks by pumping out more redundant audio, which MLow allows us to do efficiently. We’re excited to share more as we continue working to make it easier for all our users to make quality audio calls.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Generally <code>shpool</code> is used to provide persistent sessions when
sshing in to a remote host. To do so, <code>shpool</code> must be installed
on the remote host. No extra software is required on the client.
After installing and setting up, the typical usage pattern
is to ssh into the host you have installed shpool on, then create
a new named session by running <code>shpool attach main</code>. Here <code>main</code>
is the name of the session. You'll want a separate named session
for each terminal you use to connect to your remote host. If your
connection drops or becomes stuck, you can ssh back into the remote
host and re-attach to the same named session by running <code>shpool attach main</code>
again.</p>
<p dir="auto">If your terminal gets stuck and you forcibly close the window, you
might find that <code>shpool</code> still think a terminal is connected to
your session when you attempt to reattach. This is likely because
an ssh proxy is holding the connection open in the vain hope that
it will get some traffic again. You can just run <code>shpool detach main</code>
to force the session to detach and allow you to attach.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h3><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can specify some additional configuration options to the daemon
by passing a <code>-c /path/to/config.toml</code> flag, or by creating and
editing <code>~/.config/shpool/config.toml</code>. The options available
are documented in detail in <code>libshpool/src/config.rs</code>, but there
are a few common things you may wish to tweak.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Detach Keybinding</h4><a id="user-content-detach-keybinding" aria-label="Permalink: Detach Keybinding" href="#detach-keybinding"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You may wish to configure your detach keybinding.
By default, <code>shpool</code> will detach from the current user session when you
press the sequence <code>Ctrl-Space Ctrl-q</code> (press <code>Ctrl-Space</code> then release
it and press <code>Ctrl-q</code>, don't try to hold down all three keys at once),
but you can configure a different binding by adding an entry
like</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="[[keybinding]]
binding = &quot;Ctrl-a d&quot;
action = &quot;Detach&quot;"><pre><code>[[keybinding]]
binding = "Ctrl-a d"
action = "Detach"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to you <code>~/.config/shpool/config.toml</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">For the moment, control is the only modifier key supported, but the keybinding
engine is designed to be able to handle more, so if you want a different one,
you can file a bug with your feature request.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Session Restore Mode</h4><a id="user-content-session-restore-mode" aria-label="Permalink: Session Restore Mode" href="#session-restore-mode"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Shpool can do a few different things when you re-attach to an existing
session. You can choose what you want it to do with the <code>session_restore_mode</code>
configuration option.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>"screen"</code> (default) - restore a screenful of history</h5><a id="user-content-screen-default---restore-a-screenful-of-history" aria-label="Permalink: &quot;screen&quot; (default) - restore a screenful of history" href="#screen-default---restore-a-screenful-of-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>"screen"</code> option causes <code>shpool</code> to re-draw sufficient output to fill the
entire screen of the client terminal as well as using the SIGWINCH trick
described in the <code>"simple"</code> section below. This will help restore
context for interactive terminal sessions that are not full blown ncurses
apps. <code>"screen"</code> is the default reattach behavior for <code>shpool</code>.
You can choose this option explicitly by adding</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="session_restore_mode = &quot;screen&quot;"><pre><code>session_restore_mode = "screen"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to your <code>~/.config/shpool/config.toml</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>"simple"</code> - only ask child processes to redraw</h5><a id="user-content-simple---only-ask-child-processes-to-redraw" aria-label="Permalink: &quot;simple&quot; - only ask child processes to redraw" href="#simple---only-ask-child-processes-to-redraw"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>"simple"</code> option avoids restoring any output. In this reconnect mode, <code>shpool</code> will
issue some SIGWINCH signals to try to convince full screen ncurses apps
such as vim or emacs to re-draw the screen, but will otherwise do nothing.
Any shell output produced when there was no client connected to the session
will be lost. You can choose this connection mode by adding</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="session_restore_mode = &quot;simple&quot;"><pre><code>session_restore_mode = "simple"
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to your <code>~/.config/shpool/config.toml</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>{ lines = n }</code> - restore the last n lines of history</h5><a id="user-content--lines--n----restore-the-last-n-lines-of-history" aria-label="Permalink: { lines = n } - restore the last n lines of history" href="#-lines--n----restore-the-last-n-lines-of-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The lines option is much like the <code>"screen"</code> option, except that rather
than just a screenful of text, it restores the last n lines of text
from the terminal being re-attached to. This could be useful if you
wish to have more context than a single screenful of text. Note that
n cannot exceed the value of the <code>output_spool_lines</code> configuration
option, but it defaults to the value of the lines option, so you likely
won't need to change it.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="session_restore_mode = { lines = n }"><pre><code>session_restore_mode = { lines = n }
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">where n is a number to your <code>~/.config/shpool/config.toml</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Shell Config</h4><a id="user-content-shell-config" aria-label="Permalink: Shell Config" href="#shell-config"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">bash</h5><a id="user-content-bash" aria-label="Permalink: bash" href="#bash"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you use bash, you may want to ensure that the <code>huponexit</code> option
is set to make sure that child processes exit when you leave a
shell. Without this setting, background processes you have
spawned over the course of your shell session will stick around
in the <code>shpool</code> daemon's process tree and eat up memory. To set
this option add</p>

<p dir="auto">to your <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Subcommands</h3><a id="user-content-subcommands" aria-label="Permalink: Subcommands" href="#subcommands"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">shpool daemon</h4><a id="user-content-shpool-daemon" aria-label="Permalink: shpool daemon" href="#shpool-daemon"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>daemon</code> subcommand causes <code>shpool</code> to run in daemon mode. When running in
this mode, <code>shpool</code> listens for incoming connections and opens up subshells,
retaining ownership of them in a table. In general, this subcommand will not
be invoked directly by users, but will instead be called from a systemd unit
file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">shpool attach</h4><a id="user-content-shpool-attach" aria-label="Permalink: shpool attach" href="#shpool-attach"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>attach</code> subcommand connects to the <code>shpool daemon</code> instance, passing in a
name. If the name is new, a new shell is created, and if it already exists it
just attaches to the existing session so long as no other terminal is currently
connected to that session. The <code>--ttl</code> flag can be used to limit how long the
session will last.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">shpool list</h4><a id="user-content-shpool-list" aria-label="Permalink: shpool list" href="#shpool-list"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Lists all the current shell sessions.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">shpool detach</h4><a id="user-content-shpool-detach" aria-label="Permalink: shpool detach" href="#shpool-detach"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Detach from a one or more sessions without stopping them.
Will detach the current session if run from inside a <code>shpool</code>
session with no session name arguments.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">shpool kill</h4><a id="user-content-shpool-kill" aria-label="Permalink: shpool kill" href="#shpool-kill"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Kills a named shell session.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">(Optional) Automatically Connect to shpool</h3><a id="user-content-optional-automatically-connect-to-shpool" aria-label="Permalink: (Optional) Automatically Connect to shpool" href="#optional-automatically-connect-to-shpool"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Explicitly named sessions</h4><a id="user-content-explicitly-named-sessions" aria-label="Permalink: Explicitly named sessions" href="#explicitly-named-sessions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Specifying session names yourself lets you assign logical
roles such as text editing to each session.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ssh config</h5><a id="user-content-ssh-config" aria-label="Permalink: ssh config" href="#ssh-config"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you typically connect to a small number of sessions with
the same jobs on a particular machine, custom ssh config
blocks on your client machine are probably the best
fit.</p>
<p dir="auto">To do this, you can add a config block named <code>edit</code> like so</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Host = edit
    Hostname remote.host.example.com

    RemoteCommand shpool attach -f edit
    RequestTTY yes"><pre><code>Host = edit
    Hostname remote.host.example.com

    RemoteCommand shpool attach -f edit
    RequestTTY yes
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to <code>~/.ssh/config</code> on your client machine. You will need one
such block per session name. You can then invoke this with
<code>ssh edit</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h5 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">shell function</h5><a id="user-content-shell-function" aria-label="Permalink: shell function" href="#shell-function"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">If you would rather have a little more flexibility in
specifying the session name and machine you are targeting,
you can make a custom shell function to let you specify
both at invocation time. Add</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="function shpool-ssh () {
    if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
        echo &quot;usage: shpool-ssh <remote-machine> <session-name>&quot; >&amp;2
        return 1
    fi
    ssh -t &quot;-oRemoteCommand=shpool attach -f $2&quot; &quot;$1&quot;
}"><pre><code>function shpool-ssh () {
    if [ $# -ne 2 ] ; then
        echo "usage: shpool-ssh &lt;remote-machine&gt; &lt;session-name&gt;" &gt;&amp;2
        return 1
    fi
    ssh -t "-oRemoteCommand=shpool attach -f $2" "$1"
}
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">to your <code>.bashrc</code> then invoke it like
<code>shpool-ssh remote.host.example.com main</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Local tty based</h4><a id="user-content-local-tty-based" aria-label="Permalink: Local tty based" href="#local-tty-based"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Rather than specify an explicit name when you connect, you
can set up your system to automatically generate a <code>shpool</code>
session name based on your local terminal emulator's tty
number. To do so, you can add a block of custom ssh config
in the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> of your local machine like</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="Host = by-tty
    User remoteuser
    Hostname remote.host.example.com

    RemoteCommand shpool attach -f &quot;ssh-$(basename $(tty))&quot;
    RequestTTY yes"><pre><code>Host = by-tty
    User remoteuser
    Hostname remote.host.example.com

    RemoteCommand shpool attach -f "ssh-$(basename $(tty))"
    RequestTTY yes
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">which you then invoke with <code>ssh by-tty</code>. You can apply the same principle
of using <code>$(basename $(tty))</code> to get a unique id for your local terminal
to the custom shell function approach as well.</p>
<p dir="auto">The local-tty based approach has the advantage that you don't
need to specify a session name, but it can run into problems
if you have to close the local window and open a new terminal,
which can come up if your connection freezes rather than drops.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Comparison with other tools</h2><a id="user-content-comparison-with-other-tools" aria-label="Permalink: Comparison with other tools" href="#comparison-with-other-tools"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><code>tmux</code> and GNU <code>screen</code></h3><a id="user-content-tmux-and-gnu-screen" aria-label="Permalink: tmux and GNU screen" href="#tmux-and-gnu-screen"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>tmux</code> is probably the best known session persistence tool, and
GNU <code>screen</code> has a similar feature set, so in comparison to <code>shpool</code>
it can be thought of as belonging to the same category.</p>
<p dir="auto">The main way that <code>shpool</code> differs from <code>tmux</code> is that <code>tmux</code> is a
terminal multiplexer which necessarily means that it offers session
persistence features, while <code>shpool</code> only aims to be a session
persistence tool. In contrast to <code>tmux</code> the philosophy of <code>shpool</code>
is that managing different terminals is the job of your display or
window manager, not your session persistence tool. Every operating
system has its own idioms for switching between applications, and
there is no reason to switch to different idioms when switching
between terminals. Especially for users of tiling window managers
such as <code>i3</code>, <code>sway</code> or <code>xmonad</code>, tmux's multiplexing features are
redundant.</p>
<p dir="auto">While <code>tmux</code> renders terminal contents remotely and only paints
the current view to the screen, <code>shpool</code> just directly sends
all shell output back to the user's local terminal. This means
that all rendering is handled by a single terminal state machine
rather than going through <code>tmux</code>s internal in-memory terminal
before getting formatted and re-rendered by the local terminal.
This has performance implications, and probably most
importantly means that a terminal using <code>shpool</code> will feel
completely native. Scrollback and copy-paste will work exactly
as they do in your native terminal, while they can behave differently
when using <code>tmux</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh"><code>mosh</code></a></h3><a id="user-content-mosh" aria-label="Permalink: mosh" href="#mosh"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>mosh</code> is another tool focused on providing persistent remote shell
sessions. It differs from the other tools discussed here in that it
has its own network protocol, which it bootstraps off of regular
ssh. Like <code>tmux</code>, it renders the screen contents remotely and sends
just the current view back. It is somewhat unique in trying to
predicatively guess the right output to display to the user if
there is a network lag.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>shpool</code> differs from <code>mosh</code> in that it has nothing to do with
the network, remaining confined to a single machine like most of
these other tools. Just like in the case of <code>tmux</code>, <code>mosh</code> will
impact the way scrollback and copy-paste work, while <code>shpool</code>
keeps them feeling entirely native.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/crigler/dtach"><code>dtach</code></a>, <a href="https://github.com/martanne/abduco"><code>abduco</code></a>, and <a href="https://github.com/yazgoo/diss"><code>diss</code></a></h3><a id="user-content-dtach-abduco-and-diss" aria-label="Permalink: dtach, abduco, and diss" href="#dtach-abduco-and-diss"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">These tools have the most in common with <code>shpool</code>. Just like <code>shpool</code>, they
eschew multiplexing and just send the raw bytes back to you for your local
terminal to render. While you could say that <code>shpool</code> aims to be a
simpler version of <code>tmux</code>, these tools follow the same philosophy with
an even greater laser focus on simplicity and doing one thing well.</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>shpool</code> aims to be an easy and pleasant experience for people
who just want session persistence without having to care about
it too much, so it has a few more "cushy" features that would
not be as good a fit for the focus on simplicity of these
tools.</p>
<p dir="auto">The most obvious of these features is the difference between
how <code>shpool</code> and these programs handle re-attaches. Though under normal operation,
<code>shpool</code> does not do any rendering and subsetting of the shell
output, it continually maintains an in-memory render of the
terminal state via the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/shpool_vt100" rel="nofollow"><code>shpool_vt100</code></a>
crate. On reattach, <code>shpool</code> will use this in-memory render to
re-draw the screen, so you can easily see where you were when
your connection dropped. This even allows you to see output
generated after your connection dropped.</p>
<p dir="auto">Another such feature is the automatic prompt prefix. <code>shpool</code>
will detect when you are using a known shell (currently
<code>bash</code>, <code>zsh</code>, or <code>fish</code>) and automatically inject a prefix
into your prompt to let you know the name of the <code>shpool</code> session
you are in. This adds some nice context so you don't lose
track of your terminals and have some hint about the current
terminal state.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are also some features <code>shpool</code> is missing which these
programs have. In particular, it seems that <code>dtach</code> and <code>abduco</code>
support shared sessions, while <code>shpool</code> only allows a single
client to be connected to a particular session at a time.
There may be more since I don't know these tools as well
as <code>shpool</code>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Indian Startup 3D Prints Rocket Engine in Just 72 Hours"><p>A rocket featuring the world’s first rocket engine 3D printed as a single piece blasted off from India’s east coast in late May.

What sets Agnikul apart is that its engine is printed in one go, rather than as multiple components that have to then be stitched together, which significantly speeds up manufacturing time.</p><p> On 30 May, the company carried out its first suborbital launch powered by the engine. A single-stage rocket lifted off from the <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/" target="_blank">Indian Space Research Organisation’s</a> Satish Dhawan Space Center on Sriharikota island in Andhra Pradesh, reaching an altitude of 6.5 kilometers before splashing down into the ocean.</p><p><span data-rm-shortcode-id="47c210ba720d4009542b5774c43a4067"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3J2Lnck_vgU?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></span><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The launch of Agnibaan SOrTeD</small></p><p> “It performed very successfully,” says cofounder and chief operating officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/moin-spm-53a80342/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Moin SPM</a>. “It met all the objectives of the mission so we have a lot of confidence in the technologies that we have built.”</p><p> The company’s first commercial product will be a two-stage rocket called <a href="https://agnikul.in/#/products" target="_blank">Agnibaan</a>, which will be 18 meters tall, feature eight engines in total and able to carry a 300-kilogram payload to an altitude of around 700 km. The launch vehicle used in May’s test was only 6 meters tall and featured just a single engine, making it roughly equivalent to Agnibaan’s second stage.</p><p> The launch acted as a technology demonstrator to test out all of the key subsystems necessary for an orbital launch. Those included the flight computer, avionics, guidance, and navigation systems, as well as the launchpad itself, which was purpose-built for the mission.</p><p> The team hit its target of 6 kilonewtons of thrust and was able to successfully carry out a wind-biasing maneuver, in which the rockets trajectory is adjusted midflight to account for the affects of wind. Besides validating the technology, SPM says they gained valuable experience in both manufacturing processes and launch operations.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img id="4f373" data-rm-shortcode-id="bc254dae3e83b0307e0f9c44f06365c2" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-yellowish-metallic-3d-printed-rocket-engine-sits-on-a-table.jpg?id=52436307&amp;width=980" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-yellowish-metallic-3d-printed-rocket-engine-sits-on-a-table.jpg?id=52436307&amp;width=980" width="2000" height="2667" alt="A yellowish metallic 3D printed rocket engine sits on a table."><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">This 3D-printed rocket engine was used in Agnikul’s first successful launch.</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Agnikul</small></p><p> The launch also vindicated the company’s unconventional manufacturing approach. Constructing a rocket engine using conventional approaches can take months, followed by extensive qualification testing to ensure it meets the required specifications. Using a metal 3D printer from German company <a href="https://www.eos.info/en" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">EOS</a>, Agnikul produced its engine in roughly three days. Agnikul printed the engine out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inconel" target="_blank">inconel</a>, a high-performance alloy of nickel and chromium that can withstand high temperatures and mechanical loads. The machine also automatically outputs a report that details any deviations during printing, removing the need for postfabrication qualification.</p><p> Assembling the rest of the rocket and integrating the engine took roughly two weeks. The company says that opens the door to providing low-cost, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-printed-rockets-india-agnikul" target="_blank">“on-demand”</a> launch services to <a data-linked-post="2650279771" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-small-satellites-are-providing-lowcost-access-to-space" target="_blank">operators of small satellites</a>, which otherwise need to wait for a ride share on a bigger rocket.</p><p> The big challenge now will be going from a single engine to a cluster of seven on Agnibaan’s first stage, says cofounder and CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/srinath-ravichandran-09679a7/?originalSubdomain=in" target="_blank">Srinath Ravichandran</a>. This raises all kinds of challenges, from balancing thrust across the engines at lift-off to managing engine plume interactions when the engines gimbal to alter the trajectory. “But these are problems that people have figured out,” he says. “We believe that we should just be able to fine-tune it for our mission and go.”</p><p> The company is currently building facilities to carry out ground tests of engine clusters, says Ravichandran, and is targeting its first orbital launch for this time next year.</p><p><em>This post was updated in 12 June to add further detail about the material that Agnikul is using to 3D print its rocket engines.</em><br></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">Microsoft hired Andrew Harris for his extraordinary skill in keeping hackers out of the nation’s most sensitive computer networks. In 2016, Harris was hard at work on a mystifying incident in which intruders had somehow penetrated a major U.S. tech company.</p>
        
    
                        


   
            
            
            
            

   
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">The breach troubled Harris for two reasons. First, it involved the company’s cloud — a virtual storehouse typically containing an organization’s most sensitive data. Second, the attackers had pulled it off in a way that left little trace.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">He retreated to his home office to “war game” possible scenarios, stress-testing the various software products that could have been compromised.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="6.0">Early on, he focused on a Microsoft application that ensured users had permission to log on to cloud-based programs, the cyber equivalent of an officer checking passports at a border. It was there, after months of research, that he found something seriously wrong.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The product, which was used by millions of people to log on to their work computers, contained a flaw that could allow attackers to masquerade as legitimate employees and rummage through victims’ “crown jewels” — national security secrets, corporate intellectual property, embarrassing personal emails — all without tripping alarms.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">To Harris, who had previously spent nearly seven years working for the Defense Department, it was a security nightmare. Anyone using the software was exposed, regardless of whether they used Microsoft or another cloud provider such as Amazon. But Harris was most concerned about the federal government and the implications of his discovery for national security. He flagged the issue to his colleagues.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="10.0">They saw it differently, Harris said. The federal government was preparing to make a massive investment in cloud computing, and Microsoft wanted the business. Acknowledging this security flaw could jeopardize the company’s chances, Harris recalled one product leader telling him. The financial consequences were enormous. Not only could Microsoft lose a multibillion-dollar deal, but it could also lose the race to dominate the market for cloud computing.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">Harris said he pleaded with the company for several years to address the flaw in the product, a ProPublica investigation has found. But at every turn, Microsoft dismissed his warnings, telling him they would work on a long-term alternative — leaving cloud services around the globe vulnerable to attack in the meantime.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">Harris was certain someone would figure out how to exploit the weakness. He’d come up with a temporary solution, but it required customers to turn off one of Microsoft’s most convenient and popular features: the ability to access nearly every program used at work with a single logon.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">He scrambled to alert some of the company’s most sensitive customers about the threat and personally oversaw the fix for the New York Police Department. Frustrated by Microsoft’s inaction, he left the company in August 2020.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="15.0">Within months, his fears became reality. U.S. officials <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-imposing-costs-for-harmful-foreign-activities-by-the-russian-government/">confirmed reports</a> that a state-sponsored team of Russian hackers had carried out SolarWinds, one of the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/solarwinds-hack-russia-cyberattack-60-minutes-2021-07-04/">largest cyberattacks</a> in U.S. history. They used the flaw Harris had identified to vacuum up sensitive data from a number of federal agencies, including, ProPublica has learned, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which maintains the United States’ nuclear weapons stockpile, and the National Institutes of Health, which at the time was engaged in COVID-19 research and vaccine distribution. The Russians also used the weakness to compromise dozens of email accounts in the Treasury Department, <a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/ranking-members-news/wyden-statement-following-treasury-and-irs-briefing-on-solarwinds-hack">including those of its highest-ranking officials</a>. One federal official <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-russian-hack-extends-far-beyond-solarwinds-software-investigators-say-11611921601">described the breach</a> as “an espionage campaign designed for long-term intelligence collection.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Harris’ account, told here for the first time and supported by interviews with former colleagues and associates as well as social media posts, upends the prevailing public understanding of the SolarWinds hack.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="17.0">From the moment the hack surfaced, Microsoft insisted it was blameless. Microsoft President Brad Smith <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/qfr-bsmith-022321.pdf">assured Congress in 2021</a> that “there was no vulnerability in any Microsoft product or service that was exploited” in SolarWinds.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">He also said customers could have done more to protect themselves.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.1">Harris said they were never given the chance.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">“The decisions are not based on what’s best for Microsoft’s customers but on what’s best for Microsoft,” said Harris, who now works for CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company that competes with Microsoft.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">Microsoft declined to make Smith and other top officials available for interviews for this story, but it did not dispute ProPublica’s findings. Instead, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24742779-microsoft-statement">the company issued a statement</a> in response to written questions. “Protecting customers is always our highest priority,” a spokesperson said. “Our security response team takes all security issues seriously and gives every case due diligence with a thorough manual assessment, as well as cross-confirming with engineering and security partners. Our assessment of this issue received multiple reviews and was aligned with the industry consensus.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">ProPublica’s investigation comes as the Pentagon <a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/05/17/pentagon-weighs-microsoft-licensing-upgrades">seeks to expand its use of Microsoft products</a> — a move that has <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/06/04/schmitt_wyden_dod_microsoft_e5.pdf">drawn scrutiny</a> from federal lawmakers amid a series of cyberattacks on the government.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">Smith is set to testify on Thursday before <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/hearing/a-cascade-of-security-failures-assessing-microsoft-corporations-cybersecurity-shortfalls-and-the-implications-for-homeland-security/">the House Homeland Security Committee</a>, which is examining Microsoft’s role in a breach perpetrated last year by hackers connected to the Chinese government. Attackers exploited Microsoft security flaws to gain access to top U.S. officials’ emails. In investigating the attack, the federal Cyber Safety Review Board <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/cyber-safety-review-board-releases-report-microsoft-online-exchange-incident-summer-2023">found</a> that Microsoft’s “security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">For its part, Microsoft has said that work has already begun, declaring that <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/03/security-above-all-else-expanding-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/">the company’s top priority is security</a> “above all else.” Part of the effort involves adopting the board’s recommendations. “If you’re faced with the tradeoff between security and another priority, your answer is clear: Do security,” the company’s CEO, Satya Nadella, told employees in the wake of the board’s report, which identified a “corporate culture that deprioritized both enterprise security investments and rigorous risk management.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">ProPublica’s investigation adds new details and pivotal context about that culture, offering an unsettling look into how the world’s largest software provider handles the security of its own ubiquitous products. It also offers crucial insight into just how much the quest for profits can drive those security decisions, especially as tech behemoths push to dominate the newest — and most lucrative — frontiers, including the cloud market.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">“This is part of the problem overall with the industry,” said Nick DiCola, who was one of Harris’ bosses at Microsoft and now works at Zero Networks, a network security firm. Publicly-traded tech giants “are beholden to the share price, not to doing what’s right for the customer all the time. That’s just a reality of capitalism. You’re never going to change that in a public company because at the end of the day, they want the shareholder value to go up.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>A “Cloud-First World”</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Early this year, Microsoft surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company, worth more than $3 trillion. That triumph was almost unimaginable a decade ago. (The two remain in close competition for the top spot.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">In 2014, the same year that Harris joined Microsoft and Nadella became the CEO, Wall Street and consumers alike viewed the company as stuck in the past, clinging to the “shrink-wrapped” software products like Windows that put it on the map in the 1990s. Microsoft’s long-stagnant share price reflected its status as an also-ran in almost every major technological <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0e8c3002-20c7-11ea-92da-f0c92e957a96">breakthrough</a> since the turn of the century, from its Bing search engine to its Nokia mobile phone division.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">As the new CEO, Nadella was determined to reverse the trend and shake off the company’s fuddy-duddy reputation, so he staked Microsoft’s future on the Azure cloud computing division, which then lagged far behind Amazon. In his earliest all-staff memo, Nadella told employees they would need “to reimagine a lot of what we have done in the past for a … <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2014/satya-nadellas-full-memo-microsoft-staffers-need-believe-impossible-remove-improbable/">cloud-first world</a>.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">Microsoft salespeople pitched business and government customers on a “hybrid cloud” strategy, where they kept some traditional, on-premises servers (typically stored on racks in customers’ own offices) while shifting most of their computing needs to the cloud (hosted on servers in Microsoft data centers).</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">Security was a key selling point for the cloud. On-site servers were notoriously vulnerable, in part because organizations’ overburdened IT staff often failed to promptly install the required patches and updates. With the cloud, that crucial work was handled by dedicated employees whose job was security.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">The dawn of the cloud era at Microsoft was an exciting time to work in the field of cybersecurity for someone like Harris, whose high school yearbook features a photo of him in front of a desktop computer and monitor with a mess of floppy disks beside him. One hand is on the keyboard, the other on a wired mouse. Caption: “Harris the hacker.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">As a sophomore at Pace University in New York, he wrote a white paper titled “How to Hack the Wired Equivalent Protocol,” a network security standard, and was awarded a prestigious Defense Department scholarship, which the government uses to recruit cybersecurity specialists. The National Security Agency paid for three years of his tuition, which included a master’s degree in software engineering, in exchange for a commitment to work for the government for at least that long, he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">Early in his career, he helped lead the Defense Department’s efforts to protect individual devices. He became an expert in the niche field known as identity and access management, securing how people log in.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">As the years wore on, he grew frustrated by the lumbering bureaucracy and craved the innovation of the tech industry. He decided he could make a bigger impact in the private sector, which designed much of the software the government used.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="40.0">At Microsoft he was assigned to a secretive unit known as the “Ghostbusters” (as in: “Who you gonna call?”), which responded to hacks of the company’s most sensitive customers, especially the federal government. As a member of this team, Harris first investigated the puzzling attack on the tech company and remained obsessed with it, even after switching roles inside Microsoft.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">Eventually, he confirmed the weakness within Active Directory Federation Services, or AD FS, a product that allowed users to sign on a single time to access nearly everything they needed. The problem, he discovered, rested in how the application used a computer language known as SAML to authenticate users as they logged in.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">This is what makes a SAML attack unique. Typically, hackers leave what cybersecurity specialists call a “noisy” digital trail. Network administrators monitoring the so-called “audit logs” might see unknown or foreign IP addresses attempting to gain access to their cloud services. But SAML attacks are much harder to detect. The forged token is the equivalent of a robber using a copied master key. There was little trail to track, just the activities of what appear to be legitimate users.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Harris and a colleague who consulted for the Department of Defense spent hours in front of both real and virtual whiteboards as they mapped out how such an attack would work, the colleague told ProPublica. The “token theft” risk, as Harris referred to it, became a regular topic of discussion for them.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>A Clash With “Won’t Fix” Culture</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">Before long, Harris alerted his supervisors about his SAML finding. Nick DiCola, his boss at the time, told ProPublica he referred Harris to the Microsoft Security Response Center, which fields reports of security vulnerabilities and determines which need to be addressed. Given its central role in improving Microsoft product security, the team once considered itself the “conscience of the company,” urging colleagues to improve security without regard to profit. In a meeting room, someone hung a framed photo of Winston “the Wolf,” the charismatic fixer in Quentin Tarantino’s movie “Pulp Fiction” who is summoned to clean up the aftermath of bloody hits.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Members of the team were not always popular within the company. Plugging security holes is a cost center, and making new products is a profit center, former employees told ProPublica. In 2002, the company’s founder, Bill Gates, tried to settle the issue, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2012/01/11/memo-from-bill-gates/">sending a memo</a> that turned out to be eerily prescient. “Flaws in a single Microsoft product, service or policy not only affect the quality of our platform and services overall, but also our customers’ view of us as a company,” Gates wrote, adding: “So now, when we face a choice between adding features and resolving security issues, we need to choose security.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">At first, Gates’ memo was transformational and the company’s product divisions were more responsive to the center’s concerns. But over time, the center’s influence waned.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Its members were stuck between cultural forces. Security researchers — often characterized as having outsized egos — believed their findings should be immediately addressed, underestimating the business challenges of developing fixes quickly, former MSRC employees told ProPublica.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Product managers had little motivation to act fast, if at all, since compensation was tied to the release of new, revenue-generating products and features. That attitude was particularly pronounced in Azure product groups, former MSRC members said, because they were under pressure from Nadella to catch up to Amazon.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">“Azure was the Wild West, just this constant race for features and functionality,” said Nate Warfield, who worked in the MSRC for four years beginning in 2016. “You will get a promotion because you released the next new shiny thing in Azure. You are not going to get a promotion because you fixed a bunch of security bugs.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="52.0">Former employees told ProPublica that the center fielded hundreds or even thousands of reports a month, pushing the perennially understaffed group to its limits. The magazine Popular Science noted that volume as one of the reasons why working in the MSRC was one of the 10 “<a href="https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2007-06/worst-jobs-science-2007/">worst jobs in science</a>,” between whale feces researchers and elephant vasectomists.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“They’re trained, because they’re so resource constrained, to think of these cases in terms of: ‘How can I get to ‘won’t fix,’” said Dustin Childs, who worked in the MSRC in the years leading up to Harris’ saga. Staff would often punt on fixes by telling researchers they would be handled in “v-next,” the next product version, he said. Those launches, however, could be years away, leaving customers vulnerable in the interim, he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">The center also routinely rejected researchers’ reports of weaknesses by saying they didn’t cross what its staff called a “security boundary.” But when Harris discovered the SAML flaw, it was a term with no formal definition, former employees said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="56.0">By 2017, the lack of clarity had become the “butt of jokes,” Warfield said. Several prominent security researchers who regularly interacted with the MSRC made T-shirts and stickers that said “____ [fill in the blank] is not a security boundary.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="57.0">“Any time Microsoft didn’t want to fix something, they’d just say, ‘That’s not a security boundary, we’re not going to fix it,’” Warfield recalled.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="58.0">Unaware of the inauspicious climate, Harris met virtually with MSRC representatives and sketched out how a hacker could jump from an on-premises server to the cloud without being detected. The MSRC declined to address the problem. Its staff argued that hackers attempting to exploit the SAML flaw would first have to gain access to an on-premises server. As they saw it, Harris said, that was the security boundary — not the subsequent hop to the cloud.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Business Over Security</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="59.0">“WTF,” Harris recalled thinking when he got the news. “This makes no sense.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="60.0">Microsoft had told customers the cloud was the safest place to put their most precious data. His discovery proved that, for the millions of users whose systems included AD FS, their cloud was only as secure as their on-premises servers. In other words, all the buildings owned by the landlord are only as secure as the most careless tenant who forgot to lock their window.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.0">Harris pushed back, but he said the MSRC held firm.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="61.1">Harris had a reputation for going outside the chain of command to air his concerns, and he took his case to the team managing the products that verified user identities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="62.0">He had some clout, his former colleagues said. He had already established himself as a known expert in the field, had pioneered a cybersecurity threat detection method and later was listed as the named inventor on a <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/10977364">Microsoft patent</a>. Harris said he “went kind of crazy” and fired off an email to product manager Mark Morowczynski and director Alex Simons requesting a meeting.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="63.0">He understood that developing a long-term fix would take time, but he had an interim solution that could eliminate the threat. One of the main practical functions of AD FS was to allow users to access both on-premises servers and a variety of cloud-based services after entering credentials only once, a Microsoft feature known as “seamless” single sign-on. Harris proposed that Microsoft tell its customers to turn off that function so the SAML weakness would no longer matter.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.0">According to Harris, Morowczynski quickly jumped on a videoconference and said he had discussed the concerns with Simons.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.1">“Everyone violently agreed with me that this is a huge issue,” Harris said. “Everyone violently disagreed with me that we should move quickly to fix it.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="64.2">Morowczynski, Harris said, had two primary objections.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="65.0">First, a public acknowledgement of the SAML flaw would alert adversaries who could then exploit it. Harris waved off the concern, believing it was a risk worth taking so that customers wouldn’t be ignorant to the threat. Plus, he believed Microsoft could warn customers without betraying any specifics that could be co-opted by hackers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="66.0">According to Harris, Morowczynski’s second objection revolved around the business fallout for Microsoft. Harris said Morowczynski told him that his proposed fix could alienate one of Microsoft’s largest and most important customers: the federal government, which used AD FS. Disabling seamless SSO would have widespread and unique consequences for government employees, who relied on physical “smart cards” to log onto their devices. Required by federal rules, the cards generated random passwords each time employees signed on. Due to the configuration of the underlying technology, though, removing seamless SSO would mean users could not access the cloud through their smart cards. To access services or data on the cloud, they would have to sign in a second time and would not be able to use the mandated smart cards.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="67.0">Harris said Morowczynski rejected his idea, saying it wasn’t a viable option.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="68.0">Morowczynski told Harris that his approach could also undermine the company’s chances of getting one of the largest government computing contracts in U.S. history, which would be formally announced the next year. Internally, Nadella had made clear that Microsoft needed a piece of this multibillion-dollar deal with the Pentagon if it wanted to have a future in selling cloud services, Harris and other former employees said.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Killing the Competition</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="70.0">By Harris’ account, the team was also concerned about the potential business impact on the products sold by Microsoft to sign into the cloud. At the time, Microsoft was in a fierce rivalry with a company called Okta.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="71.0">Microsoft customers had been sold on seamless SSO, which was one of the competitive advantages — or, in Microsoft parlance, “kill points” — that the company then had over Okta, whose users had to sign on twice, Harris said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="72.0">Harris’ proposed fix would undermine the company’s strategy to marginalize Okta and would “add friction” to the user experience, whereas the “No. 1 priority was to remove friction,” Harris recalled Morowczynski telling him. Moreover, it would have cascading consequences for the cloud business because the sale of identity products often led to demand for other cloud services.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="73.0">“That little speed bump of you authenticating twice was unacceptable by Microsoft’s standards,” Harris said. He recalled Morowczynski telling him that the product group’s call “was a business decision, not a technical one.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="74.0">“What they were telling me was counterintuitive to everything I’d heard at Microsoft about ‘customer first,’” Harris said. “Now they’re telling me it’s not ‘customer first,’ it’s actually ‘business first.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="75.0">DiCola, Harris’ then-supervisor, told ProPublica the race to dominate the market for new and high-growth areas like the cloud drove the decisions of Microsoft’s product teams. “That is always like, ‘Do whatever it frickin’ takes to win because you have to win.’ Because if you don’t win, it’s much harder to win it back in the future. Customers tend to buy that product forever.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="76.0">According to Harris, Morowczynski said his team had “on the road map” a product that could replace AD FS altogether. But it was unclear when it would be available to customers.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="77.0">In the months that followed, Harris vented to his colleagues about the product group’s decision. ProPublica talked to three people who worked with Harris at the time and recalled these conversations. All of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared professional repercussions. The three said Harris was enraged and frustrated over what he described to them as the product group’s unwillingness to address the weakness.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="78.0">Neither Morowczynski nor Simons returned calls seeking comment, and Microsoft declined to make them available for interviews. The company did not dispute the details of Harris’ account. In its statement, Microsoft said it weighs a number of factors when it evaluates potential threats. “We prioritize our security response work by considering potential customer disruption, exploitability, and available mitigations,” the spokesperson said. “We continue to listen to the security research community and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/03/security-above-all-else-expanding-microsofts-secure-future-initiative/">evolve our approach</a> to ensure we are meeting customer expectations and protecting them from emerging threats.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Another Major Warning</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="79.0">Following the conversation with Morowczynski, Harris wrote a reminder to himself on the whiteboard in his home office: “SAML follow-up.” He wanted to keep the pressure on the product team.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="80.0">Soon after, the Massachusetts- and Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm <a href="https://www.cyberark.com/resources/threat-research-blog/golden-saml-newly-discovered-attack-technique-forges-authentication-to-cloud-apps">CyberArk published a blog post describing the flaw</a>, which it dubbed “Golden SAML,” along with a proof of concept, essentially a road map that showed how hackers could exploit the weakness.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="81.0">Years later, in his <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/qfr-bsmith-022321.pdf">written testimony for the Senate Intelligence Committee</a>, Microsoft’s Brad Smith said this was the moment the company learned of the issue. “The Golden SAML theory became known to cybersecurity professionals at Microsoft and across the U.S. government and the tech sector at precisely the same time, when it was published in a public paper in 2017,” Smith wrote.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="82.0">Lavi Lazarovitz of CyberArk said the firm mentioned the weakness — before the post was published — in a private WhatsApp chat of about 10 security researchers from various companies, a forum members used to compare notes on emerging threats. When they raised the discovery to the group, which included at least one researcher from Microsoft, the other members were dismissive, Lazarovitz said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="83.0">“Many in the security research community — I don’t want to say mocked — but asked, ‘Well, what’s the big deal?’” Lazarovitz said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="85.0">Nevertheless, CyberArk believed it was worth taking seriously, given that AD FS represented the gateway to users’ most sensitive information, including email. “Threat actors operate in between the cracks,” Lazarovitz said. “So obviously, we understood the feedback that we got, but we still believed that this technique will be eventually leveled by threat actors.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="86.0">The Israel-based team also reached out to contacts at Microsoft’s Israeli headquarters and were met with a response similar to the one they got in the WhatsApp group, Lazarovitz said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="87.0">The published report was CyberArk’s way of warning the public about the threat. Disclosing the weakness also had a business benefit for the company. In the blog post, it pitched its own security product, which it said “will be extremely beneficial in blocking attackers from getting their hands on important assets like the token-signing certificate in the first place.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="88.0">The report initially received little attention. Harris, however, seized on it. He said he alerted Morowczynski and Simons from the product group as well as the MSRC. The situation was more urgent than before, Harris argued to them, because CyberArk included the proof of concept that could be used by hackers to carry out a real attack. For Harris, it harkened back to Morowczynski’s worry that flagging the weakness could give hackers an advantage.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.0">“I was more energetic than ever to have us actually finally figure out what we’re going to do about this,” Harris said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="89.1">But the MSRC reiterated its “security boundary” stance, while Morowczynski reaffirmed the product group’s earlier decision, Harris said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="90.0">Harris said he then returned to his supervisors, including Hayden Hainsworth and Bharat Shah, who, as corporate vice president of the Azure cloud security division, also oversaw the MSRC. “I said, ‘Can you guys please listen to me,’” Harris recalled. “‘This is probably the most important thing I’ve ever done in my career.’”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="91.0">Harris said they were unmoved and told him to take the problem back to the MSRC.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="92.0">Microsoft did not publicly comment on the CyberArk blog post at the time. Years later, <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/qfr-bsmith-022321.pdf">in written responses to Congress</a>, Smith said the company’s security researchers reviewed the information but decided to focus on other priorities. Neither Hainsworth nor Shah returned calls seeking comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Defusing a Ticking Bomb</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="94.0">Harris said he was deeply frustrated. On a personal level, his ego was bruised. Identifying major weaknesses is considered an achievement for cybersecurity professionals, and, despite his internal discovery, CyberArk had claimed Golden SAML.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="95.0">More broadly, he said he was more worried than ever, believing the weakness was a ticking bomb. “It’s out in the open now,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="96.0">Publicly, Microsoft <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171209163607/https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/azure-vs-aws/">continued to promote the safety of its products</a>, even boasting of its relationship with the federal government in sales pitches. “To protect your organization, Azure embeds security, privacy, and compliance into its development methodology,” the company said in late 2017, “and has been recognized as the most trusted cloud for U.S. government institutions.”</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.0">Separately, he realized he could help customers with whom he had existing relationships, including the NYPD, the nation’s largest police force.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="104.1">“Knowing this exploit is actually possible, why would I not architect around it, especially for my critical customers?” Harris said.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="105.0">On a visit to the NYPD, Harris told a top IT official, Matthew Fraser, about the AD FS weakness and recommended disabling seamless SSO. Fraser was in disbelief at the severity of the issue, Harris recalled, and he agreed to disable seamless SSO.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.0">In an interview, Fraser confirmed the meeting. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="106.1">“This was identified as one of those areas that was prime, ripe,” Fraser said of the SAML weakness. “From there, we figured out what’s the best path to insulate and secure.”</p>

<h3>More Troubling Revelations</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="107.0">It was over beers at a conference in Orlando in 2018 that Harris learned the weakness was even worse than he’d initially realized. A colleague sketched out on a napkin how hackers could also bypass a common security feature called multifactor authentication, which requires users to perform one or more additional steps to verify their identity, such as entering a code sent via text message.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="108.0">They realized that, no matter how many additional security steps a company puts in place, a hacker with a forged token can bypass them all. When they brought the new information to the MSRC, “it was a nonstarter,” Harris said. While the center <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/windows-security-servicing-criteria">had published a formal definition</a> of “security boundary” by that point, Harris’ issues still didn’t meet it.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="110.0">By March 2019, concerns over Golden SAML were spilling out into the wider tech world. That month, <a href="https://troopers.de/troopers19/agenda/fpxwmn/">at a conference in Germany</a>, two researchers from the cybersecurity company Mandiant delivered a presentation demonstrating how hackers could infiltrate AD FS to gain access to organizations’ cloud accounts and applications. They also released the tools they used to do so.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.0">Mandiant said it notified Microsoft before the presentation, making it the second time in roughly 16 months that an outside firm had flagged the SAML issue to the company.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.1">In August 2020, Harris left Microsoft to work for CrowdStrike. In his exit interview with Shah, Harris said he raised the SAML weakness one last time. Shah listened but offered no feedback, he said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="111.2">“There is no inspector general-type thing” within Microsoft, Harris said. “If something egregious is happening, where the hell do you go? There’s no place to go.”</p>

<h3>SolarWinds Breaks</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="112.0">Four months later, news of the SolarWinds attack broke. Federal officials soon announced that beginning in 2019 Russian hackers had breached and exploited the network management software offered by a Texas-based company called SolarWinds, which had the misfortune of lending its name to the attack. The hackers covertly inserted malware into the firm’s software updates, gaining “backdoor” access to the networks of companies and government agencies that installed them. The ongoing access allowed hackers to take advantage of “post-exploit” vulnerabilities, including Golden SAML, to steal sensitive data and emails from the cloud.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="113.0">Despite the name, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-russian-hack-extends-far-beyond-solarwinds-software-investigators-say-11611921601">nearly a third</a> of victims of the attack never used SolarWinds software at all, Brandon Wales, then acting director of the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in the aftermath. In March 2021, Wales told a Senate panel that hackers were able to “gain broad access to data stores that they wanted, largely in Microsoft Office 365 Cloud … and it was all because they compromised those systems that manage trust and identity on networks.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="114.0">Microsoft itself was also breached.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="115.0">In the immediate aftermath of the attack, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/protecting-microsoft-365-from-on-premises-attacks/ba-p/1751754">Microsoft advised customers</a> of Microsoft 365 to disable seamless SSO in AD FS and similar products — the solution that Harris proposed three years earlier.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="116.0">As the world dealt with the consequences, Harris took his long simmering frustration <a href="http://x.com/ciberesponce/status/1339885673646612480?s=46&amp;t=chjNjKsX2TeMLEHigHtMaA">public in a series</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/ciberesponce/status/1363483257136947204?s=46&amp;t=chjNjKsX2TeMLEHigHtMaA">posts</a> on social media and on his <a href="https://www.ciberesponce.com/learning-identity-cyber-attacks/">personal blog</a>. <a href="https://x.com/ciberesponce/status/1364336404122263554?s=46&amp;t=chjNjKsX2TeMLEHigHtMaA">Challenging Brad Smith</a> by name, and criticizing the MSRC’s decisions — which he referred to as “utter BS” — Harris lambasted Microsoft for failing to publicly warn customers about Golden SAML.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="117.0">Microsoft “was not transparent about these risks, forced customers to use ADFS knowing these risks, and put many customers and especially US Gov’t in a bad place,” Harris <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrewfharris_ive-been-outspoken-a-bit-on-how-bypassing-activity-6745561216145588224-R4mj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">wrote on LinkedIn in December 2020</a>. A long-term fix was “never a priority” for the company, he wrote. “Customers are boned and sadly it’s been that way for years (which again, sickens me),” Harris said in the post.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="118.0">In the months and years following the SolarWinds attack, Microsoft took a number of actions to mitigate the SAML risk. One of them was a way to efficiently detect fallout from such a hack. The advancement, however, was available only as part of a paid add-on product known as Sentinel.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="119.0">The lack of such a detection, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/non-interactive-logins-minimizing-the-blind-spot/ba-p/2287932">the company said in a blog post</a>, had been a “blind spot.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>“Microsoft Is Back on Top”</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="120.0">In early 2021, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence called Brad Smith to testify about SolarWinds.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="121.0">Although Microsoft’s product had played a central role in the attack, Smith seemed unflappable, his easy and conversational tone a reflection of the relationships he had spent decades building on Capitol Hill. Without referencing notes or reading from a script, as some of his counterparts did, he confidently deflected questions about Microsoft’s role. Laying the responsibility with the government, he said that in the lead-up to the attack, the authentication flaw “was not prioritized by the intelligence community as a risk, nor was it flagged by civilian agencies or other entities in the security community as a risk that should be elevated” over other cybersecurity priorities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="122.0">Smith also downplayed the significance of the Golden SAML weakness, <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-bsmith-022321.pdf">saying it was used in just 15% of the 60 cases</a> that Microsoft had identified by that point. At the same time, he acknowledged that, “without question, these are not the only victims who had data observed or taken.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="123.0">When Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida <a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/hearings/open-hearing-hearing-hack-us-networks-foreign-adversary">pointedly asked him</a> what Microsoft had done to address Golden SAML in the years before the attack, Smith responded by listing a handful of steps that customers could have taken to protect themselves. His suggestions included purchasing an antivirus product like Microsoft Defender and securing devices with another Microsoft product called Intune.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.0">“The reality is any organization that did all five of those things, if it was breached, it in all likelihood suffered almost no damage,” Smith said.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="124.1">Neither Rubio nor any other senator pressed further.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="125.0">Ultimately, Microsoft <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3243483/department-names-vendors-to-provide-joint-warfighting-cloud-capability/">won a piece</a> of the Defense Department’s multibillion-dollar cloud business, sharing it with Amazon, Google and Oracle.</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="127.0">Since December 2020, when the SolarWinds attack was made public, Microsoft’s stock has soared 106%, largely on the runaway success of Azure and artificial intelligence products like ChatGPT, where the company is the largest investor. “Microsoft Is Back on Top,” proclaimed Fortune, which featured Nadella on the cover of its most recent issue.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="128.0">In September 2021, just 10 months after the discovery of SolarWinds, the paperback edition of Smith’s book, “Tools and Weapons,” was published. In it, Smith praised Microsoft’s response to the attack. The MSRC, Smith wrote, “quickly activated its incident response plan” and the company at large “mobilized more than 500 employees to work full time on every aspect of the attack.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="129.0">In the new edition, Smith also reflected on his congressional testimony on SolarWinds. The hearings, he wrote, “examined not only what had happened but also what steps needed to be taken to prevent such attacks in the future.” He didn’t mention it in the book, but that certainly would include the long-term alternative that Morowczynski first promised to Harris in 2017. The company began offering it <a href="https://redmondmag.com/articles/2022/02/14/azure-active-directory-certificate-based-authentication-preview.aspx">in 2022</a>.</p>
