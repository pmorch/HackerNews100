<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
  <p>I commented on Lobsters that <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/bzg0kq/how_do_you_deploy_10_seconds#c_ihmo1o"><code>/tmp</code> is usually a bad idea</a>,
which caused some surprise. I suppose <code>/tmp</code> security bugs were common
in the 1990s when I was learning Unix, but they are pretty rare now so
I can see why less grizzled hackers might not be familiar with the
problems.</p>
<p>I guess that’s some kind of success, but sadly the fixes have left
behind a lot of scar tissue because they didn’t address the underlying
problem: <code>/tmp</code> should not exist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a bad idea because it’s shared global mutable state that
crosses security boundaries. There’s a ton of complexity at all
levels of unix (filesystems, kernel APIs, libc, shell, admin
scripts) that only exists as a workaround for the dangers caused by
making <code>/tmp</code> shared.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="sticky-bit" href="#sticky-bit">sticky bit</a></h2>
<p>I think the earliest and lowest-level workaround is the sticky bit.</p>
<p>The sticky bit is mode bit 01000 in <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/chmod.html">unix file permissions</a>. It
is printed as the <code>t</code> instead of <code>x</code> in <code>rwt</code>.</p>
<pre><code>    drwxrwxrwt  5 root  wheel  160 Oct 22 10:22 /tmp/
</code></pre>
<p>Originally in the 1970s the sticky bit was invented to speed up
frequently-used programs such as the shell: the sticky bit indicated
to the kernel that the executable file should stick in core. This
functionality was made obsolete in the 1980s by filesystem page
caches.</p>
<p>The sticky bit was re-used to mean something else on directories, to
fix a security problem with <code>/tmp</code>.</p>
<p>On unix, permission to delete a file depends on write access to the
directory containing the file, independent of the file’s own
permissions.</p>
<p>So if a directory (such as <code>/tmp</code>) is world-writable, anyone can delete
any file in it.</p>
<p>This means <code>/tmp</code> was vulnerable to all sorts of accidental or malicious
trouble caused by users deleting each others’ files.</p>
<p>To fix this, <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=sticky">a file in a sticky directory may only be removed or
renamed by a user if the user has write permission for the directory
and the user is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or
the super-user</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="tmp-stupidity-in-c" href="#tmp-stupidity-in-c">tmp stupidity in C</a></h2>
<p>POSIX used to provide 5 (five!) ways to create a temporary file, three
of which (most of them!) you must never use and which have
subsequently been deprecated – except the do-not-use footgun <code>tmpnam</code>
which is still part of the C standard. Two more safe functions have
subsequently been added to support more complicated situations.</p>
<ul>
<li>bad: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/mktemp.html">mktemp</a>, <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/tempnam.html">tempnam</a>, <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/tmpnam.html">tmpnam</a></li>
<li>ok: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/mkstemp.html">mkstemp</a>, <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/tmpfile.html">tmpfile</a></li>
<li>new: <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/mkstemp.html">mkdtemp, mkostemp, mkstemp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are so many dangerous API design problems in these functions!
I’m not going to waste time roasting them in detail because I can
cover the important points by discussing …</p>
<h2><a name="mkstemp-and-mkdtemp" href="#mkstemp-and-mkdtemp">mkstemp and mkdtemp</a></h2>
<p>The purpose of all these functions is to create a temporary file (or
directory) that doesn’t collide with other concurrent activity.</p>
<p>When you are creating a file in <code>/tmp</code> the risk is that another
malicious user can make you open a file under their control. To avoid
this vulnerability, you (or rather <code>mkstemp</code>) must:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Generate an <em>unpredictable</em> filename.</p>
<p>It isn’t enough for the filename to be unique, it must contain
sufficient <em>secure</em> randomness that an adversary can’t win a race
and interfere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open the file with <code>O_CREAT</code> | <code>O_EXCL</code>.</p>
<p>This ensures the file has not already been created by another
friendly or malicious process, without any time-of-check /
time-of-use vulnerabilities. And it ensures that the file isn’t a
symlink pointing somewhere an attacker wants you to accidentally
corrupt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Retry if open fails with <code>EEXIST</code>.</p>
<p>Together with the randomness in the name, this avoids
denial-of-service vulnerabilites.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is intricate and not entirely obvious, as you can tell from all
the previous failed attempts at functions that didn’t create temporary
files safely.</p>
<h2><a name="mktemp-in-shell" href="#mktemp-in-shell">mktemp in shell</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=mktemp">mktemp(1)</a> command is a wrapper around mkstemp(3). (Slightly
confusingly it isn’t a wrapper around mktemp(3) because that would be
unsafe.) It was introduced by OpenBSD and it’s widely supported though
it isn’t yet in POSIX. Its manual page includes a nice rationale:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>mktemp</code> utility is provided to allow shell scripts to safely use
temporary files. Traditionally, many shell scripts take the name of
the program with the pid as a suffix and use that as a temporary
file name. This kind of naming scheme is predictable and the race
condition it creates is easy for an attacker to win. A safer, though
still inferior, approach is to make a temporary directory using
the same naming scheme. While this does allow one to guarantee that
a temporary file will not be subverted, it still allows a simple
denial of service attack. For these reasons it is suggested that
<code>mktemp</code> be used instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although shell scripts can’t avoid using the temporary file by name,
mktemp(1) is safe because it creates the file securely and an attacker
can’t interfere with it after that point. It’s OK to re-open a file
that you know is yours.</p>
<h2><a name="tmp-cleanup" href="#tmp-cleanup">tmp cleanup</a></h2>
<p>The last item on my list of regrets is “admin scripts”, an oblique
reference to <code>/tmp</code> cleanup jobs.</p>
<p>By its nature <code>/tmp</code> tends to accumulate junk, so it was common to have
cron jobs that would delete old files. (Less common now that computers
are much bigger.)</p>
<p>These scripts tended to have problems with time-of-check / time-of-use
vulnerabilities, careless handling of symlinks, and pulling the rug
out from under long-running programs that foolishly used <code>/tmp</code>. (Lots
more reasons these scripts are now less common!)</p>
<h2><a name="tmp-remedy" href="#tmp-remedy">tmp remedy</a></h2>
<p>So I’ve spent dozens of paragraphs outlining bugs and complications
related to <code>/tmp</code>. All of them could have been avoided if <code>/tmp</code> did not
exist, and everything would have been simpler as a result.</p>
<p>So where should temporary files go, if not in <code>/tmp</code>?</p>
<p>There should be per-user temporary directories. In fact, on modern
systems there <em>are</em> per-user temporary directories! But this solution
came several decades too late.</p>
<p>If you have per-user <code>$TMPDIR</code> then temporary filenames can safely be
created using the simple mechanisms described in the mktemp(1)
rationale or used by the old deprecated C functions. There’s no need
to defend against an attacker who doesn’t have sufficient access to
mount an attack! There’s no need for sticky directories because there
aren’t any world-writable directories.</p>
<p>There’s a minor wrinkle that setuid programs would have to be more
careful about how they create temporary files, but setuid programs
have to be more careful about everything.</p>
<h2><a name="tmp-rationale" href="#tmp-rationale">tmp rationale</a></h2>
<p>So why wasn’t per-user <code>$TMPDIR</code> a thing back in the day?</p>
<p>Probably the main reason was path-dependence: <code>/tmp</code> was created and in
wide use before its problems became apparent, at which point it was
difficult to deprecate.</p>
<p>There are reasons 1990-ish-you didn’t want <code>$TMPDIR</code> to be in your
home directory:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>$HOME</code> might be on NFS so a local <code>$TMPDIR</code> might be faster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$TMPDIR</code> can be a way to get workspace beyond your disk quota</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>$HOME</code> might be on a filesystem that doesn’t support named pipes,
so your X11 and SSH agent sockets live in <code>$TMPDIR</code> instead</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fix, way back when, should have been for login(8) to create a
per-user temporary directory in a sensible place before it drops
privilege, and set <code>$TMPDIR</code> so the user’s shell and child processes
can find it.</p>
<p>Oh well, think of all the excitement we would have missed if insecure
temporary file vulnerabilites had not been a thing!</p>

<p>It’s October 2024 and I’m sitting here in my creative maker studio, wearing a bright t-shirt that excitedly bellows “MQTT 25”! To my left is a top-end Bambu Lab X1C 3D printer, that uses MQTT internally for communication.

<p>The co-creator of MQTT is my good friend <a href="https://stanford-clark.com/">Andy Stanford-Clark</a>, who <a href="https://mastodon.iow.social/@andysc/113349599886653118" data-type="link" data-id="https://mastodon.iow.social/@andysc/113349599886653118">announced the event</a> on Mastodon:</p>

    </blockquote>


<p>I’m not going to post a complete history of the past two (plus) decades of this technology, but for those just joining… what the heck is MQTT, and… how did I come to be involved?</p>



<h3>Connecting things</h3>



<p>Here’s the tl;dr – MQTT is a network protocol that was originally designed to enable small devices on lightweight or patchy networks (we’re going back to the late 1990s, remember!) to publish and collect / receive data. Say you’re an environmental monitoring device in a far-flung area where there’s occasional network coverage, and you have limited power available – it’s important that you use power and network bandwidth and availability efficiently, to send sensor information (in a minimal, but useful, format) to a larger system. MQTT is a <em>great</em> fit here. It turns out that a highly optimised and efficient protocol like this, also scales up extremely well. As networks got better (faster, more stable, and more widespread), and as we moved through a period of greater access to efficient computing devices for edge-of-network, home automation, and in-your-pocket use cases, MQTT remained highly valuable. The simplicity of the protocol is very powerful.</p>



<h3>What’s my connection?</h3>



<p>In 2001 I got my second full-time job after university, and joined IBM as an IT Specialist – a consultant working with IBM software, primarily on-site with their customers, implementing what we used to call business integration, message queueing, application connectivity, middleware etc.</p>



<p>Within a few years I was pretty experienced within the IBM middleware portfolio – I’d been helping to implement banking payment systems and other projects using “full size” IBM MQ. Around that time, IBM was starting a marketing push around something they would <a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2010/08/05/mqtt-the-smarter-planet-protocol/" data-type="link" data-id="https://andypiper.co.uk/2010/08/05/mqtt-the-smarter-planet-protocol/">ultimately call Smarter Planet</a>. I’d gravitated towards IBM’s fantastic Hursley Lab as an engineering hub in the UK, the home of MQ and also, the base of Andy Stanford-Clark, who was one of my mentors. A bunch of us from there started to hack with this MQTT thing, which was at that time externally published as a protocol, but little-known or implemented outside of IBM. I became something of an accidental advocate for MQTT, and looking back now, I count that as my first “developer relations / developer advocacy” role, even though it was informal and my day job was something different<sup data-fn="a4ddc54c-fc92-4602-8814-8d2f1f904878"><a href="#a4ddc54c-fc92-4602-8814-8d2f1f904878" id="a4ddc54c-fc92-4602-8814-8d2f1f904878-link">1</a></sup>.</p>



<p>Looking back in this blog, I was <a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/tag/mqtt/" data-type="link" data-id="https://andypiper.co.uk/tag/mqtt/">posting about MQTT</a> regularly back through ~2009-2011, which was really the period where we started to make progress in socialising the protocol beyond smaller IBM implementations. We went from having a small number of message brokers – the enterprise and very expensive IBM WebSphere Message Broker, and the excellent but closed-source microbroker and, also closed-source but freely-available Really Small Message Broker from the labs – to <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@ralight">Roger Light</a>‘s creation of the Open Source <a href="https://mosquitto.org/">Mosquitto</a>, which remains one of the more widely-used free implementations out there<sup data-fn="b505d264-351c-4964-b722-476750d44bf3"><a href="#b505d264-351c-4964-b722-476750d44bf3" id="b505d264-351c-4964-b722-476750d44bf3-link">2</a></sup>. I was one of the folks who had the keys to the MQTT Twitter account and community website, and one of my goals as developer advocate was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL950E08D350673410" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL950E08D350673410">sharing</a> and promoting all of the cool ways that folks were using the protocol<sup data-fn="03445776-7e30-4460-9d06-13f0857337db"><a href="#03445776-7e30-4460-9d06-13f0857337db" id="03445776-7e30-4460-9d06-13f0857337db-link">3</a></sup>.</p>



<p>In 2011 I was <a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2012/03/10/paho-gets-started/" data-type="link" data-id="https://andypiper.co.uk/2012/03/10/paho-gets-started/">heavily involved</a> in <a href="https://andypiper.co.uk/2011/11/04/mqtt-goes-free-a-personal-qa/" data-type="link" data-id="https://andypiper.co.uk/2011/11/04/mqtt-goes-free-a-personal-qa/">IBM’s donation of its MQTT implementations to the Eclipse community</a>, as the Eclipse Paho project. After I left IBM in 2012, I continued to have a strong connection, and I played a role on the Paho project through my next job at Cloud Foundry; but, after I joined Twitter in 2014 I needed to step back from formal involvement. That was the time at which MQTT went through formal standardisation, at OASIS and ISO/IEC.</p>



<h3>Success and growth</h3>



<p>It is not my place or part in the story to talk in depth about the different companies that have thrived in the past 15 years, and helped to make MQTT as ubiquitous as it has become, but it is truly one of my most proud personal achievements, helping this technology grow to beyond the walls of IBM – into an open protocol success story. Today, 25 years on, it is in many things and places you may not realise – hobbyists and makers use it, it’s used in (for example) Dyson’s air filters and their associated apps, in 3D printer control systems, in home alerting, and across industry and manufactuing. It’s almost certain that more than one of the apps on your phone right now, is using MQTT somewhere in the stack.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="http://cr.yp.to/writing/ieee.html">http://cr.yp.to/writing/ieee.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41912625">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/djb.html">D. J. Bernstein</a>
<br><a href="http://cr.yp.to/writing.html">Notes on writing papers</a>
<h2>Don't publish with IEEE!</h2>
Before you read this page,
you should understand
(1) authors putting papers online to benefit readers,
(2) commercial publishers using copyright to limit #1,
and
(3) authors dedicating papers to the public domain as one way to stop #2.
I have a
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/bib/online.html">separate page</a>
discussing these issues.
<p>
It turns out that, in response to #3,
IEEE is overriding its scientific referees
and flat-out refusing to accept public-domain papers.
</p><p>
I learned about this from a UIC graduate student
who had submitted a paper to a conference
whose proceedings were to be published by IEEE.
After the paper was accepted,
IEEE notified the student that a copyright transfer was required.
The student declared his intention to put his paper into the public domain.
The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
threatened the student with non-publication of the paper.
Faced with this pressure,
the student capitulated and, rather than eliminating the copyright,
transferred it to IEEE.
</p><p>
When I heard about this incident,
I asked the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
to explain his overall assertion
that IEEE refuses to publish public-domain papers:
</p><blockquote>
Works from government authors are in the public domain, and I find it
difficult to believe that IEEE refuses papers from government authors. I
see that the IEEE Copyright Form has a special section for government
authors.
<p>
How many public-domain papers does IEEE actually publish? Surely you
have the exact figures for each year. Is it fair to say that, in fact,
IEEE publishes many public-domain papers?
</p></blockquote>
The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
refused to answer these questions.
<p>
In his messages to the student,
the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
had asserted that ``IEEE needs to be the owner of the work ... by assignment.''
Obviously this is impossible for papers in the public domain:
copyright assignment isn't possible when the copyright no longer exists.
I looked at the IEEE Copyright Policies
and found that public-domain papers were clearly exempted
from the copyright-transfer requirement:
</p><blockquote>
Such transfer shall be a necessary requirement for publication,
EXCEPT for material in the public domain.
</blockquote>
(Emphasis added.)
I asked the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
to explain the contradiction between his statements
and the IEEE Copyright Policies.
His only response was the rather idiotic comment that
``IEEE policy requires authors to submit an IEEE Copyright Form
in order for publication to occur'';
needless to say, the IEEE Copyright Form
is written by the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights office.
<p>
In his messages to the student,
the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
had explained IEEE's alleged need for being ``the owner of the work''
as follows:
``We can put it into the Xplore database and license it to others as one
of our ongoing electronic distribution of IEEE publications.''
I asked the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager for clarification:
</p><blockquote>
When there is no copyright, IEEE is completely free to do these things.
It can distribute the work as widely as it wants, and it can authorize
others to do so. All IEEE gets out of a copyright is the power to _stop_
the distribution of the information.
<p>
If the public domain is a problem for IEEE, how does IEEE publish works
from government authors? Do you have a better explanation for your
desire to be the owner of the work? Is it fair to say that IEEE actually
_does_ want to stop the distribution of scientific information?
</p></blockquote>
Naturally, the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager refused to respond.
<p>
The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager
had also devoted some effort to trying to fool the student
into believing that papers could not simply be dedicated to the public domain.
I asked for clarification:
</p><blockquote>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has commented that ``It is well
settled that rights gained under the Copyright Act may be abandoned.''
The standard way to abandon copyright is by a clear written dedication
of the work to the public domain. One example of a public-domain
dedication is http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain; surely
you're aware of attorney Lawrence Lessig's Creative Commons effort.
<p>
You stated that ``there is a specific legal process for placing your
work in the PD.'' When the student asked you for details, you refused to
answer. Instead you said that you were ``dubious about the idea of
simply declaring one's intention to inject a work into the public
domain,'' and that IEEE needed to be able to ``prove'' its rights.
</p><p>
If IEEE has trouble ``proving'' its rights to publish a public-domain
paper, then how does IEEE ``prove'' alleged authorship of a paper whose
copyright is allegedly transferred, and how does IEEE ``prove'' an
allegation of government employment? Is the ``legal process'' you
mentioned something more than making a clear written dedication of the
work to the public domain? If so, what exactly is the process? Why
didn't you answer the student's question regarding this process? Is it
fair to say that the IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Office is trying
to intimidate authors into transferring copyright to IEEE?
</p></blockquote>
The IEEE Intellectual Property Rights Manager refused to respond.
<p>
The bottom line is that IEEE
is refusing to accept public-domain papers
except from government authors.
IEEE has no justification for this position.
IEEE's action is a blatant attempt to maintain control
over papers that would otherwise have been freely available to the public.
Unfortunately, at least in this student's case,
the attempt succeeded:
a paper that was accepted by IEEE's scientific referees,
and that would have been in the public domain without IEEE's pressure,
is now part of IEEE's copyright portfolio.
</p><p>
Consequently, I am blacklisting IEEE here.
I recommend that authors find another publisher.
Springer, for example,
tacitly (although quite unhappily) allows public-domain papers,
and AMS explicitly does not require a copyright transfer.

            <span>Abstract:</span>This report examines the fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), integrating theoretical insights with practical applications. It outlines the historical evolution of LLMs from traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to their pivotal role in AI. A comparison of fine-tuning methodologies, including supervised, unsupervised, and instruction-based approaches, highlights their applicability to different tasks. The report introduces a structured seven-stage pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs, spanning data preparation, model initialization, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment. Emphasis is placed on managing imbalanced datasets and optimization techniques. Parameter-efficient methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Half Fine-Tuning are explored for balancing computational efficiency with performance. Advanced techniques such as memory fine-tuning, Mixture of Experts (MoE), and Mixture of Agents (MoA) are discussed for leveraging specialized networks and multi-agent collaboration. The report also examines novel approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which align LLMs with human preferences, alongside pruning and routing optimizations to improve efficiency. Further sections cover validation frameworks, post-deployment monitoring, and inference optimization, with attention to deploying LLMs on distributed and cloud-based platforms. Emerging areas such as multimodal LLMs, fine-tuning for audio and speech, and challenges related to scalability, privacy, and accountability are also addressed. This report offers actionable insights for researchers and practitioners navigating LLM fine-tuning in an evolving landscape.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">LTESniffer - An Open-source LTE Downlink/Uplink Eavesdropper</h2><a id="user-content-ltesniffer---an-open-source-lte-downlinkuplink-eavesdropper" aria-label="Permalink: LTESniffer - An Open-source LTE Downlink/Uplink Eavesdropper" href="#ltesniffer---an-open-source-lte-downlinkuplink-eavesdropper"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>LTESniffer</strong> is An Open-source LTE Downlink/Uplink Eavesdropper</p>
<p dir="auto">It first decodes the Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) to obtain the Downlink Control Informations (DCIs) and Radio Network Temporary Identifiers (RNTIs) of all active users. Using decoded DCIs and RNTIs, LTESniffer further decodes the Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) and Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH) to retrieve uplink and downlink data traffic.</p>
<p dir="auto">LTESniffer supports an API with three functions for security applications and research. Many LTE security research assumes
a passive sniffer that can capture privacy-related packets on the air. However, non of the current open-source sniffers satisfy their requirements as they cannot decode protocol packets in PDSCH and PUSCH. We developed a proof-of-concept security API that supports three tasks that were proposed by previous works: 1) Identity mapping, 2) IMSI collecting, and 3) Capability profiling.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please refer to our <a href="https://syssec.kaist.ac.kr/pub/2023/wisec2023_tuan.pdf" rel="nofollow">paper</a> for more details.</p>

<p dir="auto">LTESniffer is a tool that can capture the LTE wireless messages that are sent between a cell tower and smartphones connected to it. LTESniffer supports capturing the messages in both directions, from the tower to the smartphones, and from the smartphones back to the cell tower.</p>
<p dir="auto">LTESniffer <strong>CANNOT DECRYPT</strong> encrypted messages between the cell tower and smartphones. It can be used for analyzing unencrypted parts of the communication between the cell tower and smartphones. For example, for encrypted messages, it can allow the user to analyze unencrypted parts, such as headers in MAC and physical layers. However, those messages sent in plaintext can be completely analyzable. For example, the broadcast messages sent by the cell tower, or the messages at the beginning of the connection are completely visible.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ethical Consideration</h2><a id="user-content-ethical-consideration" aria-label="Permalink: Ethical Consideration" href="#ethical-consideration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The main purpose of LTESniffer is to support security and analysis research on the cellular network. Due to the collection of uplink-downlink user data, any use of LTESniffer must follow the local regulations on sniffing the LTE traffic. We are not responsible for any illegal purposes such as intentionally collecting user privacy-related information.</p>

LTESniffer successfully achieved real-time decoding when deployed on an Intel i7-9700K PC, decoding traffic from a base station with 150 active users.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>The following hardware is recommended</strong></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Intel i7 CPU with at least 8 physical cores</li>
<li>At least 16Gb RAM</li>
<li>256 Gb SSD storage</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">SDR</h3><a id="user-content-sdr" aria-label="Permalink: SDR" href="#sdr"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">LTESniffer requires different SDR for its uplink and downlink sniffing modes.</p>
<p dir="auto">To sniff only downlink traffic from the base station, LTESniffer is compatible with most SDRs that are supported by the srsRAN library (for example, USRP or BladeRF). The SDR should be connected to the PC via a USB 3.0 port. Also, it should be equipped with GPSDO and two RX antennas to decode downlink messages in transmission modes 3 and 4.</p>
<p dir="auto">On the other hand, to sniff uplink traffic from smartphones to base stations, LTESniffer needs to listen to two different frequencies (Uplink and Downlink) concurrently. To solve this problem, LTESniffer supports two options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Using a single USRP X310. USRP X310 has two Local Oscillators (LOs) for 2 RX channels, which can turn each RX channel to a distinct Uplink/Downlink frequency. To use this option, please refer to the <code>main</code> branch of LTESniffer.</li>
<li>Using 2 USRP B-Series. LTESniffer utilizes 2 USRP B-series (B210/B200) for uplink and downlink separately. It achieves synchronization between 2 USRPs by using GPSDO for clock source and time reference. To use this option, please refer to the <code>LTESniffer-multi-usrp</code> branch of LTESniffer and its <a href="https://github.com/SysSec-KAIST/LTESniffer/tree/LTESniffer-multi-usrp">README</a>.</li>

<p dir="auto">The effective range for sniffing uplink is limited in LTESniffer due to the capability of the RF front-end of the hardware (i.e. SDR). The uplink signal power from UE is significantly weaker compared to the downlink signal because UE is a handheld device that optimizes battery usage, while the eNB uses sufficient power to cover a large area. To successfully capture the uplink traffic, LTESniffer can increase the strength of the signal power by i) being physically close to the UE, or ii) improving the signal reception capability with specialized hardware, such as a directional antenna, dedicated RF front-end, and signal amplifier.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2><a id="user-content-faq" aria-label="Permalink: FAQ" href="#faq"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Q:</strong> Is it mandatory to use GPSDO with the USRP in order to run LTESniffer? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> GPSDO is useful for more stable synchronization. However, for downlink sniffing mode, LTESniffer still can synchronize with the LTE signal to decode the packets without GPSDO. For uplink sniffing mode, GPSDO is only required when using 2 USRP B-series, as it is the time and clock reference sources for synchrozation between uplink and downlink channels. Another uplink SDR option, using a single USRP X310, does not require GPSDO.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q:</strong> For downlink traffic, can I use a cheaper SDR? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> Technically, any SDRs supported by srsRAN library such as Blade RF can be used to run LTESniffer in the downlink sniffing mode. However, we only tested the downlink sniffing function of LTESniffer with USRP B210 and X310.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q:</strong> Is it illegal to use LTESniffer to sniff the LTE traffic? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> You should have to check the local regulations on sniffing (unencrypted) LTE traffic. Another way to test LTESniffer is setting up a personal LTE network by using <a href="https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_4G">srsRAN</a> - an open-source LTE implementation in a Faraday cage.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q:</strong> Can LTESniffer be used to view the content of messages between two users? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> One can see only the "unencrypted" part of the messages. Note that the air traffic between the base station and users is mostly encrypted.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Q:</strong> Is there any device identity exposed in plaintext in the LTE network? <br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, literature shows that there are multiple identities exposed, such as TMSI, GUTI, IMSI, and RNTI. Please refer to the academic literature for more details. e.g. <a href="https://syssec.kaist.ac.kr/pub/2022/sec22summer_bae.pdf" rel="nofollow">Watching the Watchers: Practical Video Identification Attack in LTE Networks</a></p>

All three will roll out next week with the release of iOS 18.1, and they <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24241960/apple-airpods-pro-2-otc-hearing-aid-health-industry">could mark a watershed moment</a> for hearing health awareness. Apple is about to instantly turn the world’s most popular earbuds into an over-the-counter hearing aid.</p><p>That also means we’re about to enter an era where we’ll need to get comfortable with people wearing earbuds at all times. There’s a perception that leaving your earbuds in while talking with other people is rude. Transparency mode in many of today’s earbuds sounds totally natural and lifelike, yet I still constantly remove my buds to show someone they’ve got my undivided attention. That way of thinking has to change when popular earbuds start pulling double duty as hearing aids. It’s a powerful way to reduce the stigma that’s all too common with hearing aids, but this shift will take time.</p><p>Over the last several days, I’ve been able to preview Apple’s hearing health features. At times, the experience has been emotionally intense. I’m someone who grew up with a Discman and iPod basically attached to my hip, and I’ve been to countless concerts over the decades. I also haven’t seen an audiologist since 2018 or so. That’s anything but unusual; Apple says 80 percent of adults in the US haven’t had their hearing checked in at least five years. Putting a test right on your iPhone is a great way to improve that trend.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="Hands-on photos of Apple’s AirPods Pro hearing health features." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25687446/DSC_1034_Enhanced_NR.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>The AirPods Pro 2 are transforming into something much more than wireless earbuds.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>Prevention: hearing protection</h3></p><p>Did you know there are people who’ve already been <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-used-airpods-pro-instead-of-ear-plugs-at-a-concert-heres-what-happened">replacing earplugs with the AirPods Pro</a> at concerts? Until this fall, Apple had never endorsed such a use case or advertised its earbuds as hearing protection devices. The company knew people were doing it but kept quiet on the subject. </p><p>That’s now changed. With iOS 18.1 and the soon-to-be-released AirPods firmware update, the AirPods Pro 2 will offer hearing protection at all times across noise cancellation, transparency, and adaptive audio modes. There’s no “concert mode” or a specific setting to toggle. You can think of this as an expansion of the loud sound reduction option that was already in place. Hearing protection is on by default, and Apple says “an all-new multiband high dynamic range algorithm” helps to preserve the natural sound of concerts and other live events.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A chart that shows the effectiveness of Apple’s hearing protection in the AirPods Pro 2." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/376x360/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/384x368/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/415x398/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/480x460/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/540x517/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/640x613/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/750x719/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/828x793/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/1080x1035/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/1200x1150/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/1440x1380/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/1920x1839/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/2048x1962/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/2400x2299/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1812x1736/2400x2299/filters:focal(906x868:907x869):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690977/Screenshot_2024_10_21_at_5.08.27_AM.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>This chart shows the effectiveness of Apple’s hearing protection across the different sound modes of the AirPods Pro 2.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Apple</cite></p></div></div><p>Which listening mode you’ll use for concerts comes down to personal preference. I’ve found adaptive audio works well since it lets you customize whether you prefer more noise cancellation or more passthrough. But even in full transparency mode, some level of hearing protection is active. The more noise cancellation that’s applied, the longer you can remain in relatively loud environments. </p><p>There are limits to what the AirPods Pro 2 can handle; Apple’s hearing protection isn’t cut out for extremely loud, sudden noises like gunfire, fireworks, or a jackhammer. Sustained noises over 110dBA are also too much for the earbuds. Some clubs and concerts can definitely exceed that threshold, so be aware.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo of a person wearing Apple’s AirPods Pro 2." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25688614/DSC_1043_Enhanced_NR.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>The AirPods Pro aren’t as discreet as some hearing aids, but their popularity and ubiquity could help reduce stigma.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><h3>Awareness: the Apple hearing test</h3></p><p>You’ll need a quiet space when taking Apple’s hearing test. Before getting started, your iPhone will do a quick analysis of ear tip fit and environmental noise to ensure you’re good to go. All of these hearing health features are calibrated for Apple’s stock silicone tips, so if you’re using aftermarket third-party tips (including foam), there’s no guarantee you’ll get the optimal experience. Once the test begins, you just tap the screen whenever you hear any of the three-beep tone sequences. </p><p>There are a few key things to know about Apple’s hearing test. For one, it’s designed so that you can’t predict or game it. The test can play any frequency at any time, so no two are the same. Apple tests your left ear first, and here’s something I wish I’d known going in: it’s <em>completely normal</em> to hear nothing at all for several seconds at a time. It was in those moments, when five, six, or even 10 seconds would pass without an obvious tone sequence, where I’d start feeling pretty anxious.&nbsp;</p><p>My best advice is to avoid wondering if you <em>should</em> be hearing something at a given moment and instead just focus on the tones as they come. Some can be incredibly faint. There are visual cues that let you know the test is still moving along even during silence — the most obvious one being a large circle that animates onscreen throughout the process. (You’ll also notice a progress dial for each ear that fills as you take it.) </p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A screenshot of Apple hearing test results." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/376x205/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/384x209/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/415x226/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/480x262/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/540x294/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/640x349/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/750x409/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/828x451/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/1080x589/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/1200x654/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/1440x785/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/1920x1046/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/2048x1116/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/2400x1308/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:1290x703/2400x1308/filters:focal(645x352:646x353):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690234/IMG_0041.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><div><figcaption><em>My left ear has a bit more hearing loss than my right.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>I took the test twice several days apart, and my results for both ears fall under “little to no hearing loss.” Having recently turned 40, I’ll take that.

This data is what’s used to configure the hearing aid feature. </p><p>Apple’s hearing test only takes about five minutes, but it felt like a <em>long</em> five minutes for me and everyone else I’ve let try it. Again, that’s probably because it’s been too long since many of us have done this. The second time wasn’t nearly as stressful. I can definitely see the hearing test having a viral moment on TikTok and other social media, which seems like a great thing for awareness all around. Hearing loss is incredibly common: 1.5 billion people around the world are living with some extent of it, according to the World Health Organization.</p><p><h3>Assistance: AirPods as hearing aids</h3></p><p>For those 18 years and older with mild to moderate hearing loss, the AirPods Pro 2 can now serve as a clinical-grade hearing aid. Once enabled, you can also toggle on a “Media Assist” setting that uses your hearing test results to optimize the sound of music, phone calls, and video content. </p><p>Within the settings menu, you can use sliders to fine-tune the hearing aid feature’s amplification, tone, and balance. These options are also accessible via Control Center on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Much like you can slide a finger on the AirPods Pro 2 stem to adjust volume, you can use that same gesture to control amplification when the hearing aid mode is active. You can only use the hearing aid feature when in transparency mode. Apple’s instructions for the hearing aid feature advise that it takes time — in some cases, weeks — for customers to get fully accustomed to the sound. </p><p>Jerry Saltz, the art critic at <em>New York </em>Magazine (and someone with diagnosed hearing loss), took Apple’s hearing test at our Manhattan office and was impressed in his brief time trying out the hearing aid feature. But no one has had access to it long enough for an in-depth assessment. I’m sure there’ll be detailed comparisons between the AirPods Pro 2 and existing OTC devices in the near future once iOS 18.1 is widely available.</p><div><div role="button" aria-label="Zoom" tabindex="0"><figure><div><p><span><img alt="A photo showing the hearing aid setting on an iPhone in a crowded bar." loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 1023px) 100vw, 744px" srcset="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/376x251/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 376w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/384x256/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 384w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/415x277/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 415w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/480x320/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 480w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/540x360/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 540w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/640x427/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 640w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/750x500/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 750w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/828x552/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 828w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1080x720/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 1080w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1200x800/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 1200w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1440x960/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 1440w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/1920x1280/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 1920w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2048x1365/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 2048w, https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg 2400w" src="https://duet-cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x0:2040x1360/2400x1600/filters:focal(1020x680:1021x681):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25690981/DSC_1024_Enhanced_NR_2.jpg" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></span></p></div></figure></div><p><figcaption><em>You can make hearing aid adjustments from the iOS settings menu.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Being able to use Apple’s $250 earbuds as a hearing aid is a huge deal for those who can benefit from this capability. That’s substantially less expensive than over-the-counter hearing aids from <a href="https://www.jabraenhance.com/product">Jabra</a>, <a href="https://hearing.electronics.sony.com/lp2_hearingaids">Sony</a>, and other brands. But the AirPods won’t be right for everyone. People with more severe hearing loss will still need to seek out other solutions (including those pricier products).

I’m all for that, even if it feels strange that hearing aid functionality has become the latest aspect of ecosystem lock-in. We spent a long time bemoaning the loss of the headphone jack. With advancements like this, and earbuds helping to improve so many people’s quality of life, we’re finally starting to see a worthwhile payoff. </p><p><em>Photography by Chris Welch / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://simplex.chat/blog/20241016-wired-attack-on-privacy.html">https://simplex.chat/blog/20241016-wired-attack-on-privacy.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41909941">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article">
<p><img src="https://simplex.chat/blog/images/20241016-wired-privacy.jpg" width="330"></p><p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/neo-nazis-flee-telegram-encrypted-app-simplex/">Wired article</a> by David Gilbert focusing on neo-Nazis moving to SimpleX Chat following the Telegram's changes in privacy policy is biased and misleading. By cherry-picking information from <a href="https://www.isdglobal.org/digital_dispatches/neo-nazi-accelerationists-seek-new-digital-refuge-amid-looming-telegram-crackdown/">the report</a> by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Wired fails to mention that SimpleX network design prioritizes privacy in order to protect human rights defenders, journalists, and everyday users who value their privacy — many people feel safer using SimpleX than non-private apps, being protected from strangers contacting them.</p>
<p>Yes, privacy-focused SimpleX network offers encryption and anonymity — that’s the point. To paint this as problematic solely because of who may use such apps misses the broader, critical context.</p>
<p>SimpleX’s true strength lies in protection of <a href="https://simplex.chat/blog/20240416-dangers-of-metadata-in-messengers.html">users' metadata</a>, which can reveal sensitive information about who is communicating, when, and how often. SimpleX protocols are designed to minimize metadata collection. For countless people, especially vulnerable groups, these features can be life-saving. Wired article ignores these essential protections, and overlooks the positive aspects of having such a unique design, as noted in the publication which <a href="https://www.maargentino.com/is-telegrams-privacy-shift-driving-extremists-toward-simplex/">they link to</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“SimpleX also has a significant advantage when it comes to protecting metadata — the information that can reveal who you’re talking to, when, and how often. SimpleX is designed with privacy at its core, minimizing the amount of metadata collected and ensuring that any temporary data necessary for functionality is not retained or linked to identifiable users.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both publications referenced by Wired also explore how SimpleX design actually hinders extremist groups from spreading propaganda or building large networks. SimpleX design restricts message visibility and file retention, making it far from ideal for those looking to coordinate large networks. Yet these important qualities are ignored by Wired in favor of fear-mongering about encryption — an argument we've seen before when apps like Signal <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/03/13/telegram-signal-apps-right-wing-extremism-islamic-state-terrorism-violence-europol-encrypted/">faced similar treatment</a>. Ironically, Wired just a month earlier encouraged its readers to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gadget-lab-podcast-657/">adopt encrypted messaging apps</a>, making its current stance even more contradictory.</p>
<p>The vilification of apps that offer critically important privacy, anonymity, and encryption must stop. That a small share of users may abuse these tools doesn’t justify broad criticism. Additionally, the lobbying for client-side scanning, which Wired’s article seems to indirectly endorse, is not only dangerous but goes against fundamental principles of free speech and personal security. We strongly oppose the use of private communications for any kind of monitoring, including AI training, which would undermine the very trust encryption is designed to build.</p>
<p>It’s alarming to see Wired not only criticize SimpleX for its strong privacy protections but also subtly blame the European Court of Human Rights for <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/15/echr_backdoor_encryption/">upholding basic human rights</a> by rejecting laws that would force encrypted apps to scan and hand over private messages before encryption. Wired writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>…European Court of Human Rights decision in February of this year ruled that forcing encrypted messaging apps to provide a backdoor to law enforcement was illegal. This decision undermined the EU’s controversial proposal that would potentially force encrypted messaging apps to scan all user content for identifiers of child sexual abuse material.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This commentary is both inappropriate and misguided — it plays into the hands of anti-privacy lobbyists attempting to criminalize access to private communications. Framing privacy and anonymity as tools for criminals ignores the reality that these protections are essential for millions of legitimate users, from activists to journalists, to ordinary citizens. Client-side scanning can't have any meaningful effect on reducing CSAM distribution, instead resulting in increase of crime and abuse when criminals get access to this data.</p>
<p>We need to correct this narrative. The real danger lies not in protecting communication, but in failing to do so. Privacy apps like SimpleX are crucial, not just for those resisting mass surveillance, but for everyone who values the right to communicate without fear of their conversations being monitored or misused. This is a right we must defend and incorporate into law, <a href="https://simplex.chat/blog/20240704-future-of-privacy-enforcing-privacy-standards.html">as we wrote before</a>.</p>
<p>Wired could have stood on the right side of this battle and helped normalize the demand for privacy, genuinely protecting people from criminals and from the exploitation of the increasingly AI-enabled mass surveillance. Instead they chose the path of spreading fear and uncertainty of encrypted messaging and tools that enable privacy and anonymity.</p>
<p>Spreading misinformation about privacy and security undermines trust in the tools that protect us, making it easier to justify more invasive surveillance measures that chip away at our civil liberties.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article"> <p>In the past 3 years, I’ve run over 300 interviews.  On average, I meet someone
new every 3-4 days to understand if they’re the right fit for an early-stage
startup.</p>
<p>I especially like capping interviews with an open-ended question that really
lets great candidates shine. One of my favorite now-retired questions is,
<a href="https://www.safegraph.com/blog/why-the-famous-peter-thiel-interview-question-is-so-predictive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">in Thielian fashion</a>:
“What’s something you’ve learned that you believe gives you an edge - something
that you’re almost surprised more people don’t know about?”</p>
<p>One of the all-time best answers I heard was this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you’re starting something new, the most important thing is knowing what to learn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Followed by unpacking an optimal learning flow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Very quickly identify what the foundational knowledge is.</li>
<li>Build a personal curriculum to become an expert and avoid the trap of
the <a href="https://daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">expert beginner</a>.</li>
<li>Sprint hard the first 15-20 hours to impress initial memory, then decelerate to a
more regular pace.</li>
</ol>
<p>#1 and #2 are common structured approaches to learning, whereas #3 is a
relatively novel interpretation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spaced repetition</a>.
But at a more meta level, the unexpected takeaway is the vast majority of people
likely haven’t updated their mental model for learning in decades. (Stop and
think for a moment on the last time you did this.)</p>
<p>Learning to learn is extremely high leverage. 40 hours at 25% efficiency is the
same as 12.5 hours at 80% efficiency. And it turns out that being <em>productively
honest</em> is one of the most effective and kindest things you can do
for yourself.</p> </article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p><span>O</span>ne afternoon in January 2011, <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~hussein.mourtada/">Hussein Mourtada</a> leapt onto his desk and started dancing. He wasn’t alone: Some of the graduate students who shared his Paris office were there, too. But he didn’t care. The mathematician realized that he could finally confirm a sneaking suspicion he’d first had while writing his doctoral dissertation, which he’d finished a few months earlier. He’d been studying special points, called singularities, where curves cross themselves or come to sharp turns. Now he had unexpectedly found what he’d been looking for, a way to prove that these singularities had a surprisingly deep underlying structure. Hidden within that structure were mysterious mathematical statements first written down a century earlier by a young Indian mathematician named Srinivasa Ramanujan. They had come to him in a dream.</p>
<p>Ramanujan brings life to the myth of the self-taught genius. He grew up poor and uneducated and did much of his research while isolated in southern India, barely able to afford food. In 1912, when he was 24, he began to send a series of letters to prominent mathematicians. These were mostly ignored, but one recipient, the English mathematician G.H. Hardy, corresponded with Ramanujan for a year and eventually persuaded him to come to England, smoothing the way with the colonial bureaucracies.</p>
<p>It became apparent to Hardy and his colleagues that Ramanujan could sense mathematical truths — could access entire worlds — that others simply could not. (Hardy, a mathematical giant in his own right, is said to have quipped that his greatest contribution to mathematics was the discovery of Ramanujan.) Before Ramanujan died in 1920 at the age of 32, he came up with thousands of elegant and surprising results, often without proof. He was fond of saying that his equations had been bestowed on him by the gods.</p>
<p>More than 100 years later, mathematicians are still trying to catch up to Ramanujan’s divine genius, as his visions appear again and again in disparate corners of the world of mathematics.</p>

<p>Ramanujan is perhaps most famous for coming up with partition identities, equations about the different ways you can break a whole number up into smaller parts (such as 7 = 5 + 1 + 1). In the 1980s, mathematicians began to find deep and surprising connections between these equations and other areas of mathematics: in statistical mechanics and the study of phase transitions, in knot theory and string theory, in number theory and representation theory and the study of symmetries.</p>
<p>Most recently, they’ve appeared in Mourtada’s work on curves and surfaces that are defined by algebraic equations, an area of study called algebraic geometry. Mourtada and his collaborators have spent more than a decade trying to better understand that link, and to exploit it to uncover rafts of brand-new identities that resemble those Ramanujan wrote down.</p>
<p>“It turned out that these kinds of results have basically occurred in almost every branch of mathematics. That’s an amazing thing,” said <a href="https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/OleWarnaar/">Ole Warnaar</a> of the University of Queensland in Australia. “It’s not just a happy coincidence. I don’t want to sound religious, but the mathematical god is trying to tell us something.”</p>
<h2><strong>New Worlds </strong></h2>
<p>Ramanujan’s mathematical prowess was obvious to those who knew him. Without formal training, he excelled; by the time he was in high school he had devoured advanced, though often outdated, textbooks, and was doing independent research on different kinds of numerical properties and patterns.</p>
<p>In 1904, he was granted a full scholarship to the Government Arts College in Kumbakonam, the small city where he had grown up, in what is now the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. But he ignored all subjects besides math and lost his scholarship within a year. He later enrolled in another university, this time in Madras (now Chennai), the provincial capital some 250 kilometers north. Again he flunked out.</p>

<p>He continued his research on his own for years, often while in poor health. During that time, he tutored students in math to support himself. Eventually he secured a job as a clerk at the Madras Port Trust in 1912. He pursued mathematics on the side and published some of his results in Indian journals.</p>
<p>Hoping to get some of his work into more prestigious and widely read publications, Ramanujan wrote letters to several British mathematicians, enclosing pages of findings for their review. “I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a university course,” he wrote, “but I am striking out a new path for myself.” Among the recipients was Hardy, an expert in number theory and analysis at the University of Cambridge.</p>

                            <p>Ramanujan’s first letter to G.H. Hardy included formulas (5), (6) and (7), strange nested fractions that Hardy said “defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before.”</p>

<p>Hardy was shocked at what he saw. Ramanujan had identified and then solved a number of continued fractions — expressions that can be written as infinite nests of fractions within fractions, such as:</p>
<figure>
    <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Ramanujan_Equation.svg" alt="" decoding="async" loading="lazy">    </p>
    </figure>

<p>They “defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like them before,” Hardy later wrote. “They must be true because, if they were not true, no one would have had the imagination to invent them.” The formulas, unproved, were so striking that they inspired Hardy to offer Ramanujan a fellowship at Cambridge. In 1914, Ramanujan arrived in England, and for the next five years he studied and collaborated with Hardy.</p>

<p>One of Ramanujan’s first tasks was to prove a general statement about his continued fractions. To do so, he needed to prove two other statements. But he couldn’t. Neither could Hardy, nor could any of the colleagues he reached out to.</p>
<p>It turned out that they didn’t need to. The statements had been proved 20 years earlier by a little-known English mathematician named L.J. Rogers. Rogers wrote poorly, and at the time the proofs were published no one paid any attention. (Rogers was content to do his research in relative obscurity, play piano, garden and apply his spare time to a variety of other pursuits.) Ramanujan uncovered this work in 1917, and the pair of statements later became known as the Rogers-Ramanujan identities.</p>
<p>Amid Ramanujan’s prodigious output, these statements stand out. They have carried through the decades and across nearly all of mathematics. They are the seeds that mathematicians continue to sow, growing brilliant new gardens seemingly wherever they fall.</p>
<p>Ramanujan fell ill and returned to India in 1919, where he died the next year. It would fall to others to explore the world his identities had revealed.</p>
<h2><strong>The Music of the Game</strong></h2>
<p>Hussein Mourtada grew up in the 1980s in Lebanon, in a small city called Baalbek. As a teenager, he didn’t like studying and preferred to play: soccer, billiards, basketball. Math, too. “It looked like a game,” he said. “And I liked playing.”</p>
<p>As an undergraduate at the Lebanese University in Beirut, he studied both law and mathematics, with an eye to a legal career. But he soon found that while he enjoyed the philosophical aspects of law, he did not enjoy it in practice. He turned his attention to math, where he was particularly drawn to the community. As a child, his teachers and classmates were what excited him about going to school, even though he often fell asleep during class. As a budding mathematician, “I had the impression that these are beautiful people,” he said. “They are honest. You need to be honest with yourself to be a mathematician. Otherwise, it doesn’t work.”</p>

<p>He moved to France for his doctorate and started to focus on algebraic geometry — the study of algebraic varieties, or shapes cut out by polynomial equations. These are equations that can be written as sums of variables raised to whole-number powers. A line, for instance, is cut out by the equation <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> = 0, a circle by <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> + <em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = 1, a figure eight by <em>x</em><sup>4</sup> = <em>x</em><sup>2</sup> − <em>y</em><sup>2</sup>. While the line and circle are completely smooth, the figure eight has a point where it intersects itself — a singularity.</p>
<p>It’s easy to spot singularities when you’re dealing with shapes that you can draw on a sheet of paper. But higher-dimensional algebraic varieties are far more complicated and impossible to visualize. Algebraic geometers are in the business of understanding their singularities, too.</p>
<p>They’ve developed all sorts of tools to do this. One dates back to the mathematician John Nash, who in the 1960s started studying related objects called arc spaces. Nash would take a point, or singularity, and define infinitely many short trajectories — little arcs — that passed through it. By looking at all these short trajectories together, he could test how smooth his variety was at that point. “If you want to see if it’s smooth, you want to pet it,” said <a href="https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Gleb.POGUDIN/">Gleb Pogudin</a> of the École Polytechnique in France.</p>
<p>In practical terms, an arc space provides an infinite collection of polynomial equations. “This is really the thing that Mourtada is expert in: understanding the meaning of those equations,” said <a href="https://webusers.imj-prg.fr/~bernard.teissier/">Bernard Teissier</a>, a colleague of Mourtada’s at the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu in Paris. “Because these equations can be very complicated. But they have a certain music to them. There is a lot of structure which governs the nature of these equations, and he’s just the person, I think, who best listens to this music and understands what it means.”</p>

<p>In William Faulkner’s 1938 nov­el <a href="https://amzn.to/3NwnMlg"><em>The Unvan­quished</em></a>, the implaca­ble Colonel Sar­toris takes dras­tic action to stop the elec­tion of a black Repub­li­can can­di­date to office after the Civ­il War, destroy­ing the bal­lots of black vot­ers and shoot­ing two North­ern car­pet­bag­gers. While such dra­mat­ic means of vot­er sup­pres­sion occurred often enough in the Recon­struc­tion South, tac­tics of elec­toral exclu­sion refined over time, such that by the mid-twen­ti­eth cen­tu­ry the Jim Crow South relied large­ly on near­ly impos­si­ble-to-pass lit­er­a­cy tests to impede free and fair elec­tions.</p>
<p>These tests, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/06/28/voting_rights_and_the_supreme_court_the_impossible_literacy_test_louisiana.html">writes Rebec­ca Onion at <em>Slate</em></a>, were “sup­pos­ed­ly applic­a­ble to both white and black prospec­tive vot­ers who couldn’t prove a cer­tain lev­el of edu­ca­tion” (typ­i­cal­ly up to the fifth grade). Yet they were “in actu­al­i­ty dis­pro­por­tion­ate­ly admin­is­tered to black vot­ers.”</p>


<p>Addi­tion­al­ly, many of the tests were rigged so that reg­is­trars could give poten­tial vot­ers an easy or a dif­fi­cult ver­sion, and could score them dif­fer­ent­ly as well. For exam­ple, the <a href="http://www.crmvet.org/info/lithome.htm">Vet­er­ans of the Civ­il Rights Move­ment</a> describes a test admin­is­tered in Alaba­ma that is so entire­ly sub­jec­tive that it mea­sures the registrar’s shrewd­ness and cun­ning more than any­thing else.</p>

<p>The test here from Louisiana con­sists of ques­tions so ambigu­ous that no one, what­ev­er their lev­el of edu­ca­tion, can divine a “right” or “wrong” answer to most of them. And yet, as the instruc­tions state, “one wrong answer denotes fail­ure of the test,” an impos­si­ble stan­dard for even a legit­i­mate exam. Even worse, vot­ers had only ten min­utes to com­plete the three-page, 30-ques­tion doc­u­ment. The Louisiana test dates from 1964, the year before the pas­sage of the <a href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/voting-rights-act">Vot­ing Rights Act</a>, which effec­tive­ly put an end to these bla­tant­ly dis­crim­i­na­to­ry prac­tices.</p>

<p dir="auto">Scalene is a high-performance CPU, GPU <em>and</em> memory profiler for
Python that does a number of things that other Python profilers do not
and cannot do.  It runs orders of magnitude faster than many other
profilers while delivering far more detailed information. It is also
the first profiler ever to incorporate AI-powered proposed
optimizations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">AI-powered optimization suggestions</h3><a id="user-content-ai-powered-optimization-suggestions" aria-label="Permalink: AI-powered optimization suggestions" href="#ai-powered-optimization-suggestions"></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Note</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">To enable AI-powered optimization suggestions, you need to enter an <a href="https://openai.com/api/" rel="nofollow">OpenAI key</a> in the box under "Advanced options". <em>Your account will need to have a positive balance for this to work</em> (check your balance at <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/usage" rel="nofollow">https://platform.openai.com/account/usage</a>).</p>

</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">Once you've entered your OpenAI key (see above), click on the lightning bolt (⚡) beside any line or the explosion (💥) for an entire region of code to generate a proposed optimization. Click on a proposed optimization to copy it to the clipboard.</p>

<p dir="auto">You can click as many times as you like on the lightning bolt or explosion, and it will generate different suggested optimizations. Your mileage may vary, but in some cases, the suggestions are quite impressive (e.g., order-of-magnitude improvements).</p>

    Using the Scalene VS Code Extension:
  </summary>
<p dir="auto">First, install <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EmeryBerger.scalene" rel="nofollow">the Scalene extension from the VS Code Marketplace</a> or by searching for it within VS Code by typing Command-Shift-X (Mac) or Ctrl-Shift-X (Windows). Once that's installed, click Command-Shift-P or Ctrl-Shift-P to open the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface" rel="nofollow">Command Palette</a>. Then select <b>"Scalene: AI-powered profiling..."</b> (you can start typing Scalene and it will pop up if it's installed). Run that and, assuming your code runs for at least a second, a Scalene profile will appear in a webview.</p>

<p dir="auto">Scalene has both a CLI and a web-based GUI <a href="http://plasma-umass.org/scalene-gui/" rel="nofollow">(demo here)</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By default, once Scalene has profiled your program, it will open a
tab in a web browser with an interactive user interface (all processing is done
locally). Hover over bars to see breakdowns of CPU and memory
consumption, and click on underlined column headers to sort the
columns. The generated file <code>profile.html</code> is self-contained and can be saved for later use.</p>

<li>
<p dir="auto">Scalene is <strong><em>fast</em></strong>. It uses sampling instead of instrumentation or relying on Python's tracing facilities. Its overhead is typically no more than 10-20% (and often less).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto">Scalene is <strong>accurate</strong>. We tested CPU profiler accuracy and found that Scalene is among the most accurate profilers, correctly measuring time taken.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CPU profiling</h3><a id="user-content-cpu-profiling" aria-label="Permalink: CPU profiling" href="#cpu-profiling"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Scalene <strong>separates out time spent in Python from time in native code</strong> (including libraries). Most Python programmers aren't going to optimize the performance of native code (which is usually either in the Python implementation or external libraries), so this helps developers focus their optimization efforts on the code they can actually improve.</li>
<li>Scalene <strong>highlights hotspots</strong> (code accounting for significant percentages of CPU time or memory allocation) in red, making them even easier to spot.</li>

Can I use Scalene with PyTest?
</summary>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! You can run it as follows (for example):</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>python3 -m scalene --- -m pytest your_test.py</code></p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Is there any way to get shorter profiles or do more targeted profiling?
</summary>
<p dir="auto"><strong>A:</strong> Yes! There are several options:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Use <code>--reduced-profile</code> to include only lines and files with memory/CPU/GPU activity.</li>
<li>Use <code>--profile-only</code> to include only filenames containing specific strings (as in, <code>--profile-only foo,bar,baz</code>).</li>
<li>Decorate functions of interest with <code>@profile</code> to have Scalene report <em>only</em> those functions.</li>
<li>Turn profiling on and off programmatically by importing Scalene profiler (<code>from scalene import scalene_profiler</code>) and then turning profiling on and off via <code>scalene_profiler.start()</code> and <code>scalene_profiler.stop()</code>. By default, Scalene runs with profiling on, so to delay profiling until desired, use the <code>--off</code> command-line option (<code>python3 -m scalene --off yourprogram.py</code>).</li>

<p>T-Mobile and AT&amp;T say US regulators should drop a plan to require unlocking of phones within 60 days of activation, claiming that locking phones to a carrier's network makes it possible to provide cheaper handsets to consumers. "If the Commission mandates a uniform unlocking policy, it is consumers—not providers—who stand to lose the most," T-Mobile alleged in an <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1017178290200/1">October 17 filing</a> with the Federal Communications Commission.</p>
<p>The proposed rule has support from consumer advocacy groups who say it will give users more choice and lower their costs. T-Mobile has been criticized for locking phones for up to a year, which makes it impossible to use a phone on a rival's network. T-Mobile claims that with a 60-day unlocking rule, "consumers risk losing access to the benefits of free or heavily subsidized handsets because the proposal would force providers to reduce the line-up of their most compelling handset offers."</p>
<p>If the proposed rule is enacted, "T-Mobile estimates that its prepaid customers, for example, would see subsidies reduced by 40 percent to 70 percent for both its lower and higher-end devices, such as the Moto G, Samsung A15, and iPhone 12," the carrier said. "A handset unlocking mandate would also leave providers little choice but to limit their handset offers to lower cost and often lesser performing handsets."</p>
<p>T-Mobile and other carriers are responding to a call for public comments that began after the FCC approved a <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-24-77A1.pdf">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</a> (NPRM) in a 5–0 vote. The FCC is proposing "to require all mobile wireless service providers to unlock handsets 60 days after a consumer's handset is activated with the provider, unless within the 60-day period the service provider determines the handset was purchased through fraud."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>When the FCC proposed the 60-day unlocking rule in July 2024, the agency <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/fcc-blasts-t-mobiles-365-day-phone-locking-proposes-60-day-unlock-rule/">criticized T-Mobile</a> for locking prepaid phones for a year. The NPRM pointed out that "T-Mobile recently increased its locking period for one of its brands, Metro by T-Mobile, from 180 days to 365 days."</p>
<p>T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/sim-unlock-policy">policy</a> says the carrier will only unlock mobile devices on prepaid plans if "at least 365 days... have passed since the device was activated on the T-Mobile network."</p>
<p>"You bought your phone, you should be able to take it to any provider you want," FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said when the FCC proposed the rule. "Some providers already operate this way. Others do not. In fact, some have recently increased the time their customers must wait until they can unlock their device by as much as 100 percent."</p>
<h2>T-Mobile locking policy more onerous</h2>
<p>T-Mobile executives, who also argue that the FCC lacks authority to impose the proposed rule, met with FCC officials last week to express their concerns.</p>
<p>"T-Mobile is passionate about winning customers for life, and explained how its handset unlocking policies greatly benefit our customers," the carrier said in its post-meeting filing. "Our policies allow us to deliver access to high-speed mobile broadband on a nationwide 5G network <em>via handsets that are free or heavily discounted</em> off the manufacturer's suggested retail price. T-Mobile's unlocking policies are transparent, and there is absolutely no evidence of consumer harm stemming from these policies. T-Mobile's current unlocking policies also help T-Mobile combat handset theft and fraud by sophisticated, international criminal organizations."</p>
<p>For postpaid users, T-Mobile says it allows unlocking of fully paid-off phones that have been active for at least 40 days. But given the 365-day lock on prepaid users, T-Mobile's overall policy is more onerous than those of other carriers. T-Mobile has also <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-enraged-as-un-carrier-breaks-promise-to-never-raise-prices/">faced angry customers</a> because of a recent decision to raise prices on plans that were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/t-mobile-users-thought-they-had-a-lifetime-price-lock-guess-what-happened-next/">advertised as having a lifetime price lock</a>.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.att.com/support/article/wireless/KM1262649/">enables unlocking</a> of paid-off phones after 60 days for postpaid users and after six months for prepaid users. AT&amp;T lodged similar complaints as T-Mobile, saying in an October 7 <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1008217166272/1">filing</a> that the FCC's proposed rules would "mak[e] handsets less affordable for consumers, especially those in low-income households," and "exacerbate handset arbitrage, fraud, and trafficking. "</p>
<p>AT&amp;T told the FCC that "requiring providers to unlock handsets before they are paid-off would ultimately harm consumers by creating upward pressure on handset prices and disincentives to finance handsets on flexible terms." If the FCC implements any rules, it should maintain "existing contractual arrangements between customers and providers, ensure that providers have at least 180 days to detect fraud before unlocking a device, and include at least a 24-month period for providers to implement any new rules," AT&amp;T said.</p>
<p>Verizon, which already faces unlocking rules because of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/wireless-net-neutrality-puts-verizon-and-rivals-on-equal-footing/">requirements imposed on spectrum licenses</a> it owns, automatically <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/consumer-safety/device-unlocking-policy">unlocks</a> phones after 60 days for prepaid and postpaid users. Among the three major carriers, Verizon is the most amenable to the FCC's new rules.</p>

<h2>Consumer groups: Make Verizon rules industry-wide</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1018046516995/1">October 18 filing</a> supporting a strict unlocking rule was submitted by numerous consumer advocacy groups including Public Knowledge, New America's Open Technology Institute, Consumer Reports, the National Consumers League, the National Consumer Law Center, and the National Digital Inclusion Alliance.</p>
<p>"Wireless users are subject to unnecessary restrictions in the form of locked devices, which tie them to their service providers even when better options may be available. Handset locking practices limit consumer freedom and lessen competition by creating an artificial technological barrier to switching providers," the groups said.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The groups cited the Verizon rules as a model and urged the FCC to require "that device unlocking is truly automatic—that is, unlocked after the requisite time period without any additional actions of the consumer." Carriers should not be allowed to lock phones for longer than 60 days even when a phone is on a financing plan with outstanding payments, the groups' letter said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Providers should be required to transition out of selling devices without this [automatic unlocking] capability and the industry-wide rule should be the same as the one protecting Verizon customers today: after the expiration of the initial period, the handset must automatically unlock regardless of whether: (1) the customer asks for the handset to be unlocked or (2) the handset is fully paid off. Removing this barrier to switching will make the standard simple for consumers and encourage providers to compete more vigorously on mobile service price, quality, and innovation.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an October 2 <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10022636123363/1">filing</a>, Verizon said it supports "a uniform approach to handset unlocking that allows all wireless providers to lock wireless handsets for a reasonable period of time to limit fraud and to enable device subsidies, followed by automatic unlocking absent evidence of fraud."</p>
<p>Verizon said 60 days should be the minimum for postpaid devices so that carriers have time to detect fraud and theft, and that "a longer, 180-day locking period for prepaid is necessary to enable wireless providers to continue offering subsidies that make phones affordable for prepaid customers." Regardless of what time frame the FCC chooses, Verizon said "a uniform unlocking policy that applies to all providers... will benefit both consumers and competition."</p>

          
                  </div>

        <div>
          
          
<h2>FCC considers impact on phone subsidies</h2>
<p>While the FCC is likely to impose an unlocking rule, one question is whether it will apply when a carrier has provided a discounted phone. The FCC's NPRM asked the public for "comment on the impact of a 60-day unlocking requirement in connection with service providers' incentives to offer discounted handsets for postpaid and prepaid service plans."</p>
<p>The FCC acknowledged Verizon's argument "that providers may rely on handset locking to sustain their ability to offer handset subsidies and that such subsidies may be particularly important in prepaid environments." But the FCC noted that public interest groups "argue that locked handsets tied to prepaid plans can disadvantage low-income customers most of all since they may not have the resources to switch service providers or purchase new handsets."</p>
<p>The public interest groups also note that unlocked handsets "facilitate a robust secondary market for used devices, providing consumers with more affordable options," the NPRM said.</p>
<p>The FCC says it can impose phone-unlocking rules using its legal authority under Title III of the Communications Act "to protect the public interest through spectrum licensing and regulations to require mobile wireless service providers to provide handset unlocking." The FCC said it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/02/wireless-net-neutrality-puts-verizon-and-rivals-on-equal-footing/">previously relied</a> on the same Title III authority when it imposed the unlocking rules on 700 MHz C Block spectrum licenses purchased by Verizon.</p>
<p>T-Mobile told the FCC in a <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/10923041590680/1">filing</a> last month that "none of the litany of Title III provisions cited in the NPRM support the expansive authority asserted here to regulate consumer handsets (rather than telecommunications services)." T-Mobile also said that "the Commission's legal vulnerabilities on this score are only magnified in light of recent Supreme Court precedent."</p>
<p>The Supreme Court recently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/scotus-kills-chevron-deference-giving-courts-more-power-to-block-federal-rules/">overturned</a> the 40-year-old <em>Chevron</em> precedent that gave agencies like the FCC judicial deference when interpreting ambiguous laws. The end of <em>Chevron</em> makes it harder for agencies to issue regulations without explicit authorization from Congress. This is a potential problem for the FCC in its fight to revive net neutrality rules, which are currently <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/fcc-suffers-major-setback-in-attempt-to-defend-net-neutrality-rules/">blocked</a> by a court order pending the outcome of litigation.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Data Formulator</strong> is an application from Microsoft Research that uses large language models to transform data, expediting the practice of data visualization.</p>
<p dir="auto">Data Formulator is an AI-powered tool for analysts to iteratively create rich visualizations. Unlike most chat-based AI tools where users need to describe everything in natural language, Data Formulator combines <em>user interface interactions (UI)</em> and <em>natural language (NL) inputs</em> for easier interaction. This blended approach makes it easier for users to describe their chart designs while delegating data transformation to AI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Get Started</h2><a id="user-content-get-started" aria-label="Permalink: Get Started" href="#get-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Play with Data Formulator with one of the following options:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Option 1: Install via Python PIP</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Use Python PIP for an easy setup experience, running locally (recommend: install it in a virtual environment).</p>

<p>For almost as long as <a href="https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/">the Undergraduate Projects Lab</a> at the University of Wisconsin has existed, there’s been a camera of some sort peering at the room. There’s evidence of a system existing even as far back as the 1990s, with a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202092257/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/uplcam.html">prehistoric revision of the site</a> mentioning that an old iteration was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…a $15 video camera attached to the wall with duct tape, connected to a VCR, connected to a video spigot in a Mac IIcx, running Timed Video Grabber (TVG), and FTPd. Dax, an HP workstation ran a script that would try to FTP the latest image every 60 seconds. Because the clocks would drift, occasionally, the file accesses would collide, and the whole scheme would break.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just <em>reading</em> that makes me stare at the camera that now sits perched on top of the arcade cabinet with wonder. What used to be several thousand dollars of equipment is now achievable (with immeasurably better quality) with a $50 webcam plugged into a Raspberry Pi.</p>

</p>
<p><i>Taken ~25 years apart.</i></p>
<p>I could—and probably will—write an entire other blog post about the intricate history of the UPL, mentioning how <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001003051528/http://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/uplcam/spincam.html">older versions of the website</a> allowed for users to control the tilt and pan of the camera using four stepper motors attached to the camera.</p>
<p>However, the focus of this article is about the two <em>latest</em> iterations of cameras in the UPL.</p>
<h2 id="is-the-upl-open-right-now"><a href="#is-the-upl-open-right-now">#</a>“Is the UPL open right now?”</h2>
<p>I’m sure that any UPL member can testify the horror of arriving to the lab to see a closed door. If you live anywhere off campus, it’s heartbreaking to see your arduous trek to the CS building result in failure.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that as far back as IRC, members of the UPL messaged each other asking if the lab was open. With the advent of mobile phones, it’s gotten easier to bother your friends—who may not even be in the room!</p>
<p>Well, myself, in collaboration with other UPL members, decided to fix this issue in, perhaps, the most CS-student-esque way possible: an automated system to identify the occupancy of the lab.</p>
<h2 id="people-counting"><a href="#people-counting">#</a>People counting</h2>
<p>The first iteration of the people counting system (as built by <a href="https://github.com/mdberkey">Michael Berkey</a>) utilized a Logitech C920 camera mounted on a vantage point that had a clear view of the room. A Discord bot was set on a 15 minute loop (using discord.py.ext’s <code>@tasks.loop(minutes=15)</code>) to call a YOLOv7 model set to class 0 (detecting people). The bot called the webcam to take an image, then ran it through the model for inference. It returned the number of people in the room (and annotated the image with bounding boxes of where it believed the people to be, for debug purposes).</p>

    <img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/camera-peek.png" alt="The back side of a C920 webcam.">
</p>
<p><i>…don’t mind the tape.</i></p>
<p>It then set the name of a channel to the results (either <code>1-person-in-upl</code> or <code>X-people-in-upl</code>), which others could check.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/8-people-in-upl.png" alt="A channel in the UPL Discord reads '8 people in UPL'.">
</p>
<p><i>An example of what the Discord looked like on a day with a semi-busy UPL.</i></p>
<h2 id="switching-to-door-sensing"><a href="#switching-to-door-sensing">#</a>Switching to door sensing</h2>
<p>This worked perfectly for a while — people would check the Discord channel name and see the estimated count of the number of people in the room. If it said “zero people”, they could infer that the UPL wasn’t open.</p>
<p>However, this solution started presenting issues. For one, having people in the room didn’t necessarily indicate that the UPL was open. There could be a meeting, or a separate gathering where the doors were closed and people weren’t allowed inside. This was confusing to people who might have seen “8 people inside the UPL”, only to arrive at the building to see coords having a meeting.</p>
<p>There was also the issue of the model sometimes interpreting the chair in the corner as a person<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/upl_empty.png" alt="An image of the empty lab. An annotation on a brown armchair reads 'Person 0', despite no human on the chair.">
</p>
<p><i>Either the model is too sensitive, or the UPL has a friendly ghost!</i></p>
<p>It was around this time that I stumbled upon the homepage of <a href="https://miters.mit.edu/">MITERS</a>, a makerspace at MIT. On their website, they broadcast whether the door to the space is open using a reed switch attached to a Raspberry Pi. Reed switches are small, physical components that are able to detect a magnetic field. If you put one on a doorframe, and then attach a tiny magnet to the door itself, you have an effective way of detecting whether a door is open or closed! I was able to find <a href="https://andrewbirkel.com/projects/MITERS_Door.html">a writeup</a> by a former member of the space on their implementation, but I can’t guarantee that it’s accurate to how it’s set up there currently.</p>
<p>I considered using similar components for a door status checker for the UPL — it wouldn’t have been too much effort to buy WiFi enabled ESP32 modules and off-the-shelf door-mountable reed switches. Then, I would have the chips simply send a POST request with their status every time the door was opened or closed.</p>
<p>I decided against this approach for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The UPL doesn’t really have the equipment to maintain such a system. I don’t know how to solder, and mounting breadboards to the walls doesn’t seem like the most future-proof or aesthetically pleasing solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the system were to spontaneously break after I left, it would be difficult to find somebody to fix it. The UPL is mainly a software oriented lab!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The WiFi ran by the university (UWNet) requires you to log in with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal">captive portal</a> to register your device to connect to the network. Without intervention, it will occasionally require you to sign back in to renew your ability to connect<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. While there <em>are</em> some ways to emulate the specific requests a typical browser would use to authenticate with your NetID, it would be a ton of recurring effort (and the login it used would have to be changed as people graduated)!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I decided that the sensors themselves would have to act autonomously and simply relay their state to a device elsewhere in the room. Luckily, the Raspberry Pi that ran the code for the people counter was easily repurposed. I installed <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a>, an open source platform for interfacing with various network connected devices.</p>
<p>There are plenty of devices that track the status of doors, made by companies like Ring and ADT for home security. However, they usually require proprietary hubs to check their status, and don’t offer easily accessible APIs to interface with the device. Luckily, there was a better solution!</p>
<h2 id="zigbee"><a href="#zigbee">#</a>Zigbee!</h2>
<p>Enter Zigbee. It’s a low-rate mesh wireless protocol that allows for smart devices to communicate over a personal area network. A benefit of this is that you’re able to use one hub to communicate with a variety of devices, even those made by different manufacturers. Instead of searching for a particular brand for the door contact sensors, I would just have to find ones that supported the Zigbee protocol. Then I would be able to view their status through Home Assistant’s dashboard.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that Zigbee radios operate independently from WiFi or Bluetooth antennas. If you want to interface with Zigbee devices, you’ll have to pick up a special receiver that can support the protocol. For this project, I picked up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SONOFF-Universal-Assistant-Zigbee2MQTT-Wireless/dp/B0B6P22YJC/">this one</a> made by SONOFF. Home Assistant’s Zigbee integration is called <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/zha/">Zigbee Home Automation</a>, and it supports a variety of Zigbee coordinators (the USB dongles that allow for connections). When you use this integration, Home Assistant automatically creates a Zigbee network that the devices can join.</p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Aqara-MCCGQ11LM-Window-Sensor-White/dp/B07D37VDM3/">these Aqara door and window sensors</a> for this project. They had the best reviews out of all of the Zigbee door sensors I looked at, and have a battery life of two years (with an easily replaceable CR1632 cell).</p>
<p>Once the coordinator and sensors arrived, I created a Home Assistant login and installed the ZHA integration. Pairing simply required holding the “reset” button on the sensors until Home Assistant recognized them and added the corresponding entities in the dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-door-statuses"><a href="#using-the-door-statuses">#</a>Using the door statuses</h2>
<p>Once this was all configured, I had the live statuses of the doors through the Home Assistant dashboard! I’m not going to lie, it was really fun opening and closing the doors repeatedly and seeing the dashboard change in real-time (even if passerby in the CS building probably thought I was crazy).</p>

<p><i>It’s so satisfying to watch this happen in real-time.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></i></p>
<p>An important thing to note here is that UWNet provides total access point isolation. None of the devices on the network can see any of the others (for good reason, as it would be a huge security vulnerability for any devices with open ports). If this wasn’t a limitation, I would just have the website directly query the rpi.</p>
<p>My first intuition was to use Home Assistant’s <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/rest_command/">RESTful Command</a> integration to send a POST request to my webserver whenever the status of the doors changed. These require you to setup each command ahead of time, in HA’s <code>configuration.yml</code>:</p>

<p>…but I very quickly realized that this solution wasn’t the best. For one, when I published <a href="https://github.com/UW-UPL/people-counter-v2/blob/main/home-assistant/configuration.yaml">the source code</a> onto GitHub, some very funny students decided that they would manually simulate the POST requests and change the status of the doors to be inaccurate. That’s what I get for leaving the endpoint unsecured!<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>
<p>I eventually learned that Home Assistant provides a <a href="https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest/">RESTful API</a> directly alongside the web dashboard. If I set that up, I would be able to query the instance for the states of the connected devices.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup> All it took was appending an <code>/api/</code> route to the HA URL. I could just use that!</p>
<p>The API has all of its routes authenticated with a bearer token (to most likely mirror the permissions of the frontend, which requires a user login before showing any data). Given that I wanted to display the door status on the UPL’s page, I realized the potential danger in shipping the bearer token with the site. Any crafty user could take it and access any other route on Home Assistant’s API. Given the level of information and control available on HA instances, this could be disastrous.</p>
<p>I made a quick webserver using Express that proxies the request with the bearer token and only serves the relevant door information. Because it displays this separately, the user has no way of seeing or manipulating anything beyond this.</p>

<p>Now, the server will query Home Assistant’s API on your behalf (with the proper bearer token). It’ll return a JSON object of the door statuses and their last change, like so:</p>
<div><figure><pre data-language="json"><code><div><p><span>[</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"door"</span><span>: </span><span>"back"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"status"</span><span>: </span><span>"on"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"last_updated"</span><span>: </span><span>"2024-10-12T20:01:54.353657+00:00"</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>},</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>{</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"door"</span><span>: </span><span>"front"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"status"</span><span>: </span><span>"on"</span><span>,</span></p></div><div><p><span>    </span><span>"last_updated"</span><span>: </span><span>"2024-10-12T20:02:10.132178+00:00"</span></p></div><div><p><span><span>  </span></span><span>}</span></p></div><div><p><span>]</span></p></div></code></pre></figure></div>
<p>…and the Discord bot/UPL website can use that to let people know what the status is.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/open_door.png" alt="The UPL website reads 'the doors are open!' with an icon of an open door.">
</p>
<p><i>The UPL website uses a header component which fetches the door status every 15 seconds.</i></p>
<p><img src="https://www.amoses.dev/images/upl-pc/upl_discord.png" alt="A channel in the UPL Discord reads 'UPL doors open'.">
</p>
<p><i>The Discord channel name is an easy way to see the status without opening the site.</i></p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m pretty happy with how this project turned out. It’s been really fun developing something that I actually use every day, and I find it pretty special that every time I check if the UPL’s open or not, I’m doing it via something that I made myself.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>A new </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/investigations/30-cameras-border-patrols-main-surveillance-system-are-broken-memo-say-rcna175281"><span>bombshell scoop</span></a><span> from NBC News revealed an internal U.S. Border Patrol memo claiming that 30 percent of camera towers that compose the agency's "Remote Video Surveillance System" (RVSS) program are broken. According to the report, the memo describes "several technical problems" affecting approximately 150 towers.</span></p>
<p><span>Except, this isn't a bombshell. What should actually be shocking is that Congressional leaders are acting shocked, like those who recently sent a </span><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/whistleblowers-border-patrol-surveillance-cameras-out-service-gop-demands-answers-dhs"><span>letter</span></a><span> about the towers to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. These revelations simply reiterate what people who have been watching border technology have known for decades: Surveillance at the U.S.-Mexico border is a wasteful endeavor that is ill-equipped to respond to an ill-defined problem. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Yet, after years of bipartisan recognition that these programs were straight-up boondoggles, there seems to be a competition among political leaders to throw the most money at programs that continue to fail. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Official oversight reports about the failures, repeated breakages, and general ineffectiveness of these camera towers have been public since at least the mid-2000s. So why haven't border security agencies confronted the problem in the last 25 years? One reason is that these cameras are largely political theater; the technology dazzles publicly, then fizzles quietly. Meanwhile, communities that should be thriving at the border are treated like a laboratory for tech companies looking to cash in on often exaggerated—if not fabricated—homeland security threats.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Acronym Game</strong></h3>
<div><p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/cbp-expanding-its-surveillance-tower-program-us-mexico-border-and-were-mapping-it"><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/eff_map_10-18-2024.png" width="1125" height="729" alt="A map of the US-Mexico border with multicolored dots representing surveillance towers." title="EFF is mapping surveillance at the US-Mexico border"></a></p><p>EFF is mapping surveillance at the U.S.-Mexico border</p></div><p><em><i><span>.</span></i></em></p><p><span></span><span>In fact, the history of camera towers at the border is an ugly cycle. First, Border Patrol introduces a surveillance program with a catchy name and big promises. Then a few years later, oversight bodies, including Congress, conclude it's an abject mess. But rather than abandon the program once and for all, border security officials come up with a new name, slap on a fresh coat of paint, and continue on. A few years later, history repeats. </span></p>
<p><span>In the early 2000s, there was the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), with the installation of RVSS towers in places like Calexico, California and Nogales, Arizona, which was later became the America's Shield Initiative (ASI). After those failures, there was Project 28 (P-28), the first stage of the Secure Border Initiative (SBInet). When that program was canceled, there were various new programs like the Arizona Border Surveillance Technology Plan, which became the Southwest Border Technology Plan. Border Patrol introduced the Integrated Fixed Tower (IFT) program and the RVSS Update program, then the Automated Surveillance Tower (AST) program. And now we've got a whole slew of new acronyms, including the Integrated Surveillance Tower (IST) program and the Consolidated Towers and Surveillance Equipment (CTSE) program. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Feeling overwhelmed by acronyms? Welcome to the shell game of border surveillance. Here's what happens whenever oversight bodies take a closer look. </span></p>
<h3><b>ISIS and ASI</b></h3>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/calexico_rvss.jpg" width="1920" height="1346" alt="A surveillance tower over a home." title=""></p><p>An RVSS from the early 2000s in Calexico, California.</p></div>
<p><span>Let's start with the Integrated Surveillance Intelligence System (ISIS), a program comprised of towers, sensors and databases originally launched in 1997 by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. A few years later, INS was reorganized into the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and ISIS became part of the newly formed Customs &amp; Border Protection (CBP). <br></span></p>
<p><span>It was only a matter of years before the DHS Inspector General </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23314612-oig_06-15_dec05"><span>concluded that ISIS</span></a><span> was a flop:</span><span> "ISIS remote surveillance technology yielded few apprehensions as a percentage of detection, resulted in needless investigations of legitimate activity, and consumed valuable staff time to perform video analysis or investigate sensor alerts." </span></p>
<p><span>During </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863"><span>Senate hearings</span></a><span>, Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH), complained about a "</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863#document/p125"><span>total breakdown in the camera structures</span></a><span>," and that the U.S. government "</span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863#document/p141"><span>bought cameras that didn't work.</span></a><span>" </span></p>
<p><span>Around 2004, ISIS was folded into the new America's Shield Initiative (ASI), which officials claimed would fix those problems. CBP Commissioner Robert Bonner even <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24483802-chrg-109shrg99863#document/p30">promoted</a> ASI as a "critical part of CBP’s strategy to build smarter borders." Yet, less than a year later, Bonner stepped down, and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found the ASI had <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25242401-gao-06-295#document/p2">numerous unresolved issues</a> necessitating a total reevaluation. CBP disputed none of the findings and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25242401-gao-06-295#document/p6">explained</a> it was dismantling ASI in order to move onto something new that would solve everything: the Secure Border Initiative (SBI).<br></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23825159-chrg-110hhrg44137#document/p10"><span>Reflecting on the ISIS/ASI programs in 2008</span></a><span>, Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) said, "What we found was a camera and sensor system that was plagued by mismanagement, operational problems, and financial waste. At that time, we put the Department on notice that mistakes of the past should not be repeated in SBInet."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can guess what happened next.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>P-28 and SBInet</b></h3>
<p><span>The next iteration was called Project 28, which then evolved into the Secure Border Initiative's SBInet, starting in the Arizona desert.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, the DHS Chief Information Officer summarized its </span><a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24487999/itpa-cbp-sbinet2010.pdf"><span>comprehensive review</span></a><span>: "'Project 28,' the initial prototype for the SBInet system, did not perform as planned. Project 28 was not scalable to meet the mission requirements for a national comment [sic] and control system, and experienced significant technical difficulties."&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/sbinet.jpg" width="1000" height="750" alt="A convoluted graphic illustrating how SBInet surveillance towers fit into the border security plan." title=""></p><p>A DHS graphic illustrating the SBInet concept</p></div>
<p><span>Meanwhile, bipartisan consensus had emerged about the failure of the program, due to the technical problems as well as contracting irregularities and cost overruns.</span></p>
<p><span>As Rep. Christopher Carney (D-PA) said in his </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23825159-chrg-110hhrg44137#document/p9"><span>prepared statement</span></a><span> during Congressional hearings:</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span> P–28 and the larger SBInet program are supposed to be a model of how the Federal Government is leveraging technology to secure our borders, but Project 28, in my mind, has achieved a dubious distinction as a trifecta of bad Government contracting: Poor contract management; poor contractor performance; and a poor final product.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Rep. Rogers' remarks were even more cutting: "You know the history of ISIS and what a disaster that was, and we had hoped to take the lessons from that and do better on this and, apparently, we haven’t done much better. "</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps most damning of all was yet another GAO </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24488007-ad1179135"><span>report</span></a><span> that found, "SBInet defects have been found, with the number of new defects identified generally increasing faster than the number being fixed—a trend that is not indicative of a system that is maturing."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In January 2011, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano </span><a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2011/01/dhs-cancels-virtual-border-fence-047625"><span>canceled</span></a><span> the $3-billion program.</span></p>
<h3><b>IFTs, RVSSs, and ASTs<br></b></h3>
<p><span>Following the termination of SBInet, the </span><i><span>Christian Science Monitor</span></i><span> ran the naive headline, "</span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2011/0115/US-cancels-virtual-fence-along-Mexican-border.-What-s-Plan-B"><span>US cancels 'virtual fence' along Mexican border. What's Plan B</span></a><span>?" Three years later, the newspaper answered its own question with another question, "'</span><a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/0319/Virtual-border-fence-idea-revived.-Another-billion-dollar-boondoggle"><span>Virtual' border fence idea revived. Another 'billion dollar boondoggle'</span></a><span>?" <br></span></p>
<p><span>Boeing was the main contractor blamed for SBINet's failure, but Border Patrol ultimately awarded one of the biggest new contracts to Elbit Systems, which had been one of Boeing's subcontractors on SBInet. Elbit began installing IFTs (again, that stands for "Integrated Fixed Towers") in many of the exact same places slated for SBInet. In some cases, the equipment was simply swapped on an existing SBInet tower.<br></span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, another contractor, General Dynamics Information Technology, began installing new RVSS towers and upgrading old ones as part of the RVSS-U program. Border Patrol also started installing hundreds of "Autonomous Surveillance Towers" (ASTs) by yet another vendor, Anduril Industries, embracing the new buzz of artificial intelligence. <br></span></p>
<div><p><img src="https://www.eff.org/files/2024/10/18/ast_and_rvss.jpg" width="1313" height="941" alt="Two surveillance towers and a Border Patrol vehicle along the Rio Grande" title=""></p><p>An Autonomous Surveillance Tower and an RVSS tower along the Rio Grande.</p></div>
<p><span>In 2017, the GAO </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24733271-gao-18-119#document/p2"><span>complained</span></a><span> the Border Patrol's poor data quality made the agency "limited in its ability to determine the mission benefits of its surveillance technologies." In one case, Border Patrol stations in the Rio Grande Valley claimed IFTs assisted in 500 cases in just six months. The problem with that assertion was there are no IFTs in Texas or, in fact, anywhere outside Arizona. <br></span></p>
<p><span>A few years later, the DHS Inspector General issued yet another </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23706411-oig-21-21-feb21"><span>report</span></a><span> indicating not much had improved: <br></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>CBP faced additional challenges that reduced the effectiveness of its existing technology. Border Patrol officials stated they had inadequate personnel to fully leverage surveillance technology or maintain current information technology systems and infrastructure on site. Further, we identified security vulnerabilities on some CBP servers and workstations not in compliance due to disagreement about the timeline for implementing DHS configuration management requirements.</span></p>
<p><span>CBP is not well-equipped to assess its technology effectiveness to respond to these deficiencies. CBP has been aware of this challenge since at least 2017 but lacks a standard process and accurate data to overcome it. <br></span></p>
<p><span>Overall, these deficiencies have limited CBP’s ability to detect and prevent the illegal entry of noncitizens who may pose threats to national security.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Around that same time, the RAND Corporation published a </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24711700-rand_rr4348#document/p60/a2562275"><span>study</span></a><span> funded by DHS that found "strong evidence" the IFT program was having no impact on apprehension levels at the border, and only "weak" and "inconclusive" evidence that the RVSS towers were having any effect on apprehensions.</span></p>
<p><span>And yet, border authorities and their supporters in Congress are continuing to promote unproven, AI-driven technologies as the latest remedy for years of failures, including the ones voiced in the memo obtained by NBC News. These systems involve cameras controlled by algorithms that automatically identify and track objects or people of interest. But in an age when algorithmic errors and bias are being identified nearly everyday in every sector including law enforcement, it is unclear how this technology has earned the trust of the government. <br></span></p>
<h3><b>History Keeps Repeating <br></b></h3>
<p><span>That brings us today, with reportedly 150 or more towers out of service. So why does Washington keep supporting surveillance at the border? Why are they proposing record-level funding for a system that seems irreparable? Why have they abandoned their duty to scrutinize federal programs? <br></span></p>
<p><span>Well, one reason may be that treating problems at the border as humanitarian crises or pursuing foreign policy or immigration reform measures isn't as politically useful as promoting a phantom "invasion" that requires a military-style response. Another reason may be that </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2024/06/hundreds-tech-companies-want-cash-border-security-funding-heres-who-they-are-and"><span>tech companies and military contractors</span></a><span> wield immense amounts of influence and stand to make millions, if not billions, profiting off border surveillance. The price is paid by taxpayers, but also in the civil liberties of border communities and the human rights of asylum seekers and migrants.</span></p>
<p><span>But perhaps the biggest reason this history keeps repeating itself is that no one is ever really held accountable for wasting potentially billions of dollars on high-tech snake oil.</span></p>
