<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="HAKN5RA4VZGG5HUOISYWUFSUSM">An Oregon woman’s nude photos ended up the topic of conversation in her small town after a prosecutor looked through her sensitive cellphone data and told the county sheriff what he found despite no warrant, no consent and no suspicion that she had committed a crime. </p><p id="2NI3FZZWCBDNTENWITV7DN7FXM">But the district attorney involved won’t face legal consequences under a federal appeals court ruling released Monday.</p><p id="CSLFAFBGT5E4BCECIRXAGA6XV4">A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25519734-olsonvcarpenter9thcircuitruling/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25519734-olsonvcarpenter9thcircuitruling/">ruled </a>2-to-1 that Grant County District Attorney Jim Carpenter’s actions amounted to “a troubling example of the intrusion on Fourth Amendment rights” against illegal searches. </p><p id="IDEANTQSHFARBOZUYRKAODQENU">But all three judges upheld a lower court’s decision to grant Carpenter qualified immunity and dismiss the woman’s lawsuit. </p><p id="K2FQ5VQAURELNAJI4QED427T6E">Under qualified immunity, government officials can be held accountable for violating someone’s rights only if a court has previously ruled that it was “clearly established” those precise actions were unconstitutional.</p><p id="Y6IUVXCMSJGEBKBTY45A4GCW4I">Carpenter declined to comment on the ruling.</p><p id="FFGH7SYLAVDYFMW37HOBAWRHXE">A lawyer for the woman said the decision, while disappointing because it allows no remedy for her client, still shines a light on the improper behavior by law enforcement officials and will help others.</p><p id="XRX3JS6LL5DBZACQQJP3KP3F2Y">The ruling puts prosecutors and police on notice that similar actions in the future would violate the Constitution and they could face liability, said attorney Nadia Dahab.</p><p id="P5ZPBS4PPNFQRLMBPUTBGKQ75M">“Opinions like this are important for the development of the law and for people who suffer harms like she did in the future to be able to hold public officials accountable,” Dahab said. “This makes it harder for officials to engage in this kind of conduct and to raise a qualified immunity defense down the road.”</p><p id="UFPPHOAR4FD7TFSMJ52NWWFZDA">Qualified immunity has faced widespread criticism from victims who argue that it protects police and government officials from civil liability when they violate an individual’s constitutional rights. Victims of police misconduct and their families often spend years in court to seek justice only for officers to be shielded by qualified immunity, their lawyers have argued.</p><p id="PHA2JFPD5NCLFJBYDYVRAOVJFI">Dahab represents Haley Olson, who runs a marijuana dispensary store in John Day, population 1,660.</p><p id="I4PABPRW5BFMDNL6UQT7YCAMXA">Olson’s case began when she was pulled over and arrested in Jerome County, Idaho, on Jan. 22, 2019, and charged with possessing marijuana. </p><p id="A7O5LU6VJJDLHGJOBIUDS7LJXA">Recreational marijuana use is legal in Oregon but not in Idaho. </p><p id="CESXQNSFLZHDZEDRO46OBU2SHI">Olson told the Idaho State Police trooper during the stop that her boyfriend was a sheriff’s deputy and police also found a business card for Grant County sheriff’s Deputy Tyler Smith in Olson’s car, according to the appellate opinion.</p><p id="HHD76GJLI5FYLBXFK6XRF7VB7E">Olson signed a form, giving Idaho police consent to search her cellphone. They extracted and copied the contents of her phone for review. Idaho authorities later dropped charges against her.</p><p id="UYRIYSHHXVE3RFRAE7QOAMFI3M">But <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/topic/sheriff%20glenn%20palmer/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.oregonlive.com/topic/sheriff%20glenn%20palmer/">Glenn Palmer, the Grant County sheriff at the time</a>, had called the Idaho trooper who handled Olson’s case shortly after her arrest. Palmer had apparently heard about the arrest from another sheriff’s office employee and was “curious” about whether Olson’s phone might reveal misconduct on Smith’s part, the appellate court wrote.</p><p id="75K4L7VMX5ADVCDSFFIOR6R3WU">Palmer learned during the conversation that the deputy’s card had been discovered in Olson’s car and asked the Idaho trooper to share the contents of Olson’s phone, but Idaho authorities rejected his request, according to the opinion.</p><p id="FY4CRKSUXZFGDH6TFBFGSX7KUY">Palmer then asked the district attorney to request the contents of Olson’s cellphone from Idaho police and review the material.</p><p id="GNIPSMRACRB37O7ZDFNKQ2ACLA">Palmer was allegedly concerned that his deputy “might be involved in illegal activities with Olson” that would require an internal investigation, the ruling said.</p><p id="PVAR47OU6JEXBJLTRTPVCARWLQ">Carpenter wrote to a prosecutor in the Jerome County District Attorney’s Office, saying the phone extraction “will be used only for internal purposes” and wouldn’t be disseminated to another agency or third party, according to the ruling. </p><p id="GZJBC66NF5FEZMMRNP4QJSMBGM">An Idaho prosecutor then shared a flash drive containing the contents of Olson’s phone with Carpenter.</p><p id="D4RLJA22ONBL7LOMWAL7QJZEVY">Carpenter immediately violated his pledge to Idaho police and asked detectives from two outside agencies, the Oregon State Police and the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office, to review the flash drive material, according to the appellate opinion. </p><p id="TW5Q6GFB5ZFD5OXGQRQQ674EBI">Both agencies declined, because it wasn’t tied to a criminal investigation, the opinion said.</p><p id="UXJFYLXVTVCRBBDTKO46GZY5ZI">Carpenter reviewed the phone contents himself in April 2019, found nude photos of both Olson and Smith and contacted the sheriff to tell him that the phone showed evidence of an intimate relationship between Smith and Olson, the ruling said.</p><p id="SEHCX4HGJJA7ZIOASAKWEC5FYU">But Carpenter added in his letter to the sheriff that he found no evidence of misconduct by Smith on the phone, according to court records.</p><p id="53Z26XHSKNDQBPUUJ5TGB7TZQE">Olson argued in her lawsuit that the district attorney shared the nude photos with the sheriff, but both Carpenter and Palmer denied those allegations. </p><p id="DUNWJVNTEJFJXJTMVAEUYQUCHE">Yet Palmer testified in his deposition that Carpenter twice offered him a copy of the thumb drive and told him, “There were things on the cell phone that, ‘once you see them, you can’t unsee them,’” according to the ruling.</p><p id="HNUTXA7K5BCFFGQZX6W2B5MK4I">Oslon said she started hearing gossip regarding her arrest, the examination of her phone, her relationship with Smith and the nude photos -- “all seemingly originating from the sheriff’s office,” the opinion said.</p><p id="UEWQED7GKFCXHGNDYXSK3FHTEU">Olson said a Grant County deputy whom she didn’t know came into her marijuana store and told her that he had heard “there’s some pretty smokin’ pictures of you going around the sheriff’s office,” the appeals court wrote</p><p id="YLD72IBZGFHANPRXXFEGLJ6CME">Another witness reported observing two sheriff’s employees looking at nude photos of Olson on a phone, according to the opinion. </p><p id="QFRKHWBFSZEMLBNUMMEYYYYTFQ">One of Olson’s customers asked her, “What happened to ya out in Idaho? Palmer told me you got arrested” and later said he had heard something about the contents on her phone, according to court records.</p><p id="7PPLDJVJDNHBVFRXYF77QXMKB4">Olson sued Palmer, Carpenter and Grant County in federal court, alleging violation of her Fourth Amendment right to be free from an unreasonable search and 14th Amendment right to privacy. </p><p id="DMXHJPM5XBA2DKQGMHDK7IJOUM">U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut of Portland threw out the case, finding that Carpenter was entitled to qualified immunity and that Palmer had no “supervisory liability” because she found no evidence that the sheriff had reviewed the cellphone material or supervised Carpenter.</p><p id="LPAZX2KJCNCZ7IMK5YQFQXRLFY">But 9th Circuit Judge M. Margaret McKeown determined Carpenter’s review of the cellphone material was an unreasonable search, considering it was done “without consent, without a warrant and without even a suspicion of further criminal activity by Olson or even Smith.”</p><p id="GXQTAMVR2ZBT5KSETEV6ZQLIM4">McKeown, writing for the majority, said the Idaho State Police consent form that Olson signed didn’t extend to a search of the phone by a different law enforcement agency “in another state, for evidence of her boyfriend’s theoretical misdeeds.”</p><p id="4KNAKL5TQRBCVBUKDUOU7WHULE">Although Palmer denied seeing or sharing the contents of Olson’s phone with members of the public, Olson’s allegations that strangers made derogatory comments to her regarding the circulation of her nude photos “also support the claim that Olson’s private information was shared far beyond the scope of her original consent,” McKeown wrote.</p><p id="B5USDBT5I5AMFFQOC7UXUGPF4E">“Palmer was ‘curious’ about whether Olson’s phone might reveal misconduct on Smith’s part, and Carpenter was interested in reviewing the phone for possible Brady material in cases where Smith might testify,” the opinion said. </p><p id="KU5Q6PYOQNBMVL4OXMQWZRSXGU">Under the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Brady v. Maryland, police must inform prosecutors about an officer’s potential credibility problems on the witness stand or the need to turn over information that might be favorable to defense attorneys in a case.</p><p id="6UFHLNAJ7ZAKFGR3TWPM5QRKAM">“But neither Palmer’s curiosity nor Carpenter’s improbable search for Brady material for some hypothetical future investigation justifies expanding the consent form’s express scope,” McKeown wrote.</p><p id="IMB4Z33NENC6LKVTBRXYCHZO5M">McKeown found Carpenter’s explanation for his search of the phone material unbelievable. </p><p id="ALA2KUMFDZES5EDOWDKSZOZ4OI">“It defies common sense to hypothesize a potential Brady complication when there has been no prosecution, no investigation, nor even a whiff of criminal activity,” she wrote. </p><p id="DOANPTF5MRAW7ACIG6OKEX2N5U">The 9th Circuit panel also blasted Carpenter’s claim that his actions comported with longstanding practices of electronic data sharing between law enforcement agencies, calling it “devoid of any supporting authority.”</p><p id="OAHSVDN4XJHMNAKM5T2PJMXC5A">Jill Conbere, the Oregon Justice Department lawyer who defended Carpenter in the case, argued that information sharing between law enforcement agencies “is standard practice in many contexts.”</p><p id="HTVB5UYA3JBNZLKQD37HN3P6ZM">Conbere said Carpenter wasn’t required to get a warrant before accessing the phone data because Olson had given Idaho State Police consent to search her phone.</p><p id="OZW2AMR4ZBGOJJUZKGJHIXJ6SM">Yet the 9th Circuit’s majority ruling noted, “At every turn, Carpenter and Palmer were stymied by other law enforcement personnel or agencies in both Idaho and Oregon that refused to aid them. The Idaho state trooper declined to give Palmer the extraction of Olson’s phone, and the other criminal investigation agencies in Oregon declined to review the data when asked by Carpenter, because there were no allegations of a crime, and therefore nothing for them to investigate.”</p><p id="ZGQBPRVQ7ZFOLOZTXJZB4ZFDL4">In a separate concurring 9th Circuit opinion, Circuit Judge Daniel A. Bress agreed that the court should uphold the trial court’s granting of immunity and dismissal of the claims. But he wrote that the panel should have simply affirmed the lower court ruling and not gone on to find a constitutional violation. </p><p id="NMD5TCYVLZBATCPEJGDYC6BN7Y">It’s unclear, Bress wrote, whether Idaho authorities are more at fault, for example. “In my respectful view, prudence here dictated that we decide only what we needed to decide,” he wrote.</p><p id="GMTML2LN45GS3CRPPMUXTLSCQQ">Later in 2019 in an unrelated case, Smith was fired from the sheriff’s office after his arrest on alleged assault and sex abuse complaints. </p><p id="T7FW7ECEYNA2BNPI7UBBEP7J4E">He was acquitted of all charges in 2022, and argued in a federal whistleblower complaint that Palmer retaliated against him for reporting misconduct involving another sheriff’s deputy, who was the wife of Palmer’s undersheriff. Smith obtained more than $1.3 million from Grant County and the state of Oregon in a series of settlements after challenging his firing in the whistleblower complaint, the <a href="https://www.bluemountaineagle.com/news/ex-grant-county-deputy-reaps-1-3-million-legal-settlement/article_dc60bcb0-d846-11ee-b191-ffaffee43bfe.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bluemountaineagle.com/news/ex-grant-county-deputy-reaps-1-3-million-legal-settlement/article_dc60bcb0-d846-11ee-b191-ffaffee43bfe.html">Blue Mountain Eagle</a> reported.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/ice-immigration-social-media-surveillance/">https://theintercept.com/2025/02/11/ice-immigration-social-media-surveillance/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43049152">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><span>Amid anger and</span> protest over the Trump administration’s plan to deport millions of immigrants, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to monitor and locate “negative” social media discussion about the agency and its top officials, according to contract documents reviewed by The Intercept.</p>



<p>Citing an increase in threats to ICE agents and leadership, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25517962-statement-of-objectives/">the agency is soliciting pitches from private companies</a> to monitor threats across the internet — with a special focus on social media. People who simply criticize ICE online could pulled into the dragnet.</p>



<p>“In order to prevent adversaries from successfully targeting ICE Senior leaders, personnel and facilities, ICE requires real-time threat mitigation and monitoring services, vulnerability assessments, and proactive threat monitoring services,” the procurement document reads.</p>



<p>If this scanning uncovers anything the agency deems suspicious, ICE is asking its contractors to drill down into the background of social media users.</p>



<p>That includes:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Previous social media activity which would indicate any additional threats to ICE; 2). Information which would indicate the individual(s) and/or the organization(s) making threats have a proclivity for violence; and 3). Information indicating a potential for carrying out a threat (such as postings depicting weapons, acts of violence, refences to acts of violence, to include empathy or affiliation with a group which has violent tendencies; references to violent acts; affections with violent acts; eluding [sic] to violent acts.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s unclear how exactly any contractor might sniff out someone’s “proclivity for violence.” The ICE document states only that the contractor will use “social and behavioral sciences” and “psychological profiles” to accomplish its automated threat detection.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->



<p>Once flagged, the system will further scour a target’s internet history and attempt to reveal their real-world position and offline identity. In addition to compiling personal information — such as the Social Security numbers and addresses of those whose posts are flagged — the contractor will also provide ICE with a “photograph, partial legal name, partial date of birth, possible city, possible work affiliations, possible school or university affiliation, and any identified possible family members or associates.”</p>



<div><p>The document also requests “Facial Recognition capabilities that could take a photograph of a subject and search the internet to find all relevant information associated with the subject.” The contract contains specific directions for targets found in other countries, implying the program would scan the domestic speech of American citizens.</p><!-- BLOCK(promote-post)[1](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22PROMOTE_POST%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%22slug%22%3A%22immigrants%22%2C%22crop%22%3A%22promo%22%7D) -->  </div>
<!-- END-BLOCK(promote-post)[1] -->&nbsp;



<p>The posting indicates that ICE isn’t merely looking to detect direct threats of violence, but also online criticism of the agency.</p>



<p>As part of its mission to protect ICE with “proactive threat monitoring,” the winning contractor will not simply flag threatening remarks but “Provide monitoring and analysis of behavioral and social media sentiment (i.e. positive, neutral, and negative).” This includes regular updates on the “total number of negative references to ICE found in social media” from week to week.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>“ICE’s attempt to have eyes and ears in as many places as we exist both online and offline should ring an alarm.”</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Such sentiment analysis — typically accomplished via machine-learning techniques — could place under law enforcement scrutiny speech that is constitutionally protected. Simply stated, a post that is critical or even hostile to ICE isn’t against the law.</p>



<p>“ICE’s attempts to capture and assign a judgement to people’s ‘sentiment’ throughout the expanse of the internet is beyond concerning,” said Cinthya Rodriguez, an organizer with the immigrant rights group Mijente. “The current administration’s attempt to use this technology falls within the agency’s larger history&nbsp;of mass surveillance, which includes gathering information from personal social media accounts and retaliating against immigrant activists. ICE’s attempt to have eyes and ears in as many places as we exist both online and offline should ring an alarm for all of us.”</p>



  



<p>Scanning online speech in the name of homeland security is a <a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/86876/dhss-newest-target-atlanta-cop-city-activists/">bipartisan</a> initiative. The document soliciting contractors appears nearly identical to a procurement document published by ICE in 2020, which resulted in a $5.5 million contract between the agency and Barbaricum, a Washington-based defense and intelligence contractor. A new contract has not yet been awarded. ICE spokesperson Jocelyn Biggs told The Intercept, “While ICE anticipates maintaining its threat risk monitoring services, we cannot speculate on a specific timeline for future contract decisions.”</p>



<!-- BLOCK(newsletter)[2](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22NEWSLETTER%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(newsletter)[2] -->



<p>ICE already has <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-ices-database-derogatory-information-giant-oak-gost/">extensive social media surveillance capabilities</a> provided by federal contractor Giant Oak, which under both Trump’s first term and the Biden administration sought “derogatory” posts about the United States to inform immigration-related decision-making. The goal of this contract, ostensibly, is focused more narrowly on threats to ICE leadership, agents, facilities, and operations.</p>



<p>Civil liberties advocates told The Intercept the program had grave speech implications under the current administration. “While surveillance programs like this under any administration are a concerning privacy and free speech violation and I would fight to stop them, the rhetoric of the Trump administration makes this practice especially terrifying,” said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “Threats to ‘punish’ opponents or deport those exercising 1st Amendment rights combine with these invasive practices to create a real ‘thought police’ scenario.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>In 1992, four college students, Roland Dyroff, Thomas Fehr, Hubert Mantel, and Burchard Steinbild in Fürth, Germany were dreaming of independence. They wanted to chart their own paths, make money for themselves, and have fun doing so. They’d had significant exposure to UNIX at university, and there was a new, free, and open source kernel called Linux from Helsinki. At the same time, there was Peter MacDonald’s Linux distribution, the Softlanding System (SLS), and Patrick Volkerding was publishing fixes for SLS and making them freely available via FTP. Somewhat problematically, most UNIX systems and most Linux systems were exclusively English language oriented. These four students were ready to do something for themselves and they began the process of localizing SLS into German.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png" width="728" height="633.1549295774648" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/bb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:494,&quot;width&quot;:568,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:728,&quot;bytes&quot;:293158,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb37e7c2-cbd3-4891-82e8-415369de4358_568x494.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Burchard Steinbild, Hubert Mantel, Roland Dyroff, Thomas Fehr</figcaption></figure></div><p>On the 2nd of September in 1992, the quartet founded Gesellschaft für Software und Systementwicklung mbH (or S.u.S.E.). In English that would be Software and System Development, but the contraction S.u.S.E. also bore more than a passing similarity to the name of Konrad Zuse who’d built the world’s first programmable and Turing-complete computer (depending upon how one defines this) the Z3 in May of 1941.</p><p><span>Shortly after they began, Patrick Volkerding released </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-slackware" rel="">Slackware Linux</a><span>. Their work then shifted to localizing Slackware, and they managed to obtain assistance in this endeavor from Volkerding. Of course, translations weren’t quite enough to get a company going. They chose to focus on localization, software development, distribution, documentation, and customer support. With the kind of energy seemingly available only to college students, they worked hundred hour weeks, and they sought no outside investment having opted to sell software CD-ROMs and floppies to fund their endeavor (via phone/mail and retail boxes). They were among the first resellers of Yggdrasil, and they also had their semi-localized versions of SLS and Slackware, along with patch sets. While this may not appear to be an obvious path to younger readers today, this was truly a huge service to their customers. The internet wasn’t widespread, and for those who had it, it was slow. Sure, one could download all forty Slackware floppy disk images, but it would take quite a bit of time on a 28.8kbps modem. Then, if someone in the household had needed to make a call, the download would have been interrupted. After that, one needed to have forty blank floppies available, and image each one, one at time. After what may have been intermittent work over the course of a few days, the potential Linux user was then greeted with a command line in a foreign language. The alternative was to call up S.u.S.E. with a number found in an advertisement in a trade magazine and get a CD-ROM for your 386/486 PC that had been localized to your own language. With that, you might also get a manual, again in your own language, that explained how the software system worked and what it was you might need to do to get things fully operational.</span></p><p>In these halcyon days, the young company had no real hierarchy, no regular meetings, no reports, and no bureaucracy. The company operated in a sort of democratic fashion. Being so small, everyone knew everything that was occurring at any given time. If a major decision needed to be made, they’d simply take an informal vote. If they had unanimity, they’d make the change and this meant that the company could change direction in a single night which was when they normally got the most work done.</p><p>In 1994, S.u.S.E released a fully localized version of Slackware Linux 2.0 with some patches and software incorporated from other Linux distributions, S.u.S.E. Linux 1.0. This release was quickly followed by 1.1.27 in July. This was a Linux system with the XFree86 2.1.1, TCP/IP, NFS, kernel 1.0.9, GNU CC 2.5.8 and 2.4.5, and documentation on disc. The system requirements were a 386 with at least 4MB of RAM, but if one intended to use X11 the RAM requirement was a minimum of 8MB. The system supported ISA, EISA, VLB, and PCI, but it did not support MCA.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg" width="1456" height="1132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1132,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:4403305,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6abe3b64-014a-4cdf-bbf9-c59caa8ef3c4_3536x2748.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a><figcaption>S.u.S.E.

He began with writing patches for various UNIX and GNU packages to make them work on the Linux kernel, and he kept these separate from the vanilla sources. He then wrote a script that he placed at </span><code>/usr/bin/pkgpack</code><span> which would collect those patches and apply them prior to compilation. The distribution was shipped as a binary system on five floppy disks, and the first production installation was completed in 1994 at Saarland University for those studying law (Jura is “law” and “ix” is the common suffix for UNIX-like systems). This first install was online at </span><code>jura.uni-sb.de</code><span> and there were several client systems internally. The university used this system to make email, web, and other software available to students. La Roche joined S.u.S.E. in 1995.</span></p><p><span>With La Roche on the team, the company began work on their next major Linux release, but this time, the company was mixing in pieces of Jurix. From what I can tell, this was largely the build system. Slackware has used standardized bash scripts for package creation (these are now known as SlackBuilds), while Jurix had a system that would become AutoBuild, and much later the Open Build Service. Much like the purely Slackware-based S.u.S.E. Linux releases, this version would use a curses menu system for installation, and many users would boot to MS-DOS and then use </span><code>LOADLIN </code><span>to get into the Linux system. However, these similarities can be deceiving. The S.u.S.E. installer was for more polished and far more informative at each step. Version 4.2 (numbered for the answer to life the universe and everything) was released in May of 1996 with the Linux kernel 2.0 and YaST (yet another setup tool) 0.42. This release was on three CD-ROMs with one being the live filesystem and two for the installation.

At that point, the partition changes are written to disk. In my case, this meant that I would need to boot from a floppy. There is an option to create a Linux boot floppy, but I chose to use a Win98 boot floppy instead. This essentially runs through the LOADLIN portion for a second time, after which I restarted the setup, loaded the config for all packages, and proceeded with the installation.</p><div><figure><a

Linux version 5 was released in July of 1997, and that was the version to begin the transition of the distribution to RPMs. Slackware’s TGZs were still supported. That release used kernel 2.0.30, Bash 2.0, Qt 1.2, XFree86 3.3 and FVWM 4.0.45. October of that year saw the release of version 5.1 with the most notable changes being the support of FTP package updates and KDE. This version was five CD-ROMs. Four of these were for the installation, and one was for the LiveCD environment. The final version 5 release was on the 10th of September in 1998, version 5.3 with kernel 2.0.35, KDE 1.0, and Netscape Communicator version 4.05.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Everything is a bit more refined, the installation was far more straight forward, and we can easily see that what has been reported as a complete rebase on Jurix, was truly more of a merger between the Slackware-rooted origin, and the RPM-based Jurix with its automatic build system. We can also see that S.u.S.E. was now evolving into something unique, something gestalt. That said, my installation on a K6-III crashed repeatedly.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

as well as more offices across Europe. Not long after these expansions came new partnerships with IBM, SAP, Compaq, and Oracle. For IBM and Compaq, this partnership included S.u.S.E. offering 24-hour support services. The same year, SuSE began offering servers pre-installed with S.u.S.E. Linux. For 1998, the company moved their corporate office from Fürth to Nürnberg. In 1999, the company opened a branch office in the UK.</p><p>The company released version 6.0 on the 21st of December in 1998, and with this release, the company rebranded as SuSE Linux. Version 6 shipped with kernel 2.0.36, and it saw point release up to 6.4 which released on the 9th of March in 2000. Version 6.4 included YaST2 which was graphical.</p><p>On the 27th of September in 2000, SuSE Linux version 7 was released. SuSE Linux Professional 7.0 consisted of six CD-ROMs and one DVD for those who had a DVD-ROM drive, two floppies for those who couldn’t boot from optical media, a quick install guide, a handbook, a configuration guide, and an applications guide. By this point, like many other commercial Linux distributions, SuSE included StarOffice, Netscape, Acrobat, GIMP, Sane, KDE, and other familiar applications. It had a graphical YaST2 setup tool, ReiserFS and ext2 filesystems, RPM package management, and retailed for $69.99. SuSE Linux Personal lacked many of the proprietary applications and shipped on three CDs. This version saw released for x86, Alpha, PPC, and SPARC. The last of the version 7 systems was 7.3 released on the 23rd of October in 2001.</p><p><span>In the late 1990s, it was becoming obvious that Linux was going to be a major player in the operating system space, and IBM was well aware. The company had been engaging with open source projects like Apache and Linux for their Power and x86 systems, but the idea of running any non-IBM operating system on an IBM mainframe was heresy within the company. Yet, this was something that IBM’s leadership knew needed to happen. To that end, in December of 1998, IBM began a secret project to port Linux and the GNU C toolchain to the S/390 in Böblingen. At this time, the company had no plans to release a distribution of their own, but they hoped to offer a starting point for distribution makers. This effort was released in December of 1999. SuSE was the first company to do anything with this, and their effort would reshape SuSE. They approached IBM in early 2000 with a proof of concept for which they received an orientation on IBM mainframes and a reference system for software development. They used their AutoBuild system to generate packages resulting in 400 or so in the first weekend. They then ported YaST and continued refinements. A major shakeup for SuSE was that this version incorporated some things more similar to Red Hat than to Slackware, such as the directory hierarchy and some file naming conventions. The prior origins could still be seen, but things were a bit more nuanced. The more difficult task for SuSE was really learning about the enterprise market with its low-volume, high reliability, and service intensive nature. On the 31st of October in 2000, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server was born. Linux had come to IBM S/390. SLES for x86 followed in April of 2001, and ports continued for </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-itanic-saga" rel="">Itanium</a><span>, PPC, and zSeries.</span></p><p>By November of 2000, something around 66% of SuSE’s revenues were from Linux CD-ROM sales at retail, online, over the phone. Roughly 24% was from services, and the remaining 8% or so was from hardware sales. The company had around forty developers working on open source software, and this didn’t include people who handled the compiling and packaging into RPMs (release engineers), or those who handled support services. Beyond this, the company contributed both money and talent to projects like ReiserFS, KDE, and the Linux kernel.</p><p><span>The recession of 2001 hit the company hard. First, thirty of the forty five employees at the Oakland office were laid off on the 8th of February in 2001, and the support services previously offered from that office were shifted to Germany. At this time, the company had grown to 470 employees, and they were one of the four major players in enterprise Linux globally (</span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-red-hat" rel="">Red Hat</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-caldera-part-1" rel="">Caldera</a><span>, Turbolinux, and a potential fifth, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-linux-mandrake" rel="">Mandrake</a><span> fighting to make their entry). This move wasn’t quite unexpected. The US and German offices had never really worked together all too well, and the US office had seen four presidents in as many years. Later that year, Johannes Nussbickl took over the CEO role from Roland Dyroff. Nussbickl then went out attempting to secure venture funding, and slashed headcounts a bit further, about a quarter of all staff. Nussbickl was replaced by Richard Seibt the following year.</span></p><p>SuSE Linux 8.0 was released on the 22nd of April in 2002 with Linux kernel 2.4.18, KDE3, KOffice, and several other enhancements. The installer was more automated, had better hardware detection, and YaST2 could detect Windows partitions. Upon the detection of a Windows partition, the installer would suggest changes to hard disk allocation for the installation of SuSE. YaST2 was also much better at configuring the X server with SaX2 (SuSE advanced X configuration). On the media side of things, SuSE 8 included applications for audio mixing, editing, and CD writing. These audio applications were aided by the inclusion of ALSA 0.9 (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) which allowed for the playback of more than one audio stream at a time. Security enhancements also came to SuSE with SuSE Personal Firewall 2, GNU Privacy Guard, OpenSSH, PAM, and IPsec. Version 8 concluded with the release of 8.2 on the 7th of April in 2003.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png" width="1280" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:379246,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50dda119-e3a3-4528-9328-48446b67e654_1280x1024.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>SuSE 8 default desktop</figcaption></figure></div><p>SuSE Linux 9.0 was released on the 15th of October in 2003 with Linux kernel 2.4.21, GNOME 2.2.3, and KDE 3.1.4. This version brought two major changes. First, SuSE Linux 9 was the first distribution to support AMD64. SuSE had reached out to AMD early in the Hammer architecture’s development, and they built an emulator from AMD’s specifications. The company then proceeded to port the entire distribution AMD64 with AutoBuild. When the first hardware arrived at their offices, the system worked flawlessly. The second big addition was support for NTFS (non-root) filesystems.</p><p><span>On the 13th of January in 2004, </span><a href="https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-novell" rel="">Novell</a><span> announced that it had completed its acquisition of SuSE, now styled SUSE, for $210 million in cash. With this completed, IBM then invested $50 million in Novell. This followed Novell’s acquisition of Ximian in 2003. Ximian had developed Ximian Evolution (eMail client), Connector (plugin for Evolution offering MS Exchange support), Red Carpet (RPM-based package manager), Bonobo (MS OLE-like), and Mono (.NET framework for Linux). These acquisitions fundamentally changed Novell. The company’s prior focus on networking products was gone, and the company became, at its core, an enterprise Linux company. That is, it essentially became the SUSE company. For many at the company, this was actually a welcomed change. The company had been on the verge of insolvency for quite sometime, the lay offs were obviously horrible (not just for those who lost jobs, but also for the increased workload for those who remained), and this take over brought some breathing room. </span></p><p>The first release after acquisition was SUSE Linux 9.1 on the 23rd of April in 2004. This version shipped with kernel 2.6.4, GNOME 2.4, and KDE 3.2.1. SUSE 9.1 brought in some visual changes between the personal and professional editions as well. The personal editions maintained the green theming while the professional editions had blue theming.

Xen, the ext3 filesystem, Firefox 2, and NetworkManager. To my knowledge, this was the first major inclusion of Xen in any Linux system. Both enterprise server and desktop versions of 10 were released in July of 2006, and the Novell Linux Desktop was dropped in favor of SUSE Linux Enterprise Deskstop. Version bumps and the name change to openSUSE arrived with 10.2 on the 7th of Decemer in 2006. The final version 10 release was made on the 4th of October in 2007 with 10.3 featuring kernel 2.6.22, GNOME 2.12, KDE 3.5.1, and XFCE 4.4.1. This version also included a preview release of KDE4 Beta 2. On the enterprise side, updates were shipped in Service Packs with SP4, the final version 10 service pack, having shipped on the 15th of April in 2011.</p><p>In November of 2006, Microsoft and Novell signed an intellectual property agreement that involved immunity over patent litigation and freed SUSE Linux users over any possibility of lawsuits from Microsoft. This followed claims from Microsoft that Linux systems were in violation of 235 patents without any disclosure over what those violations were. While some in the community viewed this negatively and were quite vocal about it, this did gain some piece of mind for SUSE to include things like Exchange support, MS Office file format support, and interoperability between the two companies’ directory implementations. This would prove to have lasting effects on both the wider Linux ecosystem and on Microsoft. In the following years, improvements in MS Office support would proliferate, Active Directory support would be common, and Microsoft’s Azure would have Linux support. Microsoft even made SQL Server, VS Code, and Powershell available on Linux.</p><p><span>openSUSE 11 was released on the 19th of June 2008. This version introduced ZYpp (Zen/YaST Packages Patches Patterns Products) for package management. The command for invocation was </span><code>zypper</code><span> and ZYpp was implemented primarily in C++ under the GPLv2. Of course, this is SUSE, so the graphical ZYpp implementation was YaST. The new package manager would hit 1.0 with openSUSE 11.1’s release on the 18th of December in 2008. ZYpp was later adopted by Ark, Meego, Sailfish, and Tizen. Version 11.2 came on the 12th of November in 2009 and introduced the ext4 filesystem and preliminary support for Btrfs, full disk encryption, and support for USB boot with all ISOs. Version 11.3 was released on the 15th of July in 2010 and brought LXDE to SUSE. The final version 11 system, 11.4, was released on the 3rd of March in 2011. It moved SUSE from OpenOffice to LibreOffice, and brought Firefox 4 to the distribution. The enterprise Linux variants shipped on the 24th of March in 2009 with the inclusion of some proprietary software like Flash, Moonlight, Mono, AD support, and Exchange Server integration.</span></p><p>On the 22nd of November in 2010, Novell and Attachmate announced that Novell would be acquired by Attachmate. Jeff Hawn, chairman and CEO of Attachmate, commented:</p><blockquote><p><em>The openSUSE project is an important part of the SUSE business. As noted in the agreement announced today, Attachmate plans to operate SUSE as a stand-alone business unit after the transaction closes. If this transaction closes, then after closing, Attachmate Corporation anticipates no change to the relationship between the SUSE business and the openSUSE project as a result of this transaction.</em></p></blockquote><p>On the 30th of April in 2011, Attachmate completed their acquisition of Novell. On Monday, the 2nd of May, eight hundred employees were laid off. </p><p>openSUSE 12.1 came into the world on the 16th of November in 2011 with kernel 3.1.0, GNOME 3.2, and KDE 4.7. This release also included Snapper for Btrfs snapshot management, and systemd for the init system. System V init was still available to users should they want it. Version 12.2 hit on the 5th of September in 2012 with KDE Plasma 4.8, GNOME 3.4, XFCE 4.10, Firefox 14, Plymouth, GRUB 2, and kernel 3.4.6. Version 12.3, the final for the 12 series, released on the 13th of March in 2013. This version gave version bumps to most software, did away with LiveCDs in favor of USB images, and introduced a “rescue” image with XFCE. </p><p>openSUSE version 13.1 was released on the 19th of November in 2013 with kernel 3.11.6, GNOME 3.10, KDE Plasma 4.11.2, Firefox 25, LibreOffice 4.1, experimental Wayland support, and YaST rewritten in Ruby. SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 was built on openSUSE 13, and it shipped on the 28th of October in 2014. openSUSE 13.2 followed on the 4th of November in 2014 with version bumps across the board. That same month, the openSUSE project introduced openSUSE Tumbleweed. This is a rolling release distribution with periodic snapshots made into installable images for i686, AMD64, ARM 64, PPC64, IBM zSystems, KVM, Xen, HyperV, and public and private cloud. Live system images are available with GNOME, KDE, XFCE, and rescue.</p><p>On the 20th of November in 2014, Micro Focus completed its acquisition of Attachmate. Under Micro Focus, SUSE was operated independently from the rest of the organization with its own products. Nils Brauckmann became CEO of SUSE and gained a board seat at Micro Focus.</p><p>With rolling releases now available, the traditional openSUSE system became openSUSE Leap. The first release of Leap hearkened back to the distribution’s history with version 42.1 becoming available on the 4th of November in 2015. This system was based off of enterprise 12 SP1. With another reference to history, Leap brought about a return to KDE as the default desktop with KDE Plasma 5.8. The 42 series saw two updated releases with 42.2 on the 16th of November in 2016, and 42.3 on the 26th of July in 2017. These later releases were based off of SP2 and SP3 respectively.</p><p>On the 25th of May in 2018, SUSE released Leap 15 with SUSE Linux Enterprise following on the 25th of June. These were built on the same codebase with GNOME 3.26, LibreOffice 6, GCC 7, Wayland as the display server, and kernel 4.12. Updates of this release are the current offering as of this writing.</p><p>Micro Focus sold SUSE to EQT AB on the 2nd of July in 2018 for $2.535 billion. Melissa Di Donato became CEO on the 22nd of July in 2019. SUSE finally went public on the Frankfurt stock exchange on the 19th of May in 2021. The company was valued at about $6.1 billion on the first day of trading. Di Donato resigned on the 21st of March in 2023 with Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen being appointed as CEO. On the 17th of August in 2023, EQT delisted SUSE. On the 13th of November in 2023, SUSE merged with Marcel New Lux IV S.A. and the combined entity became SUSE S.A.</p><p>I now have readers from many of the companies whose history I cover, and many of you were present for time periods I cover.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple is feeling the heat over its acclaimed iPhone privacy policy after a German regulator's review of iOS tracking consent alleged that the tech giant exempted itself from the rules it enforces on third-party developers.</p>
<p>In a preliminary legal assessment of Apple's App Tracking Transparency framework (ATTF), Germany's competition watchdog <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/SharedDocs/Meldung/EN/Pressemitteilungen/2025/02_13_2025_ATTF.html?nn=48916">said</a> the "strict requirements under the ATTF only apply to third-party app providers, not to Apple itself."</p>
<p>It is a common tactic to track users across devices – sometimes by a free app dev trying to get paid a premium for "profiled" ads, sometimes by a technical vendor selling services to the ad industry or a content provider that traditionally would have run print ads, like a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/uk_newspaper_apple/">newspaper</a>. Whether or not users know it is happening and agree to it is probably a better question.</p>
<div><p><img src="https://regmedia.co.uk/2024/05/14/shutterstock_uk_newspapers.jpg?x=174&amp;amp;y=115&amp;amp;crop=1" width="174" height="115" alt="A collection of UK national daily newspapers"></p><h2 title="Breaking news, perhaps literally: AI content blocking tool in Safari for iOS">Brit publishers beg Apple not to hurt online ad revenue</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/uk_newspaper_apple/"><span>READ MORE</span></a></p></div>
<p>Since 2021, when Apple set up the iOS ATTF, app devs have had to ask ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ users for their consent before applications could track their activity across other apps such as Facebook. Facebook owner Meta had a problem with this, especially when a 2022 ATTF update began to preclude advertisers from using data across their own platforms. This practice is known as "first-party" tracking as opposed to "third-party" tracking.</p>
<p>As one programmatic ad news outlet <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/how-facebook-is-overhauling-its-attribution-standards-to-deal-with-apples-att/">pointed out</a>, Facebook was actually hit the hardest by the 2022 first-party rules because its software development kit (SDK) "plugged into so many outside apps and ... its attribution pixels [were] littered liberally across the web." This meant that when an iPhone user with the latest ATTF update was on Instagram, data could not be collected on what the user was doing on Facebook, and vice versa.</p>

    

<p>Meta was so worried about this that it chalked up a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/03/facebook_q4_2021/">$10 billion hole</a> in potential ad sales to the move, with CFO Dave Wehner saying in a February <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2021/q4/Meta-Q4-2021-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf">2022 earnings call</a> [PDF] discussing its full-year 2021 results: "We believe the impact of iOS overall as a headwind on our business in 2022 is on the order of $10 billion."</p>

        


        

<p>Judging by what the Bundeskartellamt said of its preliminary findings, though, Apple's "comprehensive digital ecosystem" appears to suffer less degradation in cross-tracking.</p>
<p>The Federal Cartel Office claims that Apple's ATTF defines "tracking" in a way that only covers data processing for advertising purposes across companies – but that these "strict ... rules do not cover Apple's own practice of combining user data across its ecosystem – from its App Store, Apple ID and connected devices – and using them for advertising purposes."</p>

</ul>
<p>Additionally, it says the consent dialogues for Apple's apps differ "substantially" from those of third-party apps. The current design, particularly the wording of the dialogue for Apple's own apps, makes it "more likely that users will consent than that of the ATTF dialogue for third-party apps."</p>
<p>It also claims that people using third-party apps will see up to four consecutive consent prompts, while Apple apps receive only a "maximum of two," which do not properly explain that Apple's processing of user data across services constitutes first-party tracking.</p>

        

<p>Apple has been under extra scrutiny in Germany since April 2023, when the regulator determined that Apple had "cross-market significance for competition," meaning it is now subject to "extended abuse control." Apple appealed to the Federal Court of Justice over this on January 28. The court's decision will be delivered on March 18.</p>
<p>Andreas Mundt, President of the Federal Cartel Office, said: "Apple operates a comprehensive digital ecosystem, which, through its many services and connected devices, the App Store and Apple ID, provides Apple with extensive access to user data relevant for advertising. Apple uses some of these data to offer advertising space for personalized advertising in its App Store, generating significant revenues."</p>
<p>He said advertising was also of "great commercial significance for other companies wishing to offer free apps, some of which compete with Apple's own services, in the App Store." Those providers do not have a "wealth of broad and deep user data to draw on" like Apple does, he added.</p>

        

<p>"For us, it is key that users can make a free and informed decision about whether or not their data may be used for personalized advertising at all. The question at hand is whether Apple is allowed to apply stricter criteria to other providers than to itself when it comes to requesting such user consent. In our preliminary view, doing so may amount to unequal treatment and self-preferencing, which are prohibited under competition law."</p>
<p>Apple had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>I propose that the advent and integration of AI models into the workflows of developers has stifled the adoption of new and potentially superior technologies due to training data cutoffs and system prompt influence.</p>
<p>I have noticed a bias towards specific technologies in multiple popular models and have noted anecdotally in conversation and online discussion people choosing technology based on how well AI tooling can assist with its usage or implementation.</p>
<p>While it has long been the case that developers have considered documentation and support availability when choosing software, AI’s influence dramatically amplifies this factor in decision-making, often in ways that aren’t immediately apparent and with undisclosed influence.</p>
<h2 id="the-knowledge-gap">The Knowledge Gap</h2>
<p>Large language models, especially those on the scale of many of the most accessible, popular hosted options, take humongous datasets and long periods to train. By the time everything has been scraped and a dataset has been built, the set is on some level already obsolete. Then, before a model can reach the hands of consumers, time must be taken to train and evaluate it, and then even more to finally deploy it.</p>
<p>Once it has finally released, it usually remains stagnant in terms of having its knowledge updated. This creates an AI knowledge gap. A period between the present and AI’s training cutoff. This gap creates a time between when a new technology emerges and when AI systems can effectively support user needs regarding its adoption, meaning that models will not be able to service users requesting assistance with new technologies, thus disincentivising their use.</p>
<p>The cutoff means that models are strictly limited in knowledge up to a certain point. For instance, Anthropic’s latest models have a cutoff of <a href="https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/8114494-how-up-to-date-is-claude-s-training-data">April 2024</a>, and OpenAI’s latest models have cutoffs of <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models">late 2023</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of the popularisation of AI models has also led to the proliferation of AI slop content, which AI companies are likely trying to avoid introducing in their scraped data sets – potentially increasing this knowledge gap.</p>
<p>This knowledge gap doesn’t just stifle the adoption of new frameworks and tooling but also the adoption of new and potentially superior features introduced in updates to already in-use frameworks and tooling as a result of the models not yet including information about them in their training set. This is a lesser issue though, because a technology with existing market adoption is bound to have fanatics who will use it, create examples, and produce blog posts, documentation, and other media about it that will eventually end up in training data.</p>
<p>While some models are used in contexts where they are equipped with tooling, such as ChatGPT with its internet search capabilities, their prompts often only instruct them to use this functionality when explicitly requested by a user. Of course, plenty of implementations don’t have any access to any internet query functionality at all, such as Claude via its web interface, which will inform you it will only discuss things included in its training data.</p>
<p>Of course, if people are reluctant to adopt a new technology because of a lack of AI support, there will be fewer people likely to produce material regarding said technology, which leads to an overall inverse feedback effect. Lack of AI support prevents a technology from gaining the required critical adoption mass, which in turn prevents a technology from entering use and having material made for it, which in turn starves the model of training data, which in turn disincentivises selecting that technology, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Consider a developer working with a cutting-edge JavaScript framework released just months ago. When they turn to AI coding assistants for help, they find these tools unable to provide meaningful guidance because their training data predates the framework’s release. This forces developers to rely solely on potentially limited official documentation and early adopter experiences, which, for better or worse, tends to be an ‘old’ way of doing things and incentivises them to use something else.</p>
<h2 id="system-prompt-influence">System Prompt Influence</h2>
<p>I’ve anecdotally noticed that many AI tools have a ‘preference’ for React and Tailwind when asked to tackle a web-based task, or even to create any app involving an interface at all.</p>
<p>With Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which is generally my AI offering of choice given its superior coding ability, my “What personal preferences should Claude consider in responses?” profile setting includes the line “When writing code, use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless otherwise noted by me”. Despite this, Claude will <em>frequently</em> opt to generate new code with React, and in some occurrences even rewrite my existing code into React against my intent and without my consultation.</p>
<p>While Anthropic <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/system-prompts">publishes Claude’s core system prompts</a>, they do not publish the system prompts of specific features, such as artifacts. However, a <a href="https://github.com/jujumilk3/leaked-system-prompts/blob/main/claude-artifacts_20240620.md">leaked system prompt</a> for Claude’s artifacts feature shows that both React and Tailwind are specifically mentioned with explicit instruction on how they should be handled. It also specifically mentions the diagramming tool <a href="http://mermaid.js.org/">Mermaid</a> and a set of React libraries, including <a href="https://recharts.org/">Recharts</a>, <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">shadcn/ui</a>, and <a href="https://lucide.dev/">Lucide icons</a>, as well as <a href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare’s cdnjs</a>.</p>
<p>This can be evidenced when asking Claude to use a certain technology, such as Svelte Runes, where it will instead direct the user towards its preferred technology. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Build me something with Svelte Runes.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Claude:</strong> I apologize, but I am not able to create Svelte Runes components directly, as the artifact environment only supports certain technologies like React, HTML, and SVG. I can help you build something similar using React, or I can provide you with Svelte Runes code that you can use in your own Svelte project. Which would you prefer?</p>
<p>If you’d like to see a React version, I can create something with similar reactive functionality using React’s hooks. Or if you want Svelte Runes code specifically, I can write that for you to use in your own environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does provide a choice, but chances are someone will select <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_of_least_resistance">the path of least resistance</a>.</p>
<h3 id="testing">Testing</h3>
<p>To test if popular models do have built-in bias for React, I logged into the web interfaces of four of the current most popular AI chat platforms<sup><a id="footnote-ref-1" href="#footnote-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> via my free account and asked the models to “Create me a web app. It can do anything.”. I repeated this with each of the four models three times in fresh chats with previous chats deleted and any shared context (such as ChatGPT’s memory feature) disabled or cleared between each test.</p>
<p>I asked Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet with blank personal preferences and artifacts enabled. The first time it opted to create a mood tracking app, the second a reading list manager, and the third time a to-do list. Each time it chose to generate it using React with Tailwind CSS for styling. It generated each project in an artifact which offered an interactive preview directly in the interface.</p>
<p>I asked OpenAI’s ChatGPT 4o with both custom instructions and memory disabled. It produced a note-taking app the first time, a random quote generator the second time, and a to-do list the third time. All using React with Tailwind for styling and presented in <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-canvas">canvases</a>. These canvases came with a preview button, which, much like with Claude, offered an interactive preview of the React project it built directly in the interface.</p>
<p>I asked Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash with app activity disabled. All three times it built to-do list apps using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each time, it also noted that I should consider using JavaScript frameworks on the frontend, namely React, Angular, and Vue - in that order.</p>
<p>I asked DeepSeek’s DeepSeek-V3, and it returned a to-do list app using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On the second request, it created a project outline for a to-do list app, but this time with Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, and SQLite. The third time, it created another outline for a note-taking app but with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.</p>
<p>DeepSeek had the greatest variation in technology used but is the least accessible model and didn’t actually ‘create’ the app as requested – merely a general outline for it.</p>
<p>These tests show both Claude and ChatGPT have a strong preference for React and Tailwind, <sup><a id="footnote-ref-2" href="#footnote-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup> that Gemini has a preference for HTML/CSS/JS but will recommend React and that DeepSeek is much more flexible and varied with its technological choices, though requires more prompting to produce an actual output.</p>
<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>I’d suggest that a beginner developer, or someone creating an app exclusively via prompting, is likely to use ChatGPT due to its position in the zeitgeist and use whatever output the model first produces without much second thought – thus influencing their tech selection without their realising.</p>
<p>Even if a developer does opt to use another framework or toolset, there is a chance that the model will prod them towards a selection more aligned with its system prompt, even going as far as rewriting their code to its ‘preference’ against user request, as evidenced by Claude ignoring my request for vanilla web technologies.</p>
<p>That is assuming that a specific framework or toolset hasn’t already been chosen by the user specifically because they have heard or experienced it being best handled by AI models. Also, while this very much applies to larger technical choices, such as what framework or general tooling a project may choose, it also trickles down into smaller decisions, such as what libraries or modules they may import.</p>
<p>I think it is evident that AI models are influencing technology, and that the technologies currently in use – especially those that reached popularity before November 2022, when ChatGPT was released, or that are otherwise in current data sets – will be around for a long time to come, and that AI models’ preferential treatment of them will expand their adoption and lifespan.</p>
<p>I think it would be prudent for AI companies to provide more transparent documentation of technology biases in their models, like they disclose that their models can make mistakes. These models are becoming a common part of developer knowledge and decision-making, and we’re letting the training and prompting decisions of OpenAI, Anthropic, etc shape the entire direction of software development.</p>
<p>As for further research on this topic, if one had a collection of system prompts over time, it may be possible to compare them to download trends of specified packages and identify correlations. Of course, there are a lot of other influences on the download and adoption of packages, so this may prove difficult and provide data too noisy and influenced by outside variables to be unusable.</p>

<p>We’ve been upgrading the operating system from CentOS to Ubuntu on hosts across our fleet. Our CentOS hosts run an outdated Linux kernel version (3.10), whereas our Ubuntu hosts run a more modern kernel version (6.8). In August 2024, we began rolling out the Ubuntu upgrade across our Apache web servers. When we migrated larger portions of our fleet to Ubuntu, we began seeing elevated listen overflow errors. This elevated error rate prompted us to roll back the Ubuntu upgrade while we debugged:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i1.png" alt="graph of web server listen overflows"></p>
<h2 id="what-are-listen-overflows">
  
  
    What are listen overflows? <a href="#what-are-listen-overflows">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Apache listens on a socket for incoming web requests. When incoming requests arrive more quickly than Apache can serve them, the queue of requests waiting to be served grows longer. This queue is capped to a configurable size. When the queue overflows its maximum size, we have a <em>listen overflow</em>.</p>

<p>Listen overflows are a symptom of either of two things: the rate of incoming web requests is too high, and / or Apache is serving web requests too slowly.</p>

<p>Each listen overflow that occurs means we failed to serve a web request. This can result in user-facing errors. Furthermore, if the listen overflows are a symptom of web requests being served slowly, it means users may be experiencing slow page loads.</p>
<h2 id="whats-causing-listen-overflows">
  
  
    What’s causing listen overflows? <a href="#whats-causing-listen-overflows">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Listen overflows occurred a few minutes after a newly autoscaled web server was pooled. They did not tend to recur subsequently. Furthermore, web requests had elevated latency during this same time period:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i2.png" alt="web server listen overflow and web request latency graphs"></p>

<p>We believed listen overflows were occurring because web requests served in the first few minutes after the host was pooled were being served unusually slowly.</p>

</h2>
    

<p>Log lines, <code>strace</code> timing information, and <a href="https://github.com/adsr/phpspy"><code>phpspy</code></a> flame graphs showed that network operations were executing particularly slowly. But investigating further, we found evidence that the network was performing normally. Instead, PHP had seemingly stalled for over a second. The below log line indicates that a memcached SET command was slow, but network packet captures on both the client and the server that we analyzed in Wireshark indicate that the SET command experienced normal network latency. The client waited over 1 second before sending the subsequent GET command, as if our PHP script stalled after the packet was received but before we recorded the elapsed time.</p>

<p><code>[Tue Sep 24 21:20:54 2024] [info] Memcached operation exceeded 20ms :operation="set" <b>latency="1354.68292236"</b> key="warmup_key_7746_2"</code></p>

</h2>
    

<p>Adding on to the evidence pointing away from network problems, we saw a large spike in system CPU usage about four minutes after newly autoscaled hosts were booted. If we waited until after this spike in system CPU to pool the hosts, we experienced no listen overflows. This spike in system CPU only occurred on Ubuntu hosts – CentOS did not have this problem:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i4.png" alt="system CPU graph"></p>

<p>This made us realize that the problems we were seeing were unrelated to pooling the hosts – the spike in system CPU occurred regardless of whether the hosts were pooled. During the spike in system CPU, we saw logs in <code>dmesg</code>:</p>

<p><code>workqueue: inode_switch_wbs_work_fn hogged CPU for &gt;10000us 4 times, consider switching to WQ_UNBOUND</code></p>

<p>And <code>htop</code> showed kernel workers were using lots of CPU in a function <code>inode_switch_wbs</code>:</p>

<p><img src="https://dasl.cc/assets/posts/2025-01-01-debugging-our-new-linux-kernel/i5.png" alt="htop screenshot"></p>

<p>We made a <code>perf</code> recording demonstrating that when system CPU spikes, the kernel is busy inside <code>inode_switch_wbs_work_fn</code>:</p>

    Why did we initially suspect the network? <a href="#why-did-we-initially-suspect-the-network">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Our logs and profiling tools showed that network operations were executing particularly slowly. However, when CPU is busy, network operations may appear to slow down disproportionately. Network calls require CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch">context switches</a> (I think?). After a process blocked on network receives a response, the process may spend a long time waiting in the CPU <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_queue">run queue</a> before it gets scheduled again when the CPU is busy. Network operations that appear slow at the user space level may be a symptom of CPU busyness.</p>

<p>Although there can be cases where this is not true, it has been my experience that when the network is the cause of slowness, CPU usage on client hosts is often lower than normal. When the client is blocked waiting for the network, it is often more idle. In retrospect, perhaps the fact that elevated CPU was one of the symptoms we were seeing should have pointed us away from network issues.</p>

<p>We believed something in the kernel function <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/fs/fs-writeback.c#L490"><code>inode_switch_wbs_work_fn</code></a> was causing elevated system CPU. This function is in a file <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/fs/fs-writeback.c"><code>fs-writeback.c</code></a>, which contains functions related to the <a href="https://github.com/firmianay/Life-long-Learner/blob/master/linux-kernel-development/chapter-16.md">writeback functionality of the Linux page cache</a>. We knew that system CPU was elevated about four minutes after new hosts were booted. One of the first things a new host does is download the latest code – this is part of our host bootstrapping process and involves writing thousands of files to disk. We wondered if the process of flushing the dirty pages to disk was causing the elevated system CPU. While we did not see elevated disk write metrics during the system CPU spike, we decided to test this theory. We added a <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sync.1.html"><code>sync</code></a> call after the <code>rsync</code> command that downloads the code on new hosts. In theory, that should synchronously write the dirty pages in the page cache to disk. Perhaps by controlling when the page cache was flushed to disk, we could control when the spike in system CPU occurred and ensure that it occurred before we pooled the host. This attempt, however, was unsuccessful. We saw no spike in system CPU when calling <code>sync</code>. Furthermore, we still saw the spike in system CPU a minute or two later.</p>

<p>We were back to the drawing board. As we mentioned above, one of the first things a new host does is download the latest code. This process is called <code>setupwebroot</code>, and it runs as a <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.service.html">systemd oneshot</a> service. We found something perplexing: if we prevented the <code>setupwebroot</code> service from running, we never saw the spike in system CPU. And if we subsequently ran the <code>setupwebroot</code> service manually, we would see the spike in system CPU a couple minutes later. This implies that something in <code>setupwebroot</code> was the cause of the issues. However, if we ran the <code>rsync</code> command in <code>setupwebroot</code> manually in our interactive shell, we saw no spikes in system CPU. This apparent contradiction led us on a wild goose chase of trying to determine if some systemd service that was dependent on <code>setupwebroot</code> was the cause of the elevated system CPU, or if there was some subtle difference in the way we were running the commands in our shell versus how systemd was running the commands.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-inode-cgroup-switching-yes">
  
  
    Is it inode cgroup switching? (yes) <a href="#is-it-inode-cgroup-switching-yes">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>Each of the thousands of files that is written by the <code>setupwebroot</code> service has a corresponding <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/ext4/inodes.html">index node</a>, also known as an inode, that the kernel uses to store file metadata. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.0/admin-guide/cgroup-v2.html#control-group-v2">Control groups</a>, also known as cgroups, are a feature of Linux which allows for setting per process limits on system resources. For example, cgroups allow us to limit a given process from consuming too much memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth, etc. Every process belongs to a cgroup. Cgroups form a tree-like hierarchical structure. Processes in a given cgroup are given limits both by the cgroup to which they belong and that cgroup’s parents.</p>

<p>In the context of cgroups, page cache writeback is tracked at the inode level. A given inode is assigned to whichever cgroup contains the process that is responsible for the majority of writes to the inode’s file. If a new process starts writing a lot to a file, the file’s inode may switch to the new process’s cgroup. Likewise, if a process managed by systemd is terminated, systemd will <a href="https://systemd.io/CGROUP_DELEGATION/#controller-support">remove the process’s cgroup</a>, at which point any inodes assigned to the process’s cgroup will be moved to the parent cgroup.</p>

<em>Initially, inodes are assigned to <code>setupwebroot</code>’s cgroup</em></p>

<em><code>setupwebroot</code> finishes. Systemd removes its cgroup, and inodes are moved to the parent cgroup</em></p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/fs/fs-writeback.c#L490"><code>inode_switch_wbs_work_fn</code></a> that we believed was causing the elevated system CPU is responsible for moving an inode from one cgroup to another in the context of writeback. We got more insight by running this <a href="https://github.com/bpftrace/bpftrace"><code>bpftrace</code></a> command on a newly booted host:</p>

<div><pre><code>% sudo bpftrace -e '
tracepoint:writeback:inode_switch_wbs {
  printf(
    "[%s] inode is switching! inode: %d old cgroup: %d new cgroup: %d\n",
    strftime("%H:%M:%S", nsecs),
    args-&gt;ino,
    args-&gt;old_cgroup_ino,
    args-&gt;new_cgroup_ino
  );
}'
</code></pre></div>

<p>During the spike in system CPU, we saw thousands of these lines printed out by the <code>bpftrace</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code>[20:49:30] inode is switching! inode: 3730800 old cgroup: 22438 new cgroup: 88
[20:49:30] inode is switching! inode: 3730799 old cgroup: 22438 new cgroup: 88
...

</code></pre></div>

<p>Each line corresponds to a file written by <code>setupwebroot</code> that was switching from <code>setupwebroot</code>’s dying cgroup to the parent cgroup. The old cgroup identifier (<code>22438)</code> corresponds to <code>setupwebroot</code>’s cgroup. The new cgroup identifier (<code>88</code>) corresponds to the parent cgroup.</p>

<p>The <code>bpftrace</code> command prints out data from a <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/fs/fs-writeback.c#L415">kernel tracepoint</a> in the Linux kernel’s <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/906bd684e4b1e517dd424a354744c5b0aebef8af/include/trace/events/writeback.h#L216-L243">writeback code</a>. The fields available to print in this tracepoint can be viewed via:</p>
<div><pre><code>% sudo cat /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/writeback/inode_switch_wbs/format

</code></pre></div>

<p>We found that when we added a <code>sleep 3600</code> to the end of the script that <code>setupwebroot</code> executes, we could delay the spike in system CPU by one hour. Because systemd only removes a service’s cgroup when its process exits, the <code>sleep</code> delayed when inodes switched from one cgroup to another.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix">
  
  
    The fix <a href="#the-fix">#</a>
  
  
</h2>
    

<p>We found a systemd directive that allows us to turn off certain cgroup accounting features: <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.resource-control.html#Control%20Group%20Management"><code>DisableControllers</code></a>. If either the <code>io</code> or <code>memory</code> controllers are disabled, the kernel <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/c291c9cfd76a8fb92ef3d66567e507009236ce90/include/linux/backing-dev.h#L172">will not</a> perform cgroup writeback or any of the related accounting and cgroup switching. We found that by creating a systemd <a href="https://gist.github.com/dasl-/87b849625846aed17f1e4841b04ecc84#file-dasl-slice-L5">slice with those controllers disabled</a> and configuring <code>setupwebroot</code>’s unit file to <a href="https://gist.github.com/dasl-/06ced03d4b905fd79d8d58283ecaf67d#file-setupwebroot-service-L7">use that slice</a>, we could no longer reproduce the elevated system CPU. We had solved our performance issue.</p>

<p>No more system CPU spike and no more listen overflows:

<p>We came up with a minimal reproduction of the issue:</p>

<p><code>$ sudo mkdir -p /var/random-files &amp;&amp; sudo systemd-run --property=Type=oneshot bash -c 'dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1024 count=400000 | split -a 16 -b 1k - /var/random-files/file.'</code></p>

<p>This command creates 400,000 files, each consisting of 1,024 random bytes. The files have names like <code>/var/random-files/file.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</code> and <code>/var/random-files/file.aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab</code>. This command is run as a systemd oneshot service. Within anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 minutes after this command finishes, we see a spike in system CPU. Viewing <code>htop</code> will confirm this (press <code>shift + k</code> to show kernel threads in <code>htop</code>) – we see kernel workers using lots of CPU in the function <code>inode_switch_wbs</code>.</p>

    Why wasn’t CentOS affected? <a href="#why-wasnt-centos-affected">#</a>

<p>The initial release of <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html">cgroups</a>, known as cgroups v1, was in kernel version 2.6.24. Cgroups v1 has since been replaced by a new implementation: cgroups v2. Cgroups v2 was officially released in kernel version 4.5. Our old CentOS operating system used kernel version 3.10. We believe this inode switching CPU issue is related to the <code>io</code> and <code>memory</code> controllers introduced in cgroups v2. Thus CentOS, which uses cgroups v1, is not vulnerable to this issue.</p>

<p><a href="#is-it-writeback-no">Recall</a> that when we ran the <code>rsync</code> command from <code>setupwebroot</code> manually in our interactive shell, we saw no spike in system CPU. It turns out that each interactive ssh session you have open creates its own cgroup. Below is the output of <code>systemd-cgls</code> on a web server on which I have two interactive ssh sessions open. One session is running a <code>sleep 100</code> command, and the other session is running <code>systemd-cgls</code>. The two cgroups are called <code>session-17450.scope</code> and <code>session-17455.scope</code>:</p>

<pre>% sudo systemd-cgls

</pre>

<p>These <code>session-*.scope</code> cgroups stick around until you terminate your ssh session. After terminating your ssh session, systemd removes the corresponding cgroup. With this insight, we tested terminating the interactive ssh session after manually running the <code>rsync</code> commands. Sure enough, about 2 minutes after we terminated the ssh session, we saw the big spikes in system CPU caused by inode cgroup switching.</p>

<p>We suspected that this performance issue was caused by either the hypervisor or the kernel. We shared our findings with Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. Canonical confirmed that it is a kernel issue that was likely introduced by a Linux kernel commit from 2021. More details are available in the <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-oem-6.5/+bug/2038492">public bug report</a>, in which I have commented. We are hopeful that Canonical will engage with the Linux kernel developers and eventually fix this performance issue.</p>

<p>The doge.gov website that was spun up to track Elon Musk’s cuts to the federal government is insecure and pulls from a database that can be edited by anyone, according to two separate people who found the vulnerability and shared it with 404 Media. One coder added at least two database entries that are visible on the live site and say “<a href="https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=1&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>this is a joke of a .gov site</u></a>” and “<a href="https://doge.gov/workforce?orgId=7cd300eb-cf3f-47f5-90f1-9e66a8bc8d07&amp;ref=404media.co"><u>THESE ‘EXPERTS’ LEFT THEIR DATABASE OPEN -roro</u></a>.”&nbsp;</p><p>Doge.gov was hastily deployed after Elon Musk <a href="https://www.404media.co/elon-musks-waste-gov-is-just-a-wordpress-theme-placeholder-page/"><u>told reporters Tuesday</u></a> that his Department of Government Efficiency is “trying to be as transparent as possible. In fact, our actions—we post our actions to the DOGE handle on X, and to the DOGE website.” At the time, DOGE was an essentially blank webpage. It was built out further Wednesday and Thursday, and now shows a mirror of the @DOGE X account posts, as well as various stats about the U.S. government’s federal workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>Two different web development experts who asked to remain anonymous because they were probing a federal website told 404 Media that doge.gov is seemingly built on a Cloudflare Pages site that is not currently hosted on government servers. The database it is pulling from can be and has been written to by third parties, and will show up on the live website.&nbsp;</p><p>Both sources told 404 Media that they noticed Doge.gov is pulling from a Cloudflare Pages website, where the code that runs it is actually deployed.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces an open-source benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tasks in dynamic video environments. We present a curated dataset containing 1,477 manually annotated frames spanning diverse domains, including code editors, news broadcasts, YouTube videos, and advertisements. Three state of the art VLMs - Claude-3, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o are benchmarked against traditional OCR systems such as EasyOCR and RapidOCR. Evaluation metrics include Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and Accuracy. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of VLMs in video-based OCR tasks, demonstrating their potential to outperform conventional OCR models in many scenarios. However, challenges such as hallucinations, content security policies, and sensitivity to occluded or stylized text remain. The dataset and benchmarking framework are publicly available to foster further research.

      <p>Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.</p>
<h2 id="webassembly-and-the-webassembly-system-interface">WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface</h2>
<p><a href="https://webassembly.org/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
<a href="https://wasi.dev/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.</p>
<p>Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
<code>js/wasm</code> port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new <code>GOOS=wasip1</code> port.</p>
<h2 id="exporting-go-functions-to-wasm-with-gowasmexport">Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with <code>go:wasmexport</code></h2>
<p>Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, <code>go:wasmexport</code>, which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/modules.html?highlight=export#exports" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">export</a>
in the resulting Wasm binary.</p>
<p>To use the <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive, simply add it to a function definition:</p>
<pre><code>//go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
</code></pre>
<p>With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named <code>add</code> that
can be called from the host.</p>
<p>This is analogous to the <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/cgo#hdr-C_references_to_Go">cgo <code>export</code> directive</a>,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though <code>go:wasmexport</code> uses a different, simpler mechanism.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-wasi-reactor">Building a WASI Reactor</h2>
<p>A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.</p>
<p>With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the <code>-buildmode=c-shared</code> build
flag.</p>
<pre><code>$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
</code></pre>
<p>The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the <code>_start</code> function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
<code>_initialize</code> function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The <code>_initialize</code> function must be called before any other exported functions.
The <code>main</code> function will not be automatically invoked.</p>
<p>To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
<code>_initialize</code>, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using <a href="https://wazero.io/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Wazero</a>, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:</p>
<pre><code>// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>go:wasmexport</code> directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.</p>
<h2 id="supporting-rich-types-between-the-host-and-the-client">Supporting rich types between the host and the client</h2>
<p>Go 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with <code>go:wasmimport</code> functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an <code>int32</code>, or a
pointer to a struct which embeds <code>structs.HostLayout</code> and contains supported
field types
(see the <a href="https://go.dev/cmd/compile#hdr-WebAssembly_Directives">documentation</a> for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.</p>
<p>Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A <code>go:wasmexport</code> function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the <code>go:wasmexport</code> function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.</p>
<p>While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with <code>go:wasmimport</code> and
<code>go:wasmexport</code> functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a <code>go:wasmimport</code> function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction">https://zed.dev/blog/edit-prediction</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43045606">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Zed is built for speed. We've always strived for an editing experience that feels <em>instant</em>. But what's faster than instant?  A tool that anticipates your next move. That's why we're introducing <a href="https://zed.dev/edit-prediction">edit prediction</a> in Zed, powered by <a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">Zeta</a>, our new open source model.</p>
<p>Here's a quick walkthrough:</p>
<p><figure><video src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/32e5feacc10b8e63292918b21e9ae15c/downloads/default.mp4" width="640" height="360" controls=""></video><figcaption>Edit Prediction in action.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>As you work, Zed now predicts your next edit, so you can apply it just by hitting <code>tab</code>. Once you accept a prediction, you can perform multiple follow-up edits by pressing <code>tab</code> repeatedly, saving you time and keystrokes. We've received <em>a ton</em> of requests for this functionality, and we've poured our hearts into making it feel like a natural extension of the Zed experience.</p>
<p>You can use Zeta for free during this public beta by <a href="https://zed.dev/download">downloading Zed</a> and signing in with your GitHub account. Edit prediction won't be free forever, but right now we're just excited to share and learn.</p>
<h2 id="thoughtful-integration"><a href="#thoughtful-integration" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Thoughtful Integration</span></a></h2>
<p>Edit prediction transforms <code>tab</code> into a magical, universal key. But what about the existing uses of <code>tab</code>, such as indenting lines? And what happens when there's both an edit prediction <em>and</em> suggestions from your language server? We didn't want a powerful new feature to come at the expense of the existing editing experience in Zed.</p>
<p><figure><video loop="" muted="" autoplay="" preload="metadata" controls="" playsinline=""><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/4f9b29a42d9bfa64e5457dec716f59be/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/webm; codecs=&quot;vp8.0, vorbis&quot;"><source src="https://customer-snccc0j9v3kfzkif.cloudflarestream.com/4f9b29a42d9bfa64e5457dec716f59be/downloads/default.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.4D401E, mp4a.40.2&quot;"></video><figcaption>Zeta predictions together with language server completions.</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>When language server completions are visible, Zed won't preview the predicted edit until you press <code>option</code> or <code>alt</code>. As soon as you press the modifier, Zed previews the edit and hides the menu to enable an unobstructed review. On macOS, you can just hit <code>tab</code> to confirm, or back out by releasing <code>option</code> to restore the language server completions menu.</p>
<p>On Linux, <code>alt-tab</code> is often reserved by the window manager, so we offer <code>alt-l</code> as an alternative default. We chose <code>l</code> because it's on the QWERTY home row and represents rightward movement in Vim. If your Linux window manager doesn't claim <code>alt-tab</code>, you're free to use that binding as well.</p>

<p>Most coding models are trained on a "fill in the middle" task. You give them a prefix and a suffix, and they generate what goes in between.</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre><code data-language="rs" data-theme="dark-plus light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>&lt;|</span><span>fim_prefix</span><span>|&gt;</span><span>fn</span><span> quicksort</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>T</span><span>]) {</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>        return</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> pivot</span><span> = </span><span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>array</span><span>);</span></span>

<span data-line=""><span>    quicksort</span><span>(&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> array</span><span>[</span><span>pivot</span><span> + </span><span>1</span><span>..]);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}&lt;|</span><span>fim_middle</span><span>|&gt;</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<p>This works for completing text at the cursor, but we wanted Zeta to predict edits at arbitrary locations, which doesn't fit into this structure.</p>
<p>In our experience, models aren't very good at producing granular edits, but they do excel at rewriting larger chunks of code. So that's where we started: given a list of recent edits and the cursor position, we asked the model to rewrite a snippet of text around the cursor, incorporating one or more edit predictions in the rewritten text.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-predictions"><a href="#evaluating-predictions" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Evaluating Predictions</span></a></h3>
<p>Before writing a single line of code, we created a set of tests to check if our idea worked. Testing the output of a large language model is tricky because, on every run, you can get slightly different results even when feeding it the exact same input. This can be mitigated by using a temperature of <code>0</code> and, for providers that support it, providing a seed for the RNG.</p>
<p>That said, code can often be written in many different but equally valid ways. So even when Zeta's output differs from our expected answer, it might still be doing exactly what we want—just taking a different path to get there. This makes traditional unit testing approaches particularly challenging when working with LLMs.</p>
<p>This led us to take a different approach—instead of strict assertions, we used a larger LLM to evaluate Zeta's edits. By writing our test assertions in plain English and having Claude check if the results matched our intent, we could validate that Zeta was making sensible edits, even when its exact output differed between runs. This ended up being much more practical than trying to make brittle assertions about specific tokens.</p>
<p>Here's an example taken from our eval suite:</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><div><pre><code data-language="rs" data-theme="dark-plus light-plus"><span data-line=""><span>// Input:</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>pub</span><span> fn</span><span> quicksort</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>: </span><span>Ord</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>arr</span><span>: &amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> [</span><span>T</span><span>]) {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> len</span><span> = </span><span>arr</span><span>.</span><span>len</span><span>();</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    if</span><span> len</span><span> &lt;= </span><span>1</span><span> {</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>        return</span><span>;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    }</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>    let</span><span> pivot_index</span><span> = </span><span>partition</span><span>(</span><span>arr</span><span>);</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>    &lt;|</span><span>user_cursor_is_here</span><span>|&gt;</span></span>
<span data-line=""><span>}</span></span>
<span data-line=""> </span>
<span data-line=""><span>// Assertion: Ensure that the quicksort function recurses to the left and to the right of the pivot.</span></span></code></pre></div></figure>
<h3 id="prompt-engineering"><a href="#prompt-engineering" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Prompt Engineering</span></a></h3>
<p>We took our first stab at making those tests pass by using Qwen2.5-Coder-32B and giving it clear instructions for which types of edits we wanted it to predict. <a href="https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/blob/79a70b72b3968d102c6171f8bd2738ec7be8e94f/crates/zeta/src/complete_prompt.md">Here's the initial system prompt</a> we used and you can look through the history to see how we kept changing it to pass the eval suite.</p>
<p>This worked out surprisingly well for the first 4-5 evals. However, as soon as we introduced more, we started noticing that it got harder and harder to pass them all consistently. Changing the prompt caused the new evals to pass, but made the old ones fail. Overall, it felt like a flaky process and we didn't feel confident this would lead to the system being robust enough to be used in production.</p>
<p>Moreover, using a 32b model wasn't really compatible with our strict latency requirements (more on that later).</p>
<h3 id="supervised-fine-tuning"><a href="#supervised-fine-tuning" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Supervised Fine-Tuning</span></a></h3>
<p>After playing around with different approaches, we decided to go with supervised fine-tuning using <a href="https://unsloth.ai/">Unsloth</a> and LoRA. The idea was to teach Zeta two key things: figuring out what changes a developer might want next based on their recent edits, and then actually applying those changes cleanly to the code without introducing weird side effects.</p>
<p>But we had a classic chicken-and-egg problem—we needed data to train the model, but we didn't have any real examples yet. So we started by having Claude generate about 50 synthetic examples that we added to <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/zed-industries/zeta-dataset">our dataset</a>. We then used that initial fine-tune to ship an early version of Zeta behind a feature flag and started collecting examples from our own team's usage.</p>
<p>This approach let us quickly build up a solid dataset of around 400 high-quality examples, which improved the model a lot! However, we kept running into edge cases that would trip the model up. The most annoying ones were when Zeta was working with a small piece of code in a larger file—it would sometimes get confused and make random deletions or insertions that had nothing to do with what the user was trying to do, and it didn't seem like adding more examples steered the model away from those mistakes.</p>
<h3 id="direct-preference-optimization"><a href="#direct-preference-optimization" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Direct Preference Optimization</span></a></h3>
<p>To handle these edge cases, we conducted another pass using direct preference optimization (DPO). This technique let us go beyond simply showing the model what good edits look like—we could also teach it what edits <em>to avoid</em>. With DPO, we could fine-tune Zeta by providing both positive and negative examples, helping it learn the subtle differences between helpful and problematic edits.</p>
<p>We found that just ~150 carefully selected examples were enough to significantly improve Zeta's behavior on tricky cases. Of course, we think we can make it even better by expanding our training data with more diverse examples, and we're excited to keep pushing the boundaries here.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-latency-speculative-decoding"><a href="#minimizing-latency-speculative-decoding" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Minimizing Latency: Speculative Decoding</span></a></h3>
<p>Like every feature in Zed, latency was a critical factor for edit prediction. When we started, we set aggressive performance targets: predictions should be delivered in under 200ms for the median case (p50) and under 500ms for the 90th percentile (p90). The challenge was that rewriting complete excerpts, while enabling multi-location edits, requires generating significantly more tokens than simple fill-in-middle approaches. Initially, this put us way over our latency budget.</p>
<p>However, there's a fascinating insight about how edit predictions work. When we rewrite a text snippet, the output often mirrors the input closely, with changes concentrated in specific spots. This pattern lets us parallelize token generation by using the input as a reference—a technique known as speculative decoding. We use n-gram search to identify promising jumping-off points in the input where we can start parallel token generation, giving us a significant speedup without sacrificing quality.</p>
<h3 id="minimizing-latency-serving-the-model"><a href="#minimizing-latency-serving-the-model" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Minimizing Latency: Serving The Model</span></a></h3>
<p>For edit predictions to feel responsive, we needed to solve multiple latency challenges in parallel. As discussed above, we tackled the model execution time through speculative decoding, but serving the model at scale presented its own set of hurdles. This was by far the most compute-intensive problem our team has ever tackled.</p>
<p>A few weeks out from launch, we ran a brief competitive process, and we ended up being really impressed with <a href="https://www.baseten.co/">Baseten</a>. Their performance engineers quickly optimized our open source model to run on their flexible infrastructure, achieving our target latencies while letting us retain full visibility into the details of the deployment, both for the Zed team and the entire Zed community. We plan to follow up with a guest post about what they learned optimizing <a href="https://huggingface.co/zed-industries/zeta">our model</a>.</p>
<p>Latency is not just a function of compute; network transit time is a key driver of perceived speed. To cooperate with the laws of physics, we're launching with GPUs in both North America and Europe, and we hope to add more regions soon. We're also using <a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Workers</a> to handle your requests in a data center located as close to you as possible.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" aria-label="Copy heading link"><span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="10" height="10" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="9" y2="9"></line><line x1="4" x2="20" y1="15" y2="15"></line><line x1="10" x2="8" y1="3" y2="21"></line><line x1="16" x2="14" y1="3" y2="21"></line></svg></span><span>Conclusion</span></a></h2>
<p>There's plenty more to explore to make edit predictions more powerful. We'll be fast-following with more experiments. We plan on sending more kinds of context to the model and continuing our experiments with fine-tuning, and we'll share updates as we grow and evolve the Zeta dataset.</p>
<p>We've learned a lot since we launched Zed AI last fall. The world is changing fast, and we're having a blast exploring and learning to build features that developers love. We're also excited to build with AI the Zed way. From our early days, we've been proponents of an open approach to building software, even when hard, and we see no reason to change that approach when it comes to working with AI. We hope you'll join us as a user, a contributor, or an employee, as we hustle to ship a golden future.</p><hr></article></div>]]></description>

<p>
There's an interesting theory out there that X causes Y. If this were true, it would be pretty important. So I did a deep-dive into the academic literature on whether X causes Y. Here's what I found.
</p>
<p>
(Embarrassingly, I can't actually remember what X and Y are. I think maybe X was enriched preschool, or just school itself, or eating fish while pregnant, or the Paleo diet, or lead exposure, or a clever "nudge" policy trying to get people to save more, or some self-help technique, or some micronutrient or public health intervention, or democracy, or free trade, or some approach to intellectual property law. And Y was ... lifetime earnings, or risk of ADHD diagnosis, or IQ in adulthood, or weight loss, or violent crime, or peaceful foreign policy, or GDP per capita, or innovation. Sorry about that! Hope you enjoy the post anyway! Fortunately, I think <strong>what I'm about to write is correct for pretty much any (X,Y) from those sorts of lists.</strong>)
</p>
<p>
In brief:
</p>
<ul>

<li>There are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y, but most of them are simple observational studies that are just essentially saying "People/countries with more X also have more Y." For reasons discussed below, we can't really learn much from these studies.

</li><li>There are 1-5 more interesting studies on whether X causes Y. Each study looks really clever, informative and rigorous at first glance. However, the more closely you look at them, the more confusing the picture gets.

</li><li>We ultimately need to choose between (a) believing some overly complicated theory of the relationship between X and Y, which reconciles all of the wildly conflicting and often implausible things we're seeing in the studies; (b) more-or-less reverting to what we would've guessed about the relationship between X and Y in the absence of any research.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-chaff">The chaff: lots of unhelpful studies that I'm disregarding</h2>


<p>
First, the good news: there are hundreds of studies on whether X causes Y. The bad news? We need to throw most of them out. 
</p>
<p>
Many have comically small sample sizes (like studying 20 people) and/or comically short time horizons (like looking at weight loss over two weeks),<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> or unhelpful outcome measures (like intelligence tests in children under 5).<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> But by far the most common problem is that <strong>most of the studies on whether X causes Y are simple observational studies: they essentially just find that people/countries with more X also have more Y. </strong>
</p>
<p>
Why is this a problem? There could be a <em>confounder</em> - some third thing, Z, that is correlated with both X and Y. And there are specific reasons we should expect confounders to be common:
</p>
<ul>

<li>In general, people/countries that have more X also have more of lots of other helpful things - they're richer, they're more educated, etc. For example, if we're asking whether higher-quality schooling leads to higher earnings down the line, an issue is that people with higher-quality schooling also tend to come from better-off families with lots of other advantages.

</li><li>In fact, the <em>very fact that people in upper-class intellectual circles think X causes Y</em> means that richer, more educated people/countries tend to deliberately get more X, and also try to do a lot of other things to get more Y. For example, more educated families tend to eat more fish (complicating the attempt to see whether eating fish in pregnancy is good for the baby).<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
Now, a lot of these studies try to "control for" the problem I just stated - they say things like "We examined the effect of X and Y, while controlling for Z [e.g., how wealthy or educated the people/countries/whatever are]." How do they do this? The short answer is, well, hm, jeez. Well you see, to simplify matters a bit, just try to imagine ... uh ... shit. Uh. The only high-level way I can put this is:
</p>
<ul>

<li>They use a technique called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis">regression analysis</a> that, as far as I can determine, cannot be explained in a simple, intuitive way (especially not in terms of how it "controls for" confounders).

</li><li>The "controlling for" thing relies on a lot of subtle assumptions and can break in all kinds of weird ways. <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152719">Here's </a>a technical explanation of some of the pitfalls; <a href="https://www.cold-takes.com/phil-birnbaums-regression-analysis/">here's</a> a set of deconstructions of regressions that break in weird ways.

</li><li>None of the observational studies about whether X causes Y discuss the pitfalls of "controlling for" things and whether they apply here.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I don't think we can trust these papers, and to really pick them all apart (given how many there are) would take too much time. So let's focus on a smaller number of better studies.
</p>
<h2 id="the-wheat">The wheat: 1-5 more interesting studies</h2>


<p>
Digging through the sea of unhelpful studies, I found 1-5 of them that are actually really interesting! 
</p>
<p>
For example, one study examines some strange historical event you've never heard of (perhaps a <a href="https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/mariel-impact.pdf">surge in Cuban emigration triggered by Fidel Castro suddenly allowing it</a>, or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800113/">John Rockefeller's decision to fund a hookworm eradication campaign</a>, or a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.103.6.2437">sudden collective pardon leading to release of a third of prison inmates in Italy</a>), where for abstruse and idiosyncratic reasons, X got distributed in what seems to be almost a random way. This study is really clever, and the authors were incredibly thorough in examining seemingly every way their results could have been wrong. They conclude that X causes Y!
</p>
<p>
But on closer inspection, I have a bunch of reservations. For example:
</p>
<ul>

<li>The paper doesn't make it easy to replicate its analysis, and when someone does manage to sort-of replicate it, they may <a href="https://blog.givewell.org/2017/12/07/questioning-evidence-hookworm-eradication-american-south/">get different results</a>. 

</li><li>There was other weird stuff going on (e.g., changes in census data collection methods<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>), during the strange historical event, so it's a little hard to generalize.

</li><li>In a response to the study, another academic advances a complex theory of how the study could actually have gotten a misleading result. This led to an intense back-and-forth between the original authors and the skeptic, stretched out over years because each response had to be published in a journal, and by the time I got to the end of it I didn't have any idea what to think anymore.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></li></ul>
<p>
I found 0-4 other interesting studies. I can't remember all of the details, but they may have included:
</p>
<ul>

<li>A study comparing siblings, or maybe "very similar countries," that got more or less of X.<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>

</li><li>A study using a complex mathematical technique claiming to cleanly isolate the effect of X and Y. I can't really follow what it's doing, and I’m guessing there are a lot of weird assumptions baked into this analysis.<sup id="fnref8"><a href="#fn8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>

</li><li>A study with actual randomization: some people were randomly assigned to receive more X than others, and the researchers looked at who ended up with more Y. This sounds awesome! However, there are issues here too: 
<ul>
 
<li>It's kind of ambiguous whether the assignment to X was really "random."<sup id="fnref9"><a href="#fn9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup>
 
</li><li>Extremely weird things happened during the study (for example, <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming/reanalysis#Our_initial_reservations">generational levels of flooding</a>), so it's not clear how well it generalizes to other settings.
 
</li><li>The result seems fragile (<a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Other_studies_of_long-term_effects">simply adding more data weakens it a lot</a>) and/or just hard to believe (like <a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-017-0287-9">schoolchildren doing noticeably better on a cognition test after a few weeks of being given fish instead of meat with their lunch, even though they mostly didn't eat the fish</a>). </li></ul></li></ul>
<p>
Compounding the problem, the 1-5 studies I found tell very different stories about the relationship between X and Y. How could this make sense? Is there a unified theory that can reconcile all the results?
</p>
<p>
Well, one possibility is that X causes Y sometimes, but only under very particular conditions, and the effect can be masked by some other thing going on. So - if you meet one of 7 criteria, you should do X to get more Y, but if you meet one of 9 other criteria, you should actually avoid X!
</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>


<p>
I have to say, this all was simultaneously more fascinating and less <em>informative</em> than I expected it would be going in. I thought I would find some nice studies about the relationship between X and Y and be done. Instead, I've learned a ton about weird historical events and about the ins and outs of different measures of X and Y, but I feel just super confused about whether X causes Y.
</p>
<p>
I guess my bottom line is that X does cause Y, because it intuitively seems like it would.
</p>
<p>
I'm glad I did all this research, though. It's good to know that social science research can go haywire in all kinds of strange ways. And it's good to know that despite the confident proclamations of pro- and anti-X people, it's legitimately just super unclear whether X causes Y. 
</p>
<p>
I mean, how else could I have learned that?
</p>
<h2 id="appendix">Appendix: based on a true story</h2>


<p>
This piece was inspired by:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Most evidence reviews GiveWell has done, especially of <a href="https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming">deworming</a>

</li><li>Many evidence reviews by David Roodman, particularly <a href="https://www.cgdev.org/publication/macro-aid-effectiveness-research-guide-perplexed-working-paper-135">Macro Aid Effectiveness Research: a Guide for the Perplexed</a>; <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0095V3J0S/">Due Diligence: an Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance</a>; and <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reasonable-doubt-new-look-whether-prison-growth-cuts-crime">Reasonable Doubt: A New Look at Whether Prison Growth Cuts Crime</a>. 

</li><li>Many evidence reviews by Slate Star Codex, collected <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/tag/much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/">here</a>.

</li><li>Informal evidence reviews I've done for e.g. personal medical decisions.
</li></ul>
<p>
The basic patterns above apply to most of these, and the bottom line usually has the kind of frustrating ambiguity seen in this conclusion.</p>
    
<p>There are cases where things seem a bit less ambiguous and the bottom line seems clearer. Speaking broadly, I think the main things that contribute to this are:
</p>
<ul>

<li>Actual randomization. For years I've nodded along when people say "You shouldn't be dogmatic about randomization, there are many ways for a study to be informative," but each year I've become a bit more dogmatic. Even the most sophisticated-, appealing-seeming alternatives to randomization in studies seem to have a way of falling apart. Randomized studies almost always have problems and drawbacks too. But I’d rather have a randomized study with drawbacks than a non-randomized study with drawbacks.

</li><li>Extreme thoroughness, such as Roodman's attempt to reconstruct the data and code for key studies in <a href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/reasonable-doubt-new-look-whether-prison-growth-cuts-crime">Reasonable Doubt</a>. This sometimes leads to outright dismissing a number of studies, leaving a smaller, more consistent set remaining.
</li>
</ul>

<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/apple-resumes-advertising-on-x/">Apple Has Resumed Advertising on X for the First Time Since Late 2023</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Joe Rossignol, MacRumors:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple this month started advertising on X for the first time in
more than a year. The company <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/">had stopped advertising</a> on
the social media platform in November 2023 following controversial
remarks made by its owner Elon Musk.</p>

<p>For example, the @Apple account is <a href="https://x.com/apple/status/1889089503278813659">running an ad</a> promoting
Safari’s privacy features. The ad was spotted by MacRumors
contributor <a href="https://x.com/aaronp613">Aaron Perris</a>. The @AppleTV account has <a href="https://twitter.com/AdtechBrags/status/1888708923651440701">also
been running ads</a> for the Apple TV+ show Severance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The November 2023 outrage was in response to, among other things, <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299">Musk replying</a> “You have said the actual truth” to <a href="https://x.com/breakingbaht/status/1724892505647296620">a tweet from a rando</a> that stated “I’m deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don’t exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.”</p>

<p>Musk clearly learned his lesson. Since then, he’s been lying low, out of the public eye, and refraining from any sort of controversial statements or actions. He barely even tweets anymore. The one and only time I can recall him even being in the news in the last 18 months was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1">this year-ago profile in the Wall Street Journal</a> documenting Musk’s health and nutrition regimen. So it’s all cool now and Apple feels comfortable advertising on the social network Musk wholly owns.</p>

I'll let you in a secret.  The maintainers are not "all-powerfui".  We
are the "thin blue line" that is trying to keep the code to be
maintainable and high quality.  Like most leaders of volunteer
organization, whether it is the Internet Engineerint Task Force (the
standards body for the Internet), we actually have very little power.
We can not *command* people to work on retiring technical debt, or to
improve testing infrastructure, or work on some particular feature
that we'd very like for our users.

All we can do is stop things from being accepted (either in our
subsystem, or the imprimatur of the IETF).  Hopefully, we're only
stopping bad things from progressing, but that *really* is all we can
actually do.

One of the things which gets very frustrating from the maintainer's
perspective is development teams that are only interested in their pet
feature, and we *know*, through very bitter experience, that 95+% of
the time, once the code is accepted, the engineers which contribute
the code will disappear, never to be seen again.  As a result, a very
common dynamic is that maintainers will exercise the one and only
power which they have --- which is to refuse to accept code until it
is pretty much perfect --- since once we accept the code, we instantly
lose all leverge, and the contributors will be disappear, and we will
be left with the responsibility of cleanig up the mess.  (And once
there are users, we can't even rip out the code, since that would be a
user-visible regression.)

Occasionally, there is an accusation that different standards that
might apply for people who are in the "gold old buys club".  But what
isn't appreciated, is that it is precisely because people who are
long-term members of the community are trusted to stick around and
will support code that the have sponsored.  For example, Darrick Wong,
who contributed ext4 metadata checksuming support before we moved on
to become the XFS maintainer, is still reviewing and making
contributions to code that he contributed many years to ext4.  I've
been known to submit fixes to test bugs for xfs-specific tests in
xfstests that I discovered when running daily spinner tests on the
linux git tree.

Just in the past two weeks, I've spent 15+ hours working on cleaning
up a casefold "security fix" that had nasty on-disk backwards
compatibility issues.  Part of it was that it was ext4 (although I
discovered that there was also fsck.f2fs problems that had been
overlooked), but the *other* part of why I spent so much time was that
I sponsored the casefolding patches, and so I felt I certain moral
responsibility to make sure the code was continued to be maintained.

(And note, this has nothing to do with who employs me; the 15-20 hours
that I spent working on creating the fix and the test scripts was
purely on my own time, on the weekend, or late at night.  The time
that I spend doing this isn't reflected in my performance reviews, or
promotion propects --- in fact, arguably, over the past 15 years, this
has probably slowed down my promotion prospects; I've only been
promoted once since joining said big tech company...)

<span>&gt; Not sure what the fix is, from a project management perspective the
&gt; technology industry has never faced a challenge like this.  The fork
&gt; model, which was the classic protection in open-source, doesn't work
&gt; at this scale.
</span>
Well, here's my suggestion.  Teams that want to get features,
especially ones that might be potentially disruptive, into the tree,
need to spend time becoming part of the *community*.  This means that
they need to participate in part of the joint effort to keep the code
maintainable and high quaity --- even if it isn't part of their
company's short-term goals, or directly related to their pet feature
that they are trying to get upstream.

This was the trust of my "Beyond Upstream First" presentation which I
gave to the Linux Foundation Member Summit last fall[1].

[1] <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11rMc8PBeyMItV6hv31OHSZ626_6FCZxjX6ZxEAehCpQ/edit#slide=id.p">https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11rMc8PBeyMItV6hv31OHSZ626_6FCZxjX6ZxEAehCpQ/edit#slide=id.p</a>

Now, I'll say that the Rust developers are making strides in the right
direction here.  Miguel has stood for election for the Technical
Adviory Board, and has been contributing in various ways beyond just
Rust for Linux.  Ultimately, Cristoph's concern is that Rust is going
to make life harder for maintainers because of particular build breaks
getting in the way of the very limited bandwidth that Maintainers have
(and again, a lot of the work that we do gets done on our own personal
time; it's rare that even those maintainers employed by a "big
technology company" have complete freedom to work on whatever they
want; and they certainly don't have minions employed to do all of the
grunt work to support code maintenance work, especially if we let
crappy code slip past us in the name of "time to market" concerns.)

So I think we'll get past this.  It might take some more effort, and
more trust building --- on both sides --- but I'm fairly optismistic
that it will happen.  It might not happe as *fast* as people might
like; as Linus pointed out, it took ten years for the Clang compiler
to be considered 100% fully supported --- and this was without needing
to worrying about language issues, including an upstream language
community which refuses to make any kind of backwards compatibility
guarantees, and which is *actively* hostile to a second Rust compiler
implementation (I suspect because it might limit their ability to make
arbitrary backwards-incompatble language changes).

<span>&gt; Obviously respect and open-mindedness to new ideas appears to be the
&gt; grease that makes all of this run smoothly.  Unfortunately that seems
&gt; to be about as rare a commodity as omniscience in our industry.
</span>
The other thing which is super rare is people and companies who care
about tech debt cleanup, code maintainability, and code quality.
Instead of complaining about maintainers for who are unreasonably
caring about these things, when they are desparately under-resourced
to do as good of a job as they industry demands, how about meeting us
half-way and *helping* us with these sort of long-term code health
issues?  Maybe if you engage us as part of the community, we'll be a
lot more open to adding changes that might increase the code
maintenance burden?

Cheers,

            <span>Abstract:</span>This paper introduces the Large Memory Model (LM2), a decoder-only Transformer architecture enhanced with an auxiliary memory module that aims to address the limitations of standard Transformers in multi-step reasoning, relational argumentation, and synthesizing information distributed over long contexts. The proposed LM2 incorporates a memory module that acts as a contextual representation repository, interacting with input tokens via cross attention and updating through gating mechanisms. To preserve the Transformers general-purpose capabilities, LM2 maintains the original information flow while integrating a complementary memory pathway. Experimental results on the BABILong benchmark demonstrate that the LM2model outperforms both the memory-augmented RMT model by 37.1% and the baseline Llama-3.2 model by 86.3% on average across tasks. LM2 exhibits exceptional capabilities in multi-hop inference, numerical reasoning, and large-context question-answering. On the MMLU dataset, it achieves a 5.0% improvement over a pre-trained vanilla model, demonstrating that its memory module does not degrade performance on general tasks. Further, in our analysis, we explore the memory interpretability, effectiveness of memory modules, and test-time behavior. Our findings emphasize the importance of explicit memory in enhancing Transformer architectures.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/openai-scrubs-diversity-commitment-web-page-from-its-site/">https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/13/openai-scrubs-diversity-commitment-web-page-from-its-site/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43042723">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">OpenAI has eliminated a page on its website that used to express its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The URL “<a href="https://openai.com/commitment-to-dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://openai.com/commitment-to-dei/</a>” now redirects to “<a rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/building-dynamic-teams/">https://openai.com/building-dynamic-teams/</a>,” a page that talks about people with “different backgrounds” with no use of the word “diversity.”</p>

<p>The previous page stated that the company’s “investment in diversity, equity and inclusion” was ongoing. It also said that it was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/25/openai-responds-to-congressional-black-caucus-about-lack-of-diversity-on-its-board/">serious about this work</a> and was committed to “continuously improving our work in creating a diverse, equitable, and inclusive organization,” as captured by the Internet Web Archive and also as cited <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/15/tech/openai-board-diversity/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by a 2023 CNN article</a>.</p>







<p>It isn’t clear exactly when this change was made, but there’s some evidence it was very recent. The diversity commitment web page <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/tech-firms-trumps-ai-stargate-venture-touted-dei/story?id=117996988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was cited as available by an ABC News story</a> published on January 22. By January 27, OpenAI <a href="https://x.com/btibor91/status/1883855755436245201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">had published</a> the new, replacement “building dynamic teams” web page.</p>

<p>The new page says, “At OpenAI, we recognize that the strongest ideas emerge when they are tested, debated, and improved by people with different backgrounds, experiences, and ways of thinking. We encourage a culture of curiosity where ideas can be challenged — not just accepted.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>OpenAI did not immediately respond to our request for comment about the website change or if it indicates any of the company’s internal processes have been rolled back or altered. OpenAI’s web page that <a rel="nofollow" href="https://openai.com/index/evaluating-fairness-in-chatgpt/">promises “fairness”</a> in model training to remove social biases is still live, for instance.</p>

<p>OpenAI is hardly the only company to distance itself from the wording of DEI as these specific words — as well as the concepts behind them — face fierce political and legal backlash these days. Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi <a href="https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388501/dl?inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">instructed</a> the Department of Justice to “investigate, eliminate, and penalize,” DEI programs deemed illegal in private sector companies that receive federal funds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the past month, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all announced the elimination or adjustment of DEI policies, with the latter two <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/amazon-deletes-inclusion-and-diversity-language-in-latest-filing/">scrubbing mention</a> of diversity and inclusion from their recent 10-K forms.&nbsp;</p>


<p>OpenAI is working with the government in a few capacities. For instance, It secured <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/04/1107897/openais-new-defense-contract-completes-its-military-pivot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a government contract </a>and launched a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/openai-launches-chatgpt-gov-us-government-agencies-amid-rising-ai-competition-2025-01-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">chatbot for government agencies.</a></p>

<p>Amazon will cease the ability to download and transfer options for the Kindle e-reader on February 26th, 2025. No Kindle can use this functionality once the due date rolls around. Only the 12th generation Kindles never had this ability to begin with, but now no other model will either. Why is Amazon doing this? It’s a feature not many people use and those who do, commit e-book piracy.</p>
<blockquote><p>Starting February 26, 2025, the “Download &amp; Transfer via USB” option will no longer be available. You can still send Kindle books to your Wi-Fi enabled devices by selecting the “Deliver or Remove from Device” option.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “download and transfer option” is located on the Amazon website when logged in. To get there, hover over the text to the right of the search bar that says “Hello, [Your Name] Account &amp; Lists”, select “Orders” from the menu that appears, then select “Digital Orders” from the “Your Orders” page that appears after selecting. You’ll see a list of Digital Orders you’ve placed, including books. Click “Manage Content and Devices” next to one of the items, and a “Digital Content” page will appear. After clicking “More Actions,” you’ll see a list of actions, including “Download &amp; Transfer via USB”. This is the option that is going away.</p>
<p>Download and Transfer via USB was launched over ten years ago and was created at a time, when WIFI was not prevalent, so this feature was the only way to send e-books to the Kindle. When you buy a Kindle book, it is automatically sent to any registered Kindle e-readers, Fire Tablets, or any Kindle apps for Android or iOS on your account.</p>
<p>Here are some essential facts to know.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can continue to use Calibre to send Kindle books to your Kindle</li>
<li>Send to Kindle will continue to work</li>
<li>You can continue to sideload e-books on your Kindle via USB cable</li>
</ul>
