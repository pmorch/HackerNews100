            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html">https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46747366">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><p><span>Published on <time datetime="Sat Jan 24 2026">January 24, 2026</time></span></p></div><p>You can now view replies to this blog post made on Bluesky directly on this website. <a href="https://micahcantor.com/blog/bluesky-comment-section#comments">Check it out here</a>!</p>
<p>I've always wanted to host a comment section on my site, but it's difficult because the content is statically generated and hosted on a CDN.
I could host comments on a separate VPS or cloud service.
But maintaining a dynamic web service like this can be expensive and time-consuming — in general, I'm not interested in being an unpaid, part-time DevOps engineer.</p>
<p>Recently, however, I read a blog post by <a href="https://www.coryzue.com/writing/bluesky-comments/">Cory Zue</a> about how he embedded a comment section from Bluesky on his blog.
I immediately understood to benefits of this approach. With this approach, Bluesky could handle all of the difficult work involved in managing a social media like account verification, hosting, storage, spam, and moderation. Meanwhile because Bluesky is an open platform with a public API, it's easy to directly embed comments on my own site.</p>
<p>There are other services that could be used for this purpose instead. Notably, I could embed replies from the social media formerly known as Twitter. Or I could use a platform like <a href="https://disqus.com/">Disqus</a> or even <a href="https://giscus.app/">giscus</a>, which hosts comments on GitHub Discussions. But I see Bluesky as a clearly superior choice among these options. For one, Bluesky is built on top of an open social media platform in AT Proto, meaning it can't easily be taken over by an authoritarian billionaire creep. Moreover, Bluesky is a full-fledged social media platform, which naturally makes it a better option for hosting a conversation than GitHub.</p>
<p>Zue published a standalone package called <a href="https://github.com/czue/bluesky-comments">bluesky-comments</a> that allows embedding comments in a React component as he did.
But I decided to build this feature myself instead. Mainly this is because I wanted to make a few styling changes anyway to match the rest of my site. But I also wanted to leave the option open to adding more features in the future, which would be easier to do if I wrote the code myself. The entire implementation is small regardless, amounting to only ~200 LOC between the UI components and API functions.</p>
<p>Initially, I planned to allow people to directly post on Bluesky via my site. This would work by providing an OAuth flow that gives my site permission to post on Bluesky on behalf of the user. I actually did get the auth flow working, but building out a UI for posting and replying to existing comments is difficult to do well. Going down this path quickly leads to building what is essentially a custom Bluesky client, which I didn't have the time or interest in doing right now. Moreover, because the user needs to go through the auth flow and sign-in to their Bluesky account, the process is not really much easier than posting directly on a linked Bluesky post.</p>
<p>Without the requirement of allowing others to directly post on my site, the implementation became much simpler. Essentially, my task was to specify a Bluesky post that corresponds to the article in the site's metadata. Then, when the page loads I fetch the replies to that post from Bluesky, parse the response, and display the results in a simple comment section UI.</p>
<p>As explained in <a href="https://micahcantor.com/blog/rsc-rewrite">my last post</a>, this site is built using React Server Components and Parcel. The content of my articles are written using MDX, an extension to Markdown that allows directly embedding JavaScript and JSX. In each post, I export a <code>metadata</code> object that I validate using a <a href="https://zod.dev/">Zod</a> schema. For instance, the metadata for this post looks like this:</p>
<div data-bright-theme="github-dark"><pre><code><p><span><span>export const </span><span>metadata </span><span>=</span><span> {</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	title: </span><span>"I added a Bluesky comment section to my blog"</span><span>,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	description:</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>		"How I embedded Bluesky replies directly on my site"</span><span>,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	date: </span><span>"2026-01-24"</span><span>,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	bskyPostId: &lt;</span><span>post</span><span>-</span><span>id</span><span>&gt;,</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>	tags: [</span><span>"web-dev"</span><span>],</span><br></span></p><p><span><span>};</span><br></span></p></code></pre></div>
<p>The value of <code>bskyPostId</code> references the Bluesky post from which I'll pull replies to display in the comment section. Because my project is built in TypeScript, it was easy to integrate with the Bluesky TypeScript SDK (<code>@bluesky/api</code> on NPM). Reading the Bluesky API documentation and Zue's implementation led me to the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/docs/api/app-bsky-feed-get-post-thread"><code>getPostThread</code> endpoint</a>. Given an AT Protocol URI, this endpoint returns an object with data on the given post and its replies.</p>
<p>I could have interacted directly with the Bluesky API from my React component using <code>fetch</code> and <code>useEffect</code>. However, it can be a bit tricky to correctly handle loading and a error states, even for a simple feature like this. Because of this, I decided to use the <a href="https://tanstack.com/query/latest">Tanstack <code>react-query</code> package</a> to manage the API request/response cycle. This library takes care of the messy work of handling errors, retries, and loading states while I simply provide it a function to fetch the post data.</p>
<p>Once I obtain the Bluesky response, the next task is parsing out the content and metadata for the replies. Bluesky supports a rich content structure in its posts for representing markup, references, and attachments. Building out a UI that fully respects this rich content would be difficult. Instead, I decided to keep it simple by just pulling out the text content from each reply.</p>
<p>Even so, building a UI that properly displays threaded comments, particularly one that is formatted well on small mobile devices, can be tricky. For now, my approach was to again keep it simple. I indented each reply and added a left border to make it easier to follow reply threads. Otherwise, I mostly copied design elements for layout of the profile picture and post date from Bluesky.</p>
<p>Lastly, I added a UI component linking to the parent post on Bluesky, and encouraging people to add to the conversation there. With this, the read-only comment section implementation was complete. If there's interest, I could publish my version of Bluesky comments as a standalone package. But several of the choices I made were relatively specific to my own site. Moreover, the implementation is simple enough that others could probably build their own version from reading the source code, just as I did using Zue's version.</p>
<p>Let me know what you think by replying on Bluesky. Hopefully this can help increase engagement with my blog posts, but then again, my last article generated no replies, so maybe not 😭.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <h2>Bye Bye Gmail</h2>
<h2>it's been great, but it's not me, it's you</h2>
<p>Friends,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Please remove <strong>@gmail.com</strong> as my primary email address and substitute <strong>removed</strong>. I will try to respond to email sent to @gmail.com but no guarantees.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>A week or two ago I was surprised to see a Google Gemini summary at the top of my email on my phone. A day or two later this appeared in my web client as well. Look, I love our new overlords (for the record m'lords I nearly always use "please" and "thank you"). I was an early adopter and introduced many of you to the LLMs. I still am a frequent user... I mean someone who has all the answers and blows smoke up my ass... perfect right!</p>
<p>Despite that, it appears it's not good for me ( <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/">https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/</a> ). It's great, it's easy, makes me feel good in the moment... of course it's bad for me!</p>
<p>Here's the thing. I like to read things from my friends that they have taken the time to write. I personally hate texting. All the nuance is gone. Often the humor. Sad. Makes me want to have a beer with you... eye contact... blech. The <strong>LAST</strong> thing I want is a summary... at the top of the email... highlighted... that I <strong>CANNOT</strong> turn off.</p>
<p>I tried to turn it off. I can. It's under <code>Gmail -&gt; Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Smart Features (checkbox)</code>. <strong>BUT</strong>... the AI summaries is now grouped with the Smart Tabs.</p>
<p>For those of you who do not use Gmail (or do use Gmail and don't use Smart Tabs), Smart Tabs (officially the Tabbed Inbox) have been part of Gmail since 2013; well actually the technology behind them—Smart Labels—actually debuted two years earlier. (Thank you Gemini, yes I <strong>DO</strong> truly love you. Tell me again about the comparisons of Stephen Miller and Heinrich Himmler's tactics please?)</p>
<p>Smart Tabs automatically sort my incoming flood of solicited commercial email (<strong>cue</strong> laughter from those who know my first start-up) into five buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary:</strong> Email from you.</li>
<li><strong>Promotions:</strong> K&amp;L Wine Merchants at the top of the list.</li>
<li><strong>Social:</strong> Hi Andrew on Facebook (that I only log into from Firefox running on a VM).</li>
<li><strong>Update:</strong> Actual transactional emails from companies.</li>
<li><strong>Forums:</strong> <em>The Information</em> at the top of the list (a newsletter I'd like to read but don't want to make the time justify paying for the content).</li>
</ul>
<p>I tried turning off Smart Features and oh my, that's not usable. So I lived with the AI summary at the top. For a week. Then this morning, I saw several messages in my Primary tab that normally get sorted into Promotions, Social, Updates or Forums. This is not unheard of; sometimes a company uses a new incoming address or something and stuff gets put in the wrong bucket.</p>
<p>But <strong>THIS</strong> time, I got a popup that says I must "Share" this message with Google and links to the Privacy Policy and Google Terms of Service. And an explicit sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Messages and attachments might be reviewed by humans, so don't share any sensitive or confidential information."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not naive. I'm an early adopter, my email address includes my name and no numbers. I was a direct marketer when we still were the red-headed step-children of the product managers.  I carpooled to Symantec with Google employee no 11's girlfriend (Go Beavers!) From the get-go, having Google read my email in order to provide targeted advertising was part of the deal. I was fine with that.</p>
<p><strong>BUT</strong>... now... what they are saying is that... we are going to use your email to train our LLMs. I'm not okay with that. That knowledge of my way of writing, my personal details, my confidential commercial information is <strong>NOT</strong> okay to use to train your models. 'Cause I expect mistakes will be made and more information will reside in the model than those at Google (or FB, MSFT etc) intended. And I'm not really up for assuming that risk.</p>
<p>So... goodbye Gmail. It's been great. Really great. I'm sure I'll miss you. Bye.</p>
<p>My email is now being hosted by Microsoft, so hopefully will be free of the outages and limits some of you have experienced with that email in the past. There it will reside until I cannot turn off MSFT's ability to read my email. Then I guess it's off to Switzerland ( <a href="https://proton.me/about">https://proton.me/about</a> ); my email can be with my gold. JK..NR</p>
<p>Tom</p>
<p>p.s.  why thank you Gemini for reformatting that for me into a clean, engaging markdown blog post.  Yes, I do agree this is a sharp, timely take on the "AI-ification" of tools we use every day. I love you.  Kill me last?</p>

<p>Today we’re going to be taking a look at what almost 13 years of development has done for the Raspberry Pi. I have one of each generation of Pi from the original Pi that was launched in 2012 through to the Pi 5 which was released just over a year ago.</p><p>We’ll take a look at what has changed between each generation and how their performance and power consumption has improved by running some tests on them.</p>

<h2>Hardware Changes Through Each Generation</h2>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 1</h3>
<p>This is the original Raspberry Pi, which was launched in February 2012.</p>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="1024" height="569" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1024x569.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 1" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1536x854.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-2048x1139.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-150x83.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1068x594.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-1-1920x1068.jpeg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>This Pi has a Broadcom BCM2835 SOC which features a single ARM1176JZF-S core running at 700MHz along with a VideoCore IV GPU. It has 512 MB of DDR RAM.</p><p>In terms of connectivity, it only has 100Mb networking and 2 x USB 2.0 ports. Video output is 1080P through a full-size HDMI port or analogue video out through a composite video connector and audio output is provided through a 3.5mm audio jack. It doesn’t have any WiFi or Bluetooth connectivity but it does have some of the features that we still have on more recent models like DSI and CSI ports, a full size SD card reader for the operating system and GPIO pins, although only 26 of them at this stage.</p>

</figure>
<p>Power is supplied through a micro USB port and it is rated for 5V and 700mA.</p>
<p>It was priced at $35 – which at the time was incredibly cheap for what was essentially a palm-sized computer.</p><h3>Raspberry Pi 2</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 2 was launched 3 years later, in February 2015 and this Pi looked quite different to the original and similar to the Pi’s we know today.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="569" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-1024x569.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 2" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-1536x853.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-2048x1138.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-150x83.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-1068x593.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-2-1920x1067.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 2 has a significantly better processor than the original. The Broadcom BCM2836 SOC has 4 Cortex-A7 cores running at 900 MHz and it retained the same VideoCore IV GPU. RAM was also bumped up to 1GB.</p>
<p>It added another 2 x USB 2.0 ports alongside the 100Mb Ethernet port. The composite video port disappeared and the analogue video output was moved into the audio jack.</p><p>The GPIO pins were increased to 40 pins which has followed the same pin layout since – which has really helped in maintaining compatibility with hats and accessories. The SD card reader was also changed to a microSD card reader.</p>

<p>The power circuitry was bumped up to 800mA to accommodate the more powerful CPU.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 3</h3>
<p>The Raspberry Pi 3 was launched just a year later, in February 2016.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="569" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1024x569.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 3" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1024x569.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1536x854.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-2048x1139.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-150x83.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1068x594.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-3-1920x1068.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 3’s new Broadcom BCM2837 SOC retained the same 4-core architecture but these were changed to 64-bit Cortex A53 cores running at 1.2Ghz.</p>
<p>RAM was kept at 1GB but was now DDR2.</p>
<p>There was no change to the USB or Ethernet connectivity on the original Pi 3 but we did see WiFi and Bluetooth added for the first time. WiFi was single band 2.4GHz and we had Bluetooth 4.1.</p>
<p>The version that I have is actually the 3B+, which was launched a little later. The main improvements over the original Pi 3 were a 0.2GHz boost to the clock speed and the upgrade to Gigabit networking with PoE (Power over Ethernet) support and dual-band WiFi.</p><p>The power circuitry was again improved, still running at 5V but now up to 1.34A, which was almost double the Pi 2.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 4</h3>
<p>Next came the Pi 4 in June 2019. This Pi came at one of the worst times for global manufacturing and was notoriously difficult to get hold of due to the impact of COVID on the global supply chain. Quite ironically, this hard-to-get Pi is the one that I’ve got the most of, mainly due to my <a href="https://www.the-diy-life.com/building-a-water-cooled-raspberry-pi-4-cluster/">water-cooled Pi cluster build</a>.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1024x572.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1024x572.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-768x429.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1536x858.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-2048x1144.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-696x389.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1068x596.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-4-1920x1072.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 4 has a Broadcom BCM2711 SOC with 4 Cortex-A72 cores running at 1.5GHz. So again a slight clock speed increase over the Pi 3 but still retaining 4 cores. It also includes a bump up to a VideoCore VI GPU.</p><p>This was the first model to feature different RAM configurations. It was originally available in 1, 2, 4GB variants featuring LPDDR4 RAM and in March of 2020 an 8GB variant was added to the linup as well. This obviously resulted in a few different price points but impressively they still managed to keep a $35 offering 7 years after the launch of the first Pi.</p>
<p>It retained the same form factor as the Pi 3 but with the network and Ethernet ports switched around. Notably, two of the USB ports were upgraded to USB 3.0, networking was now gigabit ethernet like the 3B+, WiFi was dual-band and it had Bluetooth 5.0.</p>
<p>They also changed the single full-size HDMI port to two micro HDMI ports. Most people I know don’t like this change and find it annoying to have to use adaptors to work with common displays and these micro HDMI ports are prone to breaking when they are used often. I think general hobbyists and makers would prefer this to still be a single full-size port but Pi’s are often used in commercial display applications so I guess that’s why they went with this dual micro HDMI configuration.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="475" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1024x475.jpeg" alt="Pi 4 MicroHDMI Ports" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1024x475.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-300x139.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-768x356.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1536x713.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-2048x951.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-150x70.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-696x323.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1068x496.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-4-MicroHDMI-Ports-1920x891.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The power circuit was actually reduced in this model, from 1.34 down to 1.25A and the port was changed to USB C.</p>
<h3>Raspberry Pi 5</h3>
<p>Lastly and most recently we have the Pi 5 which was launched in October 2023.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1024x570.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi 5" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1024x570.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1536x855.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-2048x1140.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1068x595.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-5-1920x1069.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>This Pi features a Broadcom BCM2712 SOC with 4 Cortex A76 cores running at a significantly faster 2.4Ghz and a VideoCore VII GPU running at 800MHz.</p><p>So quite a bump up in CPU and GPU performance.</p>
<p>It is offered in 3 RAM configurations but the drop in a 1GB offering means that they’re no longer available at the $35 price point. There is a fairly significant increase in price up to $50 for the base 2GB variant.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1024x570.jpeg" alt="Pi 5 RAM Configurations" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1024x570.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1536x855.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-2048x1140.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1068x595.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Pi-5-RAM-Configurations-1920x1069.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Some other notable changes are the inclusion of a PCIe port which enables IO expansion and a much improved power circuit. The PCIe port is quite commonly used to add an NVMe SSD instead of a microSD card for the operating system.</p><p>The power circuit was upgraded to handle the PCIe port addition, now stepping up to 5V at up to 5A, along with a power button for the first time.</p>

<p>The change in power supply requirements to 5V and 5A is a bit annoying as most power delivery capable supplies cap out 2.5 or 3A at 5V. It would have been more universal to require a 9V 3A supply to meet the Pis power requirements. I assume they steered away from this because the Pi’s circuitry runs at 5V and 3.3V and they would have then needed to add another onboard DC-DC converter which increases complexity, size and potentially the cost, it would also have made it a bit less efficient. But this does mean that you most likely need to buy a USB C power supply that has been purpose-built for the Pi 5.</p>
<p>The Pi 5 is also the first Pi to have its own dedicated fan socket.</p><p>So that’s a summary of the hardware changes, now let’s boot them up and take a look at their performance.</p>
<h2>Testing The Performance Of Each Generation Of Pi</h2>
<p>To compare the performance between the Pi’s, I’m going to run the following tests.</p>

<ul>
<li>I’m going to attempt to playback a <strong>1080P YouTube video</strong> in the browser, although I expect we’ll have problems with this up to the Pi 4.</li>
<li>We’ll then run a <strong>Sysbench CPU benchmark</strong> which I’ll do both for a single-core and multicore.</li>
<li>Then we’ll run a <strong>GLMark2 GPU benchmark</strong>.</li>
<li>Then test the storage speed using <strong>James Chambers Pi Benchmark script</strong>.</li>
<li>Then we’ll run an <strong>iPerf3 Network Speed</strong> test.</li>
<li>Lastly, we’ll look at <strong>Power Consumption</strong>, both at idle and with the CPU maxed out.</li>
<li>And then use that data to determine each Pi’s <strong>Performance per Watt</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep things as consistent as possible I’m going to be running the latest available version of Pi OS from <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/">Raspberry Pi Imager</a> for each Pi. I was pleasantly surprised to find that you can still flash an OS image for the original Pi in their latest version of Imager.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="714" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1024x714.jpeg" alt="Raspberry Pi Imager Still Supports Pi 1" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1024x714.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-300x209.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-768x536.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1536x1071.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-150x105.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-696x485.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1-1068x745.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Raspberry-Pi-Imager-Still-Supports-Pi-1.jpeg 1546w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>

<h3>1080P YouTube Video Playback</h3>
<p>I started with the original Pi and its first boot and setup process was a lesson in patience. It took me the best part of two hours to get the first boot complete, the Pi updated and the testing utilities installed but I got there in the end.</p>

<p>The Pi 2 managed to open the browser and actually started playing back a 1080P video, which was surprising, but playback was terrible. It dropped pretty much all of the frames both in the window and fullscreen.</p>

<p>The Pi 3 played video back noticeably better than the Pi 2, but it’s still quite a long way away from being usable and still drops a lot of frames.</p><p>The Pi 4 handled 1080P video reasonably well. It had some initial trouble but then settled down. Fullscreen is also a bit choppy but is also usable.</p>
<p>The Pi 5 handled 1080P playback well without any significant issues both in the window and fullscreen.</p>

<p>In single core, the Pi 1 managed a rather dismal score of 68, the Pi 2 got a bit more than double this score but the real step up was with the Pi 3 which managed 18 times higher than the Pi 2. The Pi 4 and Pi 5 also offered good improvements on the previous generations.</p>

<p>Comparing the combined multicore score of the Pi 5 to what the single core on the Pi 1 can do, the Pi 5 is a little over 600 times faster.</p><h3>GLmark2 GPU Benchmark</h3>
<p>Next, I tried running a GLMark2 GPU benchmark on them. I used the <a href="https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/glmark2-es2-wayland.1.html">GLMark2-es2-wayland</a> version which is designed for OpenGL ES so that the Pi 1 was supported.</p>

</figure>
<p>I was surprised that the Pi 1 was even able to run GLMark2 – it did complete the benchmark, although the score wasn’t all that impressive.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="570" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1024x570.jpeg" alt="GLmark2 Scores" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1024x570.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-300x167.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-768x428.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1536x855.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-2048x1140.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-696x387.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1068x595.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GLmark2-Scores-1920x1069.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>These results really show how the Pi’s GPU has improved in the last two generations. Prior to these tests, I had never seen a score below 100 and the Pi 1, 2 and 3 managed to fall short of triple digits. Pi 5 scored over 2.5 times higher than the Pi 4.</p><h3>Storage Speed Test</h3>
<p>Next was the storage speed test using <a href="https://github.com/TheRemote/PiBenchmarks">James Chambers Pi Benchmarks</a> script. The bus speed has increased over the years from 25MHz on the Pi 1 to 100MHz on the Pi 5, so I expect we’ll see these reflected in the benchmark scores.</p>

<p>The storage speed test’s results aren’t as dramatic as the CPU and GPU results but show a steady improvement between generations. The Pi 3 did a bit worse than the Pi 2 but this small difference is likely just due to variability in the tests.</p>

<h3>iPerf Network Speed Test</h3>
<p>Next, I ran the iPerf network speed test on each.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="574" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1024x574.jpeg" alt="iPerf Network Speed Test" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1024x574.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-768x430.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-2048x1147.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-696x390.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1068x598.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iPerf-Network-Speed-Test-1920x1076.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>The Pi 1 doesn’t quite get close to its theoretical 100Mbps but the Pi 2 does. The Pi 3 B+ although having Gigabit Ethernet is limited by this running over USB 2.0 which only has a theoretical maximum of 300MBps, so it came quite close. Both the Pi 4 and 5 expectedly come close to theoretical Gigabit speeds.</p>

<h3>Power Consumption Test</h3>
<p>Lastly, I tested the power consumption of each Pi at idle and under load.</p>

<p>I used the same Pi 5 power adaptor to test all of the Pis to keep things consistent and I just used a USB C to micro USB adaptor for the Pi 1, 2 and 3.</p><figure>

<p>The idle results were closer than I expected. The Pi 2 had the lowest idle power draw and the Pi 5 the highest, but all were within a watt or two of each other. At full load, you can see the increase in CPU power draw more physical power with the Pi 5 drawing almost three times the Pi 1 and Pi 2.</p>

<p>Converted to performance per watt using the Sysbench results, we can again see how much better the Pi 4 and 5 are over the Pi 1 and 2. There is a clear improvement in the performance that each generation of Pi is able to get per watt of power, which is essentially its efficiency. Although the Pi 5 draws more power than the Pi 1 under full load, you’re getting almost 200 times more power out of it per watt.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts On The Drag Race And Future Pis</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed working through this project to see how much Pi’s have changed over the years, particularly in terms of performance. I still remember being amazed at the size and price of the original Pi when it came out and it’s great that they’re still fully supported and can still be used for projects – albeit with less CPU-intensive projects.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="572" src="https://www.the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1024x572.jpeg" alt="Buck Bunny Playing On Raspberry Pi" srcset="https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1024x572.jpeg 1024w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-300x168.jpeg 300w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-768x429.jpeg 768w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1536x858.jpeg 1536w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-2048x1144.jpeg 2048w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-150x84.jpeg 150w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-696x389.jpeg 696w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1068x596.jpeg 1068w, https://the-diy-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Buck-Bunny-Playing-On-Raspberry-Pi-1920x1072.jpeg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>
<p>Let me know what you think has been the biggest improvement to the Pi over the years and what you’d still like to see added to future models in the comments section below.</p>
<p>I personally really like the addition of the PCIe port on the Pi 5 and I’d like to see 2.5Gb networking and a DisplayPort or USB C with DisplayPort added to a future generation of Pi.</p>

<p>When using <strong>servoshell</strong> on Windows, you can now see <code>--help</code> and log output, as long as servoshell was started in a console (<a href="https://github.com/jschwe">@jschwe</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40961">#40961</a>).</p>
<p>Servo diagnostics options are now accessible in servoshell via the <code>SERVO_DIAGNOSTICS</code> environment variable (<a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41013">#41013</a>), in addition to the usual <code>-Z</code> / <code>--debug=</code> arguments.</p>
<p><a href="https://book.servo.org/contributing/devtools.html"><strong>Servo’s devtools</strong></a> now partially support the <strong>Network</strong> &gt; <strong>Security</strong> tab (<a href="https://github.com/jiang1997">@jiang1997</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40567">#40567</a>), allowing you to inspect some of the TLS details of your requests.
We’ve also made it <strong>compatible with Firefox 145</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/eerii">@eerii</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41087">#41087</a>), and use fewer IPC resources (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41161">#41161</a>).</p>

<p>Servo now has basic support for <strong>HTTP proxies</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/Narfinger">@Narfinger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40941">#40941</a>).
You can set the proxy URL in the <code>http_proxy</code> (<a href="https://github.com/Narfinger">@Narfinger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41209">#41209</a>) or <code>HTTP_PROXY</code> (<a href="https://github.com/treeshateorcs">@treeshateorcs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/yezhizhen">@yezhizhen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41268">#41268</a>) environment variables, or via <code>--pref network_http_proxy_uri</code>.</p>
<p>We now use the <strong>system root certificates</strong> by default (<a href="https://github.com/Narfinger">@Narfinger</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40935">#40935</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41179">#41179</a>), on most platforms.
If you don’t want to trust the system root certificates, you can instead continue to use Mozilla’s root certificates with <code>--pref network_use_webpki_roots</code>.
As always, you can also add your own root certificates via <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/opts/struct.Opts.html"><code>Opts</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/opts/struct.Opts.html#structfield.certificate_path"><code>certificate_path</code></a> (<code>--certificate-path=</code>).</p>
<p>We have a new <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.SiteDataManager.html"><code>SiteDataManager</code></a> API for managing <strong>localStorage</strong>, <strong>sessionStorage</strong>, and <strong>cookies</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/janvarga">@janvarga</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41236">#41236</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41255">#41255</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41378">#41378</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41523">#41523</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41528">#41528</a>), and a new <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/struct.NetworkManager.html"><code>NetworkManager</code></a> API for managing the <strong>cache</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/janvarga">@janvarga</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41255">#41255</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41474">#41474</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41386">#41386</a>).

<p><a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#simple-dialogs"><strong>Simple dialogs</strong></a> – that is alert(), confirm(), and prompt() – are now exposed to embedders via a new <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/enum.SimpleDialog.html"><code>SimpleDialog</code></a> type in <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/webview_delegate/enum.EmbedderControl.html"><code>EmbedderControl</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/40982">#40982</a>).
This new interface is harder to misuse, and no longer requires boilerplate for embedders that wish to <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#cannot-show-simple-dialogs">ignore simple dialogs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Web console messages</strong>, including messages from the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console_API">Console API</a>, are now accessible via <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.ServoDelegate.html"><code>ServoDelegate</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.ServoDelegate.html#method.show_console_message"><code>show_console_message</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.WebViewDelegate.html"><code>WebViewDelegate</code></a>::<a href="https://doc.servo.org/servo/trait.WebViewDelegate.html#method.show_console_message"><code>show_console_message</code></a> (<a href="https://github.com/atbrakhi">@atbrakhi</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41351">#41351</a>).</p>

To shut down Servo, simply <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/fn.drop.html">drop</a> the last <code>Servo</code> handle or let it go out of scope.
<code>Servo</code>::<code>start_shutting_down</code> and <code>Servo</code>::<code>deinit</code> have been removed (<a href="https://github.com/mukilan">@mukilan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>, <a href="https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/41012">#41012</a>).</p>

<p>Thanks again for your generous support!
We are now receiving <strong>7110 USD/month</strong> (+10.5% over November) in recurring donations.
This helps us cover the cost of our <strong><a href="https://ci0.servo.org/">speedy</a> <a href="https://ci1.servo.org/">CI</a> <a href="https://ci2.servo.org/">and</a> <a href="https://ci3.servo.org/">benchmarking</a> <a href="https://ci4.servo.org/">servers</a></strong>, one of our latest <strong><a href="https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2025-06/#:~:text=Servo">Outreachy interns</a></strong>, and funding <strong><a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/09/17/your-donations-at-work-funding-jdm/">maintainer work</a></strong> that helps more people contribute to Servo.</p>
<p>Servo is also on <a href="https://thanks.dev/">thanks.dev</a>, and already <strong>30 GitHub users</strong> (+2 over November) that depend on Servo are sponsoring us there.
If you use Servo libraries like <a href="https://crates.io/crates/url/reverse_dependencies">url</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/html5ever/reverse_dependencies">html5ever</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/selectors/reverse_dependencies">selectors</a>, or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cssparser/reverse_dependencies">cssparser</a>, signing up for <a href="https://thanks.dev/">thanks.dev</a> could be a good way for you (or your employer) to give back to the community.</p>
<p>We now have <a href="https://servo.org/blog/2025/11/21/sponsorship-tiers/"><strong>sponsorship tiers</strong></a> that allow you or your organisation to donate to the Servo project with public acknowlegement of your support.
A big thanks from Servo to our newest Bronze Sponsors: <strong>Anthropy</strong>, <strong>Niclas Overby</strong>, and <strong>RxDB</strong>!
If you’re interested in this kind of sponsorship, please contact us at <a href="https://servo.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0963666067497a6c7b7f6627667b6e"><span data-cfemail="046e6b6d6a44776176726b2a6b7663">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<p>We’ve recently published one talk and one blog post:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-W1mSXdlRqA"><strong>Web engine CI on a shoestring budget</strong></a> (<a href="https://www.azabani.com/talks/2025-12-18-shoestring-web-engine-ci/">slides</a>; <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-a-new-web-engine-written-in-rust/">transcript</a>) – Delan Azabani (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>) spoke about the CI system that keeps our builds and tryjobs moving fast, running nearly two million tests in under half an hour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/mrego/servo-2025-stats/"><strong>Servo 2025 Stats</strong></a> – Manuel Rego (<a href="https://github.com/mrego">@mrego</a>) wrote about the growth of the Servo project, and how our many new contributors have enabled that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have two <strong>upcoming</strong> talks at <a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/"><strong>FOSDEM 2026</strong></a> in <strong>Brussels</strong> later this month:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/LXFKS9-servo-project-impact/"><strong>The Servo project and its impact on the web platform ecosystem</strong></a> – Manuel Rego (<a href="https://github.com/mrego">@mrego</a>) is speaking on <strong>Saturday 31 January</strong> at <a href="https://everytimezone.com/?t=697d4600,8ac"><strong>14:00 local time</strong></a> (13:00 UTC), about Servo’s impact on spec issues, interop bugs, test cases, and the broader web platform ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/3J8GUD-servo-streams-reimplementation/"><strong>Implementing Streams Spec in Servo web engine</strong></a> – Taym Haddadi (<a href="https://github.com/Taym95">@Taym95</a>) is speaking on <strong>Saturday 31 January</strong> at <a href="https://everytimezone.com/?t=697d4600,98d"><strong>17:45 local time</strong></a> (16:45 UTC), about our experiences writing a new implementation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API">Streams API</a> that is independent of the one in SpiderMonkey.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Servo developers Martin Robinson (<a href="https://github.com/mrobinson">@mrobinson</a>) and Delan Azabani (<a href="https://github.com/delan">@delan</a>) will also be attending FOSDEM 2026, so it would be a great time to come along and chat about Servo!</p>

<div><p>There is no way, <i>no possible way</i> that Google prohibits the use of multiple accounts. They do not. They cannot. I just asked Gemini and I checked the actual TOS. It does not, in any way, prohibit these uses.</p><p>In fact, this is plainly evident by the way they give you <i>tools to operate them</i> in a systematic way. You can add multiple accounts to a single Android "user". You can add them to a single Google Chromebook account under one signed-in account. You can add multiple accounts separately to the same Chromebook.</p><p>You can add multiple accounts with the same names, the same birthdates, and the same Driver License. I've validated <i>at least two YouTube channels</i> by showing exactly the same ID.</p><p>Google did not terminate your account for the reason you state. You are not telling us all the background information.</p><p>Google may indeed terminate multiple accounts for the same person because of TOS violations. They will definitely link and associate your accounts, so making an "alt account" for misbehavior is not safe. If my "alt account" is compromised or violates TOS, then I can expect they will discipline all 6 equally, because they're all linked.</p><p>But operating multiple accounts is <i>very explicitly supported</i> by Google, and by Microsoft as well, I will say.

Facebook definitely prohibited this in the past, although you can maintain multiple "profiles" and "pages" that have unique settings and personalities.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46745439"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_46745439" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46745439&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46744807"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Well, spam is no big deal, and any scam that comes via email should not affect anyone who is educated and prepared for them.</p><p>Of course, with a well-known email address, you could run a higher risk of credential stuffing, and an account takeover by someone who hijacks your email account, and then pivots from there to taking other accounts.</p><p>But this seems to be a risk we all take: email addresses are meant to be shared, to be public, and to be well-known to anyone to correspond with us.</p><p>I will say that disclosing my email address to certain parties has had noticeable effects. For example, I used "MYADDRESS+Echovita@gmail.com" once, and only once. My godfather had passed away, and I ordered some flowers for his funeral. And I put that order through with that email address.</p><p>Well, Echovita themselves had a data breach shortly afterwards, and I was inundated with scam emails. Just all sorts of attackers and they were basically all using the same M.O. But they were readily identifiable because I had used that "+Echovita" to identify it uniquely. And they really haven't stopped coming in. It's been 5 years since that breach.</p><p>So yes, especially with untrusted parties, it may help to tag your email address.

Apple has openly fought against the FBI in the past when it was asked to provide a backdoor into an iPhone.

Many Small Queries Are Efficient In SQLite
</p>
</div>





<h2 id="executive_summary"><span>1. </span>Executive Summary</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
200 SQL statements per webpage is excessive for client/server database
engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.

</p></li><li><p>
But with SQLite, 200 or more SQL statement per webpage is not a problem.

</p></li><li><p>
SQLite can also do large and complex queries efficiently, just like
client/server databases.  But SQLite can do many smaller queries
efficiently too.  Application developers can use whichever technique
works best for the task at hand.
     
</p></li></ul>

<h2 id="the_perceived_problem"><span>2. </span>The Perceived Problem</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html#website">Appropriate Uses For SQLite</a> page says that
dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL
statements each.
This has provoked criticism from readers.  Examples:

</p><ul>
<li><p>
<i>"200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page"</i>
</p></li><li><p>
<i>"For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much."</i>
</p></li><li><p>
<i>"[This is] bad design"</i>
</p></li></ul>

<p>
Such criticism would be well-founded for a traditional client/server
database engine, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.  In
a client/server database, each SQL statement requires a message
round-trip from the application to the database server and back to
the application.  Doing over 200 round-trip messages, sequentially,
can be a serious performance drag.  This is sometimes called the
"N+1 Query Problem" or the "N+1 Select Problem" and it is an anti-pattern.

</p><h2 id="n_1_queries_are_not_a_problem_with_sqlite"><span>3. </span>N+1 Queries Are Not A Problem With SQLite</h2>

<p>
SQLite is <u>not</u> client/server, however.  The SQLite database runs
in the same process address space as the application.  Queries do not
involve message round-trips, only a function call.  The latency
of a single SQL query is far less in SQLite.  Hence, using a large number
of queries with SQLite is not the problem.

</p><h2 id="the_need_for_over_200_sql_statements_per_webpage"><span>4. </span>The Need For Over 200 SQL Statements Per Webpage</h2>

<p>
The dynamic webpages on the SQLite website are mostly generated by
the <a href="https://www.fossil-scm.org/">Fossil version control system</a>.
A typical dynamic
page would be a timeline such as <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline</a>.
A log of all SQL used by the timeline is shown below.

</p><p>
The first group of queries in the log are extracting display options
from the "config" and "global_config" tables of the Fossil database.
Then there is a single complex query that extracts a list of all elements
to be displayed on the timeline.
This "timeline" query demonstrates that SQLite can easily process complex
relational database queries involving multiple tables, subqueries, and
complex WHERE clause constraints, and it can make effective use of indexes
to solve the queries with minimal disk I/O.

</p><p>
Following the single big "timeline" query, 
there are additional queries for each timeline element.
Fossil is using the "N+1 Query" pattern rather than trying
to grab all the information in as few queries as possible.
But that is ok because there is no unnecessary IPC overhead.
At the bottom of
each timeline page, Fossil shows approximately how long it took to generate
the page.  For a 50-entry timeline, the latency is usually less than
25 milliseconds.  Profiling shows that few of those milliseconds
were spent inside the database engine.

</p><p>
Using the N+1 Query pattern in Fossil does not harm the application.  
But the N+1 Query pattern does have benefits.  For one, the
section of the code that creates the timeline query can be
completely separate from the section that prepares each timeline
entry for display.
This provides a separation of responsibility that helps keep the code
simple and easy to maintain.  Secondly, the information
needed for display, and the queries needed to extract that information,
vary according to what type of objects are to be shown.  Check-ins need one
set of queries.  Tickets need another set of queries.  Wiki pages need a
different query.  And so forth.  By implementing these queries on-demand
and in the part of the code dealing with the various entities, there is
further separation of responsibility and simplification of the overall 
code base.

</p><p>
So, SQLite is able to do one or two large and complex queries, or it can
do many smaller and simpler queries.  Both are efficient.  An application
can use either or both techniques, depending on what works best for the
situation at hand.

timeline (captured on 2016-09-16):

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main"><article><div><p>I’ve been using GitLab for my private projects for years now. I just started using it at some point and never had a reason to switch.</p><h2 id="how-i-ended-up-here">How I ended up here</h2><p>Back when GitHub still charged for private repositories, GitLab offered them for free. That was the initial hook. I had a bunch of small projects and experiments that I didn’t want to publish but also didn’t want to pay for. GitLab was the obvious choice.</p><p>GitHub eventually made private repos free too, but by then my workflow was already built around GitLab. All my CI pipelines, Docker images, deployment scripts - everything pointed there.</p><h2 id="the-docker-registry-thing">The Docker registry thing</h2><p>Every GitLab project comes with a Container Registry. This is probably the feature I use most.</p><p>The workflow is simple. Build an image locally or in CI, push it to the registry, pull it wherever you need it.</p><p>No separate Docker Hub account. No thinking about pull rate limits (remember when Docker Hub introduced those and broke half the internet’s CI pipelines?). No managing access tokens for yet another service.</p><p>For my private projects this is perfect. I don’t need the discoverability of Docker Hub. I just need a place to store images that integrates with my existing authentication.</p><p>The 10GB limit per project sounds small on paper but I’ve never come close to hitting it. Old tags get cleaned up, base layers are shared, and most of my images aren’t that big anyway.</p><h2 id="cicd">CI/CD</h2><p>GitLab CI was one of the earlier “CI config as code” implementations that I used. You drop a <code>.gitlab-ci.yml</code> in your repo and things start happening. The config is versioned with everything else, which means you can see exactly what your pipeline looked like six months ago.</p><p>Nothing fancy. Build the image, push it, optionally deploy. The manual trigger on deploy is nice - I can build automatically but still control when things go to production.</p><p>The shared runners GitLab provides handle most of my workloads. They’re not fast, but they’re free and reliable. For the times when I needed something specific - like a runner with more memory or access to my private network - setting up my own runner on a cheap VPS was straightforward. Install the runner, register it with a token, done.</p><p>The documentation for CI/CD is extensive. Almost too extensive. There are so many features and options that finding what you need can take a while. But once you figure out your patterns, you mostly copy-paste from your own previous configs.</p><h2 id="the-annoying-parts">The annoying parts</h2><p>Let’s talk about what’s not great.</p><p><strong>Speed.</strong> The GitLab web interface has always felt sluggish to me. Click on a merge request, wait. Switch to the pipeline view, wait. Open the job log, wait. It’s not terrible, but there’s this constant friction that adds up over a long session.</p><p>I’ve noticed improvements recently. Either they optimized things or I’ve just gotten used to it - hard to say. But it’s still not as snappy as GitHub.</p><p><strong>Feature overload.</strong> GitLab tries to be everything. Issue tracking, project management, wiki, snippets, package registry, container registry, security scanning, infrastructure management, monitoring… The sidebar menu goes on forever.</p><p>I use maybe 10% of what’s available. Repositories, merge requests, CI/CD, container registry. That’s pretty much it.</p><p>This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, feature bloat. On the other, if I ever need something like a private NPM registry or security scanning, it’s already there. I just haven’t needed it yet.</p><h2 id="the-value-proposition">The value proposition</h2><p>I run about a dozen private projects ranging from active side projects to abandoned experiments I keep around “just in case.” None of this costs me anything. It’s crazy.</p><h2 id="my-workflow">My workflow</h2><p>All my private projects live on GitLab. Prototypes, experiments, half-finished ideas, things I’m actively working on but not ready to share. It’s my digital workshop where I can make a mess without anyone watching.</p><p>GitHub is different. That’s where I put things I want people to see.</p><p>This split works well for me. I get the collaboration and visibility benefits of GitHub for public stuff while keeping my private mess organized on GitLab with proper CI/CD and container registries.</p><p>Some people do everything on GitHub. Some do everything on GitLab. Having a foot in both camps might seem redundant but honestly, they serve different purposes in my workflow.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/">https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-estimate-work/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46742389">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a kind of polite fiction at the heart of the software industry. It goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Estimating how long software projects will take is very hard, but not impossible. A skilled engineering team can, with time and effort, learn how long it will take for them to deliver work, which will in turn allow their organization to make good business plans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is, of course, false. As every experienced software engineer knows, <strong>it is not possible to accurately estimate software projects</strong>. The tension between this polite fiction and its well-understood falseness causes a lot of strange activity in tech companies.</p>
<p>For instance, many engineering teams estimate work in <a href="https://asana.com/resources/t-shirt-sizing">t-shirt sizes</a> instead of time, because it just feels too obviously silly to the engineers in question to give direct time estimates. Naturally, these t-shirt sizes are immediately translated into hours and days when the estimates make their way up the management chain.</p>
<p>Alternatively, software engineers who are genuinely trying to give good time estimates have ridiculous <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19671824">heuristics</a> like “double your initial estimate and add 20%“. This is basically the same as giving up and saying “just estimate everything at a month”.</p>
<p>Should tech companies just stop estimating? One of my guiding principles is that <strong>when a tech company is doing something silly, they’re probably doing it for a good reason</strong>. In other words, practices that appear to not make sense are often serving some more basic, <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/seeing-like-a-software-company">illegible</a> role in the organization. So what is the actual purpose of estimation, and how can you do it well as a software engineer?</p>
<h3>Why estimation is impossible</h3>
<p>Before I get into that, I should justify my core assumption a little more. People <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/software-estimates-have-never-worked-and-never-will-a41a9c71">have</a> <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18487253">written</a> <a href="https://medium.com/@riaanfnel/the-problem-with-estimates-f3d5cddd5e62">a lot</a> about this already, so I’ll keep it brief.</p>
<p>I’m also going to concede that <strong>sometimes you can accurately estimate software work</strong>, when that work is very well-understood and very small in scope. For instance, if I know it takes half an hour to deploy a service<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>, and I’m being asked to update the text in a link, I can accurately estimate the work at something like 45 minutes: five minutes to push the change up, ten minutes to wait for CI, thirty minutes to deploy.</p>
<p>For most of us, the majority of software work is not like this. We work on poorly-understood systems and cannot predict exactly what must be done in advance. Most programming in large systems is <em>research</em>: identifying prior art, mapping out enough of the system to understand the effects of changes, and so on. Even for fairly small changes, we simply do not know what’s involved in making the change until we go and look.</p>
<p>The pro-estimation dogma says that these questions ought to be answered during the planning process, so that each individual piece of work being discussed is scoped small enough to be accurately estimated. I’m not impressed by this answer. It seems to me to be a throwback to the bad old days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_architect">software architecture</a>, where one architect would map everything out in advance, so that individual programmers simply had to mechanically follow instructions. Nobody does that now, because it doesn’t work: programmers must be empowered to make architectural decisions, because they’re the ones who are actually in contact with the code<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>. Even if it did work, that would simply shift the impossible-to-estimate part of the process backwards, into the planning meeting (where of course you can’t write or run code, which makes it near-impossible to accurately answer the kind of questions involved).</p>
<p>In short: software engineering projects are not dominated by the known work, but by the unknown work, which always takes 90% of the time. However, only the known work can be accurately estimated. It’s therefore impossible to accurately estimate software projects in advance.</p>
<h3>Estimates do not come from engineers</h3>
<p>Estimates do not help engineering teams deliver work more efficiently. Many of the most productive years of my career were spent on teams that did no estimation at all: we were either working on projects that had to be done no matter what, and so didn’t really need an estimate, or on projects that would deliver a constant drip of value as we went, so we could just keep going indefinitely<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In a very real sense, <strong>estimates aren’t even made by engineers at all</strong>. If an engineering team comes up with a long estimate for a project that some VP really wants, they will be pressured into lowering it (or some other, more compliant engineering team will be handed the work). If the estimate on an undesirable project - or a project that’s intended to “hold space” for future unplanned work - is too short, the team will often be encouraged to increase it, or their manager will just add a 30% buffer.</p>
<p>One exception to this is projects that are technically impossible, or just genuinely prohibitively difficult. If a manager consistently fails to pressure their teams into giving the “right” estimates, that can send a signal up that maybe the work can’t be done after all. Smart VPs and directors will try to avoid taking on technically impossible projects.</p>
<p>Another exception to this is areas of the organization that senior leadership doesn’t really care about. In a sleepy backwater, often the formal estimation process does actually get followed to the letter, because there’s no director or VP who wants to jump in and shape the estimates to their ends. This is one way that some parts of a tech company can have drastically different engineering cultures to other parts. I’ll let you imagine the consequences when the company is re-orged and these teams are pulled into the spotlight.</p>
<p><strong>Estimates are political tools for non-engineers in the organization</strong>. They help managers, VPs, directors, and C-staff decide on which projects get funded and which projects get cancelled. </p>
<h3>Estimates define the work, not the other way around</h3>
<p>The standard way of thinking about estimates is that you start with a proposed piece of software work, and you then go and figure out how long it will take. <strong>This is entirely backwards.</strong> Instead, teams will often start with the estimate, and then go and figure out what kind of software work they can do to meet it.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re working on a LLM chatbot, and your director wants to implement “talk with a PDF”. If you have six months to do the work, you might implement a robust file upload system, some pipeline to chunk and embed the PDF content for semantic search, a way to extract PDF pages as image content to capture formatting and diagrams, and so on. If you have one day to do the work, you will naturally search for simpler approaches: for instance, converting the PDF to text client-side and sticking the entire thing in the LLM context, or offering a plain-text “grep the PDF” tool.</p>
<p>This is true at even at the level of individual lines of code. When you have weeks or months until your deadline, you might spend a lot of time thinking airily about how you could refactor the codebase to make your new feature fit in as elegantly as possible. When you have hours, you will typically be laser-focused on finding an approach that will actually work. There are always many different ways to solve software problems. Engineers thus have quite a lot of discretion about how to get it done.</p>
<h3>How I estimate work</h3>
<p>So how do I estimate, given all that?</p>
<p><strong>I gather as much political context as possible before I even look at the code</strong>. How much pressure is on this project? Is it a casual ask, or do we <em>have</em> to find a way to do this? What kind of estimate is my management chain looking for? There’s a huge difference between “the CTO <em>really</em> wants this in one week” and “we were looking for work for your team and this seemed like it could fit”.</p>
<p>Ideally, I go to the code <strong>with an estimate already in hand</strong>. Instead of asking myself “how long would it take to do this”, where “this” could be any one of a hundred different software designs, I ask myself “which approaches could be done in one week?“.</p>
<p><strong>I spend more time worrying about unknowns than knowns</strong>. As I said above, unknown work always dominates software projects. The more “dark forests” in the codebase this feature has to touch, the higher my estimate will be - or, more concretely, the tighter I need to constrain the set of approaches to the known work.</p>
<p>Finally, <strong>I go back to my manager with a risk assessment, not with a concrete estimate</strong>. I don’t ever say “this is a four-week project”. I say something like “I don’t think we’ll get this done in one week, because X Y Z would need to all go right, and at least one of those things is bound to take a lot more work than we expect. Ideally, I go back to my manager with a <em>series</em> of plans, not just one:</p>
<ul>
<li>We tackle X Y Z directly, which <em>might</em> all go smoothly but if it blows out we’ll be here for a month</li>
<li>We bypass Y and Z entirely, which would introduce these other risks but possibly allow us to hit the deadline</li>
<li>We bring in help from another team who’s more familiar with X and Y, so we just have to focus on Z</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, I don’t “break down the work to determine how long it will take”. My management chain already knows how long they want it to take. <strong>My job is to figure out the set of software approaches that match that estimate.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes that set is empty: the project is just impossible, no matter how you slice it. In that case, my management chain needs to get together and figure out some way to alter the requirements. But if I always said “this is impossible”, my managers would find someone else to do their estimates. When I do that, I’m drawing on a well of trust that I build up by making pragmatic estimates the rest of the time.</p>
<h3>Addressing some objections</h3>
<p>Many engineers find this approach distasteful. One reason is that they don’t like estimating in conditions of uncertainty, so they insist on having all the unknown questions answered in advance. I have written a lot about this in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/taking-a-position"><em>Engineers who won’t commit</em></a> and <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/clarity"><em>How I provide technical clarity to non-technical leaders</em></a>, but suffice to say that I think it’s cowardly. If you refuse to estimate, you’re forcing someone less technical to estimate for you.</p>
<p>Some engineers think that their job is to constantly push back against engineering management, and that helping their manager find technical compromises is betraying some kind of sacred engineering trust. I wrote about this in <a href="https://www.seangoedecke.com/a-little-bit-cynical"><em>Software engineers should be a little bit cynical</em></a>. If you want to spend your career doing that, that’s fine, but I personally find it more rewarding to find ways to work with my managers (who have almost exclusively been nice people).</p>
<p>Other engineers might say that they rarely feel this kind of pressure from their directors or VPs to alter estimates, and that this is really just the sign of a dysfunctional engineering organization. Maybe! I can only speak for the engineering organizations I’ve worked in. But my suspicion is that these engineers are really just saying that they work “out of the spotlight”, where there’s not much pressure in general and teams can adopt whatever processes they want. There’s nothing wrong with that. But I don’t think it qualifies you to give helpful advice to engineers who do feel this kind of pressure.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I think software engineering estimation is generally misunderstood.</p>
<p>The common view is that a manager proposes some technical project, the team gets together to figure out how long it would take to build, and then the manager makes staffing and planning decisions with that information. In fact, it’s the reverse: a manager comes to the team with an estimate already in hand (though they might not come out and admit it), and then the team must figure out what kind of technical project might be possible within that estimate.</p>
<p>This is because estimates are not by or for engineering teams. They are tools used for managers to negotiate with each other about planned work. Very occasionally, when a project is literally impossible, the estimate can serve as a way for the team to communicate that fact upwards. But that requires trust. A team that is always pushing back on estimates will not be believed when they do encounter a genuinely impossible proposal.</p>
<p>When I estimate, I extract the range my manager is looking for, and only then do I go through the code and figure out what can be done in that time. I never come back with a flat “two weeks” figure. Instead, I come back with a range of possibilities, each with their own risks, and let my manager make that tradeoff.</p>
<p><strong>It is not possible to accurately estimate software work.</strong> Software projects spend most of their time grappling with unknown problems, which by definition can’t be estimated in advance. To estimate well, you must therefore basically ignore all the known aspects of the work, and instead try and make educated guesses about how many unknowns there are, and how scary each unknown is.</p>
<p>edit: I should thank one of my readers, Karthik, who emailed me to ask about estimates, thus revealing to me that I had many more opinions than I thought.</p>

   <p>In 2020, Connie Sherburne's husband of 31 years, Peter, died in a crash while piloting their small plane.</p>   <p>Sherburne, a practical person, immediately focused on what needed to be done.</p>   <p>"I went home that evening, and the next morning, I got up and I thought, 'Hit the ground running. You've got all this to take care of.'"</p>   <p>She drove to their insurance company in Escondido, Calif., to transfer the insurance for Peter's truck into her name. Because of the pandemic, the office was staffed by just one person. The woman opened the door to let Sherburne inside, and they sat across from each other at a desk.</p>   
   <p>"It didn't take her but a few minutes to take care of why I was there," Sherburne recalled.</p>   <p>"When she got done, she stopped and she looked at me across her desk, and she made sure that I was looking at her — that she had my full attention."</p>   <p>"And she said, 'OK, so now that we've finished with that, people are going to stop and ask you, "How can I help?"' And then she gave this pregnant pause, and she said, 'Let them.'"</p>   <p>Sherburne took in the advice, absorbing the moment. She wasn't the kind of person to reach out to others for help.</p>

   <p>"But because she said it with such force, it really, really made sense to me," Sherburne said.</p>   <p>As soon as she got home, she realized that she did need help. The firewood she used to heat her home was running low, and winter was around the corner. Chopping wood was something Peter had always done. But this time, she asked a friend to take care of it.</p>   <p>"So many, many people did little things and big things to help me," Sherburne said. "One of the neighbors actually cooked for me for four years — dinners — and her husband delivered the dinners to me."</p>   
   <p>Sherburne says she would have never reached out for support if not for the advice of the woman at the insurance company.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RESNX-S1-5683170-101" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>"In the back of my mind, I kept hearing her voice, you know, 'Let them.'"</p>   <p>A few years later, Sherburne went back to the insurance office to tell the woman how deeply her words had affected her. But the agent didn't work there anymore.</p>   <p>"So I just wanted to tell her how much that meant to me," Sherburne said.</p>   <p>"It was such a little thing for this woman just to say that to me. But she didn't realize what a huge thing it was going to be to help me through all this."</p>   <p><a href="https://hiddenbrain.org/myunsunghero/" target="_blank"><em>My Unsung Hero is also a podcast</em></a><em> — new episodes are released every Tuesday.

The photo was captioned in all caps: “Arrested far-left agitator Nekima Levy Armstrong for orchestrating church riots in Minnesota.”</p><p>A photo posted by Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem’s account showed the same image with Levy Armstrong wearing a neutral expression.</p><p>Levy Armstrong, who <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-minnesota-church-disruption-bondi-ed084f5005187f58eabe0cc627d1862b">was arrested</a></span> with at least two others Thursday for an anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church where an ICE official also serves as a pastor, released her own video. Levy Armstrong and Chauntyll Allen, a St. Paul school board member who was also arrested in connection to the protest, were both released Friday, according to a post by Levy Armstrong’s organization, the Racial Justice Network. Their attorneys declined to comment.</p>
    
<p>The video shot by Levy Armstrong’s husband, Marques Armstrong, shows several federal agents approaching to arrest her.</p>



<p>“I’m asking you to please treat me with dignity and respect,” she said to the agents.</p>

<p>“We have to put you in handcuffs,” one agent said, while another held up a phone and appeared to record a video.</p>
    
    
    
<p>“Why are you recording?” Levy Armstrong asked. “I would ask that you not record.”</p><p>“It’s not going to be on Twitter,” the agent filming said. “It’s not going to be on anything like that.”</p><p>“We don’t want to create a false narrative,” the agent said.</p><p>At no point in the more than seven-minute video -- which shows Levy Armstrong being handcuffed and led into a government vehicle -- did Levy Armstrong appear to cry. Instead, she talked with agents about her arrest.</p>
    
<p>“You know that this is a significant abuse of power,” she said. “Because I refuse to be silent in the face of brutality from ICE.”</p><p>“I’m not in here to get in a political debate,” the agent filming said.</p><p>In an audio message that Levy Armstrong’s spokesperson shared with The Associated Press, Levy Armstrong said the video of her arrest exposes that the Trump administration had used AI to manipulate images of her arrest.</p><p>“We are being politically persecuted for speaking out against authoritarianism, fascism and the tyranny of the Trump administration,” said Levy Armstrong, who recorded the message Friday morning during a call with her husband from jail.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>___</p><p>Associated Press reporters Giovanna Dell’Orto in Minneapolis and Tiffany Stanley in Washington, D.C., contributed.</p>
