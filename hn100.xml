<p><em>On Wednesday night, a Californian won the $1.08B Powerball lottery, one of the largest prizes in history. But it’s not the most improbable victory. We’re republishing this story from August 2018 about an economist who perfected the lottery:</em></p>
<p>Just after 11 PM on February 15, 1992, a janky ball machine at the Virginia State Lottery HQ spit out 6 winning numbers on live television: 8… 11… 13… 15… 19… 20.</p>
<p>In the coming days, officials would find out that one “person” had secured not only the $27,036,142 jackpot, but 6 second prizes, 132 third prizes, and 135k minor prizes collectively worth another $900k.</p>
<p>What unfolded next was the strangest, most improbable lottery tale in history — one involving thousands of international investors, dozens of complex computer systems, and a mathematical savant who’d masterminded the entire operation from the other side of the world.</p>
<p>This is the story of the man who “gamed” the lottery by buying every possible combination.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s, a young Romanian economist named Stefan Mandel was struggling to get by.</p>
<p>At the time, Romania was under <a href="https://rolandia.eu/romania-ceausescu-communist-regime/"><span>oppressive Communist rule</span></a>, a period marred by poverty, job and food shortages, and “<a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2015/09/01/remembering-life-in-romania-under-communist-rule"><span>profound misery</span></a>.” Mandel’s salary of 360 lei (US $10) a month was not enough to make ends meet, and, as he later <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/01/13/462982983/10-11-51-52-62-18"><span>told</span></a> <i>Planet Money</i>, he needed a way to “get some serious money, quickly.”</p>
<p>Many Romanians in Mandel’s predicament had, out of necessity, turned to lives of crime. But Mandel, a self-described “philosopher-mathematician,” saw another way out: The lottery.</p>

<p>Let’s take a step back here: <i>What kind of idiot banks on winning the lottery? </i>You’re literally more likely to win an Olympic gold medal, have identical quintuplets, or get <a href="https://moneyminiblog.com/interesting/things-more-likely-happen-winning-lottery/"><span>crushed by a vending machine</span></a>.</p>
<p>Well, Mandel wasn’t just any guy — he was a natural with numbers who spent every spare minute analyzing theoretical probability papers written by the 13th-century mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. And, after years of research, he wrote a “number-picking algorithm” based on a method he dubbed “<a href="http://www.bursa.ro/industria-de-gambling-iulie-1994-primul-si-singurul-interviu-din-presa-romaneasca-stefan-mandel-o...&amp;s=print&amp;sr=articol&amp;id_articol=159657.html"><span>combinatorial condensation</span></a>.”</p>

<p>“I’m a weekend mathematician, an accountant without too much education,” he later told a <a href="http://sport24h.ro/geniu-sau-sarlatan-campionul-mondial-al-loteriilor-este-un-roman-am-vorbit-cu-cel-care-a-stat-fata-in-fata-cu-el-video/"><span>Romanian magazine</span></a>. “But mathematics properly applied can guarantee a fortune.”</p>
<p>Here’s how it worked.</p>
<p>If a player picked 6 numbers in a 49-ball lottery, his odds of winning were 1 in 13,983,816. If he selected 15 numbers (which required purchasing 5,005 games — one for each possible combination), his odds of winning increased to 1 in 2,794. Mandel claimed that his algorithm could reduce these 5,005 combinations to just 569.</p>
<p>If the 6 winning numbers fell among his 15 picks, he’d be guaranteed to win at <i>least</i> a 2nd prize and hundreds of smaller prizes — and he’d have a 1 in 10 chance of winning the grand prize.</p>
<p>Mandel banded together with 4 friends, each of whom bought 228 tickets per draw.</p>
<p>Miraculously (and with a lot of luck), he won the first prize of 72,783 lei (about US $2k, or $16.8k adjusted for inflation). After expenses, he walked away with&nbsp; enough to bribe foreign ministry officials and flee Romania for a new life — and a bigger jackpot.</p>
<h2><b>Turning lottery wins into a business</b></h2>
<p>After 4 years of roaming around Europe, Mandel settled in Australia and he set out to game the lottery in a different way.</p>
<p>In the typical lottery, a set of numbers within a certain range (say, <a href="https://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/lottery2.htm"><span>1-50</span></a>) are randomly selected; &nbsp;if yours match in any order, you win the jackpot. The chances of winning are based on the number of possible combinations of these numbers, often in the millions.</p>
<p>But Mandel caught on to something: In certain lottos, the <b>jackpot</b> would climb to an amount more than <b>3x the cost</b> of buying every combination.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say a lottery required 6 picks of numbers between 1 and 40. This would yield 3,838,380 possible number combinations (<a href="http://www.lottogenie.com/html/odds.html"><span>calculator here</span></a>). Now, let’s say that same lottery had a $10m jackpot. In theory, Mandel could buy a ticket for every single combination at $1 each and be guaranteed a win — and, after taxes, a decent profit.</p>
<p>Mandel maintained that “any high school math student could calculate the combinations.” But this method came with some major logistical setbacks. <i>How would he get the capital? And how could he possibly fill out hundreds of thousands of tickets, number by number?</i></p>
<figure id="attachment_9889" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-9889"><img decoding="async" src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1.jpg" alt="" width="2500" height="100%" srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1.jpg 600w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1-300x270.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='2500'%20height='100%'%20viewBox='0%200%202500%20100%'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1.jpg" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1.jpg 600w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelchart-1-300x270.jpg 300w"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-9889">Mandel’s system was simple — but incredibly complex from a logistical standpoint (The Hustle)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Over a period of years, Mandel convinced hundreds of investors to pool their money together and create a “lotto syndicate.” He then developed a full-fledged automation system: A room full of printers and computers running on an algorithm that pre-populated tickets with every combination.</p>
<p>Computers revolutionized Mandel’s process. Before, he’d been limited to writing out millions of combinations by hand, where a single mistake could ruin 8 months’ worth of work; now, he could outsource the work to a machine.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s, Mandel’s syndicate would wait until a jackpot was 3x bigger than the cost of covering all possible combinations, then “move to buy” thousands of tickets. They managed to win 12 lotteries (and rake in 400k smaller prizes) across Australia, including a $1.1m haul in 1986.</p>
<p>“Everyone said to me: You can not, you will not succeed! ” Mandel <a href="http://www.bursa.ro/industria-de-gambling-iulie-1994-primul-si-singurul-interviu-din-presa-romaneasca-stefan-mandel-o...&amp;s=print&amp;sr=articol&amp;id_articol=159657.html"><span>told</span></a> a Romanian newspaper at the time. “Now, the voices that have long [cast me as] a dreamer have been silenced.”</p>
<p>But Mandel’s system soon attracted negative attention.</p>
<p>His repeated wins prompted Australian lottery authorities to change the law, disallowing a single person from covering every possible combination.</p>
<p>So, he set his sights on much bigger feat — one that would make international headlines and boggle the minds of lottery officials around the world.</p>
<h2><b>Virginia or bust</b></h2>
<p>Mandel began by identifying lotteries where the jackpot had risen to at least 3x the cost of buying all possible combinations.</p>
<p>Ultimately, he printed out tickets for 6 US lotteries, <a href="https://scholar.lib.vt.edu/VA-news/ROA-Times/issues/1992/rt9203/920315/03150148.htm"><span>including</span></a> Massachusetts ($37m jackpot to 9m combinations), Arizona ($11m to 5.1m), and Virginia.</p>
<p>Virginia’s lottery offered several advantages. It was fairly new, and allowed buyers to purchase tickets in unlimited quantities and print them at home. But most importantly, its numbers only ranged from 1 to 44 (other states went as high as 54). This meant that with 6 picks, there were “only” 7,059,052 possible combinations, compared to the usual 25m+.</p>

<p>Mandel set up an agency with a major insurance company. Under the shell corporation <a href="https://www.lotterycritic.com/news/lottery-winners/stefan-mandel-14-time-lottery-winner/"><span>Pacific Financial Resources</span></a>, he established a trust called the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/20/589/523265/"><span>International Lotto Fund</span></a> (ILF) and convinced 2,560 people to buy a 10-year whole life insurance policy, with a $4k annual premium. Mandel then used this money, legally, to buy each person a stake in the lottery.</p>
<p>In a Melbourne warehouse, he set up 30 computers and 12 laser printers, and hired 16 full-time employees to print millions of tickets pre-populated with every combination — a process that took 3 months. He then shipped the one-tonne of paper weight to a point-person in the US at a cost of $60k.</p>
<p>With the tickets secured in Virginia, Mandel had to wait until the jackpot hit a number that would make financial sense after taxes, overhead, and paying off investors.</p>
<p>A state lottery prize typically begins in the low millions and increases every time a drawing goes by with no winner. (When you see those insane <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/24/massachusetts-powerball-jackpot-758-million-lottery"><span>$758m</span></a> jackpots, it means nobody has won in quite some time.) Mandel had to anticipate when to strike, and had to hope for the best that there wouldn’t be multiple winners to dilute the pot and ruin his margins.</p>
<p>On February 12, 1992, the Virginia Lottery jackpot hit $15.5m. Mandel’s team on the ground was given a simple directive: <i>Go.</i></p>
<p>And nobody — not even Mandel — could’ve anticipated the madness that would ensue.</p>

<p>As Mandel knew, the “buy all combinations” method of winning the lottery was more of a logistical than a financial challenge. The hard part was yet to come.</p>
<p>Tickets could be legally printed at home, but they still had to be taken to an authorized lotto retailer in the US, paid for (at $1 each), and processed. Waltzing into a gas station with 1.4m tickets and a truckload of cash wasn’t an option.</p>
<p>Mandel hired the accounting firm <a href="http://www.lowelippmann.com.au/"><span>Lowe Lippmann</span></a> to transfer $9m in investor funds to Crestar Bank in Boston, where it was cut into $10k cashier’s checks. He then lined up advance deals with Virginia-based retail chains to buy the tickets in bulk. All he needed was a point-person on the ground to orchestrate the mayhem.</p>
<p>For this task, Mandel turned to an esteemed associate by the name of Anithalee Alex.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10033" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10033"><img decoding="async" src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW.jpg" alt="Stefan mandel" width="2500" height="100%" srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW.jpg 600w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW-300x204.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='2500'%20height='100%'%20viewBox='0%200%202500%20100%'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW.jpg" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW.jpg 600w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ALEX-BW-300x204.jpg 300w"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10033">Anithalee Alex, an ex-paratrooper and failed oil man, was Mandel’s unlikely man on the ground in Virginia (Illustration by The Hustle; image via ‘How’d They Do That?’, 1992)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Perennially outfitted in a gold rolex and a safari suit, Alex was a sweet talker who could “make the world seem like a bed of roses.” An ex-paratrooper turned Rolls Royce salesman turned oil prospector, he could often be seen gallivanting around his small town of Teutopolis, Illinois, in a <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/123287787"><span>t-shirt</span></a> that read: “<i>Please Lord, let me prove to you that winning the lottery won’t spoil me</i>.”</p>
<p>When his old pal, Mandel, rang, Alex was fresh out of bankruptcy court, with $400k in debt and 16 maxed-out credit cards. He was ready for action — <i>any </i>action.</p>
<p>The job was harrowing: He was to coordinate the drop-off, payment, and processing of 1.4m lottery tickets at hundreds of stores all over Virginia.</p>
<p>The jackpot hit $15.5m on a Wednesday; the next draw would be on Saturday. This meant that he and his team had just 72 hours to pull it off.</p>
<h2><b>A logistical nightmare</b></h2>
<p>On February 12, 1992 — 3 days before the draw — Alex checked into a Holiday Inn in Norfolk, Virginia and set up a “command center” at the Koger Center, a nearby business park.</p>
<p>In the 88-acre “maze of buildings,” Alex met with a team of 35 couriers hired by Mandel (most of whom were certified accountants) and distributed cellophane-wrapped <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&amp;p_theme=vp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=%22anithalee%20alex%22&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=1992&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(%22anithalee%20alex%22)&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no"><span>bundles</span></a> of 10k tickets with stacks of $10k cashier’s checks.</p>
<p>“Think of it like an office pool,” he reportedly <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/123287787"><span>told</span></a> the CPAs, “except a <i>larger</i> office pool.”</p>
<p>For 2 straight days, the couriers methodically descended on 125 gas stations and supermarkets. At Farm Fresh, Miller Mart, and Tinee Giant locations throughout the region, flummoxed store clerks were asked to buy and process 1.4m algorithmically-generated lotto tickets.</p>
<figure id="attachment_10034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-10034"><img decoding="async" src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee.jpg" alt="Stefan Mandel" width="2500" height="100%" srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee.jpg 600w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee-300x221.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='2500'%20height='100%'%20viewBox='0%200%202500%20100%'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee.jpg" data-srcset="https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee.jpg 600w, https://thehustle.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/mandelee-300x221.jpg 300w"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-10034">Mandel sat back in the shadows in Australia while his team orchestrated his Virginia plan (Via The Sydney Morning Herald, 1992)</figcaption></figure>
<p>“We thought they were nuts,” Rick Miller, a local gas station proprietor, later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TqFp0efLK0"><span>admitted</span></a>. “But if someone comes up and says they want to buy 700k lottery tickets, we’re not going to chase them away.”</p>
<p>A representative at Farm Fresh, who sold a portion of tickets to Mandel’s team, had a more spirited take: “For someone to try to do this ticket-by-ticket is a very chancy proposition,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/group-invests-5-million-to-hedge-bets-in-lottery.html"><span>said</span></a>. “But that’s what lotto’s all about.”</p>
<p>By Saturday evening, the team was nearing completion. Then, disaster struck.</p>
<p>One of the chains who’d sold tickets in bulk got overwhelmed and quit in the final hours, leaving 140k tickets (700k combinations) on the table. When the deadline for entry arrived, around 1.24m of Mandel’s 1.4m tickets (6.4m of 7m combinations) had been processed. Mandel’s “fool proof” plan, which relied on securing every single possibility, was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Like a regular lottery, winning the jackpot would ultimately come down to luck.</p>
<h2><b>“The most incredible thing in the world”</b></h2>
<p>Mandel knew that without 100% of the combinations secured, his strategy was reduced to a multi-million dollar game of chance.</p>
<p>He was aware of other ill-fated attempts to game a US lottery by bulk-buying tickets: In 1990, a Sacramento retiree <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/group-invests-5-million-to-hedge-bets-in-lottery.html"><span>bought 30k tickets</span></a> with a diaper bag full of cash and walked away empty-handed; months later, a computer engineer known as “The Phantom” purchased 80k combinations at a Jacksonville, Florida bar and only won minor prizes.</p>
<p>Even if Mandel <i>were</i> to win, there was the possibility of multiple winners — a scenario that could significantly dilute the jackpot.</p>
<p>At 11:20 PM on February 15th, the numbers were drawn on live television. In a nearby warehouse, Alex and his team waited with baited breath.</p>
<p>Then, a victorious shout:<i> They’d won</i>.</p>

<p>“When the $27m ticket came up, everybody was 6 feet off the ground,” Alex later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TqFp0efLK0"><span>said</span></a>. “It was the most incredible thing in the world.” Purchased at a Farm Fresh in Chesapeake, the ticket had been processed in the twilight hours. Alex’s diligence had paid off.</p>
<p>From his home in Australia, Mandel sent out a short message to his 2,524 investors: “One of our target lotteries did jackpot to our required level,” he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/25/us/group-invests-5-million-to-hedge-bets-in-lottery.html"><span>wrote</span></a>. “We entered and won.”</p>
<p>The $27,036,142 jackpot (and <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage-9F0CE0D61426E331BC4A53DFB46F958A.html"><span>$900k</span></a> in secondary prizes) was to be paid out in 20 annual installments of $1.03m. But Virginia’s lottery czars had other plans.</p>
<h2><b>What would Thomas Jefferson say?</b></h2>
<p>Although completely legal under both US and Virginia state law, the Australian group’s feat was interpreted as an effort to “cheat” the traditional system.</p>
<p>“We might remember Thomas Jefferson’s view of a lottery,” Virginia Lottery director Ken Thorson <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1992/02/22/illinois-businessman-emerges-in-va-lottery-block-ticket-sales/429e1ea3-d289-4ddf-85b8-54a675285478/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.d2f5891e7629"><span>pled</span></a> to the press. “It is an opportunity for the common man to spend a small sum for the possibility of a higher prize… We never anticipated a group trying to make such a large purchase.”</p>
<p>Mandel was subjected to an <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/1393432/international-lotto-fund-v-virginia-lottery-dept/authorities/"><span>investigation</span></a> involving 14 international agencies, including the CIA, FBI, IRS, National Crime Authority, and Australian Securities Commission.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/20/589/523265/"><span>end</span></a>, neither Mandel nor the ILF was found guilty of any wrongdoing. “I will live to be 150,” he <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/123287787"><span>proclaimed</span></a>. &nbsp;“I am not the type of person who lays down and dies because some glorified clerk doesn’t know what he’s doing.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in his home country of Australia, he became something of a folk hero: An article in <i>People</i> magazine described him as a kangaroo hopping out of the US with a pouch full of cash — defiant, victorious, and full of life.</p>
<h2><b>And what became of the mastermind?</b></h2>
<p>When the dust settled, each person who’d bought into the lottery through Mandel’s life insurance policy — small business owners, machine operators, housekeepers, and doctors — made out with around $1.4k.</p>
<p>Some were not pleased with this outcome. “Stefan Mandel is not only irrelevant,” a <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/123048700/?terms=%22stefan%2Bmandel%22"><span>disgruntled investor</span></a> later quipped. “He’s toxic.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mandel paid himself a one-time “consultant’s fee” of $1.7m, and purportedly sold the annuity on the 20-year payout to a US insurance company for a lump sum of $14m. After overhead fees ($5.5m for the tickets, and <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/79735360/?terms=%22anithalee%2Balex%22"><span>$500k</span></a> in expenses), he was left with a princely sum.</p>
<p>Records show that he funneled this cash into the <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/123048700/?terms=%22stefan%2Bmandel%22"><span>Pacific Basin Fund</span></a>, a Hong Kong-based account managed by his brother-in-law. “What we calculated to be the reality has changed,” he wrote in a 1994 letter to investors. “It may not seem such a hot investment now.”</p>
<p>After that, his investor updates went cold.</p>

<p>Just a few years later, in 1995, Mandel <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/123021149/?terms=%22stefan%2Bmandel%22"><span>declared bankruptcy</span></a>. He then spent the next decade running various investment schemes — one of which earned him a 10-month <a href="https://behindmlm.com/companies/ufun-club/thai-police-estimate-ufun-club-ponzi-losses-at-1-17-billion/"><span>jail sentence</span></a> in Israel for the “alleged non-publication of a prospectus in a cooperative society.” (Mandel’s attorney said his conviction was later overturned, and that Mandel never spent a single day in prison.)</p>
<p>Today, Mandel spends his days at a beach house on a remote tropical island in Vanuatu, a country off the coast of Australia. He lives a quiet life and reports being “retired” from the lottery.</p>
<p>Anithalee Alex, his one-time associate, also dropped off the grid, and keeps a low-profile life somewhere in Illinois. “You could not have written a script as good as this,” he <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/79807329/?terms=%22anithalee%2Balex%22"><span>reminisced</span></a>, years later. “This is one time real life was better than fiction.”</p>
<p>Though we were able to piece together the logistics of Mandel’s 20-year lottery career, he’s never revealed the minute details of his algorithm. As he <a href="https://www.apnews.com/7f7949704cacaf36f44458f000a5ba5b"><span>told</span></a> an enquiring AP reporter in 1992, “That would be like Coca-Cola revealing their recipe.”</p>
<p>His legacy lives on in US legislation: All 44 states that run lotteries have <a href="https://www.oregonlottery.org/docs/default-source/commission-meeting/2016/June-27-2016/play-slips-briefing-document-(public)-6-27-16.pdf?sfvrsn=9bd234a7_4"><span>enacted laws</span></a> preventing the profitable replication of Mandel’s strategy. In effect, this secures him a title as the first and last man to ever successfully game the lottery by buying every possible combination.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div _ngcontent-appid-c222="" id="articleDetail"><p>So, COO Kim Hammonds <em>is l</em>eaving Deutsche Bank. Less than a month after <a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/311527/kim-hammonds-deutsche-bank/" target="_blank">describing Deutsche</a> as, "vastly complex," the, "most dysfunctional place she's ever worked," and in the middle of a, "difficult transformation," Hammonds has left, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fa26443a-4342-11e8-93cf-67ac3a6482fd" target="_blank">“by mutual agreement with the supervisory board.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>She was, “a breath of fresh air,” according to the chairman. In some ways, however, Hammonds does not seem to have been fresh enough.</p> 
<p>Hammonds' key task at Deutsche Bank was to streamline the bank's unwieldy array of operating systems. When now ex-CEO John Cryan presented his <a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/223787/deutsche-bank-strategy-christian-sewing" target="_blank">"Strategy 2020" plan in October 2015, </a>he expressed his intention of eliminating 6,000 Deutsche Bank contractors and cutting the bank's operating systems from 45 to four. Two and a half years later, Deutsche still has 32 different operating systems, and the contractors we spoke to complained that the bank has become "toxic" to work for.</p> 
<p>How did Deutsche end up with so many systems to begin with? A senior technologist who worked for DB for over seven years, explains. "People at Deutsche loved setting up little groups to create their own mini-platforms for developments," he says. "For example, you'd have one platform that had been set up by the exotics guys and then someone else would come along and say they liked that, but wanted their own functionality. They'd go off and make "enhancements" and then you'd have two different platforms that weren't talking to each other, each one with its mini-fiefdom."</p> 
<p>He says his time at Deutsche was spent trying to prune the platforms back: "It was like whack-a-mole. You'd get rid of one and another one would pop-up somewhere else."</p> 
<p>Despite the best efforts of some of its senior technologists, when Cryan took over in June 2015, Deutsche's IT infrastructure was therefore out of control. Cryan famously described it as,"lousy," and a "<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/29e44356-7bf0-11e5-98fb-5a6d4728f74e" target="_blank">Horlicks" (total mess to non-Britons)</a>. Alongside the bank's 40+ operating systems, there were&nbsp;100 different booking systems for trades in London alone, and no common client identifiers. Cryan elaborated upon the problem in&nbsp;his <a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/310449/john-cryan-deutsche-bank/" target="_blank">March 2018 interview with Zeit</a>.&nbsp;In 2015, the systems at Deutsche Bank were, "...really, really bad. Very bad, beyond end of life," he said. "There was hardware that was no longer supported, software that could no longer be supported because it could only run on that hardware." A Deutsche insider elaborates: "There was no integration and reporting was a nightmare. Trades between teams in the investment bank were booked in multiple systems and it was very difficult to represent the risk we were exposed to, even in a single transaction."</p> 
<p>This, then, was the situation inherited by Cryan and handed to Hammonds and her team to resolve. Nearly three years later, there have been some successes. Thirteen out of 45 operating systems have disappeared, a new risk analytics and pricing system has been put in place, inter-system reconciliations have been cut from 1,000 to 600 (with a target of 300 by 2020), and last year Deusche Bank had its most stable year ever for critical applications after working hard to stabilize its IT environment. There's also <a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/310846/deutsche-bank-fabric/" target="_blank">"Fabric,"</a>&nbsp;Deutsche's new cloud computing platform, which allows enables Deutsche Bank programmers to access the bank's computing power in weeks rather than months, and allows select third parties access to Deutsche's storage and data to create applications which will benefit the bank and its clients.</p> 
<p>Even so, insiders in Deutsche's IT division point to ongoing problems. They say the bank still operates separate platforms for equities trading, rates trading and FX trading (with the former two known as "flow risk" and "Summit" respectively.)&nbsp; "These three systems are the behemoths," says one insider. "It's almost impossible to conceive of how they could come together given how complex the products have become." The thirteen systems that have been eliminated were seemingly the easy ones: those that remain are more complicated and more fiercely protected by their champions.</p> 
<p>In this sense, rationalizing IT systems is a matter of internal politics (this may have been what Hammonds was referring to in her "dysfunctional" comment). Cryan himself acknowledged this in his Zeit interview, when he explained his intention to, "change every single computer system," at Deutsche. - Only by changing all the systems would the program be depoliticized, said Cryan: "If you say you will change some of them, the people who like their system will say "not mine.""</p> 
<p>Now that Cryan's gone, however, it's becoming apparent that<a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/312948/moelis-working-hours/" target="_blank"> his authority over some senior managers at Deutsche Bank was weak</a>. He&nbsp;and Hammonds' ability to challenge Deutsche's most powerful tribal leaders appears to have been correspondingly limited. "It's going to be a far more uphill task to cut systems in future," says one senior insider. "The people who control these systems don't want them cut. It's all about politics."</p> 
<p>Some suggest the situation is being made worse by Deutsche's alienation of the contractor market. Systems rationalization is best done by outsiders without a vested interest in the status quo. And yet, having targeted contractors for job cuts, DB technologists say the bank isn't a popular destination for systems integration specialists. "We just don't have a good reputation in the contractor market," reflects one.</p> 
<p>Nor does Hammonds appear to have made her role any easier. Having signed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-deutsche-bank-hp/deutsche-bank-signs-multibillion-dollar-it-deal-with-hp-idUSKBN0LS0T820150224" target="_blank">10 year deal with HP to manage Deutsche's servers, data centres and storage</a> in 2010, some insiders argue that she rested on her laurels and didn't do enough to motivate her team. Ultimately, however, they say she was given neither the time nor the money necessary to succeed: "It was an almost impossible job given the cost and revenue challenges," says one.</p> 
<p>Although Hammonds and Cryan have now gone, some of their key lieutenants remain. For the moment, <a href="https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2017/medien/deutsche-bank-appoints-group-chief-information-officer-en-11484.htm" target="_blank">Deutsche's global IT operation is run by Pascal Boillat</a>&nbsp;- a Cryan and Hammond hire who joined from Fannie Mae in 2016. IT in the investment bank is run by<a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/215216/deutsche-banks-top-infrastructure-technologist-talks-tech-careers/" target="_blank"> Scott Marcar,</a> who joined from RBS in 2014.&nbsp; New talent has been added: Thomas Nielsen, the former chief digital officer for Tesco’s supermarkets, joined the bank as a <a href="https://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/311682/digital-transformation-jobs-banks/" target="_blank">"digital transformation specialist"</a> last year. In a possible reflection of the intensity of the role, however,&nbsp;Jason Sutherland-Rowe - the man in charge of Deutsche's "global IT transformation programme" is currently out on sabbatical.</p> 
<p>For the moment, Deutsche's technologists are holding their breath. New CEO Christian Sewing has indicated that the strategy will continue as before, suggesting the program to rationalize the mess of operating systems will persist. Some point hopefully to Autobahn - th<a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1322b7jp0dqc5/trading-platforms-autobahn-still-motoring-along" target="_blank">e electronic trading system that started out as a fixed income platform in 1996</a> but which has since been rolled out across FX, equities and ETFs, as evidence that Deutsche's different trading teams can come together on a single platform. Others point to the success of Aladdin, the<a href="http://rockthecode.io/blog/transitioning-blackrocks-aladdin-cloud-architecture/" target="_blank"> risk management and trading system offered by Blackrock</a>, in reducing complexity at Deutsche Bank Asset and Wealth Management, as evidence that change can take place.</p> 
<p>"Hammonds was innovative, but she couldn't do what she set out to do," says one DB insider. "So we're just sitting here, waiting to see what happens next."</p>

<p>This maybe seems to be a weird post, especially for those who don’t live in Italy, because here in Italy there’s the common belief that the abilites of a worker, usually are less considered than the qualifies that it has. Or simply the employers don’t ask “what you are able to do?”, instead of “what are your credentials/studies”.</p>

<p>Unfortunaly this post will not totally debunk this myth, at least for me, because I think that in Italy the work market is not as healthy as other (north) european States, but I just want to give a little bit of hope to my fellow citizens.</p>

<h2 id="tldr"><em>tl;dr</em></h2>

<p>A security company asked me to work with them after they saw and read the posts on this blog.</p>

<h2 id="the-full-story">The full story</h2>

<p>Some months ago I was riding a bike uphill (I’m a cyclist) and a guy overtake me, so I decided to follow him during the ascent, just to chat a little.  And by talking about technolgy and cycling, I discovered that he is the CEO of some interesting companies that are bringing tech in the sport environment,  more precisely he’s building some smart sensors that you can found inside the t-shirt of some football big players (like the Italian national team, Inter, Lazio etc…). And I found we had similar ideas about the digital rights and the fundamental importance of the technology nowadays, so we kept in contact via social networks.</p>

<p>Few months after this curious meet, and after he read some of these posts blog, especially this one <a href="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/networking/2023/01/05/home-network_v4.html">My network home setup - v4.0</a>, and he decided to write me a message saying: “Hi Giulio, how are you? You know that you have the same passion I had when I was younger: the networking?! Have you ever thought of making this passion a job?”.
So I replied: “Hi xxx, thanks but why are you asking me this?”, and he said: “Because I can help you in this (make my passion a job), wait few days and a friend of mine will call you”.</p>

<p>The day after one guy (the actual CEO of the company where I’m working) called me and he asked me to have a job interview because he found my posts and abilities very interesting, but what surprised me is that he didn’t ask me “what are your studies, what is your age, what are your references, etcc…” he was interested in what I’m able to do and what I think about the networking/internet. Full stop.</p>

<p>So we made this job interview and he offered me a very interesting contract with a right salary. 
So I took some days to make my decision, because I was a scared that I wasn’t up to the job and I had also another job proposal “on background”, but in the end I said <strong>yes</strong>.</p>

<p>And I think it was one of my best decision ever, because the work environment and my colleagues are fabulous, I like a lot what I’m doing and it’s very interesting to improve my skill, learn new stuff and make new experiences.</p>



<p>I’m working something like a DevOps or a SysAdmin, I took the Fortinet NS4 certification, I’m doing the NS5 and the work my company is to build (or rebuild) the datacenters of other companies from scratch, so I have to program the network. Another branch of the company is doing the “manual stuff”, like certify the cables, wiring the switches, build the datacenter rooms/racks, etc… and we also install the security surveillance appliances and VoIP phones.</p>

<h3 id="my-monitoring-system">my monitoring system</h3>

<p>Beside the network job, like install new firewalls/switches/servers/UPS/PBX/etc.., what the company wanted from me was also a “monitoring system” for the network appliances of our clients. 
More precisely a monitoring system that can monitor lots of different stuff/hardware and sends alerts when something happens, like a server disk is full or a IP surveillance camera is offline or a WAN is loosing lots of packets, and so on…</p>

<p>So what can be the best monitoring system than Grafana and Prometheus like I’m already doing <a href="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/networking/2023/01/05/home-network_v4.html#h-grafana">at my home</a>?!</p>

<p>I knew that using Prometheus as a database would have been very tricky, because I should have use lots of different exporter (way to write in the database), like original exporters and SNMP exporters. 
And that I should have created all my customs Grafana dashboards. 
There are lots of way simply monitoring system like PRTG or Zabbix but no one is fully customizable, flexible and powerful (…and open source) as the coupling of Prometheus + Grafana. Considering also the alert system that’s integrated into Grafana.</p>

<p>So we made some consideration about the timings, the hardware costs and remote operational, then we chosen the hardware enclosure and the business model, and finally I started to build up the whole system in a one 19” rack unit that inside has:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a VPN made with WireGuard on a Mikrotik 750 with OpenWrt</li>
  <li>a Raspberry PI 4B with Grafana and Prometheus for the monitoring system</li>
  <li>a Raspberry PI 3B with Pi-Hole and Unbound to offer to the clients a privacy focused DNS</li>
  <li>a USB hub to use only one external power supply</li>
  <li>some shorts USB cables</li>
  <li>some custom Ethernet ports and cables</li>
</ul>

<p>And with the help of my colleagues, that are way skilled than me in the hardware stuff, I built the first unit!</p>

<p>But images speak better than words, so this is the first full system built:</p>

<p><img src="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2023/IT-jobs-blog/IMG_9763.jpg" alt="IMG_9763"></p>

<p>The stuff inside are taped to the bottom with a strong, heat resistant, bi-adesive tape:</p>

<p><img src="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2023/IT-jobs-blog/IMG_9786.jpg" alt="IMG_9786"></p>

<p><img src="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2023/IT-jobs-blog/IMG_9757.jpg" alt="IMG_9757"></p>

<p>And this is the unit finally installed inside a client rack:</p>

<p><img src="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2023/IT-jobs-blog/IMG_9816.jpg" alt="IMG_9816"></p>

<p>But I think you wonder why SYSMI name, rightly… well, my company name is SYSTI, so SYSMI is the name + monitoring = SYSMI. And SYSDNS for the Pi-hole DNS.</p>

<p>Finally, this solution with the Raspberry PIs reuires also very low power to operate (usually less than 20W) and it doesn’t heat, so I can use passive cooling and I don’t bother the clients (bills) with a 150/200W power system like a normal x86 server.</p>

<p>And last, here there are the screenshots of some of the first dashboards:</p>

<p>The Pi-Hole dashboard:

<p>And an alert email when something is triggered, and then resolved (for a client the sender is not ‘SYSMI’ but the name of the client, in order to know which client is having issue):
<img src="https://giuliomagnifico.blog/_images/2023/IT-jobs-blog/16900217811780.png" alt="alert email"></p>

<p>And there’re lots of other dashboards but for now I think these screenshots are sufficient.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is the first “interaction” in this environment for me, and I’ve done all in 3/4 months, so the things can be improved a lot, and I’ll do it in the future, especially with the software. But I think that as a first approach, thanks also to my colleagues, I can be quite satisfied.</p>

<p>In the future I will write more about the software, the issues and other inconvenience I will come across, for now if you have any question just ask in the comments!</p>

Thanks for joining!</i></p><p><h3>History of the Simple Sabotage Field Manual</h3></p><p> Formed in 1942 in order to shore up American intelligence capabilities at the request of Franklin D. Roosevelt, before the end of WWII the OSS eventually employed ~24,000 people and had operations across Europe and Asia. Amongst its responsibilities was frustrating the German war effort, and to that end, it wrote a short set of “best practices” - the <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ndXRlbmJlcmcub3JnL2ZpbGVzLzI2MTg0L3BhZ2UtaW1hZ2VzLzI2MTg0LWltYWdlcy5wZGY_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1idXR3aGF0Zm9yLmJlZWhpaXYuY29tJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXNpbXBsZS1zYWJvdGFnZS1maWVsZC1tYW51YWwtaG93LXRvLWRlc3Ryb3kteW91ci1vcmdhbml6YXRpb25zIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjRmODdlMDY3LTMxMjAtNDFmZC05M2UzLTc4NzZhOWI2YjgxZSIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiNmUxMzE5M2YtNTI5NC00ODM0LWI5MjctOWU3ZWI2YTExZjIzIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJhNWUzMTUyOS00OTJmLTRiNGEtYTFlMi0zMDVmZjcwNWZmYjEiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTAxMTcyMDMuMTA3LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.VBuLPg6cOf_tp-0AJZYB9byr9wvP9jPoLgGG58QsFU4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Simple Sabotage Field Manual</a>. </p><p> The purpose of the manual is fairly straightforward - it is to… </p><div><p>…<b>characterize simple sabotage, to outline its possible effects, and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it. </b></p><p>Sabotage varies from highly technical <i>coup de main</i> acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially trained operatives, to innumnerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform. This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type….</p><p>Simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage, if any, by highly indirect means. <b>It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.</b> Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another. A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one’s fellow workers, engaging in bickerings, or displaying surliness and stupidity.</p><p><b>This type of activity</b>, sometimes referred to as the “human element," <b>is frequently responsible for accidents, delays, and general obstruction even under normal conditions.</b> The potential saboteur should discover what types of faulty decisions and cooperation are <i>normally</i> found in this kind of work and should then devise his sabotage so as to enlarge that “margin for error."</p></div><p> The manual, published in 1944, has now been declassified - but it was once used as a reference guide for OSS operatives globally to train individuals in German-occupied territories how to best become “citizen saboteurs.” It says that “purposeful stupidity is contrary to human nature” and thus the manual means to serve as inspiration and direction for saboteurs. </p><p> In short, the best way that ordinary citizens, unhappy with the German occupation, could aid the Allied military was to drive inefficiency in their workplaces - to slow down every attempt at progress and make even the simplest tasks frustrating. </p><p> Specific examples involved mechanics not repairing engines on time, misplacing tools so that they are hard to find, or misusing tools so as to break them more frequently. Bus drivers could “accidentally” go past the bus stops where German officers would most likely be found or want to get off. Train operators could issue the wrong tickets to travelers so they end up at the wrong destination, or they could issue two tickets for the same seat to cause delays. Janitors could ensure a disorderly workplace environment by keeping things dirty or placing rice in water cooling systems. Even those without jobs could get involved - by giving wrong directions when asked, changing signposts to point the wrong way, or pretending to not speak whatever language the other person is using. </p><p><h3>How to Sabotage Your Team Most Effectively </h3></p><p> This all got me thinking about Charlie Munger, and how he has said <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.xPVNeDQmPiTgZCvP6LygEYdYC_b7QYWNrK_2E4MtgoE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">it is often easier to solve problems backwards than it is to solve them forwards</a> - try to uncover the things that would most effectively prevent you from achieving your goals and just don’t do those things - avoid what is certain to bring about failure so that you give yourself the best shot at success. </p><p> In order to achieve our goals or to make progress generally, many times we rely on working with others. Often, this collaboration happens in the workplace. And this is where the OSS focused their expertise - how might we best destroy the ability of our organizations to make efficient and meaningful progress? </p><p> So, with <a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXR3aGF0Zm9yLmNvbS9jaGFybGllLW11bmdlci8_dXRtX3NvdXJjZT1idXR3aGF0Zm9yLmJlZWhpaXYuY29tJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09cmVmZXJyYWwmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPXNpbXBsZS1zYWJvdGFnZS1maWVsZC1tYW51YWwtaG93LXRvLWRlc3Ryb3kteW91ci1vcmdhbml6YXRpb25zIiwicG9zdF9pZCI6IjRmODdlMDY3LTMxMjAtNDFmZC05M2UzLTc4NzZhOWI2YjgxZSIsInB1YmxpY2F0aW9uX2lkIjoiNmUxMzE5M2YtNTI5NC00ODM0LWI5MjctOWU3ZWI2YTExZjIzIiwidmlzaXRfdG9rZW4iOiJhNWUzMTUyOS00OTJmLTRiNGEtYTFlMi0zMDVmZjcwNWZmYjEiLCJpYXQiOjE2OTAxMTcyMDMuMTA3LCJpc3MiOiJvcmNoaWQifQ.8a1vivH2cOSbB9nrahJmuBxzWWGyLkfb5J8lFRbsM1c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Charlie Munger</a>’s guidance in mind, what can we learn from the OSS’ Simple Sabotage Field Manual? What do the experts say is the best way to sabotage the organizations in which we work? </p><p> Think about how many of these things are a standard where you work. Does it feel like CIA operatives have been sabotaging your current workplace for decades - or that you might unwittingly have started to help their efforts? If so, can you do anything about that? </p><p><h3>Simple Steps to Ensure Organization Disfunction</h3></p><p> It is probably easiest to ensure progress will not be made if you are the owner or leader of an entire organization. In this position, you can cause great distress and destroy morale if you… </p><div><p>Insist on doing everything through “channels.” Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.</p><p>Make “speeches.” Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your “points” by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate “patriotic” comments.</p><p>When possible, refer all matters to committees, for “further study and consideration.” Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five.</p><p>Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.</p><p>Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.</p><p>Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.</p><p>Advocate “caution.” Be “reasonable” and urge your fellow-conferees to be “reasonable” and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</p><p>Be worried about the propriety of any decision—raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.</p></div><p> However, do not despair if you are not yet the leader of an entire organization as managers of smaller teams can also do their part to bring down a group of people otherwise motivated to do well. It would be best if you can… </p><div><p>Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products</p><p>When training new workers, give incomplete or misleading instructions… Give lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when questioned.</p><p>To lower morale and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions. Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.</p><p>Hold conferences when there is more critical work to be done.</p><p>Don’t order new working materials until your current stocks have been virtually exhausted, so that the slightest delay in filling your order will mean a shutdown.</p><p>In making work assignments, always sign out the unimportant jobs first. See that the important jobs are assigned to inefficient workers of poor machines.</p></div><p> Last, but not least, if you are more of an employee looking to frustrate the well-intentioned efforts of those around you, it is best that you… </p><div><p>Work slowly.</p><p>Spread rumors.</p><p>Do your work poorly and blame it on bad tools, machinery, or equipment. Complain that these things are preventing you from doing your job right.</p><p>Contrive as many interruptions to your work as you can. When you go to the lavatory, spend longer time there than is necessary.</p><p>Never pass on your skill and experience to a new or less skilful worker.</p><p>Be as irritable and quarrelsome as possible without getting yourself into trouble.</p></div><p> And there we have it - some of the easiest ways to prevent a group of people from effectively working together. If you are like me, many of these things sound surprisingly familiar. A manual written in 1944 seems to suggest that the best way to break down organizations is to utilize behaviors that organizations today treat as “best practices.” </p><p> If you get any pushback, send around this manual - maybe knowing that the U.S. military’s best suggestion for citizens to help it win a war was to destroy an enemy’s organizational efficiency will cause some pause. The military suggested the same practices you have been using to attempt the opposite. </p><p> This may at least prompt a discussion about how we might improve our processes today. </p><p> Take care and have a great week, </p><p> — EJ </p><p><a href="https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzbGV0dGVyLmJ1dHdoYXRmb3IuY29tLz91dG1fc291cmNlPWJ1dHdoYXRmb3IuYmVlaGlpdi5jb20mdXRtX21lZGl1bT1yZWZlcnJhbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249c2ltcGxlLXNhYm90YWdlLWZpZWxkLW1hbnVhbC1ob3ctdG8tZGVzdHJveS15b3VyLW9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbnMiLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiNGY4N2UwNjctMzEyMC00MWZkLTkzZTMtNzg3NmE5YjZiODFlIiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI2ZTEzMTkzZi01Mjk0LTQ4MzQtYjkyNy05ZTdlYjZhMTFmMjMiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6ImE1ZTMxNTI5LTQ5MmYtNGI0YS1hMWUyLTMwNWZmNzA1ZmZiMSIsImlhdCI6MTY5MDExNzIwMy4xMDgsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.6DEt7yzEJtLMg1xqsyOaF7vxgpvdS64irFPWZrYj-CE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">But What For?</a> Writing about anything, as long as it’s interesting </p></div></div>]]></description>

<span face="arial,helvetica" size="-1" color="#cc0000"><b>update</b></span> <b>A day after developers at America Online's Nullsoft unit quietly released file-sharing software, AOL pulled the link to the product from the subsidiary's Web site.</b>
<p>

The software, called Waste, lets groups set up private, secure file-sharing networks. The product became available on <newslink url="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/">Nullsoft's Web site on Wednesday, just days shy of the four-year anniversary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-226540.html" title="AOL buys Spinner, Nullsoft for $400 million -- Tuesday, Jun 1, 1999">of being acquired by AOL</a>. Waste is a software application that combines peer-to-peer file sharing with instant messaging, chat and file searches. Users can set up their own network of friends and share files between each other.
</newslink></p><p>


The features of Waste are similar to those of file-swapping services such as Kazaa and the defunct Napster, but the difference is that only small networks of people (up to 50, according to the Web site) can use it. The software also offers encryption and authentication to prevent non-invitees from accessing the private networks.

The quiet launch of Waste was the work of Nullsoft's principal developer, Justin Frankel, a soft-spoken 20-something known for his tech savvy and his streak of rebelliousness.
</p><p>
Waste had been used internally to share files between AOL's San Francisco office, where Nullsoft is based, and its Dulles, Va., headquarters, according to Ian Rogers, a former founding member of Nullsoft.
</p><p>
"The real play is when you've got small networks of co-workers or friends who can share whatever they want securely," Rogers said in an interview. "It could be a group of government officials sharing secure documents or it could be Justin sharing video files with AOL Dulles."
</p><p>
An AOL representative did not return requests for comment.
</p><p>
Nullsoft has had its conflicts with AOL in the past, such as in 2000 when Frankel developed a music file-swapping technology called Gnutella. AOL quickly pulled it off the Web fearing legal ramifications, but not before developers downloaded it and began creating services based on its software code.
</p><p>
AOL also <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-244303.html" title="AOL pulls MP3 search engine -- Thursday, Aug 10, 2000">forced Nullsoft to shut down an MP3 search engine</a>, fearing the legal consequences of the software. Then, Frankel and his cohorts caused a stir when they <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-246057.html" title="Under AOL's nose: geniuses or guerrillas? -- Thursday, Sep 21, 2000">developed software called AIMazing</a>, which replaced banner advertisements on AOL Instant Messenger into wiggling sound waves accompanied by music.
</p><p>
That's not to say all of Nullsoft's products have been a thorn in AOL's side. AOL acquired Nullsoft in 1999 for its Winamp MP3 player and now uses the technology in its flagship online service. AOL also has been revamping its streaming-media delivery system by using another <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030810194502/http://news.com.com/2100-1023-966239.html" title="AOL debuts its own streaming tech -- Monday, Nov 18, 2002">Nullsoft creation called Ultravox</a>, which AOL claims can stream media more efficiently than other products on the market. AOL uses Ultravox to stream songs on its narrowband and broadband radio services.

Why SQLite Does Not Use Git
</p>


</div>




<h2 id="introduction"><span>1. </span>Introduction</h2>

<p>
SQLite does not use the
<a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a> version control system.
SQLite uses
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/">Fossil</a> instead, which is a
version control system that was specifically designed
and written to support SQLite.

</p><p>
People often wonder why SQLite does not use the
<a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a> version control system like everybody
else.
This article attempts to answer that question.  Also,
in <a href="#getthecode">section 3</a>, 
this article provides hints to Git users
about how they can easily access the SQLite source code.

</p><p>
This article is <u>not</u> a comparison between Fossil
and Git.  See
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/fossil-v-git.wiki</a>
for one comparison of the two systems.  Other third-party 
comparisons are available as well - use a search engine to find them.

</p><p>
This article is <u>not</u> advocating that you switch your projects
away from Git.  You can use whatever version control system you want.
If you are perfectly happy with Git, then by all means keep using
Git.  But, if Git is not working well for you or you are wondering 
if it can be improved or if there is something better,
then maybe try to understand the perspectives presented below.
Use the insights thus obtained to find or write a different and
better version control system, or to just make
improvements to Git itself.

</p><h2 id="edits"><span>1.1. </span>Edits</h2>

<p>
This article has been revised multiple times in an attempt
to improve clarity, address concerns and misgivings,
and to fix errors.
The complete edit history for this document can be seen at
<a href="https://sqlite.org/docsrc/finfo/pages/whynotgit.in">https://sqlite.org/docsrc/finfo/pages/whynotgit.in</a>.
(Usage hint: Click on any two nodes of the graph for a diff.
BTW, are there any Git web interfaces that offers a similar
capability?)

</p><h2 id="a_few_reasons_why_sqlite_does_not_use_git"><span>2. </span>A Few Reasons Why SQLite Does Not Use Git</h2>

<h2 id="git_does_not_provide_good_situational_awareness"><span>2.1. </span>Git does not provide good situational awareness</h2>

<p>
When I want to see what has been happening on SQLite, I visit the
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">timeline</a> and in a single
screen I see a summary of the latest changes, on all branches.
In a few clicks, I can drill down as much detail as I
want.  I can even do this from a phone.

</p><p>
GitHub and GitLab offer nothing comparable.  The closest I have
found is the <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/network">network</a>,
which is slow to render (unless it is already cached), does not 
offer nearly as much details, and scarcely works at all on mobile.
The <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commits/master">commits</a> view
of GitHub provides more detail, renders quickly,
and works on mobile, but only shows a single branch at a time,
so I cannot easily know if I've seen all of the recent changes.
And even if GitHub/GitLab did offer better interfaces, both are
third-party services.  They are not a core part of Git.  Hence,
using them introduces yet another dependency into the project.

</p><p>
I am told that Git users commonly install third-party graphical
viewers for Git, many of which do a better job of showing recent 
activity on the project.  That is great, but these are still
more third-party applications that must be installed and
managed separately.  Many are platform-specific.  (One of the
better ones, <a href="https://gitup.co/">GitUp</a>, only works on Mac, for
example.)  All require that you first sync your local repository
then bring up their graphical interface on your desktop.  And
even with all that, I still cannot see what I typically want to 
see without multiple clicks.  Checking on project status from
a phone while away from the office is not an option.

</p><h2 id="git_makes_it_difficult_to_find_successors_descendents_of_a_check_in"><span>2.2. </span>Git makes it difficult to find successors (descendents)
of a check-in</h2>

<p>
Git lets you look backwards in time, but not forwards.
Given some historical check-in, you can see what came before,
but it is challenging see what came next.

</p><p>
In contrast, Fossil offers helpful displays such as
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release</a>
to show all check-ins that are derived from the most
recent major release.

</p><ul>
<li>
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?df=major-release">
All SQLite check-ins derived from the most recent major release</a>
</li></ul>


<p>It is not impossible to find the descendents of a check-in
in Git.  It is merely difficult.  For example,
there is a 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27960605/find-all-the-direct-descendants-of-a-given-commit#27962018">stackoverflow page</a>
showing the command sequence for finding the descendents of a check-in
in unix:

</p><div><pre>git rev-list --all --parents | grep "<a name="R-20568-61871-33672-25407-24732-44471-23157-56477"></a><span color="blue"><b>
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/draft/matrix/matrix_dwhynotgit.html#R-20568-61871-33672-25407-24732-44471-23157-56477">R-20568-61871</a>:[</b></span><span color="red">.</span>
<span color="blue"><b>]</b></span>
\{40\}.*<parent_sha1>.*" | awk '{print $1}'
</parent_sha1>
</pre></div>

<p>
But this is not the same thing.  The command above gives
a list of descendents without showing the branching structure, which
is important for understanding what happened.  And the command only works
if you have a local clone of the repository; finding the descendents of
a check-in is not something you can do with web interfaces such
as GitHub or GitLab.

</p><p>
This is not really about just finding the descendents of a check-in
from time to time.  The fact that descendents are readily available in
Fossil means that the information pervades the web pages provided by
Fossil.  One example: Every Fossil check-in information page
(<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/ec7addc87f97bcff">example</a>) shows
a small "Context" graph of the immediate predecessor and successors 
to that check-in.  This helps the user maintain better situational
awareness, and it provides useful capabilities, such as the ability
click forward to the next check-in in sequence.  Another example:
Fossil easily shows the context around a specific check-in
(<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/src/timeline?c=2018-03-16&amp;n=10">example</a>)
which again helps to promote situational awareness and a deeper
understanding of what is happening in the code.  There is a
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/webpage-ex.md">whole page of additional examples</a>
in the <a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil">Fossil documentation</a>.

</p><p>
All of the above is theoretically possible with Git, given the right extensions
and tools and using the right commands.  But it is not easy to do,
and so it rarely gets done.  Consequently, developers have less awareness
of what is happening in the code.

distracts attention from the software under development.  A user of Git
needs to keep all of the following in mind:
</p><ol type="a">
<li> The working directory
</li><li> The "index" or staging area
</li><li> The local head
</li><li> The local copy of the remote head
</li><li> The actual remote head
</li></ol>
<p>
Git has commands (and/or options on commands) for moving and
comparing content between all of these locations. 

</p><p>In contrast,
Fossil users only need to think about their working directory and
the check-in they are working on.  That is 60% less distraction.
Every developer has a finite number of brain-cycles.  Fossil
requires fewer brain-cycles to operate, thus freeing up 
intellectual resources to focus on the software under development.

</p><p>One user of both Git and Fossil
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16806955">writes in HN</a>:

</p><blockquote><i>
Fossil gives me peace of mind that I have everything ... synced to 
the server with a single command....
I never get this peace of mind with git.
</i></blockquote>

<h2 id="git_does_not_track_historical_branch_names"><span>2.4. </span>Git does not track historical branch names</h2>

<p>
Git keeps the complete DAG of the check-in sequence.  But branch
tags are local information that is not synced and not retained
once a branch closes.
This makes review of historical
branches tedious.

</p><p>
As an example, suppose a customer asks you:
"What ever became of that 'prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery' branch
from two years ago?"
You might try to answer by consulting the history in
your version control system, thusly:

</p><ul>
<li><b>GitHub:</b> <a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commits/prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery">https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite/commits/prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery</a>
</li><li><b>Fossil:</b> <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?r=prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery">https://sqlite.org/src/timeline?r=prefer-coroutine-sort-subquery</a>
</li></ul>

<p>
The Fossil view clearly shows that the branch was eventually merged back into
trunk.  It shows where the branch started, and it shows two occasions where changes
on trunk were merged into the branch.  GitHub shows none of this.  In fact, the
GitHub display is mostly useless in trying to figure out what happened.

</p><p>
Many readers have recommended various third-party GUIs for Git that
might do a better job of showing historical development activity.  Maybe
some of them do work better than native Git and/or GitHub, though they
will all be hampered by the fact that Git does not preserve historical
branch names across syncs.  And even if those other tools are better,
the fact that it is necessary to go to a third-party tool to get the information
desired does not speak well of the core system.

</p><h2 id="git_requires_more_administrative_support"><span>2.5. </span>Git requires more administrative support</h2>

<p>
Git is complex software.
One needs an installer of some kind to put Git on a developer
workstation, or to upgrade to a newer version of Git.
Standing up a Git server is non-trivial, and so most developers
use a third-party service such as GitHub or GitLab,
and thus introduce additional dependencies.

</p><p>
In contrast, Fossil is a single standalone binary which is
installed by putting it on $PATH.  That one binary contains all
the functionality of core Git and also GitHub and/or GitLab.  It
manages a community server with wiki, bug tracking, and forums, 
provides packaged downloads for consumers, login managements, 
and so forth, with no extra software required.  Standing up a
community server for Fossil takes minutes.  And Fossil is efficient.
A Fossil server will run fine on a $5/month VPS or a Raspberry Pi,
whereas GitLab and similar require beefier hardware.

</p><p>
Less administration means that programmers spend more time working
on the software (SQLite in this case) and less time fussing with
the version control system.

</p><h2 id="git_provides_a_poor_user_experience"><span>2.6. </span>Git provides a poor user experience</h2>

<p>The following <a href="https://xkcd.com/1597/">https://xkcd.com/1597/</a> cartoon is an
exaggeration, yet hits close to home:

</p><p>
<img src="https://www.fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/xkcd-git.gif">

</p><p>Let's be real.  Few people dispute that Git provides
a suboptimal user experience.  A lot of 
the underlying implementation shows through into the user
interface.  The interface is so bad that there is even a
parody site that generates
<a href="https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/">fake git man pages</a>.

</p><p>Designing software is hard.  It takes a lot of focus.
A good version control system should provide the developer with
assistance, not frustration.  Git has gotten better in this
regard over the past decade, but it still has a long way to go.

</p><h2 id="a_git_user_s_guide_to_accessing_sqlite_source_code"><span>3. </span>A Git-User's Guide To Accessing SQLite Source Code</h2>

<p>
If you are a devoted Git user, you can still easily access SQLite.  
This section gives some hints on how to do so.

</p><h2 id="the_official_github_mirror"><span>3.1. </span>The Official GitHub Mirror</h2>

<p>
As of 2019-03-20, there is now an 
<a href="https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite">official Git mirror</a> of the
SQLite sources on GitHub.

</p><p>The mirror is an incremental export of the 
<a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">canonical Fossil repository</a> for
SQLite.  A cron-job updates the GitHub repository once an hour.
This is a one-way, read-only code mirror.  No pull requests or 
changes are accepted via GitHub.  The GitHub repository merely copies
the content from the Fossil repository.  All changes are input via
Fossil.

</p><p>
The hashes that identify check-ins and files on the Git mirror are
different from the hashes in Fossil.  There are many reasons for
this, chief among them that Fossil uses a SHA3-256 hash whereas
Git uses a SHA1 hash.  During export, the original Fossil hash for
each check-in is added as a footer to check-in comments.  To avoid
confusion, always use the original Fossil hash, not the Git hash,
when referring to SQLite check-ins.

</p><h2 id="web_access"><span>3.2. </span>Web Access</h2>

<p>
The <a href="https://sqlite.org/src/timeline">SQLite Fossil Repository</a> contains links
for downloading  a Tarball, ZIP Archive, or <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/draft/matrix/sqlar.html">SQLite Archive</a> for any
historical version of SQLite.  The URLs for these downloads are
simple and can be incorporated easily into automated tools.  The format is:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/</tt><i>VERSION</i><tt>/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
Simply replace <i>VERSION</i> with some description of the version to be
downloaded.  The <i>VERSION</i> can be a prefix of the cryptographic hash
name of a specific check-in, or the name of a branch (in which case the
most recent version of the branch is fetched) or a tag for a specific
check-in like "version-3.23.1":

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/version-3.23.1/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>


<p>To get the latest release, use "release"
for <i>VERSION</i>, like this:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/release/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
To get the latest trunk check-in, us "trunk" for <i>VERSION</i>:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>https://sqlite.org/src/tarball/trunk/sqlite.tar.gz</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>
And so forth.
For ZIP archives and SQLite Archives, simply change the "/tarball/" element
into either "/zip/" or "/sqlar/", and maybe also change the name of the
download file to have a ".zip" or ".sqlar" suffix.

</p><h2 id="fossil_access"><span>3.3. </span>Fossil Access</h2>

<p>
Fossil is easy to install and use.  Here are the steps for unix.
(Windows is similar.)

</p><ol>
<li>
Download the self-contained Fossil executable from
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/uv/download.html</a> and put the executable
somewhere on your $PATH.
</li><li><tt>mkdir ~/fossils</tt>
</li><li><tt>fossil clone https://sqlite.org/src ~/fossils/sqlite.fossil</tt>
</li><li><tt>mkdir ~/sqlite; cd ~/sqlite</tt>
</li><li><tt>fossil open ~/fossils/sqlite.fossil</tt>
</li></ol>

<p>
At this point you are ready to type "<tt>./configure; make</tt>"
(or on Windows with MSVC, "<tt>nmake /f Makefile.msc</tt>").

</p><p>
To change your checkout to a different version of Fossil use
the "update" command:

</p><blockquote>
<tt>fossil update </tt><i>VERSION</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
Use "trunk" for <i>VERSION</i> to get the latest trunk version of SQLite.
Or use a prefix of a cryptographic hash name, or the name of some branch
or tag.  See
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/checkin_names.wiki">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/checkin_names.wiki</a> for more
suggestions on what names can be used for <i>VERSION</i>.

</p><p>
Use the "<tt>fossil ui</tt>" command from within the ~/sqlite checkout to
bring up a local copy of the website.

</p><p>
Additional documentation on Fossil can be found at
<a href="https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/permutedindex.html">https://fossil-scm.org/fossil/doc/trunk/www/permutedindex.html</a>

</p><p>
Do not be afraid to explore and experiment.
Without a log-in you won't be able to
push back any changes you make, so you cannot damage the project.

</p><h2 id="verifying_source_code_integrity"><span>3.4. </span>Verifying Source Code Integrity</h2>

<p>
If you need to verify that the SQLite source code that you have is
authentic and has not been modified in any way (perhaps by an adversary)
that can be done using a few simple command-line tools.  At the root 
of the SQLite source tree is a file named "manifest".  The manifest 
file contains the name of every other file in the source tree together 
with either a SHA1 or SHA3-256 hash for that file.  (SHA1 is used for
older files and SHA3-256 for newer files.)  You can write a
script to extract these hashes and verify them against the source code 
files.  The hash name for the check-in is just the SHA3-256 hash of the
"manifest" file itself, possibly with the last line omitted if the
last line begins with "# Remove this line..."

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>When Kim Mitlyng was in college, one of her family members began to experience a mental-health crisis that lasted for years. Whenever Mitlyng’s phone rang, she feared that she was about to learn that her loved one had died by suicide. She and her family sought help, but they were overwhelmed by the fragmented and disorganized mental-health-care system. “I felt like we were set up for failure,” she told me. “People would just throw a bunch of numbers at us and say, ‘Call these and find out what your insurance covers.’&nbsp;” Mitlyng decided to study psychology and, after graduation, trained as a family and marriage counsellor. But she found herself drawn to psychiatric emergencies. “There’s something about being with people in the darkest time,” Mitlyng said. “Being able to hold that space and give them just a glimmer of hope.”</p><p>In 2014, Mitlyng took a job as a therapist at an emergency department in the Twin Cities. During Minnesota’s icy, gray winters, she would brace herself against the morning cold, hustle through the chaos of the emergency department, and swipe into the “mental-health suite,” a locked unit with five spartan rooms, each designed for a single patient. She often found fifteen patients in and around the suite, all of them in urgent need of care. Mitlyng usually had only fifteen minutes with each patient, to conduct a rapid crisis assessment. Then she would decide who could safely leave and who needed to stay. “It was just churning through one patient after another,” she said. Some patients ended up boarding in the emergency department for days until a bed opened up at a psychiatric facility. They were generally required to stay inside their rooms, without their belongings and with little to do except stare at a television behind plexiglass. If they had to use the bathroom or wanted food, water, or a pillow, they had to ask a nurse. “They were completely stripped of autonomy,” Mitlyng said. “Many patients said it felt like a jail.”</p><p>One afternoon, Mitlyng was in the mental-health suite when a woman grabbed her by the hair and flung her to the ground. The woman climbed on top of her and struck her before a throng of hospital staff and security guards descended. “I think all of us who worked that job were assaulted or nearly assaulted at some point,” Mitlyng told me. It wasn’t unusual for a patient’s symptoms to escalate during their stay; staff grew accustomed to patients slamming doors, throwing food, and making threats. Mitlyng wondered if she was just shifting unwanted people from place to place. “Everyone was doing the best they could under the circumstances,” Mitlyng told me. “I was doing the best I could. But, I thought, It’s time to try something new.” In the spring of 2021, she decided to change jobs.</p><p>It’s hard to imagine a less therapeutic environment for a person in crisis than an emergency department: crowded and windowless rooms; harsh fluorescent lights; the ceaseless ping of alarms; this patient retching, that one screaming. And yet, for every eight patients who present at an emergency department, one is there for a behavioral crisis such as psychosis, suicidality, mania, aggression, or substance use. Often these conditions have a years-long history and can’t be treated quickly or straightforwardly, in the way that a broken bone or a knife wound might be. In some cases, showing up at an E.R. can make things worse; patients who pose a danger to themselves or others may be sedated or kept in isolation, even tethered to bedside rails so that they cannot move. When I worked in an emergency department, I often despaired for my own mental health. I would rush from a patient with crushing chest pressure to one with a fractured foot, neglecting those who were in less visible kinds of pain. After my shift, the memory of patients I had never got to—people who had asked for a sandwich or a blanket or a conversation—would gnaw at me. I wanted to give them more time, to show them more empathy, but the circumstances seemed to make it impossible.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In May, I travelled to a suburb of Minneapolis in search of a different approach to mental-health crises. Around 8 <em>A.M.</em>, Mitlyng, who has shoulder-length brown hair and a warm smile, met me in the lobby of her new workplace, M Health Fairview Southdale Hospital, which is a ten-minute drive from the Mall of America and houses three hundred and ninety beds in a cream-colored complex. Mitlyng led me through the emergency department, which, even at that hour, had a frenzied energy. A stretcher rolled past; monitors flashed vital signs and heart rhythms. A patient moaned, and a nurse called for help. Then we walked down a long hallway to the area where Mitlyng now treats psychiatric emergencies, as a clinical supervisor.</p><p>On the other side of a door was a spacious, mellow room that reminded me of an airport’s business-class lounge. Floor-to-ceiling windows, which were partially frosted to protect patient privacy, let in the morning sun; an arc of blue light lit up the ceiling. Murals of tree branches, green leaves, and blue skies decorated the walls. A dozen or so patients rested on flatbed recliners. The unit’s nurses sat behind a curved wooden desk.</p><p>A middle-aged woman in a red T-shirt walked up. “I wanted to tell you about something,” she said to one of the nurses. “Of course,” the nurse replied. “I’ll be over in a minute.” The woman shuffled away, pausing at another patient’s recliner before plopping into her own. Their exchange was the kind of ordinary human interaction that would seem unusual only in a hospital, where patients often have to fight for attention.</p><p>Mitlyng led me to one of the unit’s four “sensory rooms.” A rocking chair stood next to a beanbag and a yoga mat. “Patients can go in there and listen to music, and change the color and intensity of the lighting,” Mitlyng told me. “Just kind of chill out, you know?” Outside, a man helped himself to tea, pudding, and a hard-boiled egg from a snack bar. A warming cabinet offered fresh blankets, and around the corner stood an exercise bike. “When someone’s really manic, it helps to externalize that nervous energy,” a nurse explained. “We have a shower, too.” On a nearby bookshelf, titles on yoga, wellness, and philosophy sat next to Scrabble, Uno, and a “Star Wars” jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>The mental-health unit where Mitlyng works is one of only a few dozen Em<em>PATH</em> units, short for Emergency Psychiatry Assessment, Treatment, and Healing. Such units, which were invented about a decade ago, vary in size, staffing, and design, but the core concept is that, instead of leaving patients to languish in an emergency room, caregivers offer them a calm communal environment where they can receive a comprehensive evaluation, start therapy, and, if needed, receive medication. Most patients stay for a day or two; the vast majority are discharged back home, instead of going on to a psychiatric facility. In its two years of existence, M Health Fairview’s Em<em>PATH</em> unit has cared for five thousand people. I turned to survey the room: patients sat placidly near one another, blankets pulled to their chins, munching on chips and watching TV. I thought back to my own experiences in the chaos of emergency departments. Was this what an E.R. for mental illness should look like?</p><inline-embed name="feature-default" attrs="[object Object]" childtypes="image" contenttype="callout:feature-default"><figure><p><span>Frosted privacy glass surrounds the mental-health unit.</span></p></figure></inline-embed><p>Until the nineteen-sixties, American hospitals did not have emergency departments as we think of them today. Physicians made house calls to provide urgent care, and, in hospitals, nurses and medical trainees staffed “accident rooms” where they treated physical traumas that resulted from falls, fights, car crashes, and other mishaps. If a senior doctor was required, one had to be summoned from elsewhere. Meanwhile, most ambulance services were operated by morticians, because hearses were roomy enough for people to lie flat. In 1961, however, James Mills, a general practitioner in Virginia, persuaded three fellow-physicians to join him in running a twenty-four-hour emergency room at Alexandria Hospital, where he’d recently been elected medical-staff president; when things got really busy, military doctors from a local Army base would help out. The new model insured that acutely ill patients could receive timely care from experienced practitioners. Soon, hospitals in other states were piloting their own versions of what came to be known as the Alexandria Plan. But public demand for emergency services of all kinds continued to swell. A few years later, a National Academy of Sciences report called the U.S. “insensitive to the magnitude of the problem of accidental death and injury,” noting that accidents had become the country’s fourth leading cause of mortality. In the early seventies, Congress passed legislation to develop regional ambulance systems, and the American Medical Association recognized emergency medicine as a specialty of its own. It is now the fifth largest, based on the number of trainees who choose it.</p><p>Over the years, small emergency rooms have grown into comprehensive departments capable of treating a wide range of conditions and saving countless lives. Since the nineties, mortality in emergency departments has fallen by half. Their focus on things like accidents, infections, and heart problems, however, remains ill-suited for psychiatric crises. For more than a decade, mental-health and substance-use emergencies have been surging, especially among <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/04/11/the-mystifying-rise-of-child-suicide">young people</a>. Between 2007 and 2020, the share of emergency-department visits for mental-health reasons in the U.S. nearly doubled, and the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/coronavirus">pandemic</a> has only worsened this trend.</p><p>Few emergency physicians are trained to provide <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/03/06/can-ai-treat-mental-illness">mental-health treatment</a>, and their workplaces are not physically designed for it. In a typical E.R., a person experiencing hallucinations, aggression, or psychosis might be evaluated by clinicians looking for a medical cause for his symptoms. Maybe he has an infection, an overactive thyroid, or a medication with psychoactive side effects. Only once these potential causes have been ruled out might the patient see a mental-health practitioner, if one is available. He might then be deemed safe for discharge—or, if doctors think he presents an immediate danger to himself or others, he might be forced to stay. Sometimes, he might wait for days, even weeks, until a bed opens up in a nearby psychiatric facility.</p><p>In 2012, Scott Zeller, who was then the head of psychiatric emergency services at the Alameda Health System, in Oakland, California, was growing frustrated with the status quo. Many observers blamed long wait times for psychiatric patients on a sharp decline in the number of psychiatric beds in public hospitals. Zeller thought they were missing a more fundamental point. “Why is mental illness the only emergency where the treatment plan is, Let’s find them a bed somewhere?” Zeller asked. “If someone comes in with an asthma attack, we don’t say, ‘We’ve got a gurney here in the back for you. We’re going to try to find you an asthma hospital in a day or two, so sit tight.’&nbsp;” For psychiatric patients, this transitional time was therapeutic dead space—a missed opportunity. Could it be transformed into a period of healing?</p><p>Zeller converted an unused hospital lobby into a large waiting room. He supplied the space with snacks and recliners and organized group activities. A nurse or therapist provided counselling, and a psychiatrist tried to see patients and prescribe medications within an hour. “People said, ‘These patients will never be able to be in the same room together—they’ll just rile each other up!’&nbsp;” Zeller told me. “Actually, no—not if you create an environment that’s less like prison and more like a place of healing.”</p><p>This approach came to be known as the Alameda Model. After it was implemented, the number of psychiatric patients who stayed overnight in the area’s emergency departments fell almost to zero. In a traditional emergency department, as many as twenty per cent of patients experiencing a mental-health crisis might end up being restrained in some way; in Zeller’s unit, the number was 0.1 per cent, a difference that he attributes to the calmer environment and specialized staff. The average wait time in the emergency department for people with acute mental-health conditions dropped from more than ten hours to less than two, and, because patients received immediate attention once they got to Zeller’s unit, three-quarters were able to go home, where they tend to have better long-term outcomes, instead of being hospitalized. In 2016, Zeller renamed the model “Em<em>PATH</em>.” He was advised to copyright the term, but decided not to, so other providers could more easily adopt it.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Soon, Zeller was fielding calls from hospitals around the country interested in creating their own Em<em>PATH</em> units. There are now dozens of them planned or in operation—in Pittsburgh and Sacramento, Lynchburg and Lexington, Billings and Bemidji. Each day, around the country, hundreds of patients in crisis are now quickly evaluated by emergency-department staff, then directed to one of these units for specialized psychiatric care.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The Em<em>PATH</em> unit at Fairview Southdale Hospital, where I met Mitlyng, is modest in size, with fifteen recliners, but it is still one of the largest in the country. It is led by Lewis Zeidner, a clinical psychologist who’s worked in emergency psychiatry for more than four decades. A soft-spoken man with silver hair, a neat mustache, and clear-frame glasses, Zeidner told me that, before the unit opened, nearly half of psychiatric patients at Fairview Southdale were hospitalized; now, only around one-tenth are. Most people are discharged home with a care plan and follow-up. “Psychiatric hospitalization carries its own kind of trauma, even when it’s voluntary,” he told me. “We try to avoid it whenever possible.” He had told me that I could observe the unit if I agreed not to talk to patients, and if I promised to omit identifying details, to protect their privacy.</p><p>Around 9 <em>A.M.</em>, the unit’s staff gathered in a private workroom to discuss how each patient was doing. On one wall, “emergency ligature cut-down shears” dangled next to a red button, which would summon help if a patient tried to harm himself; another wall was covered with letters from former patients. “Looking forward to brighter days in recovery and you are part of it,” one read. Kevan Andish, a serene psychiatrist whose waft of dark hair was graying at the temples, listened as a therapist told him about a patient who had stopped taking her mood-stabilizing drugs, convinced that they were abortion pills; her child’s school had reported her erratic behavior. The team decided to keep her overnight for monitoring and treatment.</p><p>Another patient, a young man with depression, had been brought in by friends who were alarmed when he’d started talking about <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/08/16/finding-a-way-back-from-suicide">suicide</a>. Ordinarily, school provided him with a sense of structure and community; it was now on break. During the course of a couple of days, the team had adjusted his medications and he’d improved. Today was his birthday, and he was asking the staff to let him go to a soccer game with his family.</p><p>Next, the therapist told Andish about a woman who was manic, and might benefit from another day of observation, but was determined to leave. I tried to imagine the frustrations of a patient who wasn’t here by choice; for her, the relative comfort of the unit might not make much difference. “She told me that there are people like her walking around out there all day, every day,” the therapist said. A gentle laughter filled the room.</p><p>“She’s not wrong,” someone said.</p><p>“Shows good insight,” Mitlyng chimed in. After reviewing her chart, they decided that the woman was safe to discharge.</p><p>After the huddle, I wandered back into the unit. A young woman with ginger hair, looking despondent in burnt-orange scrubs provided by the hospital, slowly approached the nursing station and asked for a mask. A nurse smiled and handed her one. The woman, whom I’ll call Emma, shuffled back to her recliner. (The Em<em>PATH</em> unit sometimes allows patients to wear their own clothes, but only after a search for potential dangers to themselves or others, like weapons, drugs, belts, and shoelaces. Patients must give up their cell phones.)</p><p>Emma had come in two days before with spiralling anxiety, depression, and paranoia. She’d been eating less than usual, sleeping little, and hearing voices. Her partner had grown concerned and urged her to get help. She’d hardly spoken to anyone at the unit.</p><p>Mitlyng walked Emma to a private consultation room with soft lighting. Emma climbed onto a chair, pulled her knees to her chest, and stared at the floor.</p><p>“Sounds like yesterday was tough,” Mitlyng said.</p><p>Emma wrung her hands. Finally, she said, “Yesterday was hard. I kept hearing names, voices.”</p><p>“What were the voices telling you?” Mitlyng asked. “Did you recognize them?”</p><p>“They sounded like people I know,” she said, barely audible. “But I couldn’t tell who they were.”</p><p>“Are you hearing something right now that maybe I wouldn’t hear?” Mitlyng asked.</p><p>Emma fidgeted. For a long while, she didn’t respond. Mitlyng put down her yellow notepad and placed a hand under her chin.</p><p>“I can’t think right now,” Emma said. “I’m scared.”</p><p>“Have you been scared like this before?” Mitlyng asked. She paused and leaned in. “Have you had any thoughts of suicide?”</p><p>“I’ve thought about hanging myself or walking into traffic,” Emma said, tears in her eyes. “But I’m scared about how it would feel.”</p><p>“It’s hard to talk about, isn’t it?” Mitlyng said. “You’re safe here. I promise.” Emma removed her yellow mask and took a sip of water.</p><p>“Do you need a break?” Mitlyng asked. Emma nodded.</p><p>“What can we do for you today to make you more comfortable?” Mitlyng said.</p><p>For the first time, Emma looked up. Her partner had dropped off a letter for her and some clothes, she said. “Let’s see if we can get them to you,” Mitlyng said, standing up. “If you want to talk to me, just let your nurse know. I’m here to talk anytime.”</p><p>Recently, I spoke with a woman named Allison, whose husband spent time in the Em<em>PATH</em> unit where Mitlyng works. Allison first heard of the unit because she works as a nurse at an affiliated hospital. Still, when her husband’s depression suddenly worsened, a few months ago, “I had no idea how to get him help,” she told me. She secured an appointment with a therapist, but it was five weeks away. “I knew we couldn’t wait that long,” she said. Eventually, she took him to the emergency department at Fairview Southdale Hospital; half an hour later, he was in the Em<em>PATH</em> unit. “I felt so sad leaving him,” Allison told me. “The emergency room can be so traumatic, in and of itself, and now he’s going to this psychiatric unit?” Within a few hours, though, a therapist called her to say that Em<em>PATH</em> staff had helped her husband to schedule two appointments for that same week: one with a therapist, and another with a nurse practitioner, who’d be able to prescribe him medication. He was starting to feel better; if they both felt ready, he could come home. “More than anything, it gave me confidence that we could handle this,” she told me.</p><p>For patients who are not immediately discharged, the unit offers forms of therapy that I’ve never encountered in an emergency department. Patients can discuss their goals in the morning, create art in the afternoons, and learn to meditate in the evenings. Sam Atkins, a clinical coördinator who often leads the art groups, told me that, in one exercise, each patient decorates the exterior of a mask with glitter, representing the face they present to the world, and, on the interior, writes about how they really feel. On the day that I visited, they would paint what Atkins called worry stones.</p><p>As a clinical manager walked through the unit, asking patients if they’d like to join, I wondered how people in crisis would respond to something so earnest. Some ignored the invitation, but two men and two women—including Emma, now in a hoodie—gathered around a table that was covered with markers, crayons, paintbrushes, and flat gray stones. “Has anyone made worry stones before?” Atkins asked the group. “They’re fun to decorate and nice to rub if you’re feeling anxious.”</p><p>A tall, bearded man sat down, squirted some black paint onto a stone, and then stood and walked away. Atkins stuck with it: “Does anyone like making art in their spare time?”</p><p>After a long silence, Emma nodded. “Pottery,” she said. She looked around tentatively, then asked, “What about you guys?”</p><p>One of the others, a dark-haired man, looked up. “Sometimes I like painting,” he said. He carefully painted a bird with green feathers, a white breast, and an orange beak onto his stone. “My bird died,” he explained. Across the table, a woman sat with her forehead in her left hand. She half-heartedly dotted a stone with purple paint.</p><p>After half an hour, I helped Atkins put away the art supplies. When I looked back, Emma remained at the table alone. Sunlight poured in through a window, casting her shadow on the mural behind her. She picked up her stone, which she had painted with pink and blue circles, and smiled. Then she got up and walked back to her recliner.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>For the foreseeable future, M Health Fairview’s Em<em>PATH</em> unit is likely to lose money. Zeidner wouldn’t tell me exactly how much, but the amount is in the hundreds of thousands each year; he said in an e-mail that the hospital administration “tolerates some of our losses because they appreciate the clinical and human value that Em<em>PATH</em> creates,” and because the unit reduces the need for psychiatric beds, clearing space for a surgical ward. His unit depends in part on donations; elsewhere, Em<em>PATH</em> units have relied on grants from local governments. One unit I contacted had shut down, owing to a shortage of staff.</p><p>Even as the model gains momentum, there is reason to worry that a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/05/how-hospice-became-a-for-profit-hustle?page=8">profit-based medical system</a> can sustain only so much experimentation. For hospitals, an averted admission often means lost revenue; although insurance companies theoretically stand to gain from lower expenditures, they tend to reimburse for discrete one-time assessments, not the kind of holistic care that Em<em>PATH</em> units offer. “Insurers still don’t really understand what this is,” Zeller told me. “They say, ‘O.K., we’ll give you a few hundred dollars to see this patient.’ I’m, like, ‘That doesn’t even cover the security guard.’&nbsp;” Each year, in the United States alone, there are an estimated three-quarters of a million emergency-department visits for mental-health crises; to address the need, hundreds of Em<em>PATH</em> units, each one treating thousands of patients per year, would be required. Zeller is convinced that this can happen. “Every few weeks, I hear from someone wanting to start an Em<em>PATH</em> unit,” he said. “People see that the need is just enormous and the way we do things right now is completely broken.”</p><p>A few weeks after my visit, I reconnected with Mitlyng. I was happy to learn that Emma had improved enough to be discharged shortly after I left, but I was also reminded that, even in the best of circumstances, mental illness can seem intractable. Normally, warmer weather brings an easing of psychiatric emergencies, but for some reason this year the unit was “bursting at the seams,” she told me. “The need feels endless.” In one case, a patient became agitated in the unit and had to be transferred back to the emergency room. In another, a patient with serious substance-use problems refused treatment after his initial symptoms had subsided. “Their families are so desperate to help them,” Mitlyng told me. “We have to say, ‘I’m sorry, there’s nothing we can do until they’re ready.’&nbsp;” But, she went on, “then you’ll get one really great experience&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and it just fills your cup for months.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Mitlyng told me about a young woman who’d come to the unit with intensifying alcohol use and thoughts of suicide. She’d often considered rehab, but needed a special evaluation before insurance would pay for it, and didn’t know how to get one on her own. When she finally came to Em<em>PATH</em>, she told Mitlyng, “If I don’t get this under control, I know I’m going to die.” Mitlyng helped her get the evaluation, but the woman started having second thoughts: she felt better and was anxious about what rehab would be like. Hoping to persuade her, Mitlyng called several facilities to make sure that they had a spot open. Then she brought over a laptop, and, together, she and the patient looked at photos of the centers. If she wanted, Mitlyng told her, she could go straight from the Em<em>PATH</em> unit to whichever facility she preferred. She called the woman’s father and asked him to bring a suitcase with some clothing. Eventually, the woman decided to do it. In moments like those, Mitlyng told me, “I’m caring for people the way I always wanted to.”</p><p>When I first heard about Em<em>PATH</em> units, I assumed that their main contribution to mental-health care was empathy. This isn’t wrong, but it is incomplete. In my experience, nearly every caregiver aims to show empathy; the question is whether, in an emergency, we have the space and time to do so. In Minnesota, I started to think that the Em<em>PATH</em> unit’s real innovation is a structural shift in how we think about space and time. We usually consider drugs, devices, and procedures the kinds of medical care that make a difference, but <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/what-should-hang-on-the-walls-of-a-hospital">physical spaces can be therapeutic</a>, too. It’s also easy to forget that, in a crisis, every minute matters. Once a patient reaches an Em<em>PATH</em> unit, there are no waiting rooms: even if a patient is in line for a transfer to a longer-term facility, she is receiving care while she waits. “You have to capitalize on the moments when someone is motivated to change,” Mitlyng said. “You never know if you’ll get another chance.” What had appeared unusual about M Health Fairview’s Em<em>PATH</em> unit started to seem intuitive, even obvious: beautify bare walls, maximize natural light, strike a balance between privacy and company. A patient with choices—even small ones, like which snack to take from a snack bar—may wind up feeling a little better.</p><p>The hospital where I work doesn’t have an Em<em>PATH</em> unit. Even so, many of the model’s underlying principles seem within reach, if only health systems broaden their definition of care. Not long ago, I treated a man who needed urgent mental-health care. He spent several moody, agitated days in a windowless room in the emergency department. He slept in the afternoons and tried to roam the halls at night; on my morning rounds, I would orient him to the date and time as he worked on breakfast, much of it landing on his hospital gown. But, a few days into his stay, a bed opened up in a sunlit room with a large window, a view of the East River, and a friendly roommate. On opposite sides of a blue curtain, the two patients synched their televisions, and, when I entered the room after that, I often found myself interrupting lively conversations. He improved quickly. On the morning that I told him I thought he was ready to leave the hospital, he seemed excited but apprehensive. As I left the room, I heard his roommate say, “You got this—I’ll be rooting for you.”&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>

<p>A kind stranger (Igor Iranto) wrote up a <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/debugging-in-vim-with-vimspector-4n0m">really nice tutorial</a> which is well worth a read.</p>

<p>In order to follow along at home, have a read of
<a href="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/demo-setup.html">these instructions</a>. They cover installing Vimspector and
overview configuring it to debug Vim, as an example of a C program.</p>

<p>See also the detailed <a href="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector/">configuration documentation</a> and the
<a href="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector/schema/">JSON schema</a> covering the <code>.vimspector.json</code> and <code>.gadgets.json</code>
formats.</p>

<h2 id="ui-overview">UI Overview</h2>

<p>When starting debugging, vimspector creates a new tab page with 5 main sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The code window</li>
  <li>The scopes window</li>
  <li>The watch window</li>
  <li>The call stack window.</li>
  <li>The output window</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-overview.png" alt="Overview"></p>

<h2 id="the-code-window">The code window</h2>

<p>This window has 2 elements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The debug toolbar (WinBar), and</li>
  <li>The code buffer.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the code buffer, the current line is highlighted with a sign. When selecting a stack frame in the call stack, the code window is updated to display the current line in that stack frame:</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-code-window.png" alt="Code Window"></p>

<p>You can even get a pop up with the vaue of the expression under the cursor.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-variable-eval-hover.png" alt="Hover"></p>

<h2 id="the-scopes-window">The scopes window</h2>

<p>Displays the variables in different visible scopes. Entries can be expanded by
putting the cursor on the line and pressing <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-locals-window.png" alt="Scopes Window"></p>

<h2 id="the-watch-window">The watch window</h2>

<p>Allows execution and display of arbitrary expressions. This window contains a
prompt buffer. When you enter insert mode (e.g. with <code>i</code>) you can type an
expression. When hitting <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>, the expression is evaluated and the result is
displayed. If the result is has structure, it can be expanded like in the scoped
window by hitting <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code>. The little <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> icons show what is
expandable.</p>

<p>Watches are recomputed regularly so update as you’re stepping through code, for
example.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-watch-window.png" alt="Watch Window"></p>

<h2 id="the-call-stack-window">The call stack window</h2>

<p>This shows the call stack for all of the threads in the program.</p>

<p>As with variables, stacks can be expanded and collapsed with <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> and have
little <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> icons where appropriate. In addition, hitting <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> on a
particular stack frame will open the file in the code window and place the
cursor there.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-callstack-window.png" alt="Call Stack"></p>

<h2 id="the-output-window">The output window</h2>

<p>This contains a number of buffers for both monitoring debugger state an interracting with the debugger itself.</p>

<p>The most interesting buffers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Console, which allows for an interactive REPL with most debug adapters,</li>
  <li>The debugee standard error stream, and</li>
  <li>The vimspector log, which allows for debugging when vimspector breaks</li>
</ul>

<p>These windows typically scroll automatically as new content is added asyncronously.</p>

<p><img src="https://puremourning.github.io/vimspector-web/img/vimspector-output-window.png" alt="Code Window"></p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>For most debugging actions, I prefer the keyboard shortcuts, but if you are more
mouse-inclined, the WinBar is quite useful.</p>

<p>Here’s a summary of common actions in the code windows. See the <a href="https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector">Vimspector</a>
readme for full details.</p>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            The generative AI revolution has been recently expanded
            to videos. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art video models are still lagging behind image models in terms of visual
            quality and user control over the generated content. In this
            work, we present a framework that harnesses the power of
            a text-to-image diffusion model for the task of text-driven
            video editing. Specifically, given a source video and a target
            text-prompt, our method generates a high-quality video that
            adheres to the target text, while preserving the spatial layout and dynamics of the input video. Our method is based
            on our key observation that consistency in the edited video
            can be obtained by enforcing consistency in the diffusion
            feature space. We achieve this by explicitly propagating
            diffusion features based on inter-frame correspondences,
            readily available in the model. Thus, our framework does
            not require any training or fine-tuning, and can work in conjunction with any off-the-shelf text-to-image editing method.
            We demonstrate state-of-the-art editing results on a variety
            of real-world videos.

                We observe that the level of temporal consistency of a video is tightly related to the temporal consistency of its feature representation, as can be seen in the feature visualization below.
                The features of a natural video have a shared, temporally consistent representation. When editing the video per frame, this consistency breaks. Our method ensures the same level of feature consistency as in the original video features.

                Our key finding is that a temporally-consistent edit can be achieved by enforcing consistency on the internal diffusion features across frames during the editing process.
                We achieve this by propagating a small set of edited features across frames, using the correspondences between the original video features.
                Given an input video I, we invert each frame, extract its tokens (i.e., output features from the self-attention modules), and extract inter-frame feature correspondences using a nearest-neighbor (NN) search. At each denoising step:
              </p>
              <ol>
                (I) We sample keyframes from the noisy video J_t and jointly edit them using an extended-attention block. The set of resulting edited tokens is T_base.
                <br>
                (II) We propagate the edited tokens across the video according to the pre-computed correspondences of the original video features.
              </ol>
              To denoise J_t, we feed each frame to the network and replace the generated tokens with the tokens obtained from the propagation step (II).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-first_letter="E">
		<p>Even if you don’t sign into your Mac using an Apple ID, it still connects to iCloud so long as it has an open internet connection. For many of us, though, iCloud and iCloud Drive are essential features of using Macs and Apple’s devices. They make it easy to share passwords, photos, documents we’re working on, and much more. This article explains the basics of how iCloud and particularly iCloud Drive now work, and provides a new version of my free utility Cirrus to help you investigate them.</p>
<p>iCloud is descended from a long series of features in older versions of Mac OS, going back to iTools in January 2000. It’s currently divided into two main functional services: <strong>CloudKit</strong> to handle databases, and <strong>iCloud Drive</strong> for storage of files. These appear to be implemented in the same vast distributed databases served by Apple’s own data centres and those of third-parties including Amazon’s AWS. macOS also includes some specialist tasks relying on iCloud such as the Find My service, and App Store apps are able to synchronise small shared dictionaries of key-value pairs such as preferences in an Ubiquitous Key-Value store.</p>
<h4>CloudKit</h4>
<p>This supports structured cloud-based databases, including the synchronisation of Core Data containers through Persistent CloudKit Container private databases. This is exceedingly complex, and uses the com.apple.cloudkit sub-system and the <code>cloudd</code> service in macOS.</p>
<p>When used to synchronise a Core Data container for an app’s database, changes to a local container are scheduled to be synchronised up to iCloud by the DAS-CTS dispatch system, and that’s performed in the background when conditions allow. Because of the time elapsed between the app making a change and it being synchronised up by CloudKit, tracing entries in the log can be difficult.</p>
<p>CloudKit is used extensively by bundled apps like Notes, by many third-party apps that keep their data in iCloud so it can be shared between different Macs and devices, and more. It also hosts some important system services for macOS, including the online app notarization database, one of the most important iCloud services to work without an Apple ID.</p>
<p>CloudKit services are controlled for macOS features in iCloud settings, in System Settings &gt; [Apple ID] &gt; iCloud. Third-party apps may place their control in the app’s settings, but they’re also combined with iCloud Drive access in the iCloud Drive settings: open those and click on the <strong>Apps syncing to iCloud Drive</strong> item at the foot of that dialog to see a full list and control their access to iCloud as a whole.</p>

<h4>iCloud Drive</h4>
<p>In contrast to CloudKit, iCloud Drive is far easier to deal with, and to understand, as it’s largely in the control of the user, and its actions are readily observable. When you copy or move a file to your Mac’s iCloud Drive, the com.apple.clouddocs sub-system and <code>bird</code> service upload that file to your iCloud Drive, then synchronise the information held in iCloud with that on each connected Mac and device.</p>
<p>Another sub-system in macOS is responsible for dividing blobs of data into the chunks used in iCloud storage: com.apple.mmcs reveals its ancient origins in its name of MobileMe Chunk Storage, or MMCS.</p>
<h4>iCloud Drive local paths</h4>
<p>If you’re using iCloud Drive <em>without</em> putting Desktop &amp; Documents Folders into iCloud, your own iCloud Drive folders will be found in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs. This roughly corresponds to the top level of iCloud Drive as seen in the Finder. However, macOS adds other folders that are actually located in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/.</p>
<p>If you have enabled Desktop &amp; Documents Folders with iCloud Drive, those folders don’t include your Documents and Desktop folders. There are several ways to locate them, including following the symlink placed in ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs (useful for Documents only, as no symlink is created for the Desktop), or by opening those folders from the top level of your Home folder. This can become extremely confusing because of discrepancies between what’s shown in the Finder, and what can be seen elsewhere. This is all part of the illusion created by macOS with iCloud Drive.</p>
<h4>iCloud Drive controls</h4>
<p>There are four controls available for iCloud Drive, in addition to that giving access to third-party apps (above):</p>
<ul>
<li>iCloud Drive switch, in iCloud &gt; iCloud Drive;</li>
<li>Desktop &amp; Documents Folders switch, immediately below that;</li>
<li>Optimise Mac Storage switch, at the top of the main iCloud settings;</li>
<li>the Finder’s contextual menu for the contents of iCloud Drive, allowing you to Download Now or Remove Download.</li>
</ul>
<p>Storing the whole of the contents of the Desktop &amp; Documents folders is an attractive solution for those with limited space for their Home folders, particularly when used in combination with Optimise Mac Storage. It has two potential drawbacks, though. It’s easy for the total stored in the two folders to exceed available free space, which prevents the contents from being properly backed up and can cause a crisis should you need to download most or all of what’s stored in iCloud Drive. Should you want to turn off Desktop &amp; Documents Folders, you must plan that carefully to cope with the resulting removal of local files.</p>
<p>Enabling Optimise Mac Storage lets macOS determine which files in iCloud Drive will be stored locally as well <em>(downloaded),</em> and which will be removed from local storage and only kept in iCloud <em>(evicted).</em> While the wording displayed might suggest that eviction is only performed when local free space becomes low, that isn’t accurate, and macOS may decide to evict files that haven’t been accessed for a long while, and others seemingly at random.</p>
<p>Immediately after a file is added to iCloud Drive, it’s both stored locally and kept in sync with the copy uploaded to iCloud storage. When that file is evicted, a stub file is kept in its local place, whose name is identical with the addition of a prefix of a stop/period. The stub file is very small by comparison, and because its name starts with a stop/period, the stub file itself is hidden, although the Finder shows the original file name with an evicted icon next to it. Stub files also retain the extended attributes of the original file, together with the special extended attribute of type com.apple.icloud.itemName containing the name of the original file. Evicted files behave differently, as they can’t be searched by Spotlight, and can’t be backed up by Time Machine, as I’ll discuss in future articles. They also lack a QuickLook preview.</p>
<h4>Logs</h4>
<p>Custom log browsers for iCloud are available in Cirrus and <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/mints-a-multifunction-utility/">Mints</a>. These distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li>com.apple.clouddocs reporting transactions for iCloud Drive,</li>
<li>com.apple.cloudkit reporting transactions for CloudKit,</li>
<li>com.apple.mmcs chunking data for iCloud storage,</li>
<li><code>cloudd</code> and <code>bird</code>, as the services for CloudKit and iCloud Drive respectively.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can obtain a similar extract using the predicate<br>
<code>subsystem == "com.apple.clouddocs" OR subsystem == "com.apple.cloudkit" OR subsystem == "com.apple.mmcs" OR processImagePath CONTAINS[c] "cloudd" OR processImagePath CONTAINS[c] "bird" OR processID = 0</code><br>
with <code>log show</code>.</p>
<h4>Cirrus</h4>
<p>One of the problems with using the Finder to try to understand what’s going on with iCloud Drive is that it has a habit of changing the status of documents there. If you open a folder of evicted documents in the Finder, macOS starts downloading some or all of them if it can. One way to work around this is to use the custom browser built into my free utility Cirrus, which also features a simple test of uploading a 1 MB file to iCloud Drive.</p>
<p>I’m pleased to provide a new version of Cirrus, 1.13, which is now fully updated to work with recent versions of macOS including Sonoma. It’s available from here: <a title="cirrus113" href="https://eclecticlightdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2023/07/cirrus113.zip">cirrus113</a><br>
from <strong>Downloads</strong> above, from <a href="https://eclecticlight.co/cirrus-bailiff/">its Product Page</a>, and via its auto-update mechanism.</p>
<p>Its menu bar companion Bailiff is no longer as useful as it has been in the past, now that you can evict items in the Finder. I will be assessing it further to see if there is any value in updating it as well.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Egregoria</h2>
<p dir="auto">Egregoria is an indie city builder, mostly inspired by Cities:Skylines.<br>
Each individual has its own thought model, meaning every action has its importance and influences the environment.<br>
Egregoria is focused on the socio-economical aspect of a city, with a logistics element.
The game is still in early development, but you can already play it and give some feedback through
<a href="https://github.com/Uriopass/Egregoria/issues">issues</a> or on <a href="https://discord.gg/CAaZhUJ" rel="nofollow">discord</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">By being open source, the hope is to get more people involved in the development of the game.<br>
Mod support is wanted but the design has not been found yet.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How to play</h2>
<p dir="auto">A small tutorial is available on the github wiki to get you started.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Devblog</h2>
<p dir="auto">I keep a blog about Egregoria's development <a href="http://douady.paris/blog/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building the project</h2>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Git LFS</h3>
<p dir="auto">This project uses Git LFS to track assets, therefore if you want to build your own copy you will need to install <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Once installed, you should be able to clone the repo and fetch the assets:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/Uriopass/Egregoria
cd Egregoria
git lfs pull"><pre>git clone https://github.com/Uriopass/Egregoria
<span>cd</span> Egregoria
git lfs pull</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Windows/Mac</h3>
<p dir="auto">I personally use Windows 10 and Mac OS 10.11, and it compiles fine once the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" rel="nofollow">rust toolchain is installed</a>.</p>

<p dir="auto">Don't forget to add the <code>--release</code> flag, otherwise the game will be very slow.<br>
Don't forget to pull the lfs files, otherwise the game will crash with a file not found error.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Ubuntu/Debian on x11</h3>
<p dir="auto">There are a few libraries to install that some of my dependencies need:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libx11-dev
cargo run --release"><pre><code>sudo apt-get install libasound2-dev libudev-dev pkg-config libx11-dev
cargo run --release
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Don't forget to add the <code>--release</code> flag, otherwise the game will be very slow.<br>
Don't forget to pull the lfs files, otherwise the game will crash with a file not found error.</p>
<p dir="auto">A GitHub Action tests the builds on Ubuntu.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Egregoria ?</h2>
<p dir="auto">An Egregor is an autonomous psychic entity made up of, and influencing, the thoughts of a group of people.<br>
It represents emergence at its purest form, where individuals come together to become a collective force.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Credits</h2>

His mother in particular instilled a love of learning, in part motivated by the fact that her own family lacked the money to continue her education beyond grade school.</p><p>“She told me that when I was a baby and she used to wheel me in a carriage around McGill, she told me that I would go there,” he said in an <a href="https://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/139/1/Marcus_OHO.pdf" target="_blank"><u>oral history</u></a> collected by Caltech in 1993. (She was right: he earned both his bachelor’s degree and doctorate at the prestigious Montreal university.)</p><p>He was drawn to puzzles as a child, and has often described his approach to science as a decades-long continuation of the childlike pleasure of teasing a solution from once-scattered parts.</p><p>“The main thing is finding something that you enjoy doing, that preferably doesn’t harm others, and that tests whatever aptitude one has, that tests one’s ingenuity,” he said. “It’s almost like a kind of a game. You against nature.”</p> </div></div>]]></description>

<p>In a Twitter thread, a <strong><em>Shopify (TSX: SHOP)</em></strong> employee has broken their non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to shed light on the company’s controversial actions and strategic direction. The thread exposed a series of events starting from the first quarter of 2022 when Shopify promised job security to its staff, only to carry out massive layoffs in July of the same year. </p>



<p>These job cuts, according to the employee, were driven not merely by a CEO’s misguided “bet,” but rather a shift towards replacing full-time employees with cheaper contract labor and an increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) support.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WOW: A <a href="https://twitter.com/Shopify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@shopify</a> employee is violating their NDA to tell us that <a href="https://twitter.com/tobi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@tobi</a>:</p><p>-has been quietly firing their global customer service team across US, Canada and Ireland<br>-is about to replace them with AI chatbots</p><p>Good luck to all Shopify shop owners out there — shit’s about to SUCK. <a href="https://t.co/TwizyV0waP">https://t.co/TwizyV0waP</a></p></div>— Nandini Jammi (@nandoodles) <a href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1681694042256449536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Last week, Shopify announced its upcoming launch of an artificial intelligence assistant called “Sidekick” for merchants using its platform, joining the ranks of other tech companies introducing similar features. In a video shared on Twitter, Lutke demonstrated how the “Sidekick” assistant, accessible through a button on Shopify, will be capable of responding to merchant inquiries, providing information on sales trends, and more.</p>



<p>The tweet series further detailed how Shopify has been aggressively embracing AI technology, using it for various purposes, from generating product descriptions to creating virtual sidekicks and developing a new help center AI agent still in beta testing. CEO Tobi Lutke’s public statements on Twitter illustrated his belief that companies can achieve higher revenues with fewer employees, signaling a desire to cut costs and please shareholders.</p>



<p>However, the consequences of this cost-cutting strategy have negatively impacted customer satisfaction. The reduction in staff and the rise of outsourced, cheap contract labor have led to significant delays in customer support, leaving frustrated merchants waiting for hours or even struggling to receive clear answers. Additionally, teams responsible for monitoring fraudulent stores have been overwhelmed, leading to a potential increase in the number of scam businesses on the platform.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">5. Tobi has hardly been discreet about his plans, sharing a graph on Twitter that illustrated how, over the years, companies required fewer workers to make $1 million in revenue: <a href="https://t.co/WHc8tu3ufx">https://t.co/WHc8tu3ufx</a></p>— Joe Momma (@sh0p1fyj03) <a href="https://twitter.com/sh0p1fyj03/status/1681673992476717057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The employee’s Twitter thread also raised concerns about the well-being of Shopify’s workforce. Since the layoffs, remaining staff members have reportedly faced increased workloads without proportional compensation or benefits, leading to burnout, anxiety, and stress leave. Despite these issues being brought to leadership’s attention, they were dismissed as “system” problems, and the company’s focus on AI-based solutions appeared to supersede the value once placed on human-driven customer service.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the thread highlighted Shopify’s apparent shift in target market focus. Previously known for supporting small businesses and entrepreneurs, Shopify now seems to prioritize larger players, as its revenue model relies heavily on payment transactions rather than subscription software.</p>



<p>The drastic changes in Shopify’s approach have led both employees and customers to question the company’s integrity and commitment to its original mission of empowering small businesses. Many see the company as straying from its roots, becoming more akin to the corporate giants it once aimed to oppose.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">16. “Once we know how to fix the system, we will invest heavily in tooling, including tooling to help Support folks do their jobs better and tooling to help our merchants get answers to questions more quickly without having to talk to a human being”.</p>— Joe Momma (@sh0p1fyj03) <a href="https://twitter.com/sh0p1fyj03/status/1681674028681920514?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 19, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Shopify’s leadership, including President Harley Finkelstein, has assured employees there will be no further layoffs. However, the company’s actions and secretive handling of layoffs under the veil of NDAs have caused employees to doubt these promises.</p>



<p>Despite multiple rounds of layoffs over the last year, management compensation at Shopify appears to have been largely unaffected.</p>



<p>In a regulatory filing made in May, Shopify revealed that Lutke collected just over $20.0 million in total compensation in 2022, on par with the $20.0 million he collected in 2021, and an increase over the $15.1 million he made in 2020.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With public scrutiny growing and concerns over its corporate values and business model mounting, Shopify faces a significant challenge in restoring trust and addressing the impact of its decisions on both employees and customers. </p>



<p>Shopify last traded at $89.91 on the TSX.</p>

						<p>Alex Tabarrok <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/08/is-the-fda-too-conservative-or-too-aggressive.html">writes about how</a> “when the FDA fails to approve a good drug, people die but the bodies are buried in an invisible graveyard.” I’d like to make that graveyard a little bit more visible because I’m going to be buried in it, in a few weeks or months. A squamous cell carcinoma tumor appeared on my tongue last September; the surgery for it occurred in October, followed by radiation in December – January, but the tumor reappeared at the base of my tongue in April. A massive surgery on May 25 appeared to produce “clean margins” (that is, no tumor cells remained where the surgeon operated), albeit at huge cost: I have no tongue any more, just a “flap” of muscle where it used to be, and no ability to swallow solid foods ever again. Monday I’m starting chemotherapy, but that’s almost certainly going to fail, because a CT scan shows four to six new gross tumors, four in my neck and two, possibly, in my lungs.</p>
<p>So what <em>might</em> help me? MRNA tumor vaccines. Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) are notoriously treatment resistant, and mRNA vaccines have shown huge promise. Why aren’t they happening faster? Because the FDA is slow. There are some trials underway (<a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-4359-P101">here is one</a> from Moderna; <a href="https://trials.modernatx.com/study/?id=mRNA-2752-P101">here is another</a>), and, although I’m trying to enroll, I may be too late, since my cancer moves so aggressively. The FDA was loathe to approve initial mRNA human trials, even when those trials would have been full of people like me: those who are facing death sentences anyway.</p>
<p>Here is one story, from “<a href="https://www.fdareview.org/issues/why-the-fda-has-an-incentive-to-delay-the-introduction-of-new-drugs/">Why the FDA Has an Incentive to Delay the Introduction of New Drugs</a>:”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the early 1980s, when I headed the team at the FDA that was reviewing the NDA for recombinant human insulin, . . . we were ready to recommend approval a mere four months after the application was submitted (at a time when the average time for NDA review was more than two and a half years). With quintessential bureaucratic reasoning, my supervisor refused to sign off on the approval—even though he agreed that the data provided compelling evidence of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. “If anything goes wrong,” he argued, “think how bad it will look that we approved the drug so quickly.” (41)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that delaying mRNA cancer vaccines kills people like me.</p>
<p>We need to have a much stronger “right to try” presumption: “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/06/26/relyvrio-als-fda-approval">When Dying Patients Want Unproven Drugs</a>,” we should let those patients try. I have weeks to months left; let’s try whatever there is to try, and advance medicine along the way. The “right to try” is part of fundamental freedom—and this is particularly true for palliative-stage patients without a route to a cure anyway. They are risking essentially nothing.</p>
<p>When I am dead and buried at least those who I love and who love me will know the FDA protected me and millions of others like me from ourselves. Thanks, FDA. But the dead do not vote and do not agitate for change, so the system is likely to grind on.</p>
<p>In computer science there is a convention in which one’s first program prints “Hello, world.” Now it is my turn to write “Goodbye, world.” I’m crying as I write this and am sorry to have to go so soon. I have to give back the gift, though with great sadness.</p>
