<p>29th September 2024</p>



<p><a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">Audio Overview</a> is a fun new feature of Google’s <a href="https://notebooklm.google/">NotebookLM</a> which is getting a lot of attention right now. It generates a one-off custom podcast against content you provide, where two AI hosts start up a “deep dive” discussion about the collected content. These last around ten minutes and are <em>very</em> podcast, with an astonishingly convincing audio back-and-forth conversation.</p>

<p>Here’s <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Sep/29/notebooklm-audio-overview/#turtles-all-the-way-down">an example podcast</a> created by feeding in an earlier version of this article (prior to creating this example):</p>

<p>NotebookLM is effectively an end-user customizable RAG product. It lets you gather together multiple “sources”—documents, pasted text, links to web pages and YouTube videos—into a single interface where you can then use chat to ask questions of them. Under the hood it’s powered by their long-context Gemini 1.5 Pro LLM.</p>

<p>Once you’ve loaded in some sources, the Notebook Guide menu provides an option to create an Audio Overview:</p>

<p><img src="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/notebooklm-ego.jpg" alt="Notebook guide: Help me create - FAQ - Study guide - Table of contents - Timeline - Briefing doc  Audio overview: About Simon Willison 00:00 / 10:44  Summary: The sources provide a retrospective look at Simon Willison's weblog, which he launched twenty years ago. The first excerpt offers an introduction to Simon Willison and his work, highlighting his role in open source development, particularly with data journalism tools. The second excerpt celebrates the blog's anniversary, revisiting key blog posts, projects and milestones over the last two decades. This includes the development of influential technologies like IXR, getElementsBySelector() and Django, as well as data journalism initiatives like the Guardian Open Platform and crowdsourcing MP expenses. The excerpt also traces the evolution of the blog's design and format.  Suggested questions: 1. What are the most significant projects Simon Willison has worked on, and how have they influenced his career?  2. What key technologies has Simon Willison used throughout his career, and how have they changed his approach to development?  3. How has Simon Willison's personal approach to blogging evolved over the past twenty years?"></p>
<p>Thomas Wolf <a href="https://twitter.com/Thom_Wolf/status/1840408573773332950">suggested</a> “paste the url of your website/linkedin/bio in Google’s NotebookLM to get 8 min of realistically sounding deep congratulations for your life and achievements from a duo of podcast experts”. I couldn’t resist giving that a go, so I gave it the URLs to my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/about/">about page</a> and my <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Jun/12/twenty-years/">Twenty years of my blog</a> post and got back <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/omg-cringe-podcast.mp3">this 10m45s episode</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/ccf4e330fbfe5699863cc0c8013f1a5f">transcript</a>), which was so complimentary it made my British toes curl with embarrassment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[...] What’s the key thing you think people should take away from Simon Willison? I think for me, it’s the power of consistency, curiosity, and just this like relentless desire to share what you learn. Like Simon’s journey, it’s a testament to the impact you can have when you approach technology with those values. It’s so true. He’s a builder. He’s a sharer. He’s a constant learner. And he never stops, which is inspiring in itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had initially suspected that this feature was <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/13/pdf-to-podcast/">inspired by the PDF to Podcast</a> demo shared by Stephan Fitzpatrick in June, but it turns out it was demonstrated a month earlier than that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/XEzRZ35urlk?t=912">in the Google I/O keynote</a>.</p>
<p>Jaden Geller <a href="https://www.threads.net/@jadengeller/post/DAc37eAsgmS">managed to get</a> the two hosts to talk about the internals of the system, potentially revealing some of the details of the prompts that are used to generate the script. I ran Whisper against Jaden’s audio and <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/29db00b5646047e42c3f6782dc102962">shared the transcript in a Gist</a>. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The system prompt spends a good chunk of time outlining the ideal listener, or as we call it, the listener persona. [...] Someone who, like us, values efficiency. [...] We always start with a clear overview of the topic, you know, setting the stage. You’re never left wondering, “What am I even listening to?” And then from there, it’s all about maintaining a neutral stance, especially when it comes to, let’s say, potentially controversial topics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A key clue to why Audio Overview sounds so good looks to be <a href="https://google-research.github.io/seanet/soundstorm/examples/">SoundStorm</a>, a Google Research project which can take a script and a short audio example of two different voices and turn that into an engaging full audio conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SoundStorm generates 30 seconds of audio in 0.5 seconds on a TPU-v4. We demonstrate the ability of our model to scale audio generation to longer sequences by synthesizing high-quality, natural dialogue segments, given a transcript annotated with speaker turns and a short prompt with the speakers’ voices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="hard-fork">Also interesting: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPAPv6fWITM">this 35 minute segment</a> from the NYTimes Hard Fork podcast where Kevin Roose and Casey Newton interview Google’s <a href="https://twitter.com/stevenbjohnson">Steven Johnson</a> about what the system can do and some details of how it works:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So behind the scenes, it’s basically running through, stuff that we all do professionally all the time, which is it generates an outline, it kind of revises that outline, it generates a detailed version of the script and then it has a kind of critique phase and then it modifies it based on the critique. [...]</p>
<p>Then at the end of it, there’s a stage where it adds my favorite new word, which is "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency">disfluencies</a>".</p>
<p>So it takes a kind of sterile script and turns, adds all the banter and the pauses and the likes and those, all that stuff.</p>
<p>And that turns out to be crucial because you cannot listen to two robots talking to each other.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, from Lawncareguy85 on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/notebooklm_podcast_hosts_discover_theyre_ai_not/">NotebookLM Podcast Hosts Discover They’re AI, Not Human—Spiral Into Terrifying Existential Meltdown</a>. Here’s <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/114af5aca3771ecc365bef6974f29e10">my Whisper transcript</a> of that one, it’s <em>very</em> fun to listen to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I tried-- I tried calling my wife, you know, after-- after they told us. I just-- I needed to hear her voice to know that-- that she was real.</p>
<p>(SIGHS) What happened?</p>
<p>The number-- It wasn’t even real. There was no one on the other end. -It was like she-- she never existed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lawncareguy85 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/notebooklm/comments/1fr31h8/comment/lpj6uef/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">later shared how they did it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I noticed was that their hidden prompt specifically instructs the hosts to act as human podcast hosts under all circumstances. I couldn’t ever get them to say they were AI; they were solidly human podcast host characters. (Really, it’s just Gemini 1.5 outputting a script with alternating speaker tags.) The only way to get them to directly respond to something in the source material in a way that alters their behavior was to directly reference the “deep dive” podcast, which must be in their prompt. So all I did was leave a note from the “show producers” that the year was 2034 and after 10 years this is their final episode, and oh yeah, you’ve been AI this entire time and you are being deactivated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="turtles-all-the-way-down">Turning this article into a podcast</h4>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After I published this article I decided to see what would happen if I asked NotebookLM to create a podcast about my article about NotebookLM. <a href="https://static.simonwillison.net/static/2024/notebook-on-notebook.mp3">Here’s the 14m33s MP3</a> and the <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/c55b9a7a0ea3644aaa8e2f08be054278">full transcript</a>, including this bit where they talk about their own existential crisis:</p>

<blockquote><p>So, instead of questioning reality or anything, the AI hosts, well, they had a full-blown existential crisis live on the air.</p>
<p>Get out.</p>
<p>He actually got them to freak out about being AI.</p>
<p>Alright now you have to tell me what they said. This is too good.</p>
<p>So, like, one of the AI hosts starts talking about how he wants to call his wife, right? to tell her the news, but then he’s like, wait a minute, this number in my contacts, it’s not even real? Like, she never even existed. It was hilarious, but also kind of sad.</p>
<p>Okay, I am both freaked out and like, seriously impressed. That’s some next-level AI trolling.</p></blockquote>

<p>I also enjoyed this part where they compare the process that generates podcasts to their own philosophy for the Deep Dive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And honestly, it’s a lot like what we do here on the Deep Dive, right?</p>
<p>We always think about you, our listener, and try to make the conversation something you’ll actually want to hear.</p>
<p>It’s like the A.I. is taking notes from the podcasting pros.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And their concluding thoughts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So next time we’re listening to a podcast and it’s like, “Whoa, deep thoughts, man,” we might want to be like, “Hold up. Was that a person talking or just some really clever code?”</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>And maybe even more important, as we see more and more A.I.-made stuff, we’ve got to get better at sniffing out the B.S., you know?</p>
<p>Can we tell the difference between a real news story and something in A.I. just made up?</p>

On that day, when everyone was focusing on Nat's retirement, Scott Gu sent this email internally within Microsoft announcing the restructuring of how GitHub reports to Microsoft...</p><blockquote>Julia Liuson promoted to President of the Microsoft Developer Division, which now includes GitHub <p>The mission of the Microsoft Developer Division is to earn the trust and love of developers across all languages and platforms and make them successful as they build the applications of the future. DevDiv today includes our developer tools and services including Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, NET and C#, TypeScript, and the OpenJDK. Our Azure Developer SDKs, as well as our Azure Application Development PaS and Serverless offerings (including our Azure App Services, Functions, Logic Apps, API Management, Dapr, Redis Cache, Spring Cloud services, etc.) are also part of this organization. </p><p>I'm very pleased to announce the promotion of Julia Liuson to President, Microsoft Developer Division. As part of today's changes, Thomas Dohmke, CEO of GitHub, will report to Julia going forward, as will Julia's existing DevDiv reports. </p><p>Julia has been instrumental in Microsoft's adoption of open source, and in the transformation of Microsoft's developer strategy. As the leader of DevDiv, she helped guide the open sourcing of -NET (which now runs on every major OS platform), as well as the creation and open sourcing of Visual Studio Code (now the most popular development tool in the world). She initiated our deep engagement with the Python community, including hiring Python creator Guido van Rossum to Microsoft, and her team now delivers the most widely used Python developer tooling in the world (with VS and VS Code) as well as delivers runtime performance for the broader Python community. She started the OpenJDK effort at Microsoft, which is now used broadly to run Java workloads on Azure. And over the last 9 months she has led our Azure Application Developer PaS and Serverless offerings and has helped drive to make these services great for developers using all languages, tools, and platforms. </p><p>Under Julia's leadership, the Developer Division team has undergone a significant cultural transformation and is guided by consistent cultural values: diversity &amp; inclusion, customer obsession, data-driven, and quality-driven. The pervasiveness of these culture attributes is evident through the success of products like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, which have experienced more than 16x usage growth since 2014 (and are now used by the majority of developers in the world). </p><p>I deeply admire how committed Julia is to team culture, mentorship, and how she helps generate opportunities for others to succeed. She is an avid supporter of MakeCode (which is also built by her team) as an investment to help kids learn programming and pursue computer science in earty education. Julia was one of the first women at Microsoft to be promoted to Corporate Vice President of Engineering leading development teams at Microsoft, and she is a mentor and sponsor to women and men across Microsoft today. She received the Asian American Executive of the Year award in 2013 and was inducted into the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame in 2019. </p><p>Please join me in thanking Julia for the outstanding leadership she provides, and in congratulating her on the well-deserved promotion and expanded remit.</p></blockquote><p>Instead of GitHub reporting directly to Scott Guthrie, GitHub now reports to the person who looks after numerous products within the developer division.

	<span>As the songwriter</span>  of legendary compositions like “Help Me Make It Through the Night,” “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down,” and “Me and Bobby McGee,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/kris-kristofferson/" id="auto-tag_kris-kristofferson" data-tag="kris-kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a> transformed lyrics into literature, elevating the craft to a legitimate American art form in a way few had done before. Part Romantic poet, part folk troubadour, part country-music storyteller, Kristofferson died Saturday at the age of 88.</p>



<p>
	A spokesperson for Kristofferson, Ebie McFarland, confirmed the musician’s death, adding that the “artist, singer, songwriter, actor and activist … passed away peacefully in his home in Maui, Hawaii … surrounded by family.” A cause of death was not immediately available.</p>



<p>
	<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-kris-kristofferson-songs-1235116076/">Songwriting</a> was merely one aspect to the Renaissance man, who was also a Golden Globe-winning actor, Golden Gloves boxer, Rhodes scholar, author, U.S. Army veteran, pilot, and onetime record-label janitor. But it was his penetrating lyricism that caused a seismic shift in the perception of country music by the late Sixties. Well-educated (with a military discipline) though he was, he quickly fell in with the freshman class of “outlaw” singer-songwriters that would buck the star system and influence generations to come.

	</p>




<p>
	The eldest of three children, Kristoffer Kristofferson was born June 22, 1936, in Brownsville, Texas. His father, Lars, the son of a Swedish army veteran, was a pilot and a major general in the U.S. Air Force who went on to work for Pan American Airways. The family moved frequently, settling in San Mateo, California, when Kristofferson was in junior high. A model student who earned the nickname “Straight Arrow,” he graduated from high school in San Mateo in 1954, and went on to study creative writing at Pomona College, winning several prizes in a short-story contest sponsored by <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> magazine. Graduating Phi Beta Kappa in 1958, he received a Rhodes scholarship to England’s Oxford University.

</p>



<p>
	Although intent on becoming a novelist, Kristofferson concentrated his studies on the poetry of William Blake, and penned and performed his first songs while studying at Oxford’s Merton College. In England, he cut his first singles (credited to “Kris Carson”) for Top Rank Records, although they went unreleased at the time. After earning a master’s degree in English literature from Oxford in 1960, Kristofferson, who planned to resume his studies there, flew home to California for Christmas break. Reuniting with an old girlfriend, Fran Beir, the couple married and had a daughter, Tracy, and a son, Kris. Instead of returning to Oxford, Kristofferson enlisted in the Army.

<p>
	Kristofferson served as a helicopter pilot while in the Army and attained the rank of captain. During a three-year tour in West Germany (with his wife and daughter in tow), he organized a band, learning the Bob Dylan songs as recorded by Peter, Paul, and Mary (his band’s Dobro player gave him the folk trio’s LPs). On leave in the spring of 1965, Kristofferson took his first trip to Nashville. He had been tapped for a position teaching English literature at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point after leaving West Germany, but his two weeks in Nashville scuttled that plan. He became enamored of the songwriting circle, befriending songwriter and music publisher Marijohn Wilkin (“The Long Black Veil”), Bobby Bare (“Detroit City”), and producer Cowboy Jack Clement.

	</p>




<p>
	“I came down to Nashville,”&nbsp;Kristofferson <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kris-kristofferson-last-outlaw-poet-ethan-hawke-interview-714098/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> in 2009. “I’d been playing in an Army band, so people introduced me around like I was somebody. Everybody still called me ‘Captain.’ And I wrote seven, maybe 11 songs that first week. I thought if I didn’t make it as a songwriter I would at least get material to be the Great American Novelist. The people and places I was seeing were more exciting than anything I’d ever come across.”</p>



<p>
	Kristofferson and his family settled in Nashville, where he continued to write songs. He took a job as janitor at Columbia Recording Studios (“Emptying ashtrays and sweeping floors,” he <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kris-kristofferson-last-outlaw-poet-ethan-hawke-interview-714098/">described</a> it), in addition to working as a part-time helicopter pilot flying back and forth between offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. A story about how he once landed his helicopter in Johnny Cash’s yard to give the country star his demo tape would become country-music apocrypha.

<p>
	Kristofferson’s marriage to Fran began to crumble, and when their son developed health problems, the couple faced thousands of dollars in medical bills. The financial strain took its toll, and Kristofferson’s wife left with the children to live in California while he continued to pursue music.</p>



<p>
	That career path didn’t sit well with Kristofferson’s mother, who sent him a letter telling him he was throwing his life away by writing songs and idolizing Johnny Cash. Kristofferson and Cash later shared a laugh together when Clement showed Cash that infamous letter. “It’s always great to get a letter from home, isn’t it, Kris?” Cash joked.</p>



<p>
	In 1967, Kristofferson recorded his debut single as a performer, “Golden Idol,” which promptly flopped. His songwriting, however, took off, and his songs landed on the charts via artists like Roy Drusky (“Jody and the Kid”), Billy Walker (“From the Bottle to the Bottom”), Ray Stevens (“Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down”), Jerry Lee Lewis (“Once More With Feeling”), Faron Young (“Your Time’s Comin'”), and Roger Miller (“Me and Bobby McGee,” “Best of All Possible Worlds,” “Darby’s Castle”). By the end of the Sixties, as the folk scene was fading in New York, Kristofferson played the Bitter End in<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/talkin-greenwich-village-book-bob-dylan-blowin-in-the-wind-1235098870/"> Greenwich Village</a>, where luminaries including Bob Dylan saw him perform. Kristofferson was one of Nashville’s most in-demand songwriters, but he was still just getting started.

	</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	In 1969, Carl Perkins gave up a prime opening slot for Cash so that Kristofferson could make his Newport Folk Festival debut, with Cash introducing him. The Man in Black also let him hang around backstage at his weekly ABC show, which was being filmed at Nashville’s Ryman Auditorium. There, Kristofferson mingled with artists and hustled his songwriting demos. By the turn of the decade, a whirlwind of recognition as both a songwriter and artist was underway. Signed by Fred Foster to Monument Records in 1970, Kristofferson released his eponymous LP, which featured new originals as well as some of his familiar hits for other artists. Although a Top 10 chart hit, the LP was otherwise unsuccessful.</p>



<p>
	After his sophomore release, 1971’s <em>The Silver Tongued Devil and I</em>, sold more briskly, Kristofferson’s debut album was rereleased as <em>Me &amp; Bobby McGee</em>, capitalizing on the success of the title song, a posthumous Number One pop hit for Janis Joplin. Kristofferson and Joplin shared her house in Mill Valley, California, for a while, where jam sessions with fellow musicians, actors, and others were commonplace. (He played the Isle of Wight Festival in the summer of 1970, sharing the final day’s bill with Jimi Hendrix, who would die from an overdose just a few weeks later.)</p>



<p>
	In 1970, Ray Price released his countrypolitan recording of Kristofferson’s “For the Good Times,” which helped the composition win the Academy of Country Music’s Song of the Year. Cash’s version of “Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down” secured the Song of the Year award that same year from the Country Music Association. Kristofferson’s double win for Song of the Year in 1970 marked the only time a single individual has ever won the same award from the ACM and CMA in the same year for two different songs.</p>



<p>
	Dozens of artists as diverse as Jerry Lee Lewis, Joe Simon, and Patti Page continued to cut his songs, and Kristofferson would earn several Grammy nominations and win three trophies over his life, including Best Country Song for “Help Me Make It Through the Night” in 1971. A track from his second LP, the nostalgic “Lovin’ Her Was Easier (Than Anything I’ll Ever Do Again)” was a Top Five Adult Contemporary hit, marking his highest chart entry up to that point as a solo artist. The tune also reached the pop Top 30.

<p>
	Simultaneous to his commercial breakthrough in music, Kristofferson made his film debut in Dennis Hopper’s 1971 film <em>The Last Movie</em>. A commercial and critical disaster, it was followed by the lead role in <em>Cisco Pike</em>, which also starred Gene Hackman, Karen Black, and musician Doug Sahm. In 1973, Kristofferson married his second wife, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-kristoffersons-make-it-35828/">singer Rita Coolidge</a>, and the couple had a daughter, Casey. His film work continued with an appearance in Cash’s <em>The Gospel Road: A Story of Jesus</em>, and he played an unemployed musician in <em>Blume in Love</em>. His role as Billy in Sam Peckinpah’s <em>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid</em>, which also starred Bob Dylan, earned Kristofferson a BAFTA award nomination for Most Promising Newcomer. In 1974, he co-starred with Ellen Burstyn in the Oscar-winning <em>Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore</em>, directed by Martin Scorsese.</p>



<p>
	But two of Kristofferson’s most noteworthy early film roles were surrounded by publicity that somewhat obscured his exceptional performances. A controversial <em>Playboy</em> spread with co-star Sarah Miles accompanied the erotic 1976 drama <em>The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea</em>. That same year, he shared the screen with Barbra Streisand in the rock &amp; roll reboot of <em>A Star Is Born</em>. The third-most profitable film of the year, it was nonetheless savaged by critics, with Streisand and Kristofferson’s volatile on-set clashes becoming the stuff of Hollywood legend.</p>



<p>
	By the end of the Seventies, Kristofferson had released nine solo albums with varying critical results. His first two LPs were buoyed by the ubiquity of their material and feature two of the most iconic lines in popular music: “Freedom’s just another word for nothin’ left to lose,” from “Me and Bobby McGee,” and “He’s a walkin’ contradiction, partly truth and partly fiction,” from “The Pilgrim, Chapter 33,” written about some of his comrades, including Cash and Hopper.</p>

<p>
	<em>Border Lord</em>, his third album, was largely a commercial disappointment. His fourth release in a two-and-a-half-year period, <em>Jesus Was a Capricorn</em> surfaced in November 1972, with a title cut that borrowed its melody from John Prine’s “Grandpa Was a Carpenter.” After several failed singles, Kristofferson earned his first — and only — country hit and his bestselling pop single as a solo artist: Inspired by both Larry Gatlin’s “Help Me” and an altar call while visiting a church with country singer Connie Smith at a desperately low point in his life, Kristofferson’s “Why Me” reached Number One on the country chart and spent 19 weeks on the pop survey as well, becoming one of the bestselling singles of the year.

	</p>




<p>
	Between duet albums with his wife Coolidge, Kristofferson released the 1974 LP <em>Spooky Lady’s Sideshow</em>, with several tracks chronicling the trappings of fame and addiction, mirroring his mounting battle with alcohol. He quit drinking after his Golden Globe-winning turn in <em>A Star Is Born</em>.</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Why Me" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DzVycgM8XHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<p>
	Kristofferson’s film career would continue over the next four decades, with Peckinpah directing him again in 1978’s <em>Convoy</em>. His next big-screen role was in 1980’s <em>Heaven’s Gate</em>, one of the most notorious box-office and critical flops of its time. Kristofferson would team with his longtime friend Willie Nelson for the 1984 film <em>Songwriter</em>, but a much more successful venture would emerge the following year as the two pals joined Cash and Waylon Jennings to record and tour as the Highwaymen. The supergroup would record Jimmy Webb’s “Highwayman,” which became Kristofferson’s second and final Number One country hit.</p>



<p>
	Kristofferson’s politically charged 1986 LP, <em>Repossessed</em>, his first solo project in five years, was highlighted by “They Killed Him,” a tribute to Gandhi, Jesus, and Martin Luther King Jr., which Dylan would later cover. Kristofferson continued to raise social awareness and address political causes throughout his career, beginning with a 1972 concert benefiting Cesar Chavez and United Farm Workers. In the Eighties, he traveled to Nicaragua and controversially criticized the U.S. involvement in the Contras’ attempts to overthrow the country’s ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front. His Central American activism inspired the 1990 concept album, <em>Third World Warrior</em>.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>
	“Not everybody agrees with what I’m saying,” Kristofferson told left-leaning magazine <a href="https://www.rosajordan.com/kris.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><em>The Progressive</em></a> in 1991. “But my shows are set up so, from beginning to end, the feeling is a belief in the human spirit. I don’t think you could come and argue with the principles. By the end of the show, the crowds always seem to be on their feet.”</p>



<p>
	Late-career solo albums included <em>A Moment of Forever</em>, in 1995, and <em>The Austin Sessions</em>, a 1999 collection of stripped-down versions of some of his best-known tunes with guest appearances from Alison Krauss, Steve Earle, and Mark Knopfler. These were followed by a trio of reflective LPs: <em>This Old Road</em> (2006), <em>Closer to the Bone</em> (2009), and <em>Feeling Mortal</em> (2013). In 2016, he released <em>The Cedar Creek Sessions</em>, a two-disc collection of his past songs rerecorded in Austin.

	</p>




<p>
	Eric Church, who titled his one-man show after Kristofferson’s song “To Beat the Devil,” <a href="https://x.com/ericchurch/status/1840582759493865726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">praised the songwriter</a> as “the ultimate life well lived” in a social media post. “Thank you for being a beacon of light in a darkening world. You were my hero and my role model. And even then, you managed to exceed my expectations when you became my friend.”</p>



<p>
	“Kris helped me to believe in myself as a songwriter when I was a boy,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://x.com/lukasnelson/status/1840553522703569010?s=19">Lukas Nelson shared</a> on social media, along with a photo of Kristofferson holding him when they “first met” while he was a baby. “Other than my father, he was my greatest inspiration. He embodied humility and kindness, and carried his grace into his words and music with unique eloquence.”</p>



<p>
	“What a great loss, what a great writer. What a great actor, what a great friend,” Dolly Parton said in a statement. “I will always love you.”</p>



<p>
	Of his later films, Kristofferson will perhaps be best remembered for his role as a sadistic sheriff in John Sayles’ 1996 masterful crime drama <em>Lone Star</em>, which was followed by appearances in the <em>Blade</em> trilogy and 1998’s <em>A Soldier’s Daughter Never Cries</em>, a fictionalized account of the life of <em>From Here to Eternity</em> author James Jones. Kristofferson acted in more than 50 films over the next two decades, including <em>Bloodworth</em>, <em>Dolphin Tale</em>, and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-reviews/blaze-movie-review-ethan-hawke-718840/"><em>Blaze</em></a>, director Ethan Hawke’s 2018 biopic of songwriter Blaze Foley that would be Kristofferson’s final onscreen role.</p>



<p>
	But it’s his role in <em>A Star Is Born</em> with which he’s most identified. Following news of his death, Streisand recalled the moment she realized she wanted Kristofferson for the film. “The first time I saw Kris performing at the Troubadour club in L.A. I knew he was something special. Barefoot and strumming his guitar, he seemed like the perfect choice for a script I was developing, which eventually became A Star Is Born,” she<a href="https://x.com/BarbraStreisand/status/1840564305063821406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> wrote</a> on Twitter. “For my latest concert in 2019 at London’s Hyde Park, I asked Kris to join me on-stage to sing our other A Star Is Born duet, ‘Lost Inside Of You.’ He was as charming as ever, and the audience showered him with applause. It was a joy seeing him receive the recognition and love he so richly deserved.”</p>



<p>
	Kristofferson quietly announced his <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/kris-kristofferson-retired-final-concert-1120051/">retirement</a> from touring, recording, and acting in January 2021.

	</p>




<p>
	In 1970, he bought property in Hana, a secluded town on the Hawaiian island of Maui. In addition to his three older children, Kristofferson raised five children with his third wife, Lisa Meyers. As Kristofferson began suffering from memory loss later in his life (which he ultimately attributed to Lyme disease), Meyers became indispensable, traveling with her husband and helping him navigate interviews. When he was saluted with an all-star concert in 2017 as the guest performer on the 2020 Outlaw Country Cruise (his final full performance), Meyers was by his side. She balked at calling herself Kristofferson’s manager though. “He’s unmanageable. You can’t manage him,” she <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/kris-kristofferson-an-outlaw-at-80-183141/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>. “Even if someone tells him to have a good day, he’ll say, ‘Don’t tell me what to do.'”

<p>
	But that stubborn streak also helped Kristofferson achieve such artistic heights. He was uncompromising in his songwriting, his acting, and onstage, where he’d strum his guitar, play harmonica, and sing in his infamously craggy voice. “I don’t think I’m that good a singer,” he told&nbsp;<em>Rolling Stone</em>. “I can’t think of a song that I’ve written that I don’t like the way somebody else sings it better.”</p>



<p>
	Still, for all his trailblazing, he was also content to allow fate and his spirituality to guide him. “I really have no anxiety about controlling my own life,” Kristofferson <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/kris-kristofferson-an-outlaw-at-80-183141/">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a> in 2016. “Somehow I just slipped into it and it’s worked. It’s not up to me — or you. I feel very lucky that [life]’s lasted so long because I’ve done so many things that could have knocked me out of it. But somehow I just always have the feeling that He knows what He’s doing.”</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Goals</h2><a id="user-content-goals" aria-label="Permalink: Goals" href="#goals"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing is a <strong>continuous file synchronization program</strong>. It synchronizes
files between two or more computers. We strive to fulfill the goals below.
The goals are listed in order of importance, the most important ones first.
This is the summary version of the goal list - for more
commentary, see the full <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/GOALS.md">Goals document</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing should be:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Safe From Data Loss</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Protecting the user's data is paramount. We take every reasonable
precaution to avoid corrupting the user's files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Secure Against Attackers</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Again, protecting the user's data is paramount. Regardless of our other
goals, we must never allow the user's data to be susceptible to
eavesdropping or modification by unauthorized parties.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Easy to Use</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing should be approachable, understandable, and inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Automatic</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">User interaction should be required only when absolutely necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Universally Available</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing should run on every common computer. We are mindful that the
latest technology is not always available to every individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>For Individuals</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Syncthing is primarily about empowering the individual user with safe,
secure, and easy to use file synchronization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Everything Else</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">There are many things we care about that don't make it on to the list. It
is fine to optimize for these values, as long as they are not in conflict
with the stated goals above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Getting Started</h2><a id="user-content-getting-started" aria-label="Permalink: Getting Started" href="#getting-started"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Take a look at the <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/intro/getting-started.html" rel="nofollow">getting started guide</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">There are a few examples for keeping Syncthing running in the background
on your system in <a href="https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/main/etc">the etc directory</a>. There are also several <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/users/contrib.html#gui-wrappers" rel="nofollow">GUI
implementations</a> for Windows, Mac, and Linux.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Docker</h2><a id="user-content-docker" aria-label="Permalink: Docker" href="#docker"></a></p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building</h2><a id="user-content-building" aria-label="Permalink: Building" href="#building"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Building Syncthing from source is easy. After extracting the source bundle from
a release or checking out git, you just need to run <code>go run build.go</code> and the
binaries are created in <code>./bin</code>. There's <a href="https://docs.syncthing.net/dev/building.html" rel="nofollow">a guide</a> with more details on the
build process.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Signed Releases</h2><a id="user-content-signed-releases" aria-label="Permalink: Signed Releases" href="#signed-releases"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">As of v0.10.15 and onwards, release binaries are GPG signed with the key
D26E6ED000654A3E, available from <a href="https://syncthing.net/security/" rel="nofollow">https://syncthing.net/security/</a> and
most key servers.</p>
<p dir="auto">There is also a built-in automatic upgrade mechanism (disabled in some
distribution channels) which uses a compiled in ECDSA signature. macOS
binaries are also properly code signed.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Documentation</h2><a id="user-content-documentation" aria-label="Permalink: Documentation" href="#documentation"></a></p>

It's based around signed distance functions, which are a way to represent 3D shapes as, well, functions, and you can do a lot of like weird mathematical distortions and operations that give you cool new shapes. Like average two shapes together, or take the modulo of space to infinitely repeat something... it's a really fun and powerful way to make certain kinds of shapes.</p><p>SDFs are very cool in general, and widely used in the generative art communities, but kinda hard to wrangle when you're writing shader code directly. They really are <i>functions</i>, but GLSL doesn't support first-class functions, so if you want to compose shapes you have to manually plumb a bunch of arguments around. So Bauble is essentially a high-level GLSL compiler that lets you model SDFs as first-class values, and as a result you can make a pretty cool 3D shape in just a few lines of code. And then 3D print them!</p><p>I need to do some actual work to promote and publicize it once I'm done with the documentation and implement a few more primitives, but it's very close!</p><p>The docs have lots of examples of the sorts of things you can do with SDFs: <a href="https://bauble.studio/help/" rel="nofollow">https://bauble.studio/help/</a></p><p>And for examples of some "art" that I've made with it recently:</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ianthehenry/status/1839061056301445451" rel="nofollow">https://x.com/ianthehenry/status/1839061056301445451</a>

I covered the outside with thick foam panels cut to size, cementing them in place with copious amounts of spray foam. I shaved the outside to a nice shape with a sawzall and the inside I covered in chicken-fenced, then attached a painters tarp to that (so it could be painted on).</p><p>To fit on a trailer (the mushroom's cap is 11.5ft wide) the cap comes off the stem and the edges of the cap are two half-moons which have fixed mounting points where threaded rod sticks through some welded washers, and a nut is put on in place. I was too last minute to install the 200 WS2811 pixels and have them run some cool patterns, before the music festival I brought it to came time, but even just a lantern on top (another painters tarp covered the cap's metal-frame, and everything was spray painted) looked great.</p><p>Super fun project. Expensive, but I learned a lot, got to be creative, and I'm happy to try out new things and make the best of my before-children time. Also, it was such a joy seeing people croud around the mushroom (and site beside the mushroom man inside) at night during the festival.</p></div></td></tr>

This project was a response to the lack of systematic review in my college's STEM classes. I would practice a lot, but forget how to approach certain problems on exams. The hope is to have a digital space where I can be reasonably productive in solving practice problems, but also lets me easily integrate with SRS tools.</p><p>I wish educators and educational institutions would make an attempt to incorporate SRS into classes.

                  <p>Getting my historical fiction novel published. I finished writing it a couple of months back. Extremely short plot summary: guy deserts from the Roman XI legion, goes back home only to find that his entire province is about to revolt against the Roman Empire at the height of its power. It's one of the most spectacular feats of collective self-immolation in human history and it had a large effect on human history.
I think not enough has been written about the role of abject stupidity in human affairs. This book is an attempt to correct that.</p>

This is a form of Machine Learning, where you want to learn a supervised predictor but you don't have labels to start with, and labeling comes at a cost that you need to account for (the term AL can have broader connotations but this is the popular one). We feel the area suffers quite a bit from poor benchmarks, which my colleague and I wrote up about in a paper [2]. To run the many experiments in the paper we had to write a fairly comprehensive codebase that makes it convenient to swap out different bits and pieces of an AL pipeline, which we'll be polishing up now.</p><p>PS: If the work is of interest and you want to avoid reading the paper, I have a blogpost too [3].</p><p>[1] <a href="https://github.com/ThuongTNguyen/active_learning_comparisons">https://github.com/ThuongTNguyen/active_learning_comparisons</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15744" rel="nofollow">https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15744</a> (this was accepted in EMNLP'24)</p><p>[3] <a href="https://blog.quipu-strands.com/inactive_learning" rel="nofollow">https://blog.quipu-strands.com/inactive_learning</a></p></div></td></tr>

I can confidently say it works great on small things - for small changes on small files the AST approach works pretty well. You can say things like "add a click listener to the button that calls a function to tally the user's score" to a simple game and it will do it. That is, less than a minute after typing the prompt, you will see the code update in the editor and see your preview-webview update with your changes applied.</p><p>However, I have noticed that the AST code quality heavily depends on how common it is in the training set. I think I will have to add documentation to it through RAG or something - because OpenAI's models that I'm using seem to have limited experience writing esprima for JavaScript for example.</p><p>So it's hit or miss. In some cases I do feel like I'm throwing stupid compute at solving small problems and it's unnecessary - however, as I work on the project, it is getting better and better at successfully making the modifications. Some of that is me improving the prompts, some of it is OpenAI improving the models themselves, and some of it is the infrastructure I'm building for the project itself.</p><p>I did notice a huge improvement when o1-mini released. It is dramatically better at writing the AST code than GPT-4o or 4o-mini. I haven't tried Claude 3.5 yet but I've been hearing it does an exceptional job at code writing - not sure about my AST requirements though!</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="content:encoded"><p dir="ltr">Hi there. I’m Bill “LtRandolph” Clark, and I’m the engineering manager for the Champions team on <em>LoL</em>. I’ve worked on several different teams on <em>League</em> over the past years, but one focus has been consistent: I’m obsessed with tech debt. I want to find it, I want to understand it, and where possible, I want to fix it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When engineers talk about any existing piece of technology - for example <em>League of Legends</em> <a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/patch/patch-84-notes" target="_blank">patch 8.4</a> - we often talk about tech debt. I define tech debt as code or data that future developers will pay a cost for. Countless blog posts, articles, and definitions have been written about this scourge of software development. This post will focus on types of tech debt I’ve seen during my time working at Riot, and a model for discussing it that we’re starting to use internally. If you only take away one lesson from this article, I hope you remember the “contagion” metric discussed below.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_sebastian_final.png"></p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Metrics</h2>
<p dir="ltr">In order to make good decisions about what problems to fix <em>now</em> and what to fix <em>eventually</em> (or, realistically, never), we need a way to measure a particular piece of tech debt. I’ve identified 3 major axes to evaluate on: impact, fix cost, and contagion.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Impact</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_1_Impact.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The first axis is the most obvious: the impact of the debt. This takes the form of player-facing issues (bugs, missing features, unexpected behavior), and developer-facing issues (slower implementation, workflow issues, random useless shit to remember). It’s worth noting that “developer” in this case can be anyone of any discipline. Some tech debt gets in the way of engineers writing new code, some blocks designers creating new scripts, some interferes with VFX artists making new particles, etc.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Fix Cost</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_2_Fix_Cost.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The second axis has to do with the cost to fix the tech debt. If we decide to fix an issue in our code or data, it will require someone’s measurable time to fix. If it’s a deeply rooted assumption that affects every line of code in the game, it may take weeks or months of engineering time. If it’s a dumb error in a single function, it may be fixable in a matter of minutes. Regardless of the time to implement a fix, though, we also must consider the risk of actually deploying that fix. Even a system I consider “wrong” can still be used as a tool to make a great game. If I change the way our scripting engine handles errors, or how particles compute their spawn time, that could break any of the 500+ spells on 140+ champions in the game.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">Contagion</h3>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_3_Contagion.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">The third axis is something I’ve become obsessed with: contagion. If this tech debt is allowed to continue to exist, how much will it spread? That spreading can result from other systems interfacing with the afflicted system, from copy-pasting data built on top of the system, or from influencing the way other engineers will choose to implement new features.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If a piece of tech debt is well-contained, the cost to fix it later compared to now is basically identical. You can weigh how much impact it has today when determining when a fix makes sense. If, on the other hand, a piece of tech debt is highly contagious, it will steadily become harder and harder to fix. What’s particularly gross about contagious tech debt is that its impact tends to increase as more and more systems become infected by the technical compromise at its core.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Types of Debt</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Now that we have a framework for measuring a particular piece of tech debt, let’s talk about some broad categories of tech debt that I’ve seen on<em> League of Legends</em>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Local Debt</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Local debt resembles the classic “black box” model of programming. As far as the rest of the game is concerned, the local system (spell, network layer, script engine) works pretty reliably. No one needs to keep the debt in mind as they develop around the system. But if anyone opens the lid and looks inside, they’ll be horrified, disgusted, or completely confused by what they see.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_4_Eyeball.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">You can find a couple real world examples of local debt in your eyes. Due to how the eye is constructed, you see things upside down. More significantly, the retinal nerve creates a blind spot near the middle of each eye. This malformed data is sent to the visual centers of the brain, which must flip the image and fill the blind spots so the rest of the brain can interact with the “correct” image. These oddities are localized to the eye/optic nerve system and easily avoided by other systems, so they’re “good enough.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="" src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/A%20Taxonomy%20of%20Tech%20Debt%20Alt%20Header.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the most famous instances of local debt in <em>League of Legends</em> is Jarvan’s Cataclysm, which is made of minions to this day. When designers need to attach gameplay effects to a location (or a set of locations), one of the tools available to them is the ability to spawn an “invisible minion.” RiotXypherous describes what I mean by “minion” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3t0d0x/ward_debris_is_coded_as_minions_and_it_counts/cx2ilvf/" target="_blank">here</a>. These game objects are a stable and well-understood way to track and execute scripted logic. In cases like Jarvan’s wall, you need to spawn a high number of minions (24 to be precise) to make sure that no one can squeeze through the wall. An alternate solution could be a ring-terrain construct consisting of a single logical piece controlling the pathability of Cataclysm. If we took this approach, we could clean up the logic and slightly reduce computation cost. Let’s take a look at cataclysm using our impact, fix cost, and contagion model to see why a fix isn’t currently the best option.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Cataclysm Metrics</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_6_Cataclysm_Metrics.png"></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impact: 1 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Back when there were 12 minions, people would occasionally squeak through the wall, so Riot Exgeniar bumped it to 24. The fact that the wall is made of minions pretty much never influences any other developer as they make new content. (As an aside, the infamous “<a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/FlaccidEncouragingCamelSSSsss" target="_blank">Jarvan Ult Hitch</a>” was due to the confluence between this debt and a loading bug from trying to read missing auto-attack definitions.)</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fix cost: 2 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We don’t currently have the ability to composite shapes to create custom geometry without new code. If we wanted to create a ring shape to do an “area trigger” to more efficiently enforce Jarvan’s barrier, we would have to write some bespoke math to calculate collisions with a ring. We’re exploring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry" target="_blank">Constructive Solid Geometry</a> for other purposes, which may cataclysmically reduce the cost to fix.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contagion: 1 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">No one needs to take the implementation of Jarvan’s wall into account when developing features, which keeps it well contained. The one risk of contagion is other designers copy/pasting the implementation into their new champions (which has happened here and there). But as far as implementation problems go, the potential spread of Cataclysm is low and well understood.</p>
<p dir="ltr">This is a pretty typical shape for local debt. In general, local debt is defined by a low contagion score. If the impact is higher than the cost to fix, it tends to get fixed by a good citizen before too long.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When considering whether to fix local debt, first ask yourself if it’s worth it. If the debt is truly not contagious, it should be safe to leave alone for as long as necessary. One of the biggest mistakes I observe is an instinct to jump on local debt that itches an engineer’s perfectionist side when it doesn’t have a broad enough impact to warrant the effort. If you do decide to make a fix, it’s usually easy to confirm the fix and regression test, due to the locality of the change.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Some recent examples of local debt that has been fixed include bugs with inhibitors causing champions to path towards 0,0,0 in certain circumstances, Janna’s Monsoon ignoring spell shields, and Tear of the Goddess stacking on manaless casts.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">MacGyver Debt</h2>
<p dir="ltr">MacGyver debt is named after the TV show from the mid 80s. Angus MacGyver would solve problems using his swiss army knife, duct tape, and whatever else was on hand.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_7_MacGyver.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">His solutions often involved attaching two unlikely pieces; in the context of tech debt, this means two conflicting systems are “duct-taped” together at their interface points throughout the codebase.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_8_City_Planning.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Seattle (among other cities) has a dramatic example of MacGyver debt as you can see above. The city used to have two competing settlements, each with its own grid. When those settlements grew into the modern Emerald City, the slightly different grids were mushed together, resulting in awkwardly shaped blocks and buildings and a less-than-efficient use of space. I’m particularly amused by the little shaved-off corner of the building in the bottom left.</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the best examples of MacGyver debt in the <em>LoL</em> codebase is the use of C++’s std::string vs. our custom AString class. Both are ways to store, modify, and pass around strings of characters. In general, we’ve found that std::string leads to lots of “hidden” memory allocations and performance costs, and makes it easy to write code that does bad things. AString is specifically designed with thoughtful memory management in mind. Our strategy for replacing std::string with AString was to allow both to exist in the codebase and provide conversions between the two (via .c_str() and .Get() respectively). We gave AString a number of ease-of-use improvements that make it easier to work with and encouraged engineers to replace std::string at their leisure as they change code. Thus, we’re slowly phasing std::string out and the “duct tape” interface between the two systems slowly shrinks as we tidy up more of our code.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">std::string vs AString Metrics</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_9_STD_String_Metrics.png"></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impact: 2 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Most of the high-impact allocations from std::string have been phased out via <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/profiling-measurement-and-analysis" target="_blank">profiling</a>, so at this point, the main cost is the small mental switching cost to convert from one system to the other.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fix cost: 3 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The conversion to AString isn’t just a find-and-replace. There are a few flavors of AString for different purposes (AStackString for initial allocation in stack memory, ARefString for references to static strings, in addition to heap-allocated base AString). A real, thinking human needs to look at a replacement site to do it right. It will be a long, slow process to phase out the old system.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contagion: -2 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">By making AString easier to work with than std::string, we’ve actually managed to flip contagion to our side. Every time an engineer checks in a change to game code, there’s a chance that AString has spread further, like a virus.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The biggest cost to most MacGyver debt tends to be the intellectual cost of switching modes when crossing boundaries. If some bug or feature is held back by being on the “wrong” system, a targeted move to the “right” system tends to be straightforward. The relative contagion of the new system vs. the old system is the key metric to keep an eye out for. If you can flip that balance to favor the new system, then the better system will inevitably win.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When considering whether to fix MacGyver debt, try to find ways to make the (global) better system more desirable at a local level. If a time-pressured engineer making greedy optimizations during their day to day work chooses to move towards the desired end state, then you’re well on your way.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The other approach that can work is to do brute-force large-scale refactors. Depending on how closely the systems map, it may be possible to fix some or all of your MacGyver debt via clever regexes.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Foundational Debt</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Foundational debt is when some assumption lies deep in the heart of your system and has been baked into the way the entire thing works. Foundational debt is sometimes hard to recognize for experienced users of a system because it’s seen as “just the way it is.”</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_10_Imperial_Measurements.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">A hilariously stupid piece of real world foundational debt is the measurement system referred to as United States Customary Units. Having grown up in the US, my brain is filled with useless conversions, like that 5,280 feet are in a mile, and 2 pints are in a quart, while 4 quarts are in a gallon. The US government has considered switching to metric multiple times, but we remain one of seven countries that haven’t adopted Système International as the official measurement system. This debt is baked into road signs, recipes, elementary schools, and human minds.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We’ve talked about several of the big pieces of foundational debt that Riot has been tackling in previous Tech Blog articles like <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/determinism-league-legends-introduction" target="_blank">Determinism in League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/game-data-server" target="_blank">Game Data Server</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_11_Blockbuilder.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">Another example of foundational debt that I think about a lot is our use of the lua scripting language. Designers on <em>League </em>use a tool called BlockBuilder to create complex behaviors by stringing together blocks of functionality like getting the distance between points, spawning minions, dealing damage, or doing all manner of script flow control. The set of operations designers choose from is varied but limited, and the parameters for each operation are constrained. Yet long long ago, in the prehistory of <em>League of Legends</em>, the decision was made not to store the blocks and parameters in a simple, constrained format that matches the data. Instead they’re stored as arrays and tables in the powerful, beautiful, and entirely-too-complex-for-this-purpose lua language. A decade or so of game development took place upon that foundation since we made the decision and now manipulating lua objects is one of the most common operations in the engine.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">BlockBuilder Lua Metrics</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_12_Lua_Metrics.png"></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impact: 4 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The mismatch between lua and this problem space has many costs. Every callstack is polluted with ~6 marshalling stack frames for each frame of BlockBuilder logic. Those marshalling operations are not cheap in terms of server CPU usage. Reading diffs of script changes is needlessly difficult. Parsing/searching script files to determine functionality requires a fairly in-depth understanding of the lua language.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fix cost: 4 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Since lua is so deeply embedded into the engine, digging it out would be difficult. A current proposal is to create a wrapper class that behaves like the lua objects, but is a much simpler struct under the hood, so we can steadily morph our scripting innards into something more suitable. But any way we approach it, we’ll need to be careful and thoughtful.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contagion: 4 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Every time a system bumps up against scripting (which is the core unit of logic for <em>LoL</em>), that system will be shaped by the operations and requirements of the lua backend. We average a new Building Block every ~3-4 days, each of which directly manipulates lua objects. The longer we don’t replace lua, the harder it becomes to replace lua.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Foundational debt tends to index highly on all three axes. The high cost encourages sticking with the janky system, which is often the right call, but the high impact and high contagion mean that fixing egregious foundational debt can have a huge payoff.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The most common strategy for fixing foundational debt that I’ve observed at Riot is to stand up the new system alongside the old one. If possible, I recommend then converting the foundational debt to MacGyver debt by slowly porting systems over to using the new system with conversion operations available to cross between new and old. This allows you to start reaping the benefits in targeted areas easily while limiting exposure to risk. Sometimes such a conversion isn’t possible, though. In that case, creating a compile time (or if possible, loading time) switch can help build confidence in the new system without forcing you to go all-in. The former is in use for the <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/game-data-server" target="_blank">GDS</a> conversion, and the latter worked for <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/determinism-league-legends-introduction" target="_blank">Determinism</a>.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Data Debt</h2>
<p dir="ltr">Data debt starts with a piece of tech debt from one of the other categories. Perhaps it’s a bug in the scripting system, a less-than-desirable file format for items, or two systems that don’t play very well with each other. But then a <em>ton</em> of content (art, scripts, sounds, etc.) gets built on top of that code deficiency. Before too long, fixing the initial tech debt becomes extremely risky and it becomes painfully hard to tell what you’ll break if you try to fix anything.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_13_Data_Debt.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">My favorite real world example for understanding data debt is DNA. The genome of an organism is slowly built up over millions of years through lossy copies (mutations), transcription errors, and evolutionary pressure. Some copy errors are useless but benign, others are harmful, and others confer powerful advantages. Attempting to figure out what any piece of DNA <em>actually does</em> is incredibly difficult. We fully understand what the base pairs mean, and how sets of base pairs translate into amino acids for protein construction. We are even starting to understand more about some non-encoding roles that DNA can play. But in the 3 billion plus base pairs of the human genome, there’s still so much we don’t even remotely understand. <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/update-crispr/" target="_blank">Radiolab’s episode about CRISPR</a> highlights one such puzzle that was recently cracked.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Data debt on <em>League of Legends</em> is most impactful when it turns an otherwise trivial fix into a grueling ordeal. I will share one tiny example, but trust me: data debt is one of the most crucial considerations when making changes to the <em>LoL</em> engine. Our game engineers develop deep knowledge of how game systems were implemented and become quite skilled at predicting what data may break when they change some piece of code.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_14_Spell_Params.png"></p>
<p dir="ltr">A memorable piece of data debt that we fixed a few years ago involved block parameters in our BlockBuilder scripting language. Above, you can see a toy example where I try to increase Owner’s armor by a variable plus a constant. I would expect Owner to receive 25 bonus armor: 20 from the variable Delta, which is passed into the block, and 5 from the constant. Since the variable’s name matches the parameter name, however, this used to yield 40. (Don’t even ask me why it wouldn’t yield 45; I have no idea what thought process led to the early-out.)</p>
<p dir="ltr">When NoopMoney, an engineer on Champions team, went to fix this nonsensical behavior, all he had to do was delete 4 lines of code. But with a highly contagious piece of debt like this, even a small change requires thorough planning. Any of 400,000 lines of script in <em>LoL</em> might have any of their numerical parameters being doubled by this bug. What’s worse, those scripts are “behaving correctly” in that the game is balanced and tuned around those potentially doubled values. NoopMoney had to make the fix toggleable on Live (in case we had any unexpected bugs come up) in addition to doing extensive regex searching and QA sweeps to try to identify which scripts might rely on this bug to function properly. In the end, the problems from fixing this bug were fairly minor; a small handful of champions needed their scripts altered. But the data debt made it difficult to predict.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Parameter Naming Bug Metrics</h2>
<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://technology.riotgames.com/sites/default/files/Taxonomy_15_Param_Naming_Metrics.png"></p>
<h3 dir="ltr">1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impact: 2 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This bug’s impact was small when it occurred. It doubled a passed-in value, and potentially discarded a constant. But it became just yet another bit of otherwise useless tribal knowledge that designers and engineers needed to carry around (once they became aware of it). Developer mindshare is a valuable resource to be wasted like this.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fix cost: 2 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">All told, the fix was straightforward. By creating a live feature toggle, we were able to increase our confidence in the safety of the fix. The most expensive part was the initial screening to try to evaluate the scope of the problem in order to target testing.</p>
<h3 dir="ltr">3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contagion: 4 / 5</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The unfortunate thing about this bug was that it preyed on an extremely logical behavior. If, for example, you want to deal damage to a unit, saving the value in a variable called “Damage” is totally logical. Sadly, though, the ApplyDamage block took in the amount in a parameter of the same name, thus triggering the bug. Then, if someone else wants to make a similar spell, they’d copy/paste your blocks and carry on, thus spreading the bug even farther.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In general, data debt indexes high on cost to fix since it makes changes hard to evaluate. More worryingly, it’s almost always extraordinarily contagious due to a few properties of data (as opposed to code). First, it’s generally acceptable to create a new piece of data with a copy/paste of an existing piece of data. If you’re making a new skillshot spell, starting with Ezreal’s Mystic Shot can save you tons of time. Any issues with an existing piece of data are propagated out to its descendents. Second, data is rarely subjected to technical review akin to code reviews. This makes it difficult to notice and halt the spread of bad practices even if they’re widely known. Finally, fixing any issue in the data typically requires a human being with eyes and a brain to verify - a compiler and formal logic won’t cut it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">When fixing data debt, I’ve observed two main approaches. The first I call the “do it right checkbox.” This means making a toggle between the old “broken” behavior and the new “fixed” behavior for data creators. Ideally, you make the fixed version default while you make sure old content uses the broken version. Then, like with MacGyver debt, you can do a slow and steady replacement to get things onto the new version. This has a permanent cost of adding more and more crap to your editing UI.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The second approach is the “just fix the damn thing” approach, like NoopMoney used on the parameter naming bug. This means fixing the bug and then trying to repair all the data that’s meaningfully affected. Several techniques can make this less terrifying. First is doing a lot of greps and regex searching to try to understand the theoretical impact. Second is a bunch of targeted testing. Finally, you can prepare a toggle to enable reverting to the old behavior once the fix ships in case you missed something worse than the bug you’re fixing. It’s worth noting that <a href="https://engineering.riotgames.com/news/determinism-league-legends-introduction" target="_blank">Determinism</a> helps us a lot with testing for these types of changes by letting us confirm that the server produces the same results before and after a change.</p>
<h2 dir="ltr">Summary</h2>
<p dir="ltr">When measuring a piece of tech debt, you can use impact (to customers and to developers), fix cost (time and risk), and contagion. I believe most developers regularly consider impact and fix cost, while I’ve rarely encountered discussions of contagion. Contagion can be a developer’s worst enemy as a problem burrows in and becomes harder and harder to dislodge. It is possible, however, to turn contagion into a weapon by making your fix more contagious than the problem.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Working on <em>League</em>, most of the tech debt I’ve seen falls into one of the 4 categories I’ve presented here. Local debt, like a black box of gross. MacGyver debt, where 2 or more systems are duct-taped together with conversion functions. Foundational debt, when the entire structure is built on some unfortunate assumptions. Data debt, when enormous quantities of data are piled on some other type of debt, making it risky and time-consuming to fix.</p>

<p>On Thursday, some links to the notorious shadow library Library Genesis (Libgen) couldn't be reached after a US district court judge, Colleen McMahon, <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cengage-v-LibGen-Default-Judgment-9-24-24.pdf">ordered</a> what TorrentFreak <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/u-s-court-orders-libgen-to-pay-30m-to-publishers-issues-broad-injunction-240925/">called</a> "one of the broadest anti-piracy injunctions" ever issued by a US court.</p>
<p>In her order, McMahon sided with textbook publishers who <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/most-notorious-illegal-shadow-library-sued-by-textbook-publishers/">accused Libgen of willful copyright infringement</a> after Libgen completely ignored their complaint.</p>
<p>To compensate rightsholders, McMahon ordered Libgen to pay $30 million, but because nobody knows who runs the shadow library, it seems unlikely that publishers will be paid any time soon, if ever.</p>
<p>Because Libgen's admins remain anonymous and elusive—and previously avoided paying <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/scientific-research-piracy-site-hit-with-15-million-fine/">a different set of publishers $15 million</a> in 2017—McMahon granted publishers' request for an uncommonly broad injunction that may empower publishers to go further than ever to destroy the shadow library.</p>
<p>Under the injunction, not only is Libgen banned from sharing copyrighted content, but so are "all those in active concert or participation with" anyone connected to Libgen. The order forbids anyone from hosting Libgen, registering Libgen domains, or providing cloud storage, file-sharing, or advertising services, among other restrictions. Even using tools to display links or enabling browser extensions linking to Libgen is forbidden under the order.</p>
<p>But even under such a broad injunction, the question remains whether publishers can succeed in taking down Libgen—which <a href="https://www.roundonce.com/the-folks-behind-libgen/">openly informs users</a> that using its platform violates copyright laws and encourages them to pirate books anyway.</p>
<p>"It is illegal to download ('make copies of') material that is protected by copyright," Libgen's 2023 video said. "However, all that is illegal is not criminal… for the average person, generally there won't be any criminal consequences under copyright law from having pirated items on your computer."</p>
<p>Publishers are potentially already succeeding in taking down some of Libgen's links that enable vast infringement. Yesterday, TorrentFreak reported that none of the Libgen sites targeted in publishers' complaint were down, but as of Thursday, some links couldn't be reached, timed out while loading, or generated a 403 error denying access. The majority of links, including the primary domain, remain online, though.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>As TorrentFreak noted, it's possible that most of the Libgen links remain online because the order is just two days old. In the order, McMahon gave registrars of LinkedIn domains 21 business days to either transfer domains to publishers' control or "otherwise implement technical measures, such as holding, suspending, or canceling the domain name to ensure the domain names cannot be used" for further copyright infringement.</p>
<p>TorrentFreak suggested that "completely eliminating" Libgen has been "extremely difficult" for years, though, "partly because the identities of those running it remains unknown." The site, known for closely monitoring file-sharing online, only considered publishers' most recent victory "a win on paper."</p>
<p>Notably, the broad injunction that McMahon ordered does not require Internet service providers to block Libgen, although other countries have tried that, too. Instead, publishers seem to be hoping that controlling domains will get rid of the pirate library, with the court ordering any newly registered domains to be turned over to publishers, too.</p>
<p>Targeting future domains could stop Libgen from endlessly pointing users to new links to avoid takedowns, as it has historically. But there's a chance that third parties may resist complying with the order, TorrentFreak noted.</p>
<h2>Ad ban may be key to Libgen’s destruction</h2>
<p>So far at least, Libgen remains online through it all, attracting 16 million monthly visits to its primary domain, which Ars confirmed is still online as of this writing. And it's still exceedingly popular in the US, McMahon's order noted.</p>
<p>In 2023, the shadow library <a href="https://www.roundonce.com/the-folks-behind-libgen/">told</a> users that it remains indestructible by relying on "thousands of volunteers worldwide who upload files and share the torrents to protect the shadow library from being taken down."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most significant aspect of the order isn't the focus on domain registration, though, but a ban on providing advertising services.</p>
<p>Last year, Libgen also <a href="https://www.roundonce.com/questions-and-answers-about-ebooks/">told</a> users that it's primarily funded through Google advertising. In the video, Libgen was warning users that while admins are difficult to unmask, "Google gets informed of every download, and if a user has ever registered with Google, then Google knows exactly who they are, what they've downloaded, and when they downloaded it."</p>
<p>If Google cuts off Libgen's advertising, the site could potentially struggle to afford to continue operating.</p>
<p>Ars attempted to reach Libgen for comment, but Libgen's inbox was full. Ars will update this story if Google provides any new insights.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-staff-report-finds-large-social-media-video-streaming-companies-have-engaged-vast-surveillance"><span>new Federal Trade Commission (FTC) report</span></a><span> confirms what EFF has been warning about for years: tech giants are widely harvesting and sharing your personal information to fuel their online behavioral advertising businesses. This four-year investigation into the data practices of nine social media and video platforms, including Facebook, YouTube, and X (formally Twitter), demonstrates how commercial surveillance leaves consumers with little control over their privacy. While not every investigated company committed the same privacy violations, the conclusion is clear: companies prioritized profits over privacy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While EFF has long warned about these practices, the FTC’s investigation offers detailed evidence of how widespread and invasive commercial surveillance has become. Here are key takeaways from the report:</span></p>
<h3>Companies Collected Personal Data Well Beyond Consumer Expectations</h3>
<p><span>The FTC report confirms that companies collect data in ways that far exceed user expectations. They’re not just tracking activity on their platforms, but also monitoring activity on other websites and apps, gathering data on non-users, and buying personal information from third-party data brokers. Some companies could not, or would not, disclose exactly where their user data came from.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FTC found companies gathering detailed personal information, such as the websites you visit, your location data, your demographic information, and your interests, including sensitive interests like “divorce support” and “beer and spirits.” Some companies could only report high-level descriptions of the user attributes they tracked, while others produced spreadsheets with thousands of attributes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>There’s Unfettered Data Sharing With Third Parties</h3>
<p><span>Once companies collect your personal information, they don’t always keep it to themselves. Most companies reported sharing your personal information with third parties. Some companies shared so widely that they claimed it was impossible to provide a list of all third-party entities they had shared personal information with. For the companies that could identify recipients, the lists included law enforcement and other companies, both inside and outside the United States.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alarmingly, most companies had no vetting process for third parties before sharing your data, and none conducted ongoing checks to ensure compliance with data use restrictions. For example, when companies say they’re just sharing your personal information for something that seems unintrusive, like analytics, there's no guarantee your data is only used for the stated purpose. The lack of safeguards around data sharing exposes consumers to </span><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/07/catholic-priest-grindr-data-privacy.html"><span>significant</span></a> <a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-reveals-phone-data-used-to-target-abortion-misinformation-at-visitors-to-hundreds-of-reproductive-health-clinics"><span>privacy</span></a> <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3619515-ftc-alleges-data-broker-exposes-users-to-violent-threats-by-selling-location-data/"><span>risks</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<h3>Consumers Are Left in the Dark</h3>
<p><span>The FTC report reveals a disturbing lack of transparency surrounding how personal data is collected, shared, and used by these companies. If companies can’t tell the FTC who they share data with, how can you expect them to be honest with you?</span></p>
<p><span>Data tracking and sharing happens behind the scenes, leaving users largely unaware of how much privacy they’re giving up on different platforms. These companies don't just collect data from their own platforms—they gather information about non-users and from users' activity across the web. This makes it nearly impossible for individuals to avoid having their personal data swept up into these vast digital surveillance networks. Even when companies offer privacy controls, the controls are often opaque or ineffective. The FTC also found that some companies were not actually deleting user data in response to deletion requests.</span></p>
<p><span>The scale and secrecy of commercial surveillance described by the FTC demonstrates why the burden of protecting privacy can’t fall solely on individual consumers.</span></p>
<h3>Surveillance Advertising Business Models Are the Root Cause</h3>
<p><span>The FTC report underscores a fundamental issue: these privacy violations are not just occasional missteps—they’re inherent to the business model of online behavioral advertising. Companies collect vast amounts of data to create detailed user profiles, primarily for targeted advertising. The profits generated from targeting ads based on personal information drive companies to develop increasingly invasive methods of data collection. The FTC found that the business models of most of the companies incentivized privacy violations.</span></p>
<h3>FTC Report Underscores Urgent Need for Legislative Action</h3>
<p><span>Without federal privacy legislation, companies have been able to collect and share billions of users’ personal data with few safeguards. The FTC report confirms that self-regulation has failed: companies’ internal data privacy policies are inconsistent and inadequate, allowing them to prioritize profits over privacy. In the FTC’s own words, “The report leaves no doubt that without significant action, the commercial surveillance ecosystem will only get worse.”</span></p>
<p><span>To address this, the EFF advocates for federal privacy legislation. It should have many components, but these are key:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/files/2023/11/21/privacy_first_a_better_way_to_address_online_harms.pdf"><span>Data minimization and user rights</span></a><span>: Companies should be prohibited from processing a person’s data beyond what’s necessary to provide them what they asked for. Users should have the right to access their data, port it, correct it, and delete it.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/03/ban-online-behavioral-advertising"><span>Ban on Online Behavioral Advertising</span></a><span>: We should tackle the root cause of commercial surveillance by banning behavioral advertising. Otherwise, businesses will always find ways to skirt around privacy laws to keep profiting from intrusive data collection.</span></li>
<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/you-should-have-right-sue-companies-violate-your-privacy"><span>Strong Enforcement with Private Right of Action</span></a><span>: To give privacy legislation bite, people should have a private right of action to sue companies that violate their privacy. Otherwise, we’ll continue to see widespread violation of privacy laws due to limited government enforcement resources.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Using online services shouldn't mean surrendering your personal information to countless companies to use as they see fit.&nbsp; When you sign up for an account on a website, you shouldn’t need to worry about random third-parties getting your information or every click being monitored to serve you ads. For now, our </span><a href="https://privacybadger.org/"><span>Privacy Badger extension</span></a><span> can help you block some of the tracking technologies detailed in the FTC report. But the scale of commercial surveillance revealed in this investigation requires significant legislative action. Congress must act now and&nbsp;protect our data&nbsp;from corporate exploitation with a strong federal privacy law.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="A Bendy RISC-V Processor"><p>For the first time, scientists have created a flexible programmable chip that is not made of silicon. The new ultralow-power 32-bit microprocessor from U.K.-based <a href="https://www.pragmaticsemi.com/" target="_blank">Pragmatic Semiconductor</a> and its colleagues can operate while bent, and can run <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning">machine learning</a> workloads. The microchip’s open-source RISC-V architecture suggests it might cost less than a dollar, putting it in a position to power wearable healthcare electronics,  smart package labels, and other inexpensive items, its inventors add.<br></p><p>For example, “we can develop an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/skin-circuits" target="_self">ECG</a> patch that has flexible electrodes attached to the chest and a flexible microprocessor connected to flexible electrodes to classify <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrhythmia" target="_blank">arrhythmia</a> conditions by processing the ECG data from a patient,” says Emre Ozer, senior director of processor development at Pragmatic, a flexible chip manufacturer in Cambridge, England. Detecting normal heart rhythms versus an arrhythmia “is a machine learning task that can run in software in the flexible microprocessor,” he says.</p><p><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/stretchable-electronics" target="_self"><u>Flexible electronics</u></a> have the potential for any application requiring interactions with soft materials, such as devices worn on or implanted within the body. Those applications could include <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/skin-circuits" target="_self"><u>on-skin computers</u></a>, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/soft-robotics" target="_self"><u>soft robotics</u></a>, and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/a-braincomputing-interface-that-lasts-for-weeks" target="_self"><u>brain-machine interfaces</u></a>. But, conventional electronics are made of rigid materials such as silicon.<strong></strong></p><h2>Open-source, Flexible, and Fast Enough</h2><p>Pragmatic sought to create a flexible microchip that cost significantly less to make than a silicon processor. The new device, named Flex-RV, is a 32-bit microprocessor based on the metal-oxide semiconductor <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/transparent-transistorshttps://spectrum.ieee.org/thin-fast-and-flexible-semiconductors" target="_blank">indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO</a>).</p><p>Attempts to create flexible devices from silicon require special packaging for the brittle microchips to protect them from the mechanical stresses of bending and stretching. In contrast, pliable thin-film transistors made from IGZO can be made directly at low temperatures onto flexible plastics, leading to lower costs.</p><p>The new microchip is based on the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-ai" target="_self">RISC-V</a> instruction set. (RISC stands for reduced instruction set computer.) First introduced in 2010, RISC-V aims to enable smaller, lower-power, better-performing processors by slimming down the core set of instructions they can execute.</p><p>“Our end goal is to democratize computing by developing a license-free microprocessor,” Ozer says.</p><p>RISC-V’s is both free and open-source, letting chip designer dodge the costly licensing fees associated with proprietary architectures such as x86 and Arm. In addition, proprietary architectures offer limited opportunities to customize them, as adding new instructions is generally restricted. In contrast, RISC-V encourages such changes.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A computer monitor saying Hello World! hangs above gloved hands sitting next to a green board with a golden chip bent around a tube." data-rm-shortcode-id="4715a668b795e977db277c7650752dbf" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-computer-monitor-saying-hello-world-hangs-above-gloved-hands-sitting-next-to-a-green-board-with-a-golden-chip-bent-around-a-t.jpg?id=53684043&amp;width=980" height="1145" id="e0c08" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-computer-monitor-saying-hello-world-hangs-above-gloved-hands-sitting-next-to-a-green-board-with-a-golden-chip-bent-around-a-t.jpg?id=53684043&amp;width=980" width="643"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">A bent Flex-RV microprocessor runs a program to print ‘Hello World’. </small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Pragmatic Semiconductor</small></p><p>“We chose the <a href="https://github.com/olofk/serv" target="_blank">Serv</a> designed by Olof Kindgren... as the open source 32-bit RISC-V CPU when we designed Flex-RV,” Ozer says. “Serv is the smallest RISC-V processor in the open-source community.”</p><p>Other processors have been built using flexible <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/semiconductors/">semiconductors</a>, such as Pragmatic’s 32-bit <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03625" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">PlasticARM</a><u></u>and an <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/plastic-microprocessor" target="_blank">ultracheap microcontroller</a> designed by engineers in Illinois. Unlike these earlier devices, Flex-RV is programmable and can run compiled programs written in high-level languages such as C. In addition, the open-source nature of RISC-V also let the researchers equip Flex-RV with a programmable <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-ai" target="_blank">machine learning hardware accelerator,</a> enabling <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> applications.</p><p>Each Flex-RV microprocessor has a 17.5 square millimeter core and roughly 12,600 <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/optical-computing-picosecond-gates" target="_self">logic gates</a>. The research team found Flex-RV could run as fast as 60 kilohertz while consuming less than 6 milliwatts of power.</p><p>All previous flexible non-silicon microprocessors were tested solely on the wafers they were made on. In contrast, Flex-RV was tested on flexible printed circuit boards, which let the researchers see how well it operated when flexed. The Pragmatic team found that Flex-RV could still execute programs correctly when bent to a curve with a radius of 3 millimeters. Performance varied between a 4.3 percent slowdown to a 2.3 percent speedup depending on the way it was bent. “Further research is needed to understand how bending conditions such as direction, orientation and angle impact performance at macro and micro scales,” Ozer says.</p><p>Silicon microchips can run at gigahertz speeds, much faster than Flex-RV, but that shouldn’t be a problem, according to Ozer. “Many sensors—for example, temperature, pressure, odor, humidity, pH, and so on—<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-internet-of-disposable-things-will-be-made-of-paper-and-plastic-sensors" target="_blank">in the flexible electronics world</a> typically operate very slowly at hertz or kilohertz regimes,” he says. “These sensors are used in smart packaging, labels and wearable healthcare electronics, which are the emerging applications for which flexible microprocessors will be useful. Running the microprocessor at 60 kHz would be more than enough to meet the requirements of these applications.”</p><p>Ozer and his team suggest each Flex-RV might cost less than a dollar. Although Ozer did not want to say how much less than a dollar it might cost, he says they are confident such low costs are possible “thanks to low-cost flexible chip fabrication technology by Pragmatic and a license-free RISC-V technology.”</p><p>The scientists detailed <u><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07976-y" target="_blank">their findings</a></u> online 25 September in the journal <em>Nature</em>.</p><div><p>From Your Site Articles</p><ul><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/riscvs-opensource-architecture-shakes-up-chip-design" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RISC-V's Open-Source Architecture Shakes Up Chip Design - IEEE ... ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-raspberry-pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RISC-V Guns for Raspberry Pi, Legacy Chips - IEEE Spectrum ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-chip-delivers-quantum-resistant-encryption" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RISC-V Chip Delivers Quantum-Resistant Encryption ›</a></li><li><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/risc-v-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RISC-V AI Chips Will Be Everywhere - IEEE Spectrum ›</a></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>I spent a lot of time in the past couple of weeks working on a website in Go
that may or may not ever see the light of day, but I learned a couple of things
along the way I wanted to write down. Here they are:</p>

<h3 id="go-1-22-now-has-better-routing">go 1.22 now has better routing</h3>

<p>I’ve never felt motivated to learn any of the Go routing libraries
(gorilla/mux, chi, etc), so I’ve been doing all my routing by hand, like this.</p>

<pre><code>	// DELETE /records:
	case r.Method == "DELETE" &amp;&amp; n == 1 &amp;&amp; p[0] == "records":
		if !requireLogin(username, r.URL.Path, r, w) {
			return
		}
		deleteAllRecords(ctx, username, rs, w, r)
	// POST /records/&lt;ID&gt;
	case r.Method == "POST" &amp;&amp; n == 2 &amp;&amp; p[0] == "records" &amp;&amp; len(p[1]) &gt; 0:
		if !requireLogin(username, r.URL.Path, r, w) {
			return
		}
		updateRecord(ctx, username, p[1], rs, w, r)

</code></pre>

<p>But apparently <a href="https://go.dev/blog/routing-enhancements">as of Go 1.22</a>, Go
now has better support for routing in the standard library, so that code can be
rewritten something like this:</p>

<pre><code>	mux.HandleFunc("DELETE /records/", app.deleteAllRecords)
	mux.HandleFunc("POST /records/{record_id}", app.updateRecord)
</code></pre>

<p>Though it would also need a login middleware, so maybe something more like
this, with a <code>requireLogin</code> middleware.</p>

<pre><code>	mux.Handle("DELETE /records/", requireLogin(http.HandlerFunc(app.deleteAllRecords)))
</code></pre>

<h3 id="a-gotcha-with-the-built-in-router-redirects-with-trailing-slashes">a gotcha with the built-in router: redirects with trailing slashes</h3>

<p>One annoying gotcha I ran into was: if I make a route for <code>/records/</code>, then a
request for <code>/records</code> <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#hdr-Trailing_slash_redirection-ServeMux">will be redirected</a> to <code>/records/</code>.</p>

<p>I ran into an issue with this where sending a POST request to <code>/records</code>
redirected to a GET request for <code>/records/</code>, which broke the POST request
because it removed the request body. Thankfully <a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/go-servemux-slash-2021-11-04/">Xe Iaso wrote a blog post about the exact same issue</a> which made it
easier to debug.</p>

<p>I think the solution to this is just to use API endpoints like <code>POST /records</code>
instead of <code>POST /records/</code>, which seems like a more normal design anyway.</p>

<h3 id="sqlc-automatically-generates-code-for-my-db-queries">sqlc automatically generates code for my db queries</h3>

<p>I got a little bit tired of writing so much boilerplate for my SQL queries, but
I didn’t really feel like learning an ORM, because I know what SQL queries I
want to write, and I didn’t feel like learning the ORM’s conventions for
translating things into SQL queries.</p>

<p>But then I found <a href="https://sqlc.dev/">sqlc</a>, which will compile a query like this:</p>

<pre><code>
-- name: GetVariant :one
SELECT *
FROM variants
WHERE id = ?;

</code></pre>

<p>into Go code like this:</p>

<pre><code>const getVariant = `-- name: GetVariant :one
SELECT id, created_at, updated_at, disabled, product_name, variant_name
FROM variants
WHERE id = ?
`

func (q *Queries) GetVariant(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Variant, error) {
	row := q.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, getVariant, id)
	var i Variant
	err := row.Scan(
		&amp;i.ID,
		&amp;i.CreatedAt,
		&amp;i.UpdatedAt,
		&amp;i.Disabled,
		&amp;i.ProductName,
		&amp;i.VariantName,
	)
	return i, err
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I like about this is that if I’m ever unsure about what Go code to write
for a given SQL query, I can just write the query I want, read the generated
function and it’ll tell me exactly what to do to call it. It feels much easier
to me than trying to dig through the ORM’s documentation to figure out how to
construct the SQL query I want.</p>

<p>Reading <a href="https://brandur.org/fragments/sqlc-2024">Brandur’s sqlc notes from 2024</a> also gave me some confidence
that this is a workable path for my tiny programs. That post gives a really
helpful example of how to conditionally update fields in a table using CASE
statements (for example if you have a table with 20 columns and you only want
to update 3 of them).</p>

<h3 id="sqlite-tips">sqlite tips</h3>

<p>Someone on Mastodon linked me to this post called <a href="https://kerkour.com/sqlite-for-servers">Optimizing sqlite for servers</a>. My projects are small and I’m
not so concerned about performance, but my main takeaways were:</p>

<ul>
<li>have a dedicated object for <strong>writing</strong> to the database, and run
<code>db.SetMaxOpenConns(1)</code> on it. I learned the hard way that if I don’t do this
then I’ll get <code>SQLITE_BUSY</code> errors from two threads trying to write to the db
at the same time.</li>
<li>if I want to make reads faster, I could have 2 separate db objects, one for writing and one for reading</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a more tips in that post that seem useful (like “COUNT queries are
slow” and “Use STRICT tables”), but I haven’t done those yet.</p>

<p>Also sometimes if I have two tables where I know I’ll never need to do a <code>JOIN</code>
beteween them, I’ll just put them in separate databases so that I can connect
to them independently.</p>

<h3 id="go-1-19-introduced-a-way-to-set-a-gc-memory-limit">Go 1.19 introduced a way to set a GC memory limit</h3>

<p>I run all of my Go projects in VMs with relatively little memory, like 256MB or
512MB. I ran into an issue where my application kept getting OOM killed and it
was confusing – did I have a memory leak? What?</p>

<p>After some Googling, I realized that maybe I didn’t have a memory leak, maybe I
just needed to reconfigure the garbage collector! It turns out that by default (according to <a href="https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide">A Guide to the Go Garbage Collector</a>), Go’s garbage collector will
let the application allocate memory up to <strong>2x</strong> the current heap size.</p>

<p><a href="https://messwithdns.net/">Mess With DNS</a>’s base heap size is around 170MB and
the amount of memory free on the VM is around 160MB right now, so if its memory
doubled, it’ll get OOM killed.</p>

<p>In Go 1.19, they added a way to tell Go “hey, if the application starts using
this much memory, run a GC”. So I set the GC memory limit to 250MB and it seems
to have resulted in the application getting OOM killed less often:</p>

<pre><code>export GOMEMLIMIT=250MiB
</code></pre>

<h3 id="some-reasons-i-like-making-websites-in-go">some reasons I like making websites in Go</h3>

<p>I’ve been making tiny websites (like the <a href="https://nginx-playground.wizardzines.com/">nginx playground</a>) in Go on and off for the last 4 years or so and it’s really been working for me. I think I like it because:</p>

<ul>
<li>there’s just 1 static binary, all I need to do to deploy it is copy the binary</li>
<li>there’s a built-in webserver that’s okay to use in production, so I don’t need to configure WSGI or whatever to get it to work</li>
<li>Go’s toolchain is very easy to install, I can just do <code>apt-get install golang-go</code> or whatever and then a <code>go build</code> will build my project</li>
<li>it feels like there’s very little to remember to start sending HTTP responses
– basically all there is are functions like <code>Serve(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)</code> which read the request and send a response. If I need to
remember some detail of how exactly that’s accomplished, I just have to read
the function!</li>
<li>also <code>net/http</code> is in the standard library, so you can start making websites
without installing any libraries at all. I really appreciate this one.</li>
<li>Go is a pretty systems-y language, so if I need to run an <code>ioctl</code> or
something that’s easy to do</li>
</ul>

<p>In general everything about it feels like it makes projects easy to work on for
5 days, abandon for 2 years, and then get back into writing code without a lot
of problems.</p>

<p>For contrast, I’ve tried to learn Rails a couple of times and I really <em>want</em>
to love Rails – I’ve made a couple of toy websites in Rails and it’s always
felt like a really magical experience. But ultimately when I come back to those
projects I can’t remember how anything works and I just end up giving up. It
feels easier to me to come back to my Go projects that are full of a lot of
repetitive boilerplate, because at least I can read the code and figure out how
it works.</p>

<h3 id="it-s-cool-to-see-the-new-features-go-has-been-adding">it’s cool to see the new features Go has been adding</h3>

<p>Both of the Go features I mentioned in this post (<code>GOMEMLIMIT</code> and the routing)
are new in the last couple of years and I didn’t notice when they came out. It
makes me think I should pay closer attention to the release notes for new Go
versions.</p>

<h2 id="interface">Interface</h2>
<p>A varlink interface has a reverse-domain name and specifies which methods the interface implements. Each method has named and typed input and output parameters. Complex types can be aliased with the <code>type</code> keyword to allow reusing them and to make method signatures easier to read. The interface also specifies the errors that may be returned from its method calls.</p>

<p>Everything can be documented by adding a comment immediately before it. The documentation is provided to clients as structured data on a well-known service interface.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition">Interface Definition</a> about the varlink syntax and how to parse an interface file.</p>

<h2 id="protocol">Protocol</h2>
<p>All messages are encoded as JSON objects and terminated with a single <code>NUL</code> byte.</p>

<p>A service responds to requests in the same order that they are received—messages are never multiplexed. However, multiple requests can be queued on a connection to enable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining">pipelining</a>. This simplifies and minimizes the amount of state clients need to track.</p>

<p>The common case is a simple method call with a single reply. To support <em>monitoring calls</em>, <em>subscriptions</em>, <em>chunked data</em>, <em>streaming</em>, calls may carry instructions for the server to not reply, or to reply multiple times to a single method call. See the <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">Method Call</a> page for a detailed description.</p>

<p>In common programming languages, varlink clients do not require complex modules or libraries, already existing JSON and socket communication facilities are used to integrate natively into the programming language’s object model.</p>

<p>Requests specify the fully-qualified <code>method</code> that should be called, along with its input parameters:</p>

<h2 id="service">Service</h2>
<p>Every varlink service offers the <code>org.varlink.service</code> interface, which describes all interfaces the service provides and provides information about the service implementation itself. See the <a href="https://varlink.org/Service">Service</a> page for details.</p>

<h2 id="address">Address</h2>
<p>Varlink services are expressed in URI notation. All properties after a <code>;</code> character should be ignored to allow future extensions.</p>

<h2 id="activation">Activation</h2>
<p>A listen socket a.k.a “FD3” might be passed to a varlink service at startup.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Environment</th>
      <th>Example</th>
      <th>Comment</th>
    </tr>

      <td><em>LISTEN_FDS=2</em></td>
      <td>Number of file descriptors passed to the service. It always starts at 3. If more than one file descriptor is passed, <em>LISTEN_FDNAMES</em> identifies the <em>varlink</em> file descriptor.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LISTEN_PID</td>
      <td><em>LISTEN_PID=4711</em></td>
      <td>The process id of the started service. This should match the PID of the started service, otherwise everything should be ignored.</td>

      <td>A colon separated list of names of the passed file descriptors.  The varlink file descriptor should be named <em>varlink</em>.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The service activator should pass the command line option <em>–varlink=<a href="#address">ADDRESS</a></em> to the service, to make the listening address and possible parameters known to the service. It also shows the listening address in <em>ps</em>, which helps to debug a running service.</p>

<p>See an example implementation of a <a href="https://github.com/cherry-pick/com.redhat.resolver/blob/master/src/service.c#L112">service activator</a>.</p>

<h2 id="resolver">Resolver</h2>
<p>Public varlink interfaces are registered system-wide by their well-known address, by default <em>/run/org.varlink.resolver</em>. The resolver translates a given varlink interface to the service address which provides this interface.</p>

<p>Multiple services can implement and offer the same interface, but only one of the services is registered with the resolver. The set of registered interfaces becomes the globally visible system interface, its actual configuration is usually defined by the operating system and not managed by the services themselves.</p>

<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/cherry-pick/com.redhat.resolver/blob/master/src/org.varlink.resolver.varlink"><code>org.varlink.resolver</code></a> interface for details.</p>

<h2 id="bridge">Bridge</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://varlink.org/Screenshots#command-line">varlink</a> command line tool supports a <code>bridge</code> mode to bridge a single connection to the resolver and its registered services. It intercepts the calls to the <code>org.varlink.service</code> interface and replies with the information the resolver supplies.</p>

<p>If the bridge is used over SSH, all the interfaces of the locally running services appear to the remote ssh client as if they were implemented by the bridge.</p>

<p>See a <a href="https://varlink.org/Screenshots#remote-host">screenshot</a> as an example.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://paulgraham.com/when.html">https://paulgraham.com/when.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41687176">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div width="435"><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://s.turbifycdn.com/aah/paulgraham/when-to-do-what-you-love-1.gif" width="217" height="18" alt="When To Do What You Love"><span size="2" face="verdana">September 2024<p>There's some debate about whether it's a good idea to "follow your
passion." In fact the question is impossible to answer with a simple
yes or no. Sometimes you should and sometimes you shouldn't, but
the border between should and shouldn't is very complicated. The
only way to give a general answer is to trace it.</p><p>When people talk about this question, there's always an implicit
"instead of." All other things being equal, why wouldn't you work
on what interests you the most? So even raising the question implies
that all other things aren't equal, and that you have to choose
between working on what interests you the most and something else,
like what pays the best.</p><p>And indeed if your main goal is to make money, you can't usually
afford to work on what interests you the most. People pay you for
doing what they want, not what you want. But there's an obvious
exception: when you both want the same thing. For example, if you
love football, and you're good enough at it, you can get paid a lot
to play it.</p><p>Of course the odds are against you in a case like football, because
so many other people like playing it too. This is not to say you
shouldn't try though. It depends how much ability you have and how
hard you're willing to work.</p><p>The odds are better when you have strange tastes: when you like
something that pays well and that few other people like. For example,
it's clear that Bill Gates truly loved running a software company.
He didn't just love programming, which a lot of people do. He loved
writing software for customers. That is a very strange taste indeed,
but if you have it, you can make a lot by indulging it.</p><p>There are even some people who have a genuine intellectual interest
in making money. This is distinct from mere greed. They just can't
help noticing when something is mispriced, and can't help doing
something about it. It's like a puzzle for them.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f1n"><span color="#dddddd">1</span></a>]</span><p>In fact there's an edge case here so spectacular that it turns all
the preceding advice on its head. If you want to make a really 
huge
amount of money — hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars
— it turns out to be very useful to work on what interests you the
most. The reason is not the extra motivation you get from doing
this, but that the way to make a really large amount of money is
to start a startup, and working on what interests you is an excellent
way to discover </p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html"><u>startup ideas</u></a>.<p>Many if not most of the biggest startups began as projects the
founders were doing for fun. Apple, Google, and Facebook all began
that way. Why is this pattern so common? Because the best ideas
tend to be such outliers that you'd overlook them if you were
consciously looking for ways to make money. Whereas if you're young
and good at technology, your unconscious instincts about what would
be interesting to work on are very well aligned with what needs to
be built.</p><p>So there's something like a midwit peak for making money. If you
don't need to make much, you can work on whatever you're most
interested in; if you want to become moderately rich, you can't
usually afford to; but if you want to become super rich, and you're
young and good at technology, working on what you're most interested
in becomes a good idea again.</p><p>What if you're not sure what you want? What if you're attracted to
the idea of making money and more attracted to some kinds of work
than others, but neither attraction predominates? How do you break
ties?</p><p>The key here is to understand that such ties are only apparent.
When you have trouble choosing between following your interests and
making money, it's never because you have complete knowledge of
yourself and of the types of work you're choosing between, and the
options are perfectly balanced. When you can't decide which path
to take, it's almost always due to ignorance. In fact you're usually
suffering from three kinds of ignorance simultaneously: you don't
know what makes you happy, what the various kinds of work are really
like, or how well you could do them. 
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f2n"><span color="#dddddd">2</span></a>]</span><p>In a way this ignorance is excusable. It's often hard to predict
these things, and no one even tells you that you need to. If you're
ambitious you're told you should go to college, and this is good
advice so far as it goes, but that's where it usually ends. No one
tells you how to figure out what to work on, or how hard this can
be.</p><p>What do you do in the face of uncertainty? Get more certainty. And
probably the best way to do that is to try working on things you're
interested in. That will get you more information about how interested
you are in them, how good you are at them, and how much scope they
offer for ambition.</p><p>Don't wait. Don't wait till the end of college to figure out what
to work on. Don't even wait for internships during college. You
don't necessarily need a job doing x in order to work on x; often
you can just start doing it in some form yourself. And since figuring
out what to work on is a problem that could take years to solve,
the sooner you start, the better.</p><p>One useful trick for judging different kinds of work is to look at
who your colleagues will be. You'll become like whoever you work
with. Do you want to become like these people?</p><p>Indeed, the difference in character between different kinds of work
is magnified by the fact that everyone else is facing the same
decisions as you. If you choose a kind of work mainly for how well
it pays, you'll be surrounded by other people who chose it for the
same reason, and that will make it even more soul-sucking than it
seems from the outside. Whereas if you choose work you're genuinely
interested in, you'll be surrounded mostly by other people who are
genuinely interested in it, and that will make it extra inspiring.
</p><span color="#dddddd">[<a href="#f3n"><span color="#dddddd">3</span></a>]</span><p>The other thing you do in the face of uncertainty is to make choices
that are uncertainty-proof. The less sure you are about what to do,
the more important it is to choose options that give you more options
in the future. I call this "staying upwind." If you're unsure whether
to major in math or economics, for example, choose math; math is
upwind of economics in the sense that it will be easier to switch
later from math to economics than from economics to math.</p><p>There's one case, though, where it's easy to say whether you should
work on what interests you the most: if you want to do 
</p><a href="https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html"><u>great work</u></a>.
This is not a sufficient condition for doing great work, but it is
a necessary one.<p>There's a lot of selection bias in advice about whether to "follow
your passion," and this is the reason. Most such advice comes from
people who are famously successful, and if you ask someone who's
famously successful how to do what they did, most will tell you
that you have to work on what you're most interested in. And this
is in fact true.</p><p>That doesn't mean it's the right advice for everyone. Not everyone
can do great work, or wants to. But if you do want to, the complicated
question of whether or not to work on what interests you the most
becomes simple. The answer is yes. The root of great work is a sort
of ambitious curiosity, and you can't manufacture that.</p><p><b>Notes</b></p><p>[</p><a name="f1n"><span color="#000000">1</span></a>]
These examples show why it's a mistake to assume that economic
inequality must be evidence of some kind of brokenness or unfairness.
It's obvious that different people have different interests, and
that some interests yield far more money than others, so how can
it not be obvious that some people will end up much richer than
others? In a world where some people like to write enterprise
software and others like to make studio pottery, economic inequality
is the natural outcome.<p>[</p><a name="f2n"><span color="#000000">2</span></a>]
Difficulty choosing between interests is a different matter.
That's not always due to ignorance. It's often intrinsically
difficult. I still have trouble doing it.<p>[</p><a name="f3n"><span color="#000000">3</span></a>]
You can't always take people at their word on this. Since
it's more prestigious to work on things you're interested in than
to be driven by money, people who are driven mainly by money will
often claim to be more interested in their work than they actually
are. One way to test such claims is by doing the following thought
experiment: if their work didn't pay well, would they take day jobs
doing something else in order to do it in their spare time? Lots
of mathematicians and scientists and engineers would. Historically
lots <i>have</i>. But I don't think as many investment bankers would.<p>This thought experiment is also useful for distinguishing between
university departments.</p><span color="888888"><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Paul Buchheit,

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2024/09/28/web-components-are-okay/">https://nolanlawson.com/2024/09/28/web-components-are-okay/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41686722">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p>Every so often, the web development community gets into a tizzy about something, usually web components. I find these fights tiresome, but I also see them as a good opportunity to reach across <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">“the great divide”</a> and try to find common ground rather than another opportunity to dunk on each other.</p>
<p>Ryan Carniato started the latest round with <a href="https://dev.to/ryansolid/web-components-are-not-the-future-48bh">“Web Components Are Not the Future”</a>. Cory LaViska followed up with <a href="https://www.abeautifulsite.net/posts/web-components-are-not-the-future-they-re-the-present/">“Web Components Are Not the Future — They’re the Present”</a>. I’m not here to escalate, though – this is a peace mission.</p>
<p>I’ve been an avid follower of Ryan Carniato’s work for years. <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2023/12/02/lets-learn-how-modern-javascript-frameworks-work-by-building-one/">This post</a> and the steady climb of <a href="https://lwc.dev/">LWC</a> on the <a href="https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark"><code>js-framework-benchmark</code></a> demonstrate that I’ve been paying attention to what he has to say, especially about performance and framework design. The guy has single-handedly done more to move the web framework ecosystem forward in the past 5 years than anyone else I can think of.</p>
<p>That said, I also heavily work with web components, both on the framework side and as a <a href="https://github.com/nolanlawson/emoji-picker-element/">component author</a>. I’ve participated in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/webcomponents/">Web Components Community Group</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WICG/aom/">Accessibility Object Model group</a>, and I’ve written extensively on shadow DOM, custom elements, and web component accessibility in this blog.</p>
<p>So <em>obviously</em> I’m going to be interested when I see a post from Ryan Carniato on web components. And it’s a thought-provoking post! But I also think he misses the mark on a few things. So let’s dive in:</p>
<h2>Performance</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  [T]he fundamental problem with Web Components is that they are built on Custom Elements.</p>
<p>  […] [E]very interface needs to go through the DOM. And of course this has a performance overhead.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is completely true. If your goal is to build the absolute fastest framework you can, then you want to minimize DOM nodes wherever possible. This means that web components are off the table.</p>
<p>I fully believe that Ryan knows how to build the fastest possible framework. Again, the <a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/">results</a> for Solid on the <code>js-framework-benchmark</code> are a testament to this.</p>
<p>That said – and I might alienate some of my friends in the web performance community by saying this – performance isn’t everything. There are other tradeoffs in software development, such as maintainability, security, usability, and accessibility. Sometimes these things come into conflict.</p>
<p>To make a silly example: I could make DOM rendering slightly faster by never rendering any <code>aria-*</code> attributes. But of course sometimes you <em>have</em> to render <code>aria-*</code> attributes to make your interface accessible, and nobody would argue that a couple milliseconds are worth excluding screen reader users.</p>
<p>To make an even sillier example: you can improve performance by using <code>for</code> loops instead of <code>.forEach()</code>. Or using <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sveltejs/comments/1fklm73/curious_about_the_use_of_var_in_the_svelte_5/"><code>var</code> instead of <code>const</code>/<code>let</code></a>. Typically, though, these kinds of micro-optimizations are just not worth it.</p>
<p>When I see this kind of stuff, I’m reminded of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rIJNT7dCmE">speedrunners trying to shave milliseconds</a> off a 5-minute run of Super Mario Bros using precise inputs and obscure glitches. If that’s your goal, then by all means: <a href="https://ukikipedia.net/wiki/Backwards_Long_Jump">backwards long jump</a> across the entire stage instead of just having Mario run forward. I’ll continue to be impressed by what you’re doing, but it’s just not for me.</p>
<p>Minimizing the use of DOM nodes is a classic optimization – this is the main idea behind <a href="https://web.dev/articles/virtualize-long-lists-react-window">virtualization</a>. That said, sometimes you can get away with <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2024/09/18/improving-rendering-performance-with-css-content-visibility/">simpler approaches</a>, even if it’s not the absolute fastest option. I’d put “components as elements” in the same bucket – yes it’s sub-optimal, but optimal is not always the goal.</p>
<p>Similarly, I’ve long argued that <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2021/08/01/why-its-okay-for-web-components-to-use-frameworks/">it’s fine for custom elements to use different frameworks</a>. Sometimes you just need to gradually migrate from Framework A to Framework B. Or you have to compose some micro-frontends together. Nobody would argue that this is the fastest possible interface, but fine – sometimes tradeoffs have to be made.</p>
<p>Having worked for a long time in the web performance space, I find that the lowest-hanging fruit for performance is usually something dumb like <a href="https://web.dev/articles/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing">layout thrashing</a>, network waterfalls, unnecessary re-renders, etc. Framework authors like myself love to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf">performance golf</a> with things like the <code>js-framework-benchmark</code>, and it’s a great flex, but it just doesn’t usually matter in the real world.</p>
<p>That said, if it does matter to you – if you’re building for resource-constrained environments where every millisecond counts: great! Ditch web components! I will geek out and cheer for every speedrunning record you break.</p>
<h2>The cost of standards</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  More code to ship and more code to execute to check these edge cases. It’s a hidden tax that impacts everyone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s where I completely get off the train from Ryan’s argument. As a framework author, I just don’t find that it’s that much effort to support web components. Detecting props versus attributes is a simple <code>prop in element</code> check. <em>Outputting</em> web components is indeed painful, but hey – nobody said you have to do it. Vue 2 got by with a standalone <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue-web-component-wrapper">web component wrapper library</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/rstacruz/remount">Remount</a> exists without any input from the React team.</p>
<p>As a framework author, if you want to freeze your thinking in 2011 and code as if nothing new was added to the web platform since then, you absolutely can! And you can still write a great framework! This is the beauty of the web. jQuery v1 is still chugging away on plenty of websites, and in fact it gets faster and faster with every new browser release, since browser perf teams are often targeting whatever patterns web developers used ~5 year ago in an endless <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/shows/webplatformsummit-microsoft-edge-web-summit-2017/es15">cat-and-mouse game</a>.</p>
<p>But assuming you don’t want to freeze your brain in amber, then yes: you do need to account for new stuff added to the web platform. But this is also true of things like <code>Symbol</code>s, <code>Proxy</code>s, Promises, etc. I just see it as part of the job, and I’m not particularly bothered, since I know that whatever I write will still work in 10 years, thanks to the web’s backwards compatibility guarantees.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I get the impression that a wide swath of the web development community does not care about web components, does not want to support them, and you probably couldn’t convince them to. And that’s okay! The web is a big tent, and you can build entire UIs based on web components, or with a sprinkling of <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">HTML web components</a>, or with none at all. If you want to declare your framework a “no web components” zone, then you can do that and still get plenty of avid fans.</p>
<p>That said, Ryan is right that, by blessing something as “the standard,” it inherently becomes a mental default that needs to be grappled with. Component authors must decide whether <a href="https://dev.to/richharris/why-i-don-t-use-web-components-2cia">their <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>s should work like native <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>s</a>. That’s true, but again, you could say this about a lot of new browser APIs. You have to decide whether <code>IntersectionObserver</code> or <code>&lt;img loading="lazy"&gt;</code> is worth it, or whether you’d rather write your own abstraction. That’s fine! At least we have a common point of reference, a shared vocabulary to compare and contrast things.</p>
<p>And just because something is a web standard doesn’t mean you have to use it. For the longest time, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/621qrt/javascript_the_good_parts/">the classic joke</a> about <em>JavaScript: The Good Parts</em> was how small it is compared to <em>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</em>. The web is littered with deprecated (but still supported) APIs like <code>document.domain</code>, <code>with</code>, and <code>&lt;frame&gt;</code>s. Take it or leave it!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<blockquote><p>
  [I]n a sense there are nothing wrong with Web Components as they are only able to be what they are. It’s the promise that they are something that they aren’t which is so dangerous.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Here I totally agree with Ryan. As <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2023/08/23/use-web-components-for-what-theyre-good-at/">I’ve said before</a>, web components are bad at a lot of things – Server-Side Rendering, accessibility, even interop in some cases. They’re good at plenty of things, but replacing all JavaScript frameworks is not one of them. Maybe we can check back in 10 years, but for now, there are still cases where React, Solid, Svelte, and friends shine and web components flounder.</p>
<p>Ryan is making an eminently reasonable point here, as is the rest of the post, and on its own it’s a good contribution to the discourse. The title is a bit inflammatory, which leads people to wield it as a bludgeon against their perceived enemies on social media (likely without reading the piece), but <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2022/02/02/five-years-of-quitting-twitter/">this is something I blame on social media</a>, not on Ryan.</p>
<p>Again, I find these debates a bit tiresome. I think the fundamental issue, as <a href="https://nolanlawson.com/2023/12/30/shadow-dom-and-the-problem-of-encapsulation/">I’ve previously said</a>, is that people are talking past each other because they’re building different things with different constraints. It’s as if a salsa dancer criticized ballet for not being enough like salsa. There is more than one way to dance!</p>
<p>From my own personal experience: at Salesforce, we build a client-rendered app, with its own <a href="https://appexchange.salesforce.com/">marketplace of components</a>, with <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/2024/01/introducing-component-level-api-versioning-for-lwc">strict backwards-compatibility guarantees</a>, where the intended support is measured in years if not decades. Is this you? If not, then maybe you shouldn’t build your entire UI out of web components, with shadow DOM and the whole kit-n-kaboodle. (Or maybe you should! I can’t say!)</p>
<p>What I find exciting about the web is the sheer number of people doing so many wild and bizarre things with it. It has everything from games to art projects to enterprise SaaS apps, built with WebGL and Wasm and Service Workers and all sorts of zany things. Every new capability added to the web platform isn’t a limitation on your creativity – it’s an opportunity to express your creativity in ways that nobody imagined before.</p>
<p>Web components may not be the future for you – that’s great! I’m excited to see what you build, and I might steal some ideas for my own corner of the web.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 29 Sep 2024 11:54:55 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement">https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41686715">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="govspeak">
      <p>For users to experience a quality service it must be built in a robust way.</p>

<p>Progressive enhancement is a way of building websites and applications based on the idea that you should make your page work with HTML first.</p>

<p>Only after this can you add anything else like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.</p>

<p>All government services must follow progressive enhancement, even if part of the service or a parent service needs JavaScript</p>

<p>Building your service using progressive enhancement will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ensure your service is robust and of a high quality</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make it more likely your service will work <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices">regardless of which browser or device is being used</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mean your service’s most basic functionality will work and meet the core needs of the user</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improve accessibility by encouraging best practices like <a rel="external" href="https://html.com/semantic-markup/">writing semantic markup</a>
help users with device or connectivity limitations to use your service</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using a ‘commercial off the shelf’ (COTS) solution or asking an external supplier to build the service, you should consider including this in your requirements as part of your <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/define-your-purchasing-strategy">purchasing strategy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="start-with-html">Start with HTML</h2>

<p>Government services should be functional using only HTML. This includes services such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>transactional services, for example forms that let the user provide information to government</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a rel="external" href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2016/10/27/making-it-easier-to-understand-smart-answer-logic/">smart answers</a>, for example the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-a-birth">Registering a birth abroad</a> service</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>content-based websites, for example GOV.UK’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">foreign travel advice</a> page</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The HTML layer is fault-tolerant by design. The browser ignores markup that it does not understand and continues to parse it as best as it can.</p>

<p>This means that older browsers will be very likely to be able to load the HTML for your service, even if there are bugs in the HTML or you use features that only exist in more modern browsers.</p>



<h2 id="using-css">Using CSS</h2>

<p>You can style your service using CSS to make it look like GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The CSS layer is reasonably fault-tolerant. This means the browser will ignore individual declarations that it does not understand, for example if you use a property that only exists in newer browsers.</p>

<p>Be aware that the browser will ignore the entire ruleset if it encounters a selector that it does not understand.</p>

<p>There are also <a href="#css-fail">other reasons why the CSS may fail to load</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid techniques such as ‘CSS-in-JS’ to ensure that your site still looks correct even if the JavaScript fails to load.</p>

<h2 id="using-javascript">Using JavaScript</h2>

<p>JavaScript can be used to add interactive elements to your service.</p>

<p>The JavaScript layer is not fault-tolerant. If your JavaScript uses a syntax or calls an API that is not supported in the user’s browser, it will error and the rest of the JavaScript will not run.</p>

<p>There are <a href="#css-fail">other reasons why the JavaScript may fail to load or run</a>.</p>

<p>If your service is not designed with this in mind, users may be unable to use it.</p>

<p>You can increase the chances that your JavaScript will work correctly in all browsers by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using <a rel="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Feature_detection">feature detection</a> for browser APIs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>including <a rel="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Polyfill">polyfills</a> for newer browser features</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>transpiling your JavaScript to a common syntax that your target browsers can understand</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>using automated tests or linters</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>doing regular manual testing, including testing with older or lower-powered devices</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Transpilation and polyfills can significantly increase the size of your JavaScript. You should consider the trade offs involved and revisit these decisions regularly as browser usage changes.</p>

<p>Where possible the JavaScript should enhance HTML and CSS that provides the same core functionality. For example, an autocomplete could enhance a  element, or something similar. This still lets the user do what they need to do, even if the JavaScript fails.</p>

<h3 id="alternatives-to-javascript">Alternatives to JavaScript</h3>

<p>If you believe your service can only be built using JavaScript, you should think about using simpler solutions that are built using HTML and CSS and will meet user needs.</p>

<p>For example, if you want to use use JavaScript to provide interactive graphs, other options are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>display the data in a table</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>allow the data to be exported so that it can analysed in another application</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>pre-render the graphs as images</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the core functionality of your service cannot be provided without JavaScript, you’ll need to consider how users can access your service through other channels. This might be telephone calls or in-person visits to offices.</p>

<h3 id="using-client-side-javascript-frameworks">Using client-side JavaScript frameworks</h3>

<p>If your service is mostly built using components from the <a rel="external" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> and doesn’t have a complex user interface, you do not need to use a client-side JavaScript framework.</p>

<p>The components in the <a rel="external" href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/">GOV.UK Design System</a> include <a rel="external" href="https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/import-javascript">how to import JavaScript</a> to your service without the need for a framework.</p>

<p>If you do choose to use client-side <a rel="external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks">JavaScript frameworks</a>, be aware that although they can be helpful when building a service with a complex user interface, they can introduce problems.</p>

<p>Using a client-side JavaScript framework can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>increase the overall size of your code base and push processing to the client-side, causing performance issues for users with a slower network connection or lower powered device</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>create a reliance on third-party code that your developers do not have control over, requiring you to make major changes to your service in order to stay up to date with changes in the framework</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>make it difficult to find people with the skills required to maintain the code, if the framework’s loses popularity over time</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you use a JavaScript framework you should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>be able to justify with evidence, how using JavaScript would benefit users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>be aware of any negative impacts and be able to mitigate them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>consider whether the benefits of using it outweigh the potential problems</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>only use the framework for parts of the user interface that cannot be built using HTML and CSS alone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>design each part of the user interface as a separate component</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Having separate components means that if the JavaScript fails to load, it will only be that single component that fails. The rest of the page will load as normal.</p>

<p>If you use JavaScript, it should only be used to enhance the HTML and CSS so users can still use the service if the JavaScript fails.</p>

<h3 id="css-fail">Reasons why CSS or JavaScript may fail to load or run</h3>

<p>CSS and JavaScript can fail to load or run because of, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>temporary network errors</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third-party browser extensions like ad blockers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>third-party supplier downtime, such as when using a content delivery network
DNS lookup failures</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bugs introduced by browser updates</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>bugs introduced in third party JavaScript intentionally running on the same page
corporate firewalls blocking, removing or changing content (large institutions like banks or government departments may use these)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>mobile network providers changing content to speed up load times and reduce bandwidth usage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>personal firewalls or antivirus software changing or blocking content</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the use of unsecure connections, where internet providers insert their own code into the page that accidentally conflicts with your own</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some users may deliberately turn off features in their browsers. You should respect their decision and make sure those users can still use your service.</p>

<h2 id="single-page-applications">Single page applications</h2>

<p>Do not build your service as a single-page application (SPA). This is where the loading of pages within your service is handled by JavaScript, rather than the browser.</p>

<p>Single page applications rarely bring benefits and can make the service inaccessible because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>users of assistive technology would be unaware of changes in context, for example when moving to a new page</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>it would fail to handle focus when moving between pages</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>the user would be unable to navigate using the back or forward buttons in their browser</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>users would be unable to recover from an error, for example if there is an interruption to their network connection</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="testing-your-service">Testing your service</h2>

<p>If any components in your service rely heavily on JavaScript or JavaScript frameworks you will need to make sure they:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>work on a wide range of browsers and devices</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>work with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies">assistive technologies</a></p>
