        <p><strong>Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics better.  Sometimes the gaps in our knowledge only become clear when explaining things to others.</strong></p>

<p>Writing about what you learn is more than just a method of documentation; it's a powerful tool for deepening understanding and revealing the gaps in one's knowledge. This practice pushes us to explore topics more thoroughly and to articulate their thoughts in a coherent and precise manner.</p>

<h2>Learning Through Writing</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Exploration</strong>: Writing about a subject can in cases require a comprehensive exploration of the topic. This often leads to uncovering new insights and connections that might not be apparent through mere reading or listening.</li>
<li><strong>Articulation</strong>: Putting thoughts into words forces a person to clarify their understanding. This process of articulation helps in identifying areas where the understanding might be vague or incomplete.</li>
<li><strong>Reflection</strong>: Writing allows for reflection on the subject matter, enabling the learner to connect new information with existing knowledge. This synthesis helps in creating a more robust and interconnected understanding of the subject.</li>
<li><strong>Revelation of Gaps</strong>: Sometimes, the act of writing reveals areas where the knowledge is lacking or inconsistent. Recognizing these gaps is the first step towards filling them and achieving a more complete understanding.</li>
</ol>



<h3>The Benefits</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Retention</strong>: Writing about what you learn helps in retaining the information for a longer time. The process of translating thoughts into words engages multiple cognitive faculties, reinforcing memory.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Communication Skills</strong>: Regularly writing about various subjects enhances the ability to communicate complex ideas effectively. This skill is invaluable in both professional and personal life.</li>
<li><strong>Personal Growth</strong>: The practice of writing about learning encourages a growth mindset. It fosters curiosity, critical thinking, and a willingness to engage with challenging subjects.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Feynman Technique</h2>

<p>The Feynman Technique is a method named after the physicist Richard Feynman, designed to help individuals learn and understand subjects deeply. It aligns well with the practice of writing about what you learn, and its principles can be summarized in the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Choose a Concept</strong>: Select a concept or topic you want to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Teach It to a Child</strong>: Try to explain the concept as if you were teaching it to a child. Use simple language and avoid jargon.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Gaps and Go Back to the Source Material</strong>: If you find areas where your explanation falters, go back to the source material to fill in the gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify and Use Analogies</strong>: Create analogies and use simple language to make the concept more relatable and easier to grasp.</li>
<li><strong>Review and Refine</strong>: Continuously review and refine your explanation until you can articulate the concept in the simplest terms possible.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://addyosmani.com/assets/feynman.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt="The technique involves four steps: 1️⃣ Choose a concept or idea that you want to learn about. 2️⃣ ELI5 (Explain It To Me Like I'm 5). Pretend that you are explaining the concept to someone who knows nothing about it. Write out your explanation in simple, plain language, using examples and analogies to make it easier to understand. 3️⃣ Review your explanation and look for any gaps or unclear points. Go back to the original source material (such as a textbook or lecture notes) and fill in any gaps in your understanding. 4️⃣ Simplify your explanations. Test your understanding by trying to explain the concept to someone else, or by asking a friend or colleague to listen to your explanation and provide feedback."></p>

<p>The Feynman Technique emphasizes the importance of clear and simple communication, mirroring the process of writing about what you learn. Both practices encourage a deep and thorough understanding of the subject matter.</p>

<h2>Consistency in Writing and Success</h2>

<p>While motivation might ignite the spark of interest in writing or any other creative effort, it's consistency that truly fuels the flame of success. The act of writing regularly, regardless of inspiration, leads to growth, mastery, and achievement in the long run.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Consistency</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Building Habits</strong>: Writing consistently helps in forming a habit. Habits, once established, become automatic and require less effort to maintain. This makes the process of writing more natural and enjoyable over time.</li>
<li><strong>Progressive Improvement</strong>: Consistent practice leads to incremental improvements. Each writing session may contribute a small enhancement in skill, but over time, these small gains accumulate into significant growth.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Momentum</strong>: Consistency helps in maintaining momentum. Regular engagement with writing keeps the ideas flowing and the creative muscles flexed, reducing the resistance to start.</li>
<li><strong>Achieving Long-Term Goals</strong>: Success in writing, like in many other fields, is often a result of sustained effort over time. Consistency aligns daily actions with long-term goals, creating a path to success.</li>
</ol>



<h3>The Challenges of Consistency</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Overcoming Procrastination</strong>: Procrastination can be a significant barrier to consistency. Setting a regular schedule, creating a conducive environment, and focusing on the process rather than the outcome can help in overcoming this challenge.</li>
<li><strong>Dealing with Burnout</strong>: Writing consistently doesn't mean writing without breaks or self-care. Balance is essential to prevent burnout. Knowing when to rest and recharge is as crucial as knowing when to push forward.</li>
<li><strong>Managing Expectations</strong>: Not every writing session will produce a masterpiece. Embracing the imperfect and focusing on the act of writing itself, rather than the immediate results, fosters a healthier relationship with the craft.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Strategies for Maintaining Consistency</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Set Realistic Goals</strong>: Break down long-term goals into smaller, achievable milestones. Focus on progress rather than perfection.</li>
<li><strong>Create a Routine</strong>: Establishing a regular writing routine creates a structure that supports consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Accountability</strong>: Sharing goals with a friend or joining a writing group can provide encouragement and accountability.</li>
<li><strong>Celebrate Progress</strong>: Acknowledging and celebrating progress, even if small, creates positive reinforcement and motivation to continue.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Writing about what you learn, employing techniques like the Feynman Technique, and maintaining consistency in practice are interconnected practices that foster deeper understanding, skill development, and long-term success. </p>

<p>In a landscape where information is abundant, the ability to learn deeply, articulate clearly, and persevere consistently stands out as a valuable skill set. These practices not only enhance personal and professional growth but also contribute to a lifelong journey of curiosity, exploration, and achievement.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you ever tried to download videos from YouTube? I mean manually without relying on software like youtube-dl, yt-dlp or one of “these” websites. It’s much more complicated than you might think.</p><p>Youtube generates revenue from user ad views, and it’s logical for the platform to implement restrictions to prevent people from downloading videos or even watching them on an unofficial client like YouTube Vanced. In this article, I will explain the technical details of these security mechanisms and how it’s possible to bypass them.</p><p><a href="https://blog.0x7d0.dev/assets/img/how-they-bypass-youtube-video-download-throttling/googlesearch-youtube-downloader.png"><img data-src="/assets/img/how-they-bypass-youtube-video-download-throttling/googlesearch-youtube-downloader.png" alt="A google search for youtube downloader" data-proofer-ignore="" src="https://blog.0x7d0.dev/assets/img/how-they-bypass-youtube-video-download-throttling/googlesearch-youtube-downloader.png"></a> <em>A google search for: youtube downloader</em></p><p>The first step is to find the actual URL containing the video file. For this, we can communicate with the YouTube API. Specifically, the <code>/youtubei/v1/player</code> endpoint allows us to retrieve all the details of a video, such as the title, description, thumbnails, and most importantly, the formats. It is within these formats that we can locate the URL of the file based on the desired quality (SD, HD, UHD, etc.).</p><p>Here’s an example for the video with the ID <code>aqz-KE-bpKQ</code>, where we will get the URL for one of the format. Note that the other variables contained within the <code>context</code> object are preconditions validated by the API. The accepted values were found by observing the requests sent by the web browser.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>However, attempting to download from this URL leads to really slow download:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

Unfortunately for this 10-minute video, it would take approximately 6 and a half hours to download the entire video. Clearly, the video is not downloaded at this speed when using a web browser. So what’s different?</p><p>Here’s the complete URL broken down. It’s rather complicated, but there’s a specific parameter that interests us.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Since mid-2021, YouTube has included the query parameter <code>n</code> in the majority of file URLs. This parameter needs to be transformed using a JavaScript algorithm located in the file <code>base.js</code>, which is distributed with the web page. YouTube utilizes this parameter as a challenge to verify that the download originates from an “official” client. If the challenge is not resolved and <code>n</code> is not transformed correctly, YouTube will silently apply throttling to the video download.</p><p>The JavaScript algorithm is obfuscated and changes frequently, so it’s not practical to attempt reverse engineering to understand it. The solution is simply to download the JavaScript file, extract the algorithm code, and execute it by passing the <code>n</code> parameter to it. The following code accomplishes this.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

However, YouTube still enforces a throttling rule. This rule imposes a variable download speed limit based on the size and length of the video, aiming to provide a download time that’s approximately half the duration of the video. This aligns with the streaming nature of videos. It would be a massive waste of bandwidth for YouTube to always provide the media file as quickly as possible.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

				<p><a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>‘s initial release occurred in 2017, the same year as the introduction of our mobile apps and mobile SDKs. For those who are unfamiliar with it, Flutter is one of the most popular frameworks for developing cross-platform applications.</p>
<p>Now a few years after their first release, <strong>we are thrilled to announce that our mobile SDKs and Flutter cross paths as the <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-flutter-sdk">Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK</a>.</strong> Yes that’s right, after multiple requests, an official Jitsi Meet Plugin for Flutter is now available.</p>
<p>As of now, our family of mobile SDKs is more complete than ever.</p>
<p>Android and iOS are supported, of course. The plugin serves as a wrapper for the iOS and Android SDKs, on top of which a Flutter API was created with functionality similar to those found in native APIs.</p>
<h3>Add Jitsi Meet to your Flutter app</h3>
<p>The plugin is available on pub.dev under the<a href="https://pub.dev/packages/jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk"> jitsi_meet_flutter_sdk</a> name. Discover it there, follow the instructions, and you’ll be able to utilize the API to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>Here is a sneak peek of how simple it is to add a meeting to a fresh page.</p>

<p>In your own Flutter app, you’ll have the same view as the one from the Jitsi Meet mobile apps, with just a few additional lines of code, amazing, right?</p>
<h3>Have a look at the sample apps</h3>
<p>We developed two apps using the Jitsi Meet Flutter SDK, one of which is the example app in the plugin <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-flutter-sdk/tree/main/example">repository</a> and primarily acts as a tester app by displaying the majority of the plugin’s features in the user interface, and the other of which is an official sample app in the <a href="https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet-sdk-samples/tree/master/flutter">repository</a> that contains all of our samples for all mobile SDKs and is just a straightforward example of integrating Jitsi Meet.</p>
<p>Flutter is new to us, and we hope this new SDK will make it easier for our users and <a href="https://jaas.8x8.vc/">JaaS</a> customers to embed video meetings into their existing Flutter apps we agerly await your feedback!</p>
<p>❤️ Your personal meetings team.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It was in last November that I texted the following to my good friend Sam, a fellow computer nerd:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a videogame where you are an operating system. You have to manage CPU cores, processes, memory pages and swap space. You have to make sure that no process starves, and to swap memory pages when necessary. Your goal is to avoid angering the user by being too slow.</p><p>So, what to you think?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I think you're a big nerd!" was his answer.</p>
<p>So I proceeded to start developing my nerdy game. First I had to pick a tech. I didn't feel like learning how to use a full-fledged game engine for my quite simple project, so I figured a simple 2D library would do. I also had been wanting to get back into Python. Naturally, Pygame was the obvious choice. Pygame also had the added benefit of making it possible to compile a game to WebAssembly (using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pygbag/">pygbag</a>), making it playable in a web browser. With Pygame I started my journey, and completed it in what was probably a single week spread across eight months.</p>
<h2 id="game-mechanics"><a href="#game-mechanics" aria-label="game mechanics permalink"></a>Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>At the core of the game, there are processes and CPU's. You can click on an idle process to assign it to an available CPU, and click on an active process to remove it from its CPU. Over time, idle processes go through six starvation levels represented by colours and emojis. If a process spends too much time in the last starvation level, the user becomes impatient and kills it. After having killed 10 processes, the user becomes so angry that they reboot you — the operating system —, ending the game. The goal is to survive as long as possible without getting rebooted. That means making sure that every process spends enough time on a CPU to not go through all the starvation levels.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="Images of the six starvation levels" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/youre-the-os-starvation-level.png">
</p>
<p>An active process can also become blocked because it is waiting for an I/O event. Blocked processes waste CPU time and it is therefore a good idea to remove them from their CPU. I/O events must be processed by clicking on a button that changes appearance when events are available.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The I/O events button" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/youre-the-os-io-events.png">
</p>
<p>As the game progresses, more processes appear, making the game increasingly difficult. At some point, all these processes start taking more memory than is available in the RAM, so you need to start swapping memory pages between the RAM and the disk. An active  process starts blinking when it is trying to access pages that are on disk, and the corresponding pages also blink. This is when you know you need to swap pages.</p>
<p>
    <img alt="The I/O events button" src="https://plbrault.com/blog-images/youre-the-os-pages.png">
</p>
<p>A process that is trying to access pages that are on disk will stay blocked until the pages are placed back in RAM. If it stays blocked for too long, it will keep going through the starvation levels and eventually get killed.</p>
<p>Finally, the game has multiple difficulty levels available, which influence things such as the number of CPU's, the amount of RAM, the number of processes existing when starting the game, the probability of I/O events, etc. It also has a custom mode where all these settings can be tweaked independently.</p>
<h2 id="does-this-game-have-educational-value"><a href="#does-this-game-have-educational-value" aria-label="does this game have educational value permalink"></a>Does This Game Have Educational Value?</h2>
<p>One has to keep in mind that this game is primarily, well, a game, and as such, has been designed to prioritize playability over realism. The first way in which it is not entirely realistic is the obvious fact that the player is not expected to have the speed of an actual computer! Many other details are technically wrong, such as processes using WAY LESS memory pages than typical actual processes would do, and the fact that a computer user does not usually keep launching new processes indefinitely — that is solely a game mechanic to make the game increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>In other words, this game has not been created with education in mind. All that being said, I do believe it can have some value in introducing computer science students to operating system principles like process scheduling and memory swapping, as long as it is made clear that it is not an exact depiction. As a computer science teacher myself, I might use it this fall while teaching a class about computer components, to better illustrate what it actually means for a processor to have more cores, or what happens when we run out of RAM.</p>
<h2 id="compiling-to-webassembly"><a href="#compiling-to-webassembly" aria-label="compiling to webassembly permalink"></a>Compiling to WebAssembly</h2>
<p>Compiling the game to WebAssembly was easier than expected, thanks to the documentation available <a href="https://pygame-web.github.io/">here</a>. The main steps are to install pygbag and implement the modifications to the code that are detailed in the documentation. The biggest problem I encountered was with <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pygame-emojis/">the library</a> I was using to render emojis, which I could not make work with pygbag. I ended up downloading SVG files from <a href="https://openmoji.org/">OpenMoji</a> and using GIMP to resize them as needed and export them to PNG.</p>
<p>By default, the game adapts its size to the browser's viewport, while maintaining the same ratio as the desktop version. It ends up being stretched if the desktop version uses a smaller window size. This does not result in unbearable pixelization for my game, which has a somewhat retro style, but your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 id="try-the-game"><a href="#try-the-game" aria-label="try the game permalink"></a>Try the Game!</h2>
<p>If I piqued your interest, you can play the game directly in your browser on <a href="https://drfreckles42.itch.io/youre-the-os">itch.io</a>. Furthermore, like most things I do, the game is open source, and its source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/plbrault/youre-the-os">GitHub</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Ninety six per cent of New Zealand IT employers expect the skills shortage to impact their operations in 2023, according to the latest Tech Alliance digital skills report.&nbsp;</p><p>Seventy-nine per cent of the 159 organisations that responded to the third <em>New Zealand Digital Skills Survey&nbsp;</em>reported they faced recruitment challenges, while many employers identified the challenge of finding skilled IT workers as an ongoing concern.</p><p>The ongoing demand for workers with advanced digital skills meant that ICT and other digital roles remain some of the highest paid jobs in Aotearoa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, despite the demand, the national median for tech salaries remains <a href="https://www.reseller.co.nz/article/689591/new-zealand-facing-critical-digital-skills-crisis/" target="_blank">unchanged since 2021</a> while the median salary for digital specific roles have increased by just two percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Job mobility remains high in ICT, with&nbsp;59 per cent of tech workers reporting they were considering a move to a new workplace in 2023. This was slightly down from the 64 per cent considering a move at the time of the 2020 report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“As we strive to harness the opportunities presented by the digital revolution, it is crucial we equip our workforce with the necessary skills,” NZTech CEO Graeme Muller said.&nbsp;</p><p>Plenty of activity aimed at addressing the digital skills gap was observed through the research with numerous initiatives were under way, Muller said. However, despite these the statistics showed little improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There had also been a significant decline in learners engaging in digital technology studies, which flowed into low numbers graduating.&nbsp;</p><p>“It is now abundantly clear that systemic change is required – a transformation that encompasses the collective efforts of industry, government and the education sector," Muller said.&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge demanded an approach where resources could be pooled and knowledge shared to develop innovative solutions. Collaboration with government and the education sector was crucial.</p><p>Unsurprisingly given the shortages, tech employees remained highly confident in the job market, with 72 per cent saying they expected finding a job in their specialty to be as easy or easier than last year a figure that has doubled since 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>"The specialised nature of many new roles requires employees with workplace experience and advanced skills in specific areas," the report says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Immigration had been the primary source of this specialised talent, filling a significant portion of all new digital technology jobs created.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"While it is important to grow the local pipeline, immigration will continue to be needed to ensure the right mix of advanced digital skills in the workforce," the report said.</p><p>The<em>&nbsp;</em>survey was conducted in January and February 2023.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://korban.net/posts/2023-08-11-thoughts-on-elixir-phoenix-liveview/">https://korban.net/posts/2023-08-11-thoughts-on-elixir-phoenix-liveview/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37114457">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been leading a team developing an application using Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView for the last 18 months and accumulated some thoughts on the stack. For the most part, it has been a very pleasant experience. </p>
<p>Compared to my initial evaluation of Elixir that I’d done prior to diving in in earnest, it exceeded my expectations in terms of availability of tools &amp; packages and the overall quality of dev experience. </p>
<p>Prior to Elixir, I was working primarily with Elm which probably colours my experience, but I have used a bunch of languages and have switched from static to dynamic types and back several times. </p>

<p>First of all, I find Elixir quite enjoyable: </p>
<ul>
<li>The combination of FP features and BEAM features is really good. </li>
<li>The concurrency model is really intuitive and powerful. </li>
<li>There is just enough FP to satisfy everyday needs, provided in a way that makes it easy for non-FP people to get comfortable quickly. </li>
<li>There is no ceremony involved with effects, which is sometimes very convenient and sometimes very lax (much like dynamic typing).</li>
<li>The language isn’t overly bloated and is very stable at this point. </li>
<li>Pattern matching is quite a powerful feature and becomes second nature very quickly (although it can be overused for extracting nested values).</li>
<li>Pipelines are of course very handy and used extensively. Coming from Elm, I found the pipeline operator weird in that it literally shunts the first argument into the function argument list instead of being a proper operator that you get with curried functions (it confuses code completion too!), but on the plus side its limited nature prevents the excesses of point-free style of programming. </li>
<li>Surprisingly, I don’t miss currying as much as I expected. I was initially quite wary of this. </li>
<li>The deployment story is quite straightforward these days, which is particularly helpful in cloud environments. </li>
</ul>
<p>As the pipeline example illustrates, Elixir seems to me to be one of those projects where instead of chasing the perfect design of every feature it’s OK to put in place pragmatic solutions even if they have warts. Some things are messy as a result but that’s an acceptable compromise: </p>
<ul>
<li>Parts of the standard library are clunky; I’m thinking about the combination of functions for working with data structures in<code>Enum</code>/<code>Map</code>/<code>List</code>/<code>Keyword</code> and <code>Kernel</code>, or things like <code>MapSet</code> instead of <code>Set</code>, or charlists (needed for compatibility with Erlang), or inconsistent naming (<code>is_map</code> vs <code>empty?</code>).</li>
<li>There are things that are unnecessary, such as <code>unless</code> or the ability to define some custom operators, or all the different ways to access values in maps &amp; structs that seem to be a bit confusing to newcomers.</li>
<li>Similarly, I don’t like comprehensions as everything they do can be achieved with functions, and they are not composable. </li>
<li>I can see why keyword lists exist but I don’t like that they overlap in functionality with maps. It’s another pragmatic solution that won over finding a more elegant way to support named arguments. </li>
<li>Grouped aliases/imports/requires are a mis-feature in my view. They save a few characters when typing but they complicate searching for module uses and refactoring (unless all your unqualified module names happen to be unique). Languages should really optimise for reading code! Luckily there is a Credo check that disallows grouping.</li>
<li>Having different syntax for calling anonymous functions (<code>f.()</code>) is weird for an FP language.</li>
<li>Outside the language itself, ExUnit is pretty good but setup for tests accessing a DB is finicky, and I wish there was a way to warn on tests without asserts (we’ve had a production bug slip through due to an accidentally removed assert). </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="phoenix">Phoenix</h2>
<p>My experience with Phoenix has been almost entirely with a LiveView lens, so I don’t have that much to say about Phoenix itself. It seems to be a reasonable MVC framework. The very welcome addition of compile-time checked verified routes in Phoenix 1.7 fixed one of  my complaints about dealing with routes. </p>
<p>Another thing I don’t like is the default separation of HEEX templates from the rest of the view code. For any non-trivial views, this approach doesn’t scale and you end up with HEEX in your view code anyway, so why not keep all of the template together with the code from the beginning and benefit from improved locality?  </p>
<p>I’m still somewhat unsure about the purpose and value of contexts. The idea is that contexts somehow provide a nice API for related functionality, sitting in front of a bunch of other modules with the actual implementation and hiding details of things like DB and external API access. There is even a longish guide about the use of contexts, but in the end it’s still unclear where and how to draw the context boundaries in practice. </p>
<p>For example, if I have to deal with users who have accounts which belong to companies and I want a function which gets me the stats on active accounts by company combined with each user’s last login time, should that function live in the <code>Users</code>, <code>Companies</code> or <code>Accounts</code> context? Should I even have these three contexts, or should I just have one <code>Accounts</code> context? It turns out that this isn’t easy to answer. </p>
<p>My approach to date has been to use contexts as the effectful infrastructure layer on top of the functional core. I also try to avoid multiplying contexts unnecessarily. The idea is that there shouldn’t be one context per model but only one for each of the “central” entities in the system, so for example in the oft-used blog implementation, I might have a <code>Users</code> context which deals both with users and their accounts, and an <code>Articles</code> context which deals both with posts and their comments (eg if we’re only interested in getting comments for posts and not for specific users). </p>
<h2 id="liveview">LiveView</h2>
<p>What’s great: </p>
<ul>
<li>Having a single code base for backend and frontend is great in terms of simplifying the mental model and also allowing people to work on “vertical” slices of functionality, which I think is far more effective than trying to break work by layers such as frontend &amp; backend. </li>
<li>Purely functional management of state in <code>assigns</code> (putting live components aside) is also a great simplification (and is a comfortable transition from Elm). </li>
<li>Being able to write UI interaction tests for live views directly in ExUnit, without relying on complex tools like Selenium (or whatever the latest alternative is) has been very useful. Of course, functional components being pure functions is also a boon for testing. </li>
</ul>
<p>What’s not so great: </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s unfortunate how the authentication logic (and any kind of state-based restrictions really) needs to be duplicated in an <code>on_mount</code> hook in addition to being defined in plug pipelines in the router. Relatedly, <code>live_session</code> feels like a hack that is required to enforce running through the Plug pipeline in certain situations. It feels like LiveViews actually need their own equivalent of Plug pipelines.</li>
<li>Storing client data is not particularly straightforward because websockets naturally limit the opportunities to store stuff in cookies, and using <code>localStorage</code> is also not quite trivial. </li>
<li>Live components are best avoided if possible, in my view. The documentation is quite bullish on them, presenting them as just another thing alongside functional components, but I think they should be more of a last resort, with functional components used whenever possible. This is because live components immediately raise questions about what is the source of truth for the state (view or component), they are harder to test given that they are stateful, and they have some warts like inconsistency in how messages have to be passed depending on whether the live component is a child of a view or another live component (although I know this is on the roadmap to be fixed). </li>
<li>We occasionally see weird bugs that look like events being routed to the wrong place or hiccups in reconnection logic. I guess we knew what we were getting into, seeing as LiveView hasn’t reached 1.0 yet. </li>
<li>I’m not a fan of the ad-hoc DSL that’s emerging within HTML attributes in HEEX templates (<code>:if</code> etc.). It means there are two or three different ways to express logic in templates, and it’s yet another thing to learn. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Both Elixir and Phoenix are very solid tools although of course they have their share of things that I don’t agree with. LiveView is an extremely impressive addition to Phoenix that melds backend and frontend, and is just on the cusp of becoming a mature option for more complex applications. </p>

<p>Babylon 5 is one of the best science fiction shows ever made. It also kind of sucks, and that’s okay.</p>
<p>“I hope the future will be like <em>Star Trek</em>, but I’m afraid it’s going to be like <em>Babylon 5</em>.”</p>
<p>This is how a friend convinced me to watch <em>Babylon 5</em> close to a decade ago, and it’s a statement that gets both more and less prescient by the day. <em>Babylon 5</em> depicts a future rife with stratified poverty, union busting corporations, xenophobic hate crimes, colonial legacies blossoming into new conflicts, and the tide of fascism rising right in our own backyard. In J. Michael Straczynski’s imagined future, the smug neoliberal western hegemony that arose from the ashes of the Cold War really <em>was</em> “the end of history”, and the results are simultaneously anodyne and horrific. Psychic powers are real, but those born with them are enslaved by the state. There are ancient terrors lurking on the edges of the map—civilizations who long ago ascended but refuse to let the children of the galaxy play unattended in the sandbox. People who live on the titular station still have to pay for their freaking healthcare in the year <em>2258</em>.</p>

<p>And, of course, <span data-footnote="The oft mentioned but never elaborated upon destruction of San Diego always struck me as a hilarious bit of world building. Why San Diego? What’s in San Diego? Were they nuking Comic-con????" data-footnote-index="1">let us not forget what happened to San Diego</span>.</p>
<div id="attachment_459393"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459393" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/001.png?resize=559%2C311&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="559" height="311" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459393">Pour one out. (Screenshot: Warner Bros.)</p></div>
<p>Here’s what <em>Babylon 5</em> also has: a complete, pre-planned, serialized story arc that is arguably one of the first successful examples of such on American television. A bisexual second-in-command and a nod to legalized gay marriage (in 1994!). An episode where “King Arthur” visits the station and knights an alien ambassador while drunk and actually this all has deep and ultimately painful relevance to the show’s immediate backstory, I <em>promise</em>. There’s a collective of time-travelling alien janitors all named Zathras who inexplicably become the most important hinge on which the stable time loop that ties together the first three seasons hangs. The heroes of <em>Babylon 5</em> quite literally tell the universe’s most powerful threat to “get the hell out of their galaxy” eight episodes into the penultimate season and then spend the rest of the series mopping up civil wars, succession debates and personal crises. Yeah, that’s nearly two whole seasons the show keeps going without the Big Bad and most of it is <em>very, very good</em> (some of it is <em>very, very not</em>).</p>
<p><em>Babylon 5</em> is both exactly as wild as it sounds, and utterly underwhelming in terms of execution versus expectation. Because, honestly, a modern show with a <em>Game of Thrones</em> level budget would have a difficult time living up to the vision B5 presents in its five-year-arc, which attempts to suggest a history extending a million years in either direction; a great hand reaching out of the stars… and then doing absolutely nothing else. That <em>Babylon 5</em> manages to grant us even a sliver of of that vision—like peeking through a crack in the door—is mind-blowing when you really examine <span data-footnote="For example, the unstable ancillary cast that saw Straczynski playing musical chairs with narrative roles behind the scenes for over half the series, including the departure of the show’s leading man at the end of Season 1. And did I mention Warner Bros. losing virtually all of B5’s effects shots? Making a Hi-Def—or even normal def—version of the show a pipe dream." data-footnote-index="2">all the things the show had going against it</span> .</p>
<p>—which is kind of the critical equivalent of giving the show a gold star, or a participation trophy, isn’t it? This show won two Hugos once upon a time, but the legacy it has today tends to buzz around in the form of its “firsts” and the “in spite ofs”. <em>Nothing</em> else was doing serialization like this in the ’90s! Oh, it got cancelled, then un-cancelled! They never had the budget to do what they wanted! But… but! But, but, but!</p>
<div id="attachment_459394"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459394" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/002.png?resize=560%2C351&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="351" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459394">Hugo winning dialogue. (Screenshot: Warner Bros.)</p></div>
<p>So here’s the question I want to ask—<em>is </em>the show actually worth it, beyond the novelty of it simply being what it is? Because so often <em>Babylon 5</em> is recommended in terms of those novelties, a piece of art that only justifies its existence in a self referential, metatextual sense because of its place in history. But aside from all that, is it really… <em>any good</em>?</p>
<p>I mean, obviously <em>I</em> think it is. It’s one of my favourite shows, and I’ve been known to be somewhat evangelical about it. I’ve marathoned it with friends and family members no less than five times in the nine years since I first watched it. I’ve witnessed more than one person cry during the series finale. My mother balefully admitted to me in a horrid whisper that she thought it was better than <em>Star Trek</em>. That it’s<em> worth it </em>seems self evident to me.</p>
<p>However, B5 is not a <em>straightforward</em> recommendation. There are many things about the show that are <em>bad</em>. And not just “cringey” or “cheap”, but legitimately, objectively awful or misjudged. The thing is, I don’t think that these flaws particularly detract from Babylon 5’s <em>goodness</em>. In fact I think they enhance it. They are thematically cogent and cohesive with what’s good about it, and I think that it would lose something in translation if that Big Budget, technically “perfect” modern adaptation everyone is dreaming about actually happened.</p>
<p>Don’t believe me? Well, consider <em>Babylon 5</em>’s cast: an eclectic mix of outstanding character actors, career genre gutter dwellers, and true amateurs, many of whom grew into their roles in various ways. Can you really imagine any of these characters being recast? It’s not controversial to sing the praises of the more colourful members of the dramatis personae, of course; Andreas Katsulas and Peter Jurasik’s lightning-in-a-bottle chemistry as adversarial Ambassadors Londo and G’kar is legendary. Mira Furlan brings both her effortlessly luminous demeanour and sobering real-world experience with war, to the destiny-obsessed and destiny-<em>defying</em> Delenn in a performance that is as effervescent as it is complete. Claudia Christian might be the only one who loves Susan Ivanova more than we do, and <em>everyone </em>adores Captain Sheridan. Well, a lot of fans these days actually hate Sheridan, who commits the twin sins of being both terribly earnest and also being right most of the time, but you can’t deny that Bruce Boxleitner bleeds sunshine out both his ears.</p>
<div id="attachment_459395"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459395" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/003.png?resize=560%2C355&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459395">The blocking and body language here is so good I bet you could make some pretty accurate guesses about what’s going on between these two characters even if you’ve never seen the show. (Screenshot: Warner Bros.)</p></div>
<p>It doesn’t stop there: No one forgets the first time they meet the slimy, self-righteous Psi-Cop Alfred Bester. The Ambassadorial Aides are irreplaceable [even Na’toth (<em>especially </em>Na’toth [the joke here is that she was replaced; it wasn’t the same])]. Richard Briggs brings an understated naturalism to the ship’s head medical officer Doctor Franklin that makes him carefully invisible until his demons start to leak out. Jason Carter? Who even is that guy even? I have no idea, but he was so pitch perfect as the charmingly annoying and quixotic Ranger Marcus Cole that for the longest time I thought his British accent was fake. There’s <em>layers</em>.</p>
<p>For example: Jerry Doyle—who played the station’s wise-cracking and entertainingly damaged security chief, Michael Garibaldi—had a notably short career as an actor, cushioned on either side by stints as a Wall Street trader and a right wing radio host. This is the kind of extra-canonical knowledge that would usually ruin a character for me but, y’know, I don’t like Garibaldi because I agree with him politically; I mean—he’s a <em>cop</em>. I like him because he feels real, and he feels real because Doyle was on, some level, playing himself. You really can’t say there’s a single actor in the main cast who didn’t truly and thoroughly make the role <em>their own</em>. In the same way your high school’s production of <em>Les Miserables</em> might create a stronger visceral memory of the barricade scenes than Colm Wilkinson’s flawless recitation of ‘<em>Bring Him Home</em>’ in the 10th Anniversary Concert, it’s the imperfections that make this stagey, un-subtle, occasionally overwrought Space Opera seem <em>authentic</em>.</p>
<div id="attachment_459396"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459396" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/004.png?resize=560%2C355&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459396">This episode is brave enough to show alien genitalia on screen. A landmark milestone that Star Trek has yet to match. (Screenshot: Warner Bros.)</p></div>
<p>That authenticity is underscored by the world these characters inhabit. <em>Babylon 5</em>’s production design is inspired. Unique. <em>Gorgeous</em>—I will not budge on this point. I’ve seen the Season 1 Ambassador outfits in real life: they’re incredible works of sartorial art that the current DVD transfers simply do not do justice. Instead of streamlined and sterile, B5 is rich and gaudy and grandiose. It’s peak ’90s pop art aesthetic, and it’s bargain bin film noir: smokey and dark and grimy, shot through with bursts of neon and pastels. Lounge singers are backed by bands with Christmas lights glued to their guitars to make them look “space”-y. The drum-sets have glowing fluorescent rims. Every room on the station is crafted with a careful eye for detail that often gets lost in the sumptuous shadow-drenched lighting.</p>
<div id="attachment_459397"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459397" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/005.png?resize=560%2C355&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459397">Screenshot: Warner Bros.</p></div>
<p>Colours <em>mean </em>things in <em>Babylon 5</em>, they have thematic and character associations. Hazy reds dominate G’kar’s living quarters and illuminate his steps as he treads the path to prophethood. The dazzling, abstract shards of light in Minbari architecture express both their complex, sharp-edged fragility and the Platonic foundations of their religious beliefs. The peaks and valleys of Londo Mollari’s fall-from-and-rise-to-grace are marked by him literally changing his coat. That last one’s kind of gauche, I know, but so is the character, so it works.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/006.png?resize=559%2C311&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="559" height="311" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>

<p>The show does its best to break monotony in the endless parade of flat-lighting, shot-reverse-shot film-making popularly seen in network spec shows pre-dating the revolution brought about by later seasons of <em>The X-Files </em>and <em>Buffy</em>. Which isn’t to say the directing is <em>good</em>—it’s not. In fact, sometimes it’s laughably amateur, the kind of dumb camera tricks I’d have thought to do if someone handed me a Super 35 in high school and told me to to go nuts; dutch angles, weird zooms, filming a tense exchange from the most obscure angle in the room possible… but there’s a sort of artistic innocence and freedom that comes from that lack of expertise, from filming a show that doesn’t need to be as <em>safe</em> as the TNGs of the world. Often the camera is doing something really stupid, but it’s rarely resting on its laurels. The show is at its worst—visually and atmospherically I mean, but also in terms of writing, yeah—during its fifth season, when it had the financial security to “look good”. Something is lost in the transition. It loses the fervent passion and becomes workmanship-like. The lights have come on and chased the shadows away.</p>
<div id="attachment_459400"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459400" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/008.png?resize=560%2C355&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459400">Screenshot: Warner Bros.</p></div>
<p>Which only makes sense. The <em>literal</em> Shadows are gone from the galaxy too, and all the wars are over. The fifth season weaves so many narrative threads—some elegant, some nearly unwatchable—together that the plot hooks could set up a whole other five-season arc. Telepaths demanding the postponed freedoms they were promised, servants of the vanished Old Gods trying to fill the power vacuum left by their departed masters, beloved characters falling prey to destructive patterns and desires you would have hoped they’d overcome, while other members of the cast prosper in their roles as historical figures in the making. None of it is wrapped up.</p>
<p>Which is the point—that peace is difficult to maintain and there’s no magic fix. That when you kill your Gods you have to find something to replace them. That the needs of the truly oppressed are often treated as an after-thought by the bigwigs fighting the war, and their freedom will be used as a bargaining chip. For all these reasons, toppling oppressive regimes can have unexpected consequences that persist for years. For <em>decades</em>. The heroes have brought down the pillars of corruption with in such a way that the structure is still standing, and so they are forced to rebuild with the tools they already had.</p>
<p>But what if they had new tools? This is a possibility the show never even considers, and while there is a strong degree of intentionality to that point, Babylon 5 makes a big deal from the word go about the fact that we are supposedly witnessing the beginning of a “New Age”, so I think it’s valid to ask if perhaps the show could muster a bit more <em>vision </em>in its soft revolution.</p>
<div id="attachment_459401"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459401" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/009.png?resize=560%2C355&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459401">Screenshot: Warner Bros.</p></div>
<p>The literal text of the show suggests that the natural result of Capitalism’s decay is a re-emergence of Fascism, and Earth is already locked in what we can now recognize as a familiar pattern of increasing technocratic censorship paired with a loss of political efficacy on the part of normal people when the series begins. There’s an election going on in the first episode and the conservative party wins on the basis of what we are to assume is reactionary rhetoric. He’s not the guy our protagonists were supporting, but the whole thing is treated with a shrug. It eventually leads to a civil war. We’re immediately thrust into a cynical world wracked with bureaucratic inertia and callow appeasement. Our heroes emerge as heroic because they choose to <em>reject </em>apathy, normalization and compliance. Watching Earth inexorably slip further into violent authoritarianism is gripping stuff, brilliantly played as background noise for the first two and a half seasons and just as novel as it was in 1994 even when expressed in the silliest possible terms (Earth Gov is really out there literally quoting <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four </em>on its propaganda posters, huh?). But I’m not sure how cognizant the show <em>is</em> of its own political subtext, or, y’know, <em>text </em>in general.</p>
<p>Actually, the real problem is that I <em>am</em> sure.</p>
<p>What I’m saying is that <em>Babylon 5</em> is… a little politically <em>naive</em>. It succumbs powerfully to the temptation to paint its central characters as the Great Men (and Women!) of History. The solutions it offers are not much different from the problems it wants to solve. This—in some regards—is fine, because we know what happens a million years after the end of the series: Earth falls to fascism again. Human civilization is boiled down to its bones in a nuclear war. Eventually, we rebuild. Eventually we ascend and go beyond the furthest ring to hang out with Kosh and Sheridan, and it’s all very <em>Lord of the Rings</em> in a way that has you half-expecting Gandalf to pop out from behind a corner at points. Like I said: it’s ‘<em>The End of History’</em>, the zeitgeist of the 1990s taken to its logical conclusion. It’s a Liberal hellscape, and that’s <em>intentional </em>at least 50% of the time. It might be asking a lot for a major network show from the Clinton-era to offer a more cogent critique of the system everyone was happily drowning in at the time than this.</p>
<div id="attachment_459403"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459403" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/010.png?resize=559%2C311&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="559" height="311" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459403">This one’s a <em>Canticle for Leibowitz</em> pastiche, but the monks are all drawing fanart of the show’s main characters. (Screenshot: Warner Bros.)</p></div>
<p>The show can be crassly broad when broaching topics such as the AIDS epidemic, McCarthyism or Jehovah’s Witness medical restrictions, but it is simultaneously also very good at presenting situations in which no one is exactly right, or subverting its own subversions. <em>Babylon 5</em>’s parallel to the Cardassian/Bajoran conflict is initially problematized by presenting the formerly colonized Narn as a bloodthirsty, ambitious Regime in their own right, eager to make a mark on the galaxy and give back every inch of pain meted upon them by their former oppressors the Centauri. But it’s still the Narn Ambassador G’kar who learns to look towards the future, and the Centauri Ambassador Londo who helps his Empire re-brutalize the Narn twice as bad as has been done before out of a petty desire to feel important again. The wheel does not turn: the Centauri’s Imperial desire to see themselves as martyrs now under the boot of their victims is the poison tooth at the heart of the show’s many conflicts.</p>
<p>However, this all looks very First Year PoliSci even when compared to that contemporary non-blood relative <em>Star Trek:</em> <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, which stumbles all over the place in its own Star Trekky way, but was perhaps more astute in its attempts at social criticisms with episodes like ‘Past Tense’ and ‘Far Beyond the Stars’ as well as notably more mature in its engagement with colonial war crimes. But what Babylon 5 lacks in wisdom it gains back in boldness and specificity. The reason I can respect this narrative, as outdated and self-defeating it is at points, is because B5 is never afraid—or embarrassed, even when it should be—to state its positions and their proximity to the world outside its narrative confines.</p>
<p>This specificity of framing is in sharp contrast to Star Trek, which presents a vibrant playground in which to pose infinite number of philosophical moral quandaries but has shockingly little to say about the political architecture <em>of</em> that playground. We all <em>know</em> that the Federation is a glorious Fully Automated Luxury Space Communism paradise, right? I mean, it <em>is</em>—there’s nothing else it could be, but no writer has ever told us this directly. Starfleet Officers are awfully self righteous about a way of life that the franchise seems averse to actual spelling out in explicit terms. And if you don’t <em>say</em> something out loud, it turns out you don’t actually have a whole lot to say about it in the end after all. I find specificity more valuable the older I get. I can have a conversation with <em>Babylon 5</em>, all the parts I find illuminating as well as the ones I find odious. I can interact with its ideas about capitalism and extremism and religion and western interventionism without getting lost in the weeds of polite innuendo post-Cold War Star Trek often malingered in. (NOTE: I also love Star Trek)</p>
<p><em>Babylon 5</em>’s willingness to engage heavily with the material conditions of the world it depicts is the reason I get nerd snobby about classifying the show as a Space Opera, not! a science fiction show, despite its many fascinating hard sci-fi elements. B5 has some very obvious fantasy trappings—ripped directly from Tolkien here, quoting Arthurian legends there—but what makes it capital-F <em>Fantasy</em> in my opinion is its preoccupation with communicating story and theme through the evocation of historical verisimilitude in its world-building. <em>Babylon 5</em> uses its world to tell a mythic tale with contemporary tools rather than to posit questions about our future. With the philosophical and allegorical framework of the “primary world” removed, the story gets a whole lot easier to swallow.</p>
<p>This convincing world-building is achieved not just through the beauty of the production design, but also through its storytelling format which, for all B5’s pretensions of being a “novel for television”, is actually a hybrid of arc-focused serialization and stand-alone episodes. This was a format that American television was experimenting with a lot at the time, but what makes <em>Babylon 5</em> unique is that it does not separate the two narrative approaches into neat, tidy bins like, say, <em>The X-Files</em> did with its “mythology” and “monster-of-the-week” episodes, which can essentially be watched independently of each other to create two very different television shows starring the same characters. In <em>Babylon 5</em>, lore-heavy episodes often have frivolous B-plots and seemingly inane stand-alone adventures can affect the course of the series in unexpected ways.</p>
<div id="attachment_459405"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459405" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/012.png?resize=560%2C355&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="560" height="355" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459405">Screenshot: Warner Bros.</p></div>
<p>Each episode shows you a new facet of the world. It doesn’t hand you the puzzle pieces in order and it’s not shoving them at you aggressively, begging you to guess its secrets. Season 1 is a world-building venture more than it is a storytelling one, sketching the extremes of the B5 universe’s unique elements in surprising detail, from the depressingly mundane horrors of anti-alien hate crimes and union busting to the startling implication six episodes in that psychic powers can manifest in such a way that they will cause a human being to surpass their physical form and become something akin to a God. In this same episode, we learn that the galaxy is full of “bermuda triangles”—places where people have incomprehensible encounters and, sometimes, disappear.</p>
<p>“There are things in the Universe billions of years older than either of our races,” explains Ambassador G’kar—until this point, presented as a villain, soon proved to be a Cassandra. “They are vast, timeless, and if they are aware of us at all, it is as little more than ants and we have as much chance of communicating with them as an ant has with us.”</p>
<p>The most tense conflict we experience in the episode before this is watching the station’s Commander try to save face coming up with a demonstration of Earth’s religious traditions for a cultural exchange festival while melodramatically distracted by an old girlfriend. It’s this patient see-saw between present-day material conflicts and universe-shattering metaphysical overtones that allow the show’s various foreshadowing elements to pile up almost unnoticed, so that when the first major shake up happens at the end of Season 1 it feels like a genuine gut-punch.</p>
<div id="attachment_459406"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459406" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/013.png?resize=559%2C311&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="559" height="311" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459406">The show has <em>a lot</em> of gut-punches. (Screenshot: Warner Bros.)</p></div>
<p>Amid a tangle of diverging plotlines involving almost every major character on the show, the B5 staff discover signs of an assassination plot within Earth’s Government. They scramble to decode where this evidence leads in a race against the clock that they ultimately lose—by a shockingly wide margin. By the time anyone found indication of foul-play, it was already too late to stop the the gears from turning. <em>“</em>The avalanche has begun,” warns the enigmatic Ambassador Kosh, representative of a species so ancient and advanced that he possesses no corporeal form, “it’s too late for the pebbles to vote”<em>. </em>He’s talking about bigger, older things than the political machinations of Earth-bound xenophobes, but the characters aren’t far enough away from the frame to see the entire picture yet. Earth welcomes the New Year with a sinister change in regime and the protagonists are left empty handed, disbelieved, and alone in the night.</p>
<p>At the time, this episode was shocking because it broke the rules set up by <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, a show that JMS was actively and obviously reacting against. In the 1990s, heroes didn’t fail to the extreme degree that <em>Babylon 5</em>’s protagonists do in that first season finale. The twist remains shocking even now because it still breaks the rules set up by its own premise; an episodic story where the world doesn’t get reset at the end of each episode. And the show <em>continues </em>its mostly episodic pace afterwards, so that the next paradigm shift hits just as hard. And the next one, and the <em>next</em> one, until the entire galaxy is on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>This structure is so effective that even the plot twists and status quo shifts which are poorly foreshadowed, or ill-explained, or <em>over-explained</em> feel natural and world-shaking because <em>Babylon 5</em>’s pace always gives you time to breathe, and the world is so believably <em>lived</em> in, that any crisis that strikes it feels immeasurably more impactful than damage wrought onto a world that we’re meant to understand changes from the get go. By the time the show starts hurtling along a set of <em>truly</em> serialized arcs in Season 4 there’s a feeling that anything could happen. It still feels fresh today, maybe even fresher than it did in the 1990s simply because very few people are making shows like this anymore. Modern serialized television asks you to be a voyeur to the chaos, to consume it as fast as possible, or to consume it as a communal project. You and your friends waiting for the next big bombshell and treating everything between like treading water. A show paced like <em>Babylon 5</em> asks you to come live in those in-between moments. It wants you to watch the chaos from inside the world and to stick with it during the long silences.</p>

<p>And it is <em>very</em> easy to inhabit those silences. <em>Babylon 5</em> has a very particular kind of tonal variety that makes the world inviting—an appealing balance of drama and playfulness. A lot has been said about the show’s occasionally regrettable sense of humour, and there are certainly some epic clunkers in almost every script (the less said about a certain Season 3 episode that effectuates a kooky, sitcom-esque tone while discussing ethnic cleansing the better), but I find myself laughing along with Babylon 5 more often than not. A lot of the humour is character derived, and I love the characters. I really do—I love the contrast between their realistic flaws and depressing personal lives and the cheesy, stage-play poeticism of the dialogue. I know more about the lives of Babylon 5’s senior staff than I know about <em>any </em>Starfleet Officer. They’re all a mess of workaholism, addictions, failed relationships, PTSD, broken paternal bonds—except for shining paragon of All-American Gee Whiz’ism, John Sheridan, who is broken down piece by piece during a war that reveals him to be a ruthless, “means justify the ends”-style General. He grows a beard while being tortured by his own government and never shaves it off. No one’s arc is static. No character ends where they begin. Most characters shed their comfortable roles for new directions on a season by season basis. B5 is a show that flourishes upon rewatch, largely because it’s very satisfying to start over again with all these characters knowing that most of them end up so, so far away from where they begin, in both edifying and tragic ways.</p>
<p><em>Babylon 5</em> is a station full of weirdos and failures. It attracts alien ambassadors with lists of sins ten miles long, disgraced nobles that no one else wants, military officers desperate to either escape their demons or build their careers on their own terms, rejecting the path laid out for them by mentors and patriarchs. It’s the staging point of a successful rebellion, the nucleus of several catastrophically failed peace treaties. It bears witness to the extinction of an entire species and the destruction of the key to immortality. Some dark shit goes down in this show, yet the unflagging ’90s-style optimism and local-theater-esque presentation keeps it from dipping into the kind of “gritty” grim-ness that defined TV spec fiction in the post 9/11 era. And oh, don’t get me wrong. I am a big fan of grimdarkness. I don’t inherently reject it the way a lot of people (understandably) have in the last few years, but I <em>do </em>reject the idea that it’s <em>embarrassing</em> for fantasy to be, well… <em>fanciful</em>. <em>Babylon 5</em> is <em>shamelessly</em> fanciful.</p>

<p>I’ve been very tongue in cheek about the quality of B5’s writing up until this point, but there are lines in this show that have stuck with me for years. I can quote many of them off the top of my head, and I bet every fan of the show can sing along at home:</p>
<blockquote><p>My shoes are too tight, and I’ve forgotten how to dance.</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>Understanding is a three edged sword: your side, their side, and the truth.</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>The wheel turns, does it not?</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>All life is transitory, a dream… if I don’t see you again here, I will see you, in a little while, in a place where no shadows fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s all a game—a paper fantasy of names and borders.</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>I have seen what power does, and I have seen what power costs. The one is never equal to the other.</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>I used to think it was awful that life was so unfair. Then I thought, wouldn’t it be much worse if life were fair, and all the terrible things that happen to us come because we actually deserve them?</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>There comes a time when you look into the mirror and you realize that what you see is all that you will ever be. Then you accept it or you kill yourself or you stop looking into mirrors.</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>Who are you?</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Do you have anything worth living for?</p></blockquote>
<p>* * *</p>
<blockquote><p>Will you lay down your life—not for millions, not for glory, not for fame—but for one person, in the dark, where no one will ever know or see?</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ve talked a lot about politics in this essay, but no piece of art can truly endure solely on what it <em>means</em> in the substantive, theoretical sense. It’s exhilarating to read or watch or play something that was truly prophetic, however those stories are far and few between. Storytellers can’t predict the future, they can only survive it. The further away from the original context of a work we get, the more its ephemeral aspects begin to matter over its literal ones. And the aspect that leaves the deepest impression in the sands of time is always how something <em>feels</em>.</p>
<p><em>Babylon 5</em> remains emotionally evocative in all the places it has become perhaps thematically irrelevant: in the jagged edges of the sets, the stumbling waltz of its plot threads, the lush indulgence of its dialogue, the patchwork aspects held together by glue and determination, as imperfect and brimming with colourful quirks as its most beloved characters. My favourite scenes in the show are the little things: Ivanova’s illegal coffee-plant, Londo and Vir singing Centauri opera together in the station’s hallways, Marcus regailing a beleaguered Doctor Franklin with his nerdy headcanons about which characters in <em>Le Morte d’Arthur</em> he thinks the B5 crew are most like, Delenn and Sheridan telling each other quiet, ordinary anecdotes about their very different childhoods. Babylon 5 is a story that is truly greater than the sum of its parts. Modern plot-driven shows tend to do one thing, and do it <em>very</em> well. Babylon 5 does a little bit of everything: mostly okay, sometimes horribly, and occasionally with an earnest beauty that is almost transcendent.</p>
<p>I think the value of <em>Babylon 5</em>, and indeed its entire thesis statement, is best summed by Ambassador Delenn’s sage invocation of Carl Sagan. She says:</p>
<blockquote><p>“I will tell you a great secret… the molecules of your body are the same molecules that make up this station , and the nebula outside, that burn inside the stars themselves. We are starstuff. We are the universe made manifest, trying to figure itself out.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything is interconnected, the ugly and the beautiful, our triumphs and our mistakes. Our best work and our worst. It’s only when we embrace both that we can leave behind something worth remembering.</p>
<div id="attachment_459410"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-459410" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.tor.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/017.png?resize=559%2C311&amp;type=vertical&amp;quality=100&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="559" height="311" data-recalc-dims="1"></p><p id="caption-attachment-459410">Screenshot: Warner Bros.</p></div>
<blockquote><p>I believe that when we leave a place, part of it goes with us and part of us remains […] when it is quiet, just listen […] you will hear the echoes of all our conversations, every thought and word we’ve exchanged. Long after we are gone our voices will linger in these walls…</p></blockquote>

<p dir="auto">What I Cannot Create, I Do Not Understand -Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">In the spirit of Feynman's immortal words, the goal of this project is to better understand the internals of databases by
implementing a relational database management system (RDBMS) (sqlite clone) from scratch.</p>
<p dir="auto">This project was motivated by a desire to: 1) understand databases more deeply and 2) work on a fun project. These dual
goals led to a:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>relatively simple code base</li>
<li>relatively complete RDBMS implementation</li>
<li>written in pure python
<ul dir="auto">
<li>No build step</li>

</li>
<li>zero configuration
<ul dir="auto">
<li>configuration can be overriden</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p dir="auto">This makes the learndb codebase great for tinkering with. But the product has some key limitations that means it
shouldn't be used as an actual storage solution.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h3>
<p dir="auto">Learndb supports the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">

<li>custom lexer and parser built using <a href="https://github.com/lark-parser/lark"><code>lark</code></a></li>
<li>at a high-level, there is an engine that can accept some SQL statements. These statements expresses operations on a
database (a collection of tables which contain data)</li>
<li>allows users/agents to connect to RDBMS in multiple ways:
<ul dir="auto">
<li>REPL</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Riding in the back seat of a crew-cab pickup truck, 67-year-old vanilla farmer <strong>José Cortéz</strong> peers down a narrow dirt road amid jungle-covered mountains in eastern Mexico, one of the most corrupt regions of North America.</p>
<p>His vanilla farm, a 15-acre expanse just outside Papantla, Veracruz, is up ahead. He calls it his “edible forest.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Papantla is the <strong>birthplace of vanilla</strong>, and Cortéz is part of a small community of farmers from the Totonaco indigenous group who have been cultivating and harvesting the majority of Mexico’s vanilla beans for hundreds of years — beans that some regard as the greatest in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The finest vanilla, the product with the best flavor…comes from Mexico,” wrote the historian <strong>Henry Bruman</strong> in 1948.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the work, already cumbersome because of the difficulty of growing vanilla, now comes with added stress. Cortéz, who usually carries a machete when he visits his farmland, worries about jaguars, pumas, coyotes, and a local bird called the <em>chachalaca</em> destroying his crop. And then there’s the biggest threat of all: <strong>crime</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cortéz has stumbled across armed men walking through the woods on his land. Every year, he hears about thefts of other farmers’ crops. He never hears about vanilla thieves being caught and prosecuted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The justice system in Veracruz can’t be relied on to investigate, punish, or deter criminals, nor has the government launched a major campaign to boost the vanilla industry to help the sector match the recent success of export crops like raspberries and avocados.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means the remaining practitioners of one of Mexico’s oldest agricultural traditions must fend for themselves. On a recent visit, Cortéz told us his method for protecting his harvest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Always bring a shotgun,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cortéz, who’s been farming for 35 years — continuing a family tradition that goes back generations — tends some <strong>10k plants</strong> here. That’s enough to produce <strong>440-660 pounds</strong> of green vanilla beans (the crop that gets processed into vanilla) every year.</p>

<p><em>José Cortéz stands in front of a vanilla plant on his farm in Papantla.</em><strong> </strong><em>(Nathaniel Parish Flannery)</em></p>
<p>Centuries ago, the Totonaco people used the vanilla in perfumes and medicines and for sacred rituals. The Totonacos were conquered in the 15th century by the Aztecs, who used vanilla to flavor chocolate and also wore amulets stuffed with the plant’s aromatic flower petals as necklaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the 17th century that a commercial market emerged for vanilla, and local Totonacos began actively cultivating and collecting the plants’ fragrant bean pods for sale. The spice became a sensation with the Spanish, who conquered the Aztecs, and brought vanilla back to Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major problem then, as it remains today: the difficulty of growing the crop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike other cash crops, vanilla is not suited for growth on large monocrop plantations. It grows best in smaller plots, mixed among other plants.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Growing, cultivating, and preparing vanilla for sale is a hands-on process that can take a full year.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Cortéz plants seedlings, guides their growth, and hand-pollinates the flowers in the spring and prunes and fertilizes the vanilla vines in the summers.</p>
<p>At the end of the year he clips the six- to nine-inch-long vanilla pods, which are filled with thousands of tiny black seeds. Then there’s a month-long drying process under the sun. No part of the endeavor has been mechanized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Timing is key. In the spring, <strong>the flowers bloom for just one day</strong>. If Cortéz doesn’t find them in time, he misses out on valuable vanilla pods.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/bittersweet-story-vanilla-180962757/"><strong>less than 1%</strong> </a>of the world’s vanilla comes from flowers similar to those grown by Cortéz, with the vast majority coming from an artificial process that, according to <em>Smithsonian</em> magazine, has been around since the 19th century and leads to less flavorful vanilla.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in the niche market for real vanilla, Mexico contributes a tiny — and dwindling — share. In the 1930s, the country was responsible for <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2000-jan-22-fi-56403-story.html"><strong>roughly half</strong></a> of the world’s vanilla exports. It recently ranked <a href="https://oec.world/en/profile/bilateral-product/vanilla/reporter/mex"><strong>35th</strong></a>, far behind Madagascar, which led the world by exporting <strong>$619m</strong> in 2021, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simple economics are one reason for vanilla’s decline in Mexico. The crop is largely ignored as a tool for rural economic development because farmers have other options that are easier to grow and pack onto trucks going north to mass-market commercial importers in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Berries, tomatoes, and avocados each represent <strong>billion-dollar Mexican export industries</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for vanilla? Exports officially totaled<a href="https://www.economia.gob.mx/datamexico/en/profile/product/vanilla"> <strong>~$582k</strong> in 2022</a>, although that’s likely an undercount. <strong>Nadja Shumann</strong>, cofounder of the Veracruz exporting company Vanilla Trade, told <em>The Hustle</em> her company alone exported enough vanilla to nearly reach that figure and suggests the national number is at least <strong>10x</strong> higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For vanilla farmers like Cortéz, who number <strong>~1.5k</strong> in Papantla, vanilla is a lifeline.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of them mix vanilla plants among other crops on their land and use vanilla sales — sold to exporters like Shumann — as a supplemental source of undeclared cash income. (In Mexico, the majority of businesses are small, informal, and off the books.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cortéz can earn as much as <strong>$28k</strong> annually from his crop, enough to put him in the top decile of income earners in Veracruz (half of all households in Mexico make less than <strong>$7.8k</strong> per year).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<p>That makes vanilla vital for many local farmers but dispensable to big businesses and the Mexican government. As Veracruz reels from murders, kidnappings, and cartel violence, vanilla theft is simply not a priority for anyone who could stop it.</p>
<h4 id="h-a-uniquely-corrupt-government"><strong>A ‘uniquely corrupt’ government</strong></h4>
<p>How often does vanilla get stolen from local farmers in Mexico?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>A few years ago, Mexican academics gathered to discuss the problem at the Campesino Forum in Mexico City, where professor <strong>Juan Carlos Guzmán Salas</strong> <a href="https://www.proceso.com.mx/nacional/2017/10/10/carteles-acaban-con-la-vainilla-en-mexico-alerta-investigador-de-chapingo-192993.html">estimated</a> <strong>80%</strong> of the country’s growers had experienced theft.&nbsp;</li>
<li>In April, the mayor of Gutierrez Zamora, a town 30 minutes from Papantla, warned that during the months of July and August, local growers <a href="https://jornadaveracruz.com.mx/estado/con-certificacion-intentaran-frenar-el-robo-de-la-vainilla/">report</a> up to <strong>four vanilla robberies every week</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>“At night, there’s nobody at the plantation,” <strong>Juan Salazar</strong>, a 43-year-old vanilla grower and exporter in Papantla, told <em>The Hustle</em>. “People steal. It’s frustrating. It’s a [lot of] work to take care of it, and it can be lost in one night to robbery.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It hasn’t been nearly as easy to catch the culprits. Despite vanilla thefts being well-documented anecdotally, farmers and Mexican legal experts say municipal police and state prosecutors have done little to investigate.</p>
<p>“Veracruz is quite uniquely corrupt, even by the standards of a Mexican state,” said <strong>Stephen Woodman</strong>, a Mexico-based organized crime researcher at Advanced Intelligence Solutions. “It’s run by political bosses, <em>caciques</em>. Veracruz is a hotbed for all sorts of brazen links between organized crime and municipal officials.”</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Km5Vk1zBXS_3xQYrA9UtwPQ_oF5___9-SBeQKE76TINAh2aEaFOQZJ6DA9ifWz023eSPTFtVvLHx6PCiqv0cgzrCkt3w9kILVZLRUXGQGiNKGqODUmlQ84GczRMyA8Tw9XYmQ1F7b8hS28sumLaEvw" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>Dried vanilla with an export value of ~$74k ready to be packed for export inside a vanilla drying facility in Papantla, Veracruz.</em><em> </em><em>(Nathaniel Parish Flannery)</em></p>
<p>Over the last few years, thieves connected to larger organized crime groups in Veracruz <a href="https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/politica/Cuales-son-las-entidades-con-mas-tomas-clandestinas-a-ductos-de-Pemex-20230721-0040.html"><strong>have stolen billions of dollars</strong></a> of fuel from Mexico’s state-owned oil company, Pemex. In 2018, the state’s former governor, Javier Duarte, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/27/javier-duarte-mexico-veracruz-guilty-sentenced-corruption">was sentenced</a> to nine years in prison for racketeering and money laundering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guzmán Salas <a href="https://www.proceso.com.mx/nacional/2017/10/10/carteles-acaban-con-la-vainilla-en-mexico-alerta-investigador-de-chapingo-192993.html">has publicly warned</a> that vanilla thieves could have direct relationships with organized crime syndicates and corrupt business groups that aggregate, process, and export dried vanilla pods and extracts. Cartels have already inserted themselves in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/19/1081948884/mexican-drug-cartels-are-getting-into-the-avocado-and-lime-business">the lime and avocado trade</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But with few arrests for vanilla theft, there’s a serious lack of evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local farmers guess that thefts are carried out by local, low-level criminals rather than by outside organized crime groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The people who steal are locals. It’s small scale. With vanilla, a neighbor can rob you. But it’s not armed robbery,” Salazar said.</p>
<p>Either way, farmers face the consequences. One Veracruz-based grower told <em>The Hustle</em> that it’s taken a toll on the crop’s quality and value, as the fear of theft drives farmers to harvest as soon as possible and buyers to reduce prices.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="h-can-mexico-grow-its-vanilla-industry"><strong>Can Mexico grow its vanilla industry?</strong></h4>
<p>To combat theft, one local politician in Veracruz has proposed creating a registry of producers to certify the legal provenance of vanilla bought and sold in the state.</p>
<p>It’s similar to a tactic in Madagascar, where producers have reduced the incentive for theft by “branding” their individual pods with producer-specific numbers that provide a paper trail for sourcing.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/FV4i7ce0k4kBWTbAcML_MPcTI2kAPqok0PjWcnYkorj9pWjOWelmH3I4oiQ4L2ukVwrfobMjandtbfPtuMdLDnLecRZpuUpO5LTewlASWi3laPfHygKjHAMi_CvtgP3JS4NQumSxxeqbsUu7VDNJgQ" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>The Hustle</em></p>
<p>Despite theft concerns, supporters of Mexican vanilla are bullish on the crop’s revival.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Mexico’s Ministry of Agriculture <a href="https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/257086/Potencial-Vainilla.pdf">calculates</a> that if producers used improved cultivation methods, the country could export 234 tonnes of vanilla worth <strong>~$8 million by 2030</strong> while using basically the same amount of land. That’s roughly <strong>20x more</strong> than the baseline estimate of what Shumann, the exporter with Vanilla Trade, believes the country exports today.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Savvy producers like <strong>Lizbeth Jiménez</strong>, the 33-year-old owner of Cosecha Totonaco in Papantla, have started <strong>selling directly to international buyers</strong>, bypassing traditional aggregators and processors who act as middlemen.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Jiménez’s farm produces around 150 pounds of dried vanilla annually, which she can sell for as much as <strong>$19k</strong>. She also dries, processes, and sells green vanilla that she buys wholesale from local farmers.</p>
<p>Her biggest sale last year was a bulk order for 440 pounds, which she sold for just over <strong>$69k</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hmDrmMVyZZgsgDpb0Y4Qh1LCpGHZhpLzFLCcMBxgSeobmmd_OVOzpDU760cXNYB_oeWnlAnhRIJtCsLicQl5QFW2O7oQkZ74tUUC50LIO-MpGZ2CF-pYTnH_4pbZD1g9WVub2zuAkdYiI4F0iWVVow" alt="" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='0'%20height='0'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></figure>
<p><em>Lizbeth Jim</em>é<em>nez, the owner of Cosecha Totonaco, a Papantla company that dries, processes, and exports vanilla, holds up a small package of dried vanilla worth $468.</em><em> </em><em>(Nathaniel Parish Flannery)</em></p>
<p>But many farmers are wary of growing the industry. Securing business loans and developing modern, intensive growing techniques would require producers to create formal businesses, hire accountants, and pay taxes on their income.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there’s the crime problem: Producers must already contend with theft. More output might draw scrutiny from cartels, a la the lime and avocado industries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it shakes out, Cortéz knows he’ll continue working on his farm, just like his parents and grandparents and the generations before them — harvesting with a shotgun nearby.</p>
<p>“I’ll never stop planting vanilla,” he said. “It’s my culture and it’s my main source of income.”</p>

<p>ZFSBootMenu is a bootloader that provides a powerful and flexible discovery, manipulation and booting of Linux on ZFS.
Originally inspired by the FreeBSD bootloader, ZFSBootMenu leverages the features of modern OpenZFS to allow users to
choose among multiple "boot environments" (which may represent different versions of a Linux distribution, earlier
snapshots of a common root, or entirely different distributions), manipulate snapshots in a pre-boot environment and,
for the adventurous user, even bootstrap a system installation via <code><span>zfs</span> <span>recv</span></code>.</p>
<p>In essence, ZFSBootMenu is a small, self-contained Linux system that knows how to find other Linux kernels and initramfs
images within ZFS filesystems. When a suitable kernel and initramfs are identified (either through an automatic process
or direct user selection), ZFSBootMenu launches that kernel using the <code><span>kexec</span></code> command.</p>

<p>In broad strokes, ZFSBootMenu works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Via direct EFI booting, an EFI boot manager like <code><span>rEFInd</span></code>, a BIOS bootloader like <code><span>syslinux</span></code>, or some other means,
boot a ZFSBootMenu image (as either a self-contained UEFI application or a dedicated Linux kernel and initramfs).</p></li>
<li><p>Find all healthy ZFS pools and import them (or, at the user's option, find and import only a specific pool).</p></li>
<li><p>If appropriate, select a preferred boot environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the ZFSBootMenu command line specifies a pool preference, and that pool has been imported, prefer the filesystem
indicated by its <code><span>bootfs</span></code> property (if defined).</p></li>
<li><p>If the ZFSBootMenu command line specifies no pool preference or the preferred pool is not found, prefer the
filesystem indicated by the <code><span>bootfs</span></code> property (if defined) on the first-found pool.</p></li>
<li><p>If a suitable <code><span>bootfs</span></code> has been identified, start an interruptable countdown (by default, 10 seconds) to
automatically boot that environment.</p></li>
<li><p>If no <code><span>bootfs</span></code> value can be identified or the automatic countdown was interrupted, search all imported pools for
filesystems that set <code><span>mountpoint=/</span></code> and contain Linux kernels and initramfs images in their <code><span>/boot</span></code>
subdirectories. Present a list of matching environments for user selection via <code><span>fzf</span></code>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mount the filesystem representing the selected boot environment and find either the highest versioned kernel or a
specifically selected kernel version in its <code><span>/boot</span></code> directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Using <code><span>kexec</span></code>, load the selected kernel and its initramfs image into memory, setting the kernel command line with
the contents of the <code><span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline</span></code> property for that filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Unmount all ZFS filesystems.</p></li>
<li><p>Boot the final kernel and initramfs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, the system will be booting into your usual OS-managed kernel and initramfs, along with any arguments
needed to correctly boot your system.</p>
<p>Whenever ZFSBootMenu encounters natively encrypted ZFS filesystems that it intends to scan for boot environments, it
will prompt the user to enter a passphrase as necessary.</p>
<section id="distribution-agnostic">
<h2>Distribution Agnostic<a href="#distribution-agnostic" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>ZFSBootMenu is capable of booting just about any Linux distribution. Major distributions that are known to boot without
requiring any special configuration include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Void</p></li>
<li><p>Arch</p></li>
<li><p>Alpine</p></li>
<li><p>Gentoo</p></li>
<li><p>Fedora</p></li>
<li><p>Debian and its descendants (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Devuan, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Red Hat and its descendants (RHEL, CentOS, etc.) are expected to work as well but have never been tested.</p>
<p>ZFSBootMenu provides several configuration options that can be used to fine-tune the boot process for nonstandard
configurations.</p>
</section>
<section id="easily-deployed-and-extensively-configurable">
<h2>Easily Deployed and Extensively Configurable<a href="#easily-deployed-and-extensively-configurable" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Each release includes pre-generated boot images, based on Void Linux, that should work for the majority of users. Images
are distributed for <code><span>x86_64</span></code> platforms both as monolithic UEFI applications as well a separate kernel an initramfs
image that are suitable for use on both UEFI and legacy BIOS systems. Users of other platforms or that require custom
configurations can build local images, running the ZFSBootMenu image generator either in a host installation or in the
controlled environment of an OCI (Docker) container.</p>
<p>Modern UEFI platforms provide a wide range of <a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/guides/general/uefi-booting.html"><span>options for launching ZFSBootmenu</span></a>.
For legacy BIOS systems, <code><span>syslinux</span></code> is a convenient choice. A
<a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/guides/void-linux/syslinux-mbr.html"><span>syslinux guide for Void Linux</span></a> describes the <code><span>syslinux</span></code>
installation and configuration process in the context of a broader Void Linux installation.</p>
<section id="local-installation">
<h3>Local Installation<a href="#local-installation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The ZFSBootMenu repository includes a <a href="https://github.com/zbm-dev/zfsbootmenu/blob/v2.2.0/Makefile">Makefile</a> with targets to install the
<a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/man/generate-zbm.8.html"><span>generate-zbm</span></a> builder, all necessary components, manual pages and some convenient helpers. A
local ZFSBootMenu installation requires some additional software that may be available as packages in your distribution
or may need to be manually installed. The following components are required or recommended for inclusion in the
bootloader image:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/horms/kexec-tools">kexec-tools</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.maier-komor.de/mbuffer.html">mbuffer</a> (recommended, but not required)</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In addition, <code><span>generate-zbm</span></code> requires a few Perl modules:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Sort::Versions">perl Sort::Versions</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/YAML::PP">perl YAML::PP</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/boolean">perl boolean</a></p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>If you will create unified EFI executables (which bundles the kernel, initramfs and command line), you will also need a
an EFI stub loader, which is typically included with
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/systemd-boot/">systemd-boot</a> or
<a href="https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/main/x86/gummiboot">gummiboot</a>.</p>
<p>Most or all of these software components may be available as packages in your distribution.</p>
<p>Locally created ZFSBootMenu images use your your regular system kernel, ZFS drivers and user-space utilities. The
ZFSBootMenu image is constructed using standard Linux initramfs generators. ZFSBootMenu is known to work and is
explicitly supported with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/dracutdevs/dracut">dracut</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/archlinux/mkinitcpio">mkinitcpio</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Building a custom image is known to work in the following configurations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>With <code><span>mkinitcpio</span></code> or <code><span>dracut</span></code> on Void (the <code><span>zfsbootmenu</span></code> package will make sure all prerequisites are available)</p></li>
<li><p>With <code><span>mkinitcpio</span></code> or <code><span>dracut</span></code> on Arch</p></li>
<li><p>With <code><span>dracut</span></code> on Debian or Ubuntu (installed as <code><span>dracut-core</span></code> to avoid replacing the system <code><span>initramfs-tools</span></code> setup)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Configuration of the ZFSBootMenu build process is accomplished via a <a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/man/generate-zbm.5.html"><span>YAML configuration file</span></a>
for <code><span>generate-zbm</span></code>.</p>
</section>
<section id="building-in-a-container">
<h3>Building in a Container<a href="#building-in-a-container" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The official ZFSBootMenu release images are built in a standard Void Linux OCI container that provides a predictable
environment that is known to be supported with ZFSBootMenu. The container entrypoint provides full access to all of the
configurability of ZFSBootMenu, and a helper script simplifies the process or running the container and managing the
images that it produces. The <a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/guides/general/container-building.html"><span>ZFSBootMenu container guide</span></a> provides a detailed
description of the containerized build process as well as a straightforward example of local image management using the
helper script.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="zfs-boot-environments">
<h2>ZFS Boot Environments<a href="#zfs-boot-environments" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The concept of a "boot environment" is very loosely defined in ZFSBootMenu. Fundamentally, ZFSBootMenu treats any
filesystem that appears to be an operating system root and contains an identifiable Linux kernel and initramfs as a boot
environment. A <a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/guides/general/bootenvs-and-you.html"><span>primer</span></a> provides more details about the identification process.</p>
<section id="command-line-arguments">
<h3>Command-Line Arguments<a href="#command-line-arguments" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>When booting a particular enviornment, ZFSBootMenu reads the <code><span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline</span></code>
<a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/man/zfsbootmenu.7.html#zfs-properties"><span>property</span></a> for that filesystem to discover kernel command-line arguments that should be passed to
the kernel it will boot.</p>
<div>
<p>Note</p>
<p>Do not set a <code><span>root=</span></code> option (or any similar indicator of the root filesystem) in this property; ZFSBootMenu will add
an appropriate <code><span>root=</span></code> argument when it boots the environment and will actively suppress any conflicting option.</p>
</div>
<p>Because ZFS properties are inherited by default, it is possible to set the <code><span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline</span></code> property on a
common parent to apply the same KCL arguments to multiple environments. Setting the property locally on individual boot
environments will override the common defaults.</p>
<p>As a special accommodation, the substitution keyword <code><span>%{parent}</span></code> in the KCL property will be recursively expanded to
whatever the value of <code><span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline</span></code> would be on the parent dataset. This allows, for example, mixing
options common to multiple environments with those specific to each:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>zfs<span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline<span>=</span><span>""</span>zfs.zfs_arc_max<span>=</span><span>8589934592</span><span>""</span><span> </span>zroot/ROOT
zfs<span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline<span>=</span><span>"%{parent} loglevel=4"</span><span> </span>zroot/ROOT/void.2019.11.01
zfs<span> </span><span>set</span><span> </span>org.zfsbootmenu:commandline<span>=</span><span>"loglevel=7 %{parent}"</span><span> </span>zroot/ROOT/void.2019.10.04
</pre></div>
<p>will cause ZFSBootMenu to interpret the KCL for <code><span>zroot/ROOT/void.2019.11.01</span></code> as:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>zfs.zfs_arc_max<span>=</span><span>8589934592</span><span> </span><span>loglevel</span><span>=</span><span>4</span>
</pre></div>
<p>while the KCL for <code><span>zroot/ROOT/void.2019.10.04</span></code> would be:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>loglevel</span><span>=</span><span>7</span><span> </span>zfs.zfs_arc_max<span>=</span><span>8589934592</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To simplify the manipulation of command-line parameters for boot environments, the <a href="https://docs.zfsbootmenu.org/en/v2.2.x/man/zbm-kcl.8.html"><span>zbm-kcl</span></a> helper

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
								
<p>There’s no denying that the browser is the single-most important application on any operating system, whether that be on desktops and laptops or on mobile devices. Without a capable, fast, and solid browser, the usefulness of an operating system decreases exponentially, to the point where I’m quite sure virtually nobody’s going to use an operating system for regular, normal use if it doesn’t have a browser. Having an at least somewhat useable browser is what elevates an operating system from a hobby toy to something you could use for more than 10 minutes as a fun novelty.</p>



<p>The problem here is that making a capable browser is actually incredibly hard, as the browser has become a hugely capable platform all of its own. Undertaking the mammoth task of building a browser from scratch is not something a lot of people are interested in – <a href="https://www.ladybird.dev/">save for the crazy ones</a> – made worse by the fact that competing with the three remaining browser engines is basically futile due to market consolidation and monopolisation. Chrome and its various derivatives are <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share">vastly dominant</a>, followed by Safari on iOS, if only because you can’t use anything else on iOS. And then there’s Firefox, trailing far behind as a distant third – and falling.</p>



<p>This is the environment desktop Linux distributions find themselves in. For the longest time now, desktop Linux has relied virtually exclusively on shipping Firefox – and the Mozilla suite before that – as their browser, with some users opting to download Chrome post-install. While both GNOME and KDE nominally invest in their own two browsers, <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Web">GNOME Web</a> and <a href="https://www.falkon.org/">Falkon</a>, their uptake is limited and releases few and far between. For instance, none of the major Linux distributions ship GNOME Web as their default browser, and it lacks many of the features users come to expect from a browser. Falkon, meanwhile, is updated only sporadically, often going years between releases. Worse yet, Falkon uses Chromium through <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine">QtWebEngine</a>, and GNOME Web uses WebKit (which are updated separately from the browser, so browser releases are not always a solid metric!), so both are dependent on the goodwill of two of the most ruthless corporations in the world, Google and Apple respectively.</p>



<p>Even Firefox itself, even though it’s clearly the browser of choice of distributions and Linux users alike, does not consider Linux a first-tier platform. Firefox is first and foremost a Windows browser, followed by macOS second, and Linux third. The love the Linux world has for Firefox is not reciprocated by Mozilla in the same way, and this shows in various places where issues fixed and addressed on the Windows side are ignored on the Linux side for years or longer.</p>



<p>The best and most visible example of that is hardware video acceleration. This feature has been a default part of the Windows version since forever, but it wasn’t enabled by default for Linux until <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2023/07/firefox-115-intel-gpu-video-decoding-on-linux">Firefox 115</a>, released only in early July 2023. Even then, the feature is only enabled by default for users of Intel graphics – AMD and Nvidia users need not apply. This lack of video acceleration was – and for AMD and Nvidia users, still is – a major contributing factor to Linux battery life on laptops taking a serious hit compared to their Windows counterparts.</p>



<p>The road to even getting here has been a long, hard, and bumpy one. For years and years now, getting video acceleration to work on Firefox for Linux was complicated and unreliable, with every release of the browser possibly changing what flags you needed to set, and sometimes it would just stop working for several releases in a row altogether, no matter what you did. There’s a venerable encyclopaedia of forum messages, blog posts, and website articles with outdated instructions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hail_Mary">Hail Mary</a>-like suggestions for users trying to get it to work. Conventional wisdom would change with every release, and keeping track of it all was a nightmare.</p>



<p>It’s not just hardware accelerated video decoding. Gesture support has taken much longer to arrive on the Linux version than it did on the Windows version – things like using swipes to go back and forward, or pinch to zoom on images. Similarly, touchscreen support took a longer time to arrive on the Linux version of Firefox, too. Often, such features could be enabled with about:config incantations for years before becoming enabled by default, at least, but that’s far from an ideal situation.</p>



<p>With desktop Linux trailing both Windows and macOS in popularity, there’s nothing unexpected or inherently malicious about this, and the point of the previous few paragraphs is not to complain about the state of Firefox for Linux or to suggest Mozilla transfers precious resources from the Windows and macOS versions to the Linux version. While I obviously wouldn’t complain if they did so, it wouldn’t make much sense. The real reason I’m highlighting these issues is that if Firefox for Linux is already treated as a third wheel today, with Mozilla’s current financial means and resources, what would happen if Mozilla saw a drastic reduction in its financial means and resources?</p>



<p>Firefox is not doing well. Its market share has dropped radically over the years, and now sits at a meagre 3% on desktops and laptops, and a negligible 0.5% on mobile. Chrome and to a lesser extent Safari have trampled all over the venerable browser, to a point where it’s effectively an also-ran for Linux/BSD users, and a few more nerds on other platforms. I’m not saying this to disparage those who use Firefox – I’m one of them – but to underline just how dire Firefox’ current market position really is. This shrinking market share must already be harming the development and future prospects of Firefox, especially if the slide continues.</p>



<p>The declining market share is far from the biggest problem, however. The giant sword of Damocles dangling above Firefox’ head are Mozilla’s really odd and lopsided revenue sources. As most of us are probably aware, Mozilla makes most of its money from a search deal with Google. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-05/why-google-keeps-paying-mozilla-s-firefox-even-as-chrome-dominates">Roughly 80% of Mozilla’s revenue comes from Google</a>, who pays the browser maker to set Google Search as the default search engine.</p>



<p>How long will this deal continue? Will it be renewed indefinitely, regardless of how much farther Firefox slides into irrelevance? Will the size of the deal drop, or will it end altogether? When will Google decide that spending hundreds of millions of dollars every year in what is essentially charity for a competitor is no longer worth it, or needed? Google’s similar search deal with Apple is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-apple-search-deal-doj-antitrust-suit-2020-10?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T">already facing legal scrutiny</a>; will that scrutiny have consequences for the deal with Mozilla, too?</p>



<p>Just ask yourself this question – if Mozilla’s funding dries up because Firefox’ market share declines further, the Google deal falls through, a combination of the two, or even other factors not mentioned here – <em>which version of Firefox is going to feel the cuts first</em>? What will Mozilla do to soften the blow? Are we going to see sleazy deals with other companies as Mozilla grows increasingly desperate? Shady crypto nonsense? “Allowed” ads in exchange for revenue? More suggested websites and extensions, for a price? Or will the Linux version just get cut entirely, left to the community to take over?</p>



<p>Exactly this <a href="https://www.osnews.com/story/26159/mozilla-to-cease-development-on-thunderbird/">happened to Thunderbird</a>. It took Thunderbird almost a decade to fully recover. This could happen to Firefox for Linux, too.</p>



<p>This is desktop Linux’ Firefox problem. The single most important desktop Linux application is already in dire straits, and it seems inevitable that things are only going to get worse from here on out. Yet, I don’t see anyone talking about this problem, or planning for the eventual possible demise of Firefox, what that would mean for the Linux desktop, and how it can be avoided or mitigated.</p>



<p>In an ideal world, the major stakeholders of the Linux desktop – KDE, GNOME, the various major distributions – would get together and seriously consider a plan of action. The best possible solution, in my view, would be to fork one of the major browser engines (or pick one and significantly invest in it), and modify this engine and tailor it specifically for the Linux desktop. Stop living off the scraps and leftovers thrown across the fence from Windows and macOS browser makers, and focus entirely on making a browser engine that is optimised fully for Linux, its graphics stack, and its desktops. Have the major stakeholders work together on a Linux-first – or even Linux-only – browser engine, leaving the graphical front-end to the various toolkits and desktop environments.</p>



<p>Obviously, this won’t be easy, and will take serious investments in time, resources, and people. However, by focusing entirely on Linux alone, you wouldn’t really be competing with Blink and WebKit, who don’t take desktop Linux seriously at all (Chrome still doesn’t have hardware video acceleration on Linux). Let those other engines fight for the various proprietary platforms – Linux needs a browser engine that is independent of Google (and Apple), and takes Linux seriously as a platform.</p>



<p>I’m genuinely worried about the state of browsers on Linux, and the future of Firefox on Linux in particular. I think it’s highly irresponsible of the various prominent players in the desktop Linux community, from GNOME to KDE, from Ubuntu to Fedora, to seemingly have absolutely zero contingency plans for when Firefox enshittifies or dies, despite everything we know about the current state of the browser market, the state of Mozilla’s finances, and the future prospects of both.</p>



<p>Desktop Linux has a Firefox problem, but nobody seems willing to acknowledge it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<blockquote>
<p>If you succeed, you will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something said at a client engagement I was at some time ago. I figure enough time has passed that it is worth sharing this story.</p>
<p>One of the early engagements was to deliver for a very large company an iOS Application powered by a RESTful API. This was problematic due to what is common for every large organisation, a collection of older legacy backends. Some with their own API’s, and bizzare authentication processes. Part of the deliverable was also working with push notifications for things like billing updates, documenting the systems (since few people knew how everything worked) and load testing.</p>
<p>Delivering the API… looking back had some pain points, but nothing exceptional. After 6 months of development, we had built out a full AWS environment, including deployment pipelines for all infrastructure, the API, with tests, monitoring and such. The authentication process was particularly bizarre in the way it worked. It was what I would expect OAuth to work like, if you faxed the details of it a few times before handing over the final copy to someone to implement. It worked, but was bespoke.</p>
<p>Early on we had discussed performance. The company insisted that they were going to advertise the app pretty heavily and with their expected customer base that tens of thousands of customers would login and use the application within a few days. Further prodding, with estimates based on existing load and such we settled on a target of about 100 RPS.</p>
<p>For the portions that we were in control of this was easy. We have built out using AWS API-GW with Lambda. So we got 300 concurrent lambdas per endpoint by default. Since most requests were processed in 100ms or so we could comfortably deliver over 1,000 RPS without actually having to do anything.</p>
<p>Where we needed to talk to backend systems was a different story however. SAP was the system driving the business and it had most of the integration we had to work with. The lead developer for the system was a fairly nasty piece of work. He was not the most incompetent person I had ever worked with, in fact far from it. But he is certainly one of the most hostile.</p>
<p>There were multiple ways to query his system, and getting straight answers as to the most efficient way to do so was met with “well you could do that”. In short he was actively trying to sabotage the project, even pointing out his system offered an API already, so why build another? Ignoring of course that we integrated with multiple systems, and were managing things like push notifications.</p>
<p>Anyway once we added load tests for anything that depended on SAP it became apparent that the downstream systems could deliver something like 25-50 RPS depending on what we were querying for. Optimisation of the calls had already been done at this point, with his insistence as to things being slow met with “Well its processing a lot of data” and “We don’t have AWS so we cannot be lazy and have to optimise properly”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to halt the release till this is resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pointing out that this was going to be problematic eventually resulted in an upgrade of the SAP systems. At which point they could perform over 100 RPS and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>However there is always a bottleneck. You just remove one to uncover another.</p>
<p>However, remember that oddly implemented authentication system? Because of quirks with how it was implemented it meant when tokens to it expired, they expired at once for every user. Also with the release coming there was going to be a huge amount of requests to start. When this was load tested it became apparent it could only sustain about 5 RPS.</p>
<p>This became a huge issue, especially once we started load testing against staging which was the closest environment to production. Whenever we load tested, not only would staging go down for hours once it had tipped over, production would soon follow. This resulted in a lot of massive conference calls with myself and a few others running an automated script to fire the requests, while an army of op’s and developers would monitor systems to work out the problem.</p>
<p>Turned out that at some point someone had configured the production network systems to fall over to staging in the event of a failure. However they had also configured the reverse. This took a few weeks to discover why however. Now this would probably be fine were it limited to the app, but it actually ended up taking down the production web application at the same time. The best part? We weren’t even load testing in a distributed way. In fact most of our “load” tests were run on a single EC2 instance, or even local laptop over WiFi. We realised that we could probably take down the system, on prem or remotely using a raspberry pi and a ADSL2+ connection.</p>
<p>Even more alarming was that when this was done it would take down the web portal application used by customers around the country.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to halt the release till this is resolved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having already heard this, clearly it fell on deaf ears. After all, they already upgraded… So why do it again?</p>
<p>The release date was fixed, and going ahead no matter what. No amount of discussion or push back could change their mind. It was then someone (I don’t even know if it was me) pointed out in a meeting that, if as many people as they want or expect use the system on the release, it’s going to be a success in terms of users, and then an epic fail when the system falls over.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you succeed, you will fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We ended up trying to cover our company by sending out an email listing the problems, what the likely result was and asking for their acceptance of this outcome. Which I think we got.</p>
<p>Sadly it did happen just as expected. There was a large party celebrating the launch, and while many were eating cupcakes and drinking sparkling wine to celebrate, I and my colleagues were watching the production system crash and burn. Eventually we had to severely limit the login using API-GW before calling it a day and going home.</p>
<p>I think the worst thing was knowing that a new authentication system was just weeks away. Which would have ensured this would not happen.</p>
<p>Several weeks later we were out. Considering we had delivered I was not too upset by this, although I do wish it had been the success that we all wanted to be.</p>
<p>I learnt a few things from this. The first is, some companies or organisations within them need failure in order to progress. Warnings, no matter how prophetic, are seen as being unhelpful and negative. Blind optimism up till the failure is their modus operandi. Fall back on blaming the process when failure comes around and avoid ever pointing fingers or owning it.</p>
<p>I also learnt to only become as involved and care as much as the customer. If they aren’t willing to go that extra mile then why should I?</p>
<p>Am I a bitter person because of this experience? Not really. I still have enthusiasm for projects and helping out. But I am far wiser as to when I care as much as I did this time.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>HP all-in-one printer owners, upset that their devices wouldn't scan or fax when low on ink, were handed a partial win in a northern California court this week after a judge denied HP's motion to dismiss their suit.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs argued in their amended class action <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/11/freund-hp-amended-complaint.pdf" rel="nofollow">complaint</a> [PDF] that HP withheld vital information by including software in its all-in-one printer/scanner/fax machines that disabled non-printing functions when out of ink and not telling buyers that was the case.</p>
<p>"It is well-documented that ink is not required in order to scan or to fax a document, and it is certainly possible to manufacture an All-in-One printer that scans or faxes when the device is out of ink," the plaintiffs argued in their complaint. The amended complaint was filed in February this year after US federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman dismissed the suit on the grounds that it hadn't properly stated a claim.</p>

    

<p>Armed with their amended complaint, lawyers for San Francsican Gary Freund and Minneapolis resident Wayne McMath have succeeded at not only making relevant claims, but also surviving an attempt by HP to have the entire case dismissed for a second time.&nbsp;</p>

        


        

<p>In the amended complaint, Freund and McMath's lawyers argue that HP's move to disable devices that were low on ink was intentional, citing HP's own comments from a support forum post in which an HP support agent told a user complaining of similar issues that their "HP printer is designed in such a way that with the empty cartridge or without the cartridge [the] printer will not function."&nbsp;</p>
<p>"At this stage, the message board post amounts to a factual allegation that bolster plaintiffs' allegations that HP designed its printers to disable certain functions when their ink is depleted," Judge Freeman said in her <a href="https://regmedia.co.uk/2023/08/11/freund-hp-judge-order.pdf" rel="nofollow">order</a> [PDF] handed down yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/09/13/hp_euconsumers_settlement_dynamic_security_printers_third_party_supplies/">HP pays $1.3m to settle dispute over printer security chip</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/11/23/hp_inc_q4_2022/">HP Inc to lay off up to 6,000 staff, cut costs by $1.4 billion</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/04/28/hp_ink_officejet_drm/">Florida man might just stick it to HP for injecting sneaky DRM update into his printers that rejected non-HP ink</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/11/12/hp_free_printing/">HP: That print-free-for-life deal we promised you? Well, now it's pay-per-month to continue using your printer ink</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Judge Freeman found the plaintiffs had "adequately" described "the alleged defect and HP's knowledge of that defect," they had adequately pleaded that HP had a duty to disclose the restrictions, and that the defect occurred within the warranty period since the devices were shipped with ink cartridge limitations for non-printing features.</p>
<p>Judge Freeman allowed other claims to stand as well, only dismissing the plaintiffs' request for equitable restitution under the Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act. Otherwise, Freeman said, "these allegations are sufficient" to allow the case to proceed.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>This isn't the first time HP has been taken to court over claims it improperly locked printers down. In 2022 the IT giant settled a European lawsuit for $1.35 million alleging it used security chips and DRM-like software to prevent any third-party cartridges from functioning in HP printers. The US corporation has dealt with similar cases in Australia and America, which were settled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HP hasn't responded to our questions about the latest lawsuit.</p>
<p>Canon, another printer manufacturer that sells all-in-one devices, was <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/19/canon_lawsuit_ink/">sued</a> in 2021 for the exact same reasons as Freund and McMath's suit against HP - that Canon all-in-ones disabled non-printing functions when ink was low. That case was settled late last year for an undisclosed sum. ®</p>

<p>It has been a bit of a tumultuous summer for the project, but now things are returning to normalcy.  For those who somehow missed it, the Dolphin on Steam project <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/07/20/what-happened-to-dolphin-on-steam/">has ceased</a> after contact between Valve and Nintendo.  Though we disagree with their stance and decision, we respect Valve's right to impose whatever restrictions they want within their private storefront. Please read the full article for details.</p>


<p>Fortunately, all that means is that nothing is going to change. We're going to continue working hard to improve Dolphin and make it the best emulator it can be. </p>
<p>Speaking of which, we hope you enjoy this Dolphin Progress Report!</p>

<p><img src="https://dolphin-emu.org/m/user/blog/progress-report/2017-april/android-logo-peeking.png"></p>

<p>GPU drivers for Android devices have come a long way from the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2013/09/26/dolphin-emulator-and-opengl-drivers-hall-fameshame/">nightmare they once were</a>, but they still lag behind their desktop counterparts in many ways. Missing features, performance problems, and plain old bugs are still plentiful on Android drivers. Furthermore, while drivers are improving over time, these improvements <a href="https://www.esper.io/blog/android-dessert-bites-14-gpu-driver-updates-3819534">rarely make their way to existing devices</a>, which is considerably worse than desktop. However, for Dolphin, Android GPU drivers are now at least good enough to <em>work</em> most of the time. There may be bugs or issues, but usually you'll get an image and the emulated title will function.</p>
<p>Emulators for newer consoles weren't so lucky, however, and Android drivers have been an intense pain point for them. This spurred <strong><a href="https://github.com/bylaws">ByLaws</a></strong> to take action and develop the library <a href="https://github.com/bylaws/libadrenotools">libadrenotools</a>, which lets apps temporarily switch out the system driver for a user-provided driver. libadrenotools has tremendously improved the experience of emulating newer consoles on Android devices, as not only does it allow loading of newer versions of official drivers, but it also allows the loading of <em>unofficial</em> open source drivers that are substantially better than their official counterparts. Specifically of note is Freedreno Vulkan, also known as Turnip.  It's a custom driver primarily for Adreno 600 GPUs (though support for Adreno 700 GPUs is in development as well) that is by far the most complete Vulkan driver available for Adreno.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/K0bin">K0bin</a></strong> saw all of the improvements that libadrenotools and Turnip granted other emulators and realized that Dolphin could take advantage of them too. With this change, libadrenotools is now integrated into Dolphin, allowing Android users to choose which Vulkan GPU drivers they prefer. While Android driver issues were not as critical for us, the Freedreno driver is a breath of fresh air.  Tons of Vulkan issues that have plagued our Adreno users are <em>gone</em> when using it.</p>


<p>If your GPU is among those supported, Turnip offers an opportunity to get a driver that's much closer to desktop quality.  However, we've only been talking about compatibility and bugs so far. How does Turnip compare to the official drivers in performance? Well, performance can be better, but it isn't always going to be.  Sometimes the more complete implementation of features allows Dolphin to go faster than other drivers, sometimes the fact it's able to emulate things in a more complete manner means that the game might run a little slower.  And, of course, the driver might not implement all features optimally, causing some variations that are out of the control of Dolphin.</p>
<p>Using an older phone, we can compare the Turnip driver to the latest supported Adreno driver and compare performance.  We also compared to the Adreno OpenGL driver - as Turnip is for Vulkan only.  All tests were done at 1x internal resolution in order to test the raw efficiency of the driver to keep maximum performance.</p>

<p>The results vary quite a bit, with a different driver being faster for each game!  However, for the most part performance is pretty similar between the different backends with the main benefit being that Turnip mostly just works.  While there are the occasional bugs, much like with the <em>official</em> Adreno drivers, overall Turnip provides a more consistent experience.  And with it under active development, the problems we have seen are likely to get fixed.</p>
<h5 id="a-note-to-non-adreno-users">A Note to Non-Adreno Users<a href="#a-note-to-non-adreno-users" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>There is nothing fundamentally Adreno-specific about loading custom drivers.  Unfortunately for users with other GPUs, there aren't any viable custom drivers at this time.  If custom drivers do show up for these devices, we'll be able to update Dolphin to load them.</p>
<h4 id="50-19274-add-wiiconnect24-support-via-wiilink-by-sketch"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19724/">5.0-19274 - Add WiiConnect24 Support via WiiLink</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong><a href="#50-19274-add-wiiconnect24-support-via-wiilink-by-sketch" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>When WiiConnect24 shut down so suddenly just over ten years ago in June of 2013, there was a thought among Dolphin developers that WiiConnect24 would never be emulated - at least in Dolphin.  For nearly 10 years, <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2022/12/21/dolphin-progress-report-september-october-november-2022/#50-17613-implement-missing-features-for-wiiconnect24-support-by-noahpistilli">that remained true</a>.  However, a lot of the core features of WiiConnect24 were still missing in Dolphin, and setting it up required use of third party tools to patch channels.</p>
<p>In the latest builds of Dolphin, users can now enable WiiConnect24 directly in Dolphin's GUI, allowing you to use the Forecast Channel, Nintendo Channel, and soon the News Channel and Everybody Votes Channel directly in the system menu without the need for patching channel files.  This is all thanks to <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong> (aka noahpistilli) who is both implementing critical features in Dolphin's Network/KD and reimplementing the servers which the channels themselves communicate with as the lead developer of <a href="https://www.wiilink24.com/">WiiLink</a>.</p>
<p>This marriage between the two sides of development has led to a WiiConnect24 revolution within Dolphin, and more features will be coming online in the future.</p>


<p>With Dolphin adding support for WiiLink, does this mean RiiConnect24 will not work in Dolphin?  Of course not!  The same methods used to patch channels with RiiConnect24 will continue to work in the latest versions of Dolphin.</p>
<p>Choosing between WiiLink and RiiConnect24 for a default service was not an easy task.  RiiConnect24 has been an invaluable part of the WiiConnect24 preservation scene and will continue to work in Dolphin.  However, with <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong> working on both the server side (WiiLink) and the client side (Dolphin), compatibility and stability is currently higher with WiiLink.  As well, there are some features of RiiConnect24 that use cIOS features that do not currently work in Dolphin that are handled without cIOSes in WiiLink.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that Dolphin's priority is to emulate <strong>WiiConnect24</strong> to the best of its ability.  Currently, <strong><a href="https://github.com/noahpistilli">Sketch</a></strong> is reimplementing WiiConnect24 features in a manner that would work alike to the original WiiConnect24 servers.  We are aware that some bugs/inaccuracies in Dolphin's implementation of Network/KD that, when fixed, will require changes from RiiConnect24 in order to maintain compatibility.</p>
<p>We also request that users who have used the RiiConnect24 VFF downloader delete any VFF files created by it,  as well as disable the downloader. The VFFs created by it are made to never expire, meaning new files will never be downloaded by Dolphin. To locate these, click <code>File -&gt; Open User Folder</code> and then navigate to <code>Wii/title/00010002/484146xx/data</code> for the Forecast Channel and <code>Wii/title/00010002/484147xx/data</code> for the News Channel, where <code>xx</code> is <code>45</code> for NTSC-U consoles, <code>50</code> for PAL and <code>4a</code> for Japanese. If you're having problems with WiiLink/RiiConnect24 on the latest builds and have used the VFF downloader in the past, that may be the source of your troubles.</p>
<p>Note for those who want to use an unmodified Nintendo Channel: <strong>Cheats must be enabled in order for the channel to work.</strong></p>
<h4 id="50-19448-android-disney-infinity-base-support-by-dereeperjosh"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19448/">5.0-19448 - Android - Disney Infinity Base Support</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/deReeperJosh">deReeperJosh</a></strong><a href="#50-19448-android-disney-infinity-base-support-by-dereeperjosh" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>If everyone is being honest, there probably isn't much point to this feature, at least right now.  The only game that supports the Disney Infinity Base on the Wii is <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Disney_Infinity">Disney Infinity</a>, possibly the crown jewel of the Disney Trio of Destruction.  There is no existing <em>desktop</em> computer that can run the game full speed given how Dolphin currently emulates the game.  For phones, the situation is even worse.</p>


<p>But, maybe some day, some AArch64 JIT improvement and/or some future phone will somehow emulate Disney Infinity at a playable framerate.  Whenever that happens, future Android users will be able to emulate the Infinity Base and get in game without the need for physical hardware.</p>

<p><img src="https://dolphin-emu.org/m/user/blog/progress-report/2023-july/BSPD3_thumb.jpg">
</p>

<p>After the release of the <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/21/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-april-2023/#50-18920-rewrite-android-input-handling-by-josjuice">input handling rewrite</a> a few months ago, there have been a few growing pains.  A rather annoying one for many users was an issue causing trigger inputs from certain controllers to simply be ignored in the menu.  More frustratingly, you could actually <em>manually</em> add them if you knew your way around the advanced mapping options!</p>
<p>This turned out to be relatively easy to fix in the end, though.  The input handling rewrite brought a lot of code from the PC version of Dolphin to the Android version, including a piece of code that is designed to skip over button inputs in case a gamepad provided both a button input and an axis input for a trigger at the same time.  But the affected controllers on Android were doing something that the PC version of Dolphin had never ran into: each trigger provided <em>two</em> axis inputs. Because the code wasn't expecting this, both of the inputs were getting skipped by accident.  With the cause of the problem known, <strong><a href="https://github.com/JosJuice">JosJuice</a></strong> was able to change the code to let both inputs through.</p>
<p>Users that suffered from this regression should be able to configure their controllers directly in the GUI again in the latest Play Store release.</p>
<h4 id="50-19863-add-filesize-checks-to-check-nand-by-admiralcurtiss"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19863/">5.0-19863 - Add Filesize Checks to Check NAND</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong><a href="#50-19863-add-filesize-checks-to-check-nand-by-admiralcurtiss" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>With the Wii NAND coming more to the forefront with some of Dolphin's latest features, <em>Check NAND</em> has been seeing a lot more usage.  The long-story-short of it is that the Wii File System is <em>extremely</em> tempermental and prone to breaking, so back in the day <strong><a href="https://github.com/leoetlino">leoetlino</a></strong> created a feature that allowed Dolphin to check the Wii NAND for certain common problems and automatically fix them.</p>
<p>Check NAND was mostly a tool used to fix the NAND to get the Wii Shop and <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Dragon_Quest_X:_Mezameshi_Itsutsu_no_Shuzoku_Online">Dragon Quest X</a> working - as even the slightest problem with the NAND would prevent them from booting.  However, it wasn't designed to fix everything, and it'll often say no problems found when in fact there are critical problems with the NAND.</p>
<p>Enter <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong>.  Having debugged an issue where a user's NAND was "overfilled" due to spurious files being placed in the NAND directory, they decided that it was time to expand the scope of Check NAND a bit more.  In the latest versions of Dolphin, Check NAND will now make sure that the NAND size is within the bounds of the Wii NAND.</p>


<p>On a modern computer with terabytes of storage, you might think that the Wii NAND being limited to just 512MB is a bit archaic and that Dolphin should just allow any NAND size.  And we technically do - you can keep adding things to the NAND even if it is over that maximum size.  Unfortunately, the Wii System Menu and many games have checks to make sure that the NAND isn't getting close to full.  Even if we tell the Wii it has way more NAND space, it is <em>hardcoded</em> to use exactly 512MB, with certain portions of it being reserved.</p>
<p>In the past, Dolphin has tried to lie to the emulated Wii about the size of installed files, saying that they were one block no matter how big they were, but this just caused other problems and we ran into other limitations even in situations where that hack did seem to help.  So for now, we're handling things as accurately as possible in order to make sure users don't jeopardize their Wii Save Data.</p>
<p>It's possible there is some magic combination of hacks that could <em>maybe</em> trick the emulated Wii into supporting more/bigger files, but so far we haven't found it.  And considering how many people run into the Wii's paltry NAND size limits, a hack like this wouldn't see much resistance into being merged as an option.</p>
<h4 id="50-19716-support-accurate-ntscpal-color-spaces-by-filoppi"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19716/">5.0-19716 - Support Accurate NTSC/PAL Color Spaces</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/Filoppi">Filoppi</a></strong><a href="#50-19716-support-accurate-ntscpal-color-spaces-by-filoppi" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The GameCube and Wii were designed with analog CRT televisions in mind. In this era, "close enough" was the rule of the day. For example, each region had their own slightly different color spaces and gamma targets. Games almost never accounted for these differences, so how each game would appear varied slightly from region to region! To emulate this, Filoppi (helped by <a href="https://github.com/EndlesslyFlowering">Lilium</a>) has implemented a suit of color space and gamma correction settings.</p>
<p>Dolphin's color correction provides several color space options. Using these profiles, you can now set Dolphin to match the colour space of any given region and either make it match how you remember it in your region, or just see how your game would look in an entirely different region!</p>


<p>Something a little more impactful from these changes is <em>gamma correction</em>.  Most GameCube games (and some Wii games) targeted a gamma value of roughly 2.35.  Modern televisions and monitors normally use a value of 2.2, which can result in these games looking a tiny bit brighter than they would have (by default) on hardware of the day.</p>


<p>While it's possible for users to adjust their monitor's settings, and <em>some</em> games come with built-in gamma correction, <strong><a href="https://github.com/Filoppi">Filoppi</a></strong> added gamma correction to the color space features within Dolphin's settings in order to streamline the experience.</p>
<p>Note that these settings and features have not been ported to the Android version of Dolphin yet, however that is <a href="https://github.com/dolphin-emu/dolphin/pull/12095">in progress</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-post-body="true" data-testid="post-body"><p>So I stumbled a few weeks ago on <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">this video<!-- --></a> about the world's smallest conlang and I've been thinking about it ever since.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4y7tf3VJAM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/91c54129-9425-4695-bd68-6f65d83ae793/maxresdefault.jpeg"></a></p>
<!-- --><p><i>(You will probably have the idea more than fully by the ten minute mark.)<!-- --></i></p>
<!-- --><p>This fascinated me. I think languages are really interesting but I'm also really <!-- --><i>bad<!-- --></i> at them. I cannot hack the memorization. I've mostly avoided conlangs (that's Constructed Languages, like Esperanto or Klingon) because like, oh no, now there's <!-- --><i>even more languages<!-- --></i> for me to fail at memorizing. So like, a language so minimal you can almost learn it by <!-- --><i>accident<!-- --></i>, suddenly my ears perk up.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Toki pona is <!-- --><i>really interesting<!-- --></i>, on a lot of different axes. It's a thought experiment in Taoist philosophy that turns out to be actually, practically useful. It's Esperanto But It Might Actually Work This Time¹. It has NLP implications— it's a human language which feels natural to speak yet has such a deeply logical structure it seems nearly custom-designed for simple computer programs to read and write it². Beyond all this it's simply beautiful as an intellectual object—&nbsp;nearly every decision it makes feels deeply right. It solves a seemingly insoluble problem³ and does it with a sense of effortlessness and an <!-- --><a href="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/747b4517-a3cf-438b-a6a0-07ad9e6883fd/Toki_pona.svg.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">implied "LOL"<!-- --></a> at every step.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So what toki pona is. Toki pona is a language designed around the idea of being <!-- --><i>as simple as it is possible for a language to be<!-- --></i>. It has 120 words in its original form (now, at the twenty year mark, up to 123), but you can form a lot of interesting sentences with only around twenty or thirty (I know this because this is roughly the size of my current tok vocabulary). <!-- --><a href="https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The whole tok-&gt;en dictionary fits on seventeen printed pages<!-- --></a>⁴. There are no conjugations or tenses to memorize. There are no <!-- --><i>parts of speech<!-- --></i>, generally: almost every single word can be used as almost any part of speech, drop a pronoun or a preposition⁵ in the right place and it becomes a verb, drop a verb in the right place and it becomes an adjective. There are almost no ambiguities in sentence structure; I've only found one significant one so far (using "of" [<!-- --><tt>pi<!-- --></tt>] twice in the same clause) and the community deals with this by just agreeing not to do that. There's in one sense quite a lot of ambiguity in the vocabulary but in another sense there's none; for example <!-- --><tt>nena<!-- --></tt> is listed in the dictionary as meaning <!-- --><i>hill, mountain, button, bump, nose<!-- --></i>, but the official ideology of Toki Pona is that this is not a word with five definitions, it is <!-- --><i>a word with exactly one definition, that being the concept encompassing all five of hills, mountains, buttons, bumps, and noses<!-- --></i>. Toki pona words are not ambiguous, they're just <!-- --><i>broad<!-- --></i>. I will now teach you enough toki pona to understand most sentences (assuming you consult the <!-- --><a href="https://devurandom.xyz/tokipona/dictionary.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">dictionary<!-- --></a> as you go) in a paragraph shorter than this one:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>Every sentence has an "verb" or action clause. Most sentences also have a subject clause, which goes before the verb separated by "<!-- --><tt>li<!-- --></tt>". Some sentences also have an "object" or target clause, which goes after the verb clause separated by "<!-- --><tt>e<!-- --></tt>". So "[subject] <!-- --><tt>li<!-- --></tt> [verb] <!-- --><tt>e<!-- --></tt> [object]". All three clauses are any number of words, the first word is the noun (or verb) and the rest are adjectives (or adverbs). If the first word in a sentence is <!-- --><tt>mi<!-- --></tt> or <!-- --><tt>sina<!-- --></tt> you can omit the <!-- -->li in that case <!-- --><i>only<!-- --></i>. There is no "is", a sentence like "a flower is red" is just "[a plant] <!-- --><tt>li<!-- --></tt> [red]" because there are no parts of speech and adjectives are verbs. Pronounce everything the way you would in English except "j" sounds like "y". If you see "<!-- --><tt>tawa<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>lon<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>tan<!-- --></tt>" or "<!-- --><tt>kepeken<!-- --></tt>" in adjective/adverb position that's a preposition, so treat whatever comes after it as a fourth clause. "<!-- --><tt>a<!-- --></tt>" and "<!-- --><tt>n<!-- --></tt>" are interjections and can go anywhere in a sentence. If you see "<!-- --><tt>o<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>pi<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>la<!-- --></tt>", "<!-- --><tt>taso<!-- --></tt>, "<!-- --><tt>anu<!-- --></tt>" or "<!-- --><tt>en<!-- --></tt>", then you've found one of the few special words (particles) and you should probably either read the <!-- --><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012M1RLXS/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">book<!-- --></a> or watch the <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLIjft6ja7DM70MkOMu56c4Grku7LXR61" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jan Misali instructional videos<!-- --></a> on YouTube.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>That's like… almost it!⁶ Watch one youtube video, or read a half page of grammar summary and keep the dictionary open on your phone, and you're basically ready to jump into conversations. (You'll need those last six particles to make nuanced sentences, but sentences do not have to be nuanced.) In my own case I watched the Langfocus video linked at the top and then lazily over the next week watched the <!-- --><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLn6LC1RpAo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">jan Misali overview<!-- --></a> and two of their instructional videos then read a few chapters of the book, and was already able to construct a full paragraph and be understood by another person:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><blockquote>
<!-- --><p><tt>o! mi sona e toki pona. mi lukin sona e toki mute... taso mi toki ike e toki ale. toki mute li jo e nimi mute. nimi mute li pona ala tawa mi. toki pona li pona e mi tan ni. toki pona li jo nimi lili. nimi lili li pona e me :)<!-- --></tt></p>
<!-- --></blockquote>
<!-- --><p>(<!-- --><i>Translation:<!-- --></i> <!-- --><span>Hello! I am learning toki pona. I've tried to learn many languages… but I speak all of the[m] badly. Most languages have a lot of words. Lots of words is not good for me. Toki pona is good for me because of this. Toki pona has few words. Few words is good for me :)<!-- --></span>⁷)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>So that's week one. By the end of week three (that'll be this past Sunday) I had hit three milestones:<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><ul>
<!-- --><li>I was able to make a joke in toki pona. Not a good one.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>When the joke misfired, I was able to successfully toss off an entire complex paragraph rapidly without really thinking about it.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --><li>Probably a sign I Am Getting It more significant than anything else: I realized that talking on the Discord I was dropping toki pona words into my English sentences <!-- --><i>solely because the toki pona word seemed to me to communicate a concept I wanted to communicate more precisely than any particular English word<!-- --></i>.<!-- --></li>
<!-- --></ul>
<!-- --><p>(That last one actually kind of excited me when I realized, after the fact, that it had been happening for several days before I noticed it.)<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>All of the above happened on the toki pona Discord, which seems to be the largest and healthiest outpost of toki pona community online⁸ and, I assume therefore, the world. Here's my toki pona joke; you'll notice that I begin by preemptively apologizing for it, but by the end it becomes clear I was, at that moment anyway, apparently completely on the Discord's level:⁹<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p><img src="https://staging.cohostcdn.org/attachment/d5366ff6-ae17-4c70-a900-a02ac307f108/tokipona_conversation.png"></p><!-- --><hr>
<!-- --><p><b>Footnotes<!-- --></b></p><!-- --><p>¹ Esperanto was meant to be an auxillary language simple enough the entire world could learn it as a second language. But it does not seem to me to be actually all that simple to learn (the verb tenses may be free of exceptions, but there are still like six of them) and it seems hard to convince myself to study it when I could put that effort toward a more widespread language. Toki Pona on the other hand is a language simple enough <!-- --><i>the entire world actually could learn it<!-- --></i>, had it reason to, and the buy-in cost in time is a lot lower. Meanwhile Toki Pona just seems to get certain international-accessibility things <!-- --><i>right<!-- --></i>, probably due to the advantage of having over a century of conlang practice <!-- --><i>largely inspired by Esperanto<!-- --></i> to draw from. The difference that's most interesting to me, but which I'm also least qualified to evaluate, is that the Toki Pona author had some basic familiarity with, and gave Toki Pona input from, east Asian languages. Both Toki Pona and Esperanto draw roots from a variety of languages but in Esperanto's case this winds up being mostly European languages, mostly Italian, whereas Toki Pona has Mandarin and Cantonese in its mix. Both languages were intended to have a minimal, universal phonology but Esperanto's is not very universal at all and has some consonant sounds that are going to be be totally unfamiliar unless you speak Polish or a language related to Polish. Toki Pona's phonology is <!-- --><i>actually<!-- --></i> minimal-- it has the letters in the sentence "<!-- --><tt>mi jan pi ko suwi lete<!-- --></tt>" and <!-- --><i>nothing else<!-- --></i> and the legal syllabary is basically hiragana without the combination syllables. Now, what I don't know is whether any of this <!-- --><i>actually helps<!-- --></i> speakers of Asian languages in practice or if it just makes surface choices that make it seem that way to a westerner like me. In practice if you find a toki pona speaker their native language is almost certainly English, so there doesn't seem to have been a great deal of testing as to how learnable it is to people from varied regions.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>² I kept imagining toki pona as being like LLVM IR for human languages or something.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>³ Designing an actually learnable, universal(?) international auxillary language.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁴ By which I mean if you print the unofficial web version it's 17 pages long. But you can fit it in sixteen if you remove the web-specific introductory paragraph, the "joke word" <!-- --><tt>kijetesantakalu<!-- --></tt>, and the web footer with the "trans rights now!" banner in it.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁵ There's an awkward nuance in the specific case of prepositions: if you drop a preposition into verb position it still winds up "behaving like" a preposition, it's just that the preposition describes an action. It's probably more accurate to say that the <!-- --><i>preposition phrase<!-- --></i> becomes a verb rather than the preposition itself. So for example "<!-- --><tt>mi tawa kalama<!-- --></tt>" means "I went toward the sound" [<!-- --><tt>kamala<!-- --></tt> is a noun and the object of the preposition] not "I went loudly" [as it would be if <!-- --><tt>kamala<!-- --></tt> were an adverb modifying <!-- --><tt>tawa<!-- --></tt> as a verb]. Going into detail on this because I don't want to mislead anyone but "you can form a sentence using an unmodified preposition as a verb" is such a fun fact I wanted to include it.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁶ I guess I could say "what I'm calling 'clauses' are called 'word groups' in official sources; word groups are always separated by a particle or preposition" but I'm not sure that's interesting unless you're a linguist.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁷ There's a lot of repetition in this paragraph of both kinds that show what's cool about toki pona and what's kinda impractical about it. Cool, it has some sentences where a single word shows up twice conveying two different clear things based only on where it is in the sentence, like "<!-- --><tt>mi toki ike e toki ale<!-- --></tt>" where <!-- --><tt>toki<!-- --></tt> is a verb ("I speak") the first time and a noun ("language") the second. Less cool, because so much of the meaning of the hyper-versatile toki pona words is based on context, you sometimes wind up having to include multiple sentences saying nearly the same thing just to make sure the reader selects the correct context. I may have overdone it here.<!-- --></p>
<!-- --><p>⁸ There's also a low-traffic Mastodon instance, multiple forums including one run by the Merveilles crowd, and something called "<!-- --><tt>Wikipesija<!-- --></tt>"<!-- --></p>

<p dir="auto">ChatGPT has grown explosively in popularity as we all know now. Business users across the globe often tap into the public service to work more productively or act as a creative assistant.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, ChatGPT risks exposing confidential intellectual property. One option is to block corporate access to ChatGPT, but people always find workarounds. This also limits the powerful capabilities of ChatGPT and reduces employee productivity and their work experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">Azure ChatGPT is our enterprise option. This is the exact same service but offered as your private ChatGPT.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Benefits are:</h3>
<p dir="auto"><strong>1. Private:</strong> Built-in guarantees around the privacy of your data and fully isolated from those operated by OpenAI.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>2. Controlled:</strong> Network traffic can be fully isolated to your network and other enterprise grade security controls are built in.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>3. Value:</strong> Deliver added business value with your own internal data sources (plug and play) or use plug-ins to integrate with your internal services (e.g., ServiceNow, etc).</p>

		<h3>Abstract</h3>
		<p>In this short essay, written for a symposium in the San Diego Law Review, Professor Daniel Solove examines the nothing to hide argument.  When asked about government surveillance and data mining, many people respond by declaring: "I've got nothing to hide."  According to the nothing to hide argument, there is no threat to privacy unless the government uncovers unlawful activity, in which case a person has no legitimate justification to claim that it remain private.  The nothing to hide argument and its variants are quite prevalent, and thus are worth addressing.  In this essay, Solove critiques the nothing to hide argument and exposes its faulty underpinnings. </p>

      “High inflation of the past 2+ years has done lots of economic damage,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, wrote in a <a href="https://twitter.com/Markzandi/status/1689626766875254786" target="_blank">post on X</a>, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

      Most of that increase in spending is driven by housing costs, which have surged, Zandi told CNN in an email on Friday. He added that families are also spending more at the grocery store; on buying, maintaining and insuring vehicles and on recreational services like cable.

<p>When praising your child for a job well done, recognize the effort they put in instead of their natual ability. </p>
<p>Why? When students think they are born with a particular skill, they are less likely to put in additional effort. They practise less, study less, and try less. </p>
<p>Instead of recognizing students for being naturally gifted, focus on offering praise for the effort they put in to reach their goals. Praise can be an extremely important factor in a student’s growth. It is used to motivate, encourage and inspire children.</p>
<h2>Avoiding Failure</h2>
<p>Too much praise can also work the opposite way.  If children are consistently praised for something that they essentially have no control over, they will feel powerless and unable to find a solution when they don’t succeed.  This can lead to <a href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/the-role-of-failure-in-learning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fear of failure,</a> which damages self-confidence. Instead of saying, “you are so smart,” try “you worked really hard. Awesome job!”</p>
<h2>Researching Success &amp; Failure</h2>
<p>In <a href="http://socialpsychonline.com/2016/07/psychology-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one study</a>,  psychologists gave 5th graders two separate tests: in the first test, students were either praised for being really smart or praised for their hard work. In the second test, students experienced a setback. The researchers noted that students who received praise for their intelligence took the setback negatively. The students who were praised for their effort were more likely to take the test home to practise working on the questions.</p>
<h2>Two Different Mindsets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/carol-dwecks-attitude/">Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck</a>‘s&nbsp;research on effort and success found that people tend to have one of two different mindsets when it comes to ability— either a <strong>fixed</strong> or a <strong>growth </strong>mindset.</p>
<p>People with a a <strong>fixed mindset </strong>believe that you are born with natural talents and abilities or not.</p>
<p>People with a <strong>growth mindset</strong> believe that persistence, effort, determination, and practice are the keys to overcoming any obstacle. Check out these tips to help students <a href="https://www.oxfordlearning.com/growth-mindset-tips-for-parents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">develop a growth mindset</a>.</p>
<h3>2 Ideas to Praise Effort Effectively:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Praise Process, Not The Outcome:  Praising students for working hard on a project, or putting aside time every night to study for a test helps students understand the connection between the effort they put in and the results that they get. When a child comes home excited with a great mark, say, “you deserve it! You worked really hard for that mark.” Praise the entire process including concentration, self-correction, and strategies used.</li>
<li>Praise Specifically and Sincerely. Children love attention and feedback. However, children can recognize insincere praise. It can be easy to praise a child simply to boost their self-esteem. Be <a href="https://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/social/how-to-praise-your-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as specific as possible</a> to make the praise meaningful to the child.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Praising for Success</h2>
<p>Praising effort rather than skills or natural ability helps students of all ages learn that the work they apply leads to the results they want. Skills such as perseverance, dedication, and determination help students learn to take risks, learn from their mistakes, and move on from setbacks. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
              <p>Back in my 20s, I used to hang out with trust fund kids. They told me about the paid internships their parents lined up for them. They bragged about taking long lunches and shopping on the clock. One chick laughed about her firm accidentally sending her three checks after her last day.</p><p>She tried to return the money.</p><p>"Keep it," they said.</p><p>Even my non-rich friends found ways to slack off. I had friends who managed to sneak back to their apartments for sex. I've worked at bars where the bartenders and servers snorted coke in the bathroom.</p><p>It made them <em>more </em>productive.</p><p>It made them smile.</p><p>These days, I work at a university. I have bosses making $200,000 a year. Do you know what we've caught them doing at the office? Watching soccer games. Taking selfies. Holding wine tastings. Zooming with family. Reading for edification. Holding meetings that were more like social gatherings.</p><p>David Graeber's essay on <a href="https://www.atlasofplaces.com/essays/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs/?ref=okdoomer.io">bullshit jobs</a> blew the myth of office productivity wide open a few years ago. The elite have been promising us shorter work weeks for about a hundred years. We have the technology. As we speak, they're bragging about their new AI minions.</p><p>The vast majority of us know what it's like to work an office job. It's full of bullshit errands that don't matter. It's full of distractions. A lot of that gets filed under "office culture." A lot of us finish our core duties in a few hours. We spend the rest of the day looking busy so we don't get fired. At the other end of the spectrum, some office workers can't ever get their real work done because of all the pointless interruptions they have to put up with. </p><p>Before the pandemic, the internet was filled with stories about the evils of office work. It was bad for your productivity. It was bad for your creativity. It was bad for your health. They were trying to sell us treadmill desks.</p><p>Remember all that?</p><p>Now everything has changed. If you work from home, apparently you're a lazy bum who wastes company time by snacking, playing video games, watching Netflix, shopping, hanging out with your friends, drinking, spending time with your family, or having sex. You're an awful person.</p><p>How dare you cook a healthy lunch at home. How dare you go for a walk in the middle of the day to clear your head. How dare you take a short nap to regain your focus. Didn't you know that an epic commute is actually good for your mental health? Sitting in a cubicle is <em>great </em>for your heart.</p><p>So, what's really going on here?</p><p><strong>It’s about real estate.</strong></p><p>That's it.</p><p>There's an office real estate <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/500-billion-office-real-estate-221017310.html?ref=okdoomer.io">apocalypse</a> unfolding. Corporate landlords currently hold <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/16/1174938708/commercial-real-estate-property-offices-work-from-home-remote-work?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">$1.2 trillion in loans</a> on office towers all over the country. In some cases, these are the same assholes who've been buying up all the houses and driving up prices on residential real estate, too.</p><p>They were greedy, and dumb.</p><p>When the pandemic hit, these landlords did something even dumber. As <em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a970a7f3-e493-43fd-ac11-afe40a73fbb7?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">The Financial Times</a></em> states, they took advantage of “nearly free money” from the Federal Reserve to buy up “trophy office buildings.” Now that everyone is embracing remote work, they can’t lease that office space to anyone. They have a bunch of zombie office towers.</p><p>They can’t do anything with them.</p><p>Some of these commercial real estate owners are trying to turn their empty buildings into apartments and restaurants, but it’s an expensive overhaul. Not every zombie office building makes a great apartment.</p><p>They’re stuck.</p><p>Anywhere from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/empty-office-buildings-downtown-what-happened-rcna77443?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">12 to 20 percent</a> of office space remains vacant. It’s worse than the 2008 recession. If these landlords can’t find a way to make money off their corporate real estate soon, they’re going to start defaulting on their loans. The landlords will go bankrupt, and banks will wind up with giant office towers they can’t sell. More than $1 trillion will go <em>poof</em>.</p><p>The Federal Reserve’s misguided war on inflation has made everything even worse over the last couple of years. By raising interest rates, they’ve motivated <em>more </em>companies to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/05/06/1174468821/companies-are-defaulting-on-loan-payments-for-unused-office-buildings?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">ditch their office leases</a>. Now commercial real estate is in a death spiral that could tank the economy (again).</p><p>There’s more bad news.</p><p>Major cities have spent <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/07/07/upshot/downtown-office-vulnerable-even-before-covid.html?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">the last several decades</a> catering to these corporate landlords. Now their entire downtowns rely on workers for commerce. We’re talking about all those restaurants and coffee shops that serve breakfast and lunch to white-collar workers, and all the bars where people used to go and complain about work before they spent an hour commuting home.</p><p>These cities also depend on property taxes from overpriced commercial real estate. When nobody wants those buildings, their value plummets. New York alone has lost <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3695581/after-the-remote-work-rush-vacant-offices-and-empty-downtowns.html?ref=okdoomer.io" rel="">$453 billion</a> in office real estate. Across the U.S., office buildings have shed anywhere from 40 to 80 percent of their value.</p><p>So, we have a problem.</p><p>Once again, the elite have gotten themselves into big trouble. They want the rest of us to bail them out. If they don't want our tax money, they want us to give up our freedom and autonomy. They want us to sacrifice ourselves on the altar of capitalism to protect their fortunes.</p><p>They don't care how productive we are. They don't care how creative we are. They sure as hell don't care about our health.</p><p>It's all a bunch of lies.</p><p>They only care about one thing, forcing warm bodies back into office buildings to stop the commercial real estate apocalypse.</p><p>That's it.</p>

<p>This is one doctor’s experience as an explainer to friends, family and anyone who has a bicuspid aortic valve or who, for whatever reason, has developed Aortic Stenosis.</p>



<p><strong>Early days</strong></p>



<p>I was born half way through 1967. My mother was barely 27. She had qualified as a teacher before embarking on a family and was an older mum compared to many of her peers at that time. I was her first. As the world looked up to the stars, then still anticipating man walking on the moon, my mother was told that “I would never be an astronaut”. Her beautiful baby had a heart murmur – some sort of defect which meant, according to the doctors, that I would never be fit enough to get into space.</p>



<p><strong>Heart murmurs</strong></p>



<p>In truth, that limitation of my career trajectory may have been quite unnecessary. A heart murmur is merely the noise blood makes flowing through the heart. It’s an audible ripple from the eddies  blood makes as it’s being pumped from one chamber of the heart to the next, and out to the body. Murmurs may signify there’s ‘a problem’ with the heart. Normally, blood flows through the heart almost silently. Doctors can hear the valves opening and closing and hopefully not much else. Many heart murmurs, heard soon after birth, disappear with age and all babies should be re-examined at 6-8 weeks of age to see if they’ve gone. Many are just innocent ‘flow’ murmurs and nowadays would be investigated further if they persist. Some can be due to physiological changes that occur soon after birth and these go within days, others can be due to major heart abnormalities, some of which, if it weren’t for modern medicine, wouldn’t be compatible with life, though usually the blue colour of the baby makes that fairly obvious. I was pink, – albeit whingy – and my problem was not, at that point, serious.</p>



<p>In 1967 there wasn’t the technology for readily seeing inside the heart. X-rays with dye might show some, but not all abnormalities. Heart murmurs in otherwise pink and feeding babies were deemed not to be overly important. My mother just had to accept that, if she had ever had ambitions for me to become an astronaut, they were not to be. I clearly remember her telling me several times that, I wouldn’t be able to become an astronaut, as if I was missing a limb!</p>



<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>



<p>Eighteen years later she wasn’t too disappointed though to see me get into medical school and during the undergraduate course grab an opportunity to go and work with the Royal Flying Doctor Service in outback Australia. The Australian visa necessary for such an adventure required a full medical with my university GP. He was clinically astute. He heard the murmur, still there at the ripe old age of 21, predicted it was due to a congenital abnormality called a bicuspid aortic valve and referred me to a favourite lecturer, Professor David Wood, for confirmation.</p>



<p>By the mid-1980s the National Health Service in the UK had echocardiography. Using this ultrasound wizardry Prof. Wood confirmed a bicuspid aortic valve. By this time, I’d looked the condition up in the hefty pathology tome I owned. It affects 1% of the population and is hereditary in a small proportion, so if you have it, ensure your siblings and children are screened for it, and your parents, if they’re still around, when you discover it. It doesn’t normally impact on life until the fifth or sixth decade, and the impact then, if you’re unlucky, can be sudden and final, though for many they get warning symptoms that need good clinicians to note and diagnose.</p>



<p><strong>What is it and what does it matter?</strong></p>



<p>A normal aortic valve looks, if you’re looking down on it, like the Mercedes symbol. There are three flaps to it that open and close with every heartbeat.  A bit like a three petalled flower, opening and closing with daylight, but a lot faster! A bicuspid valve only has two flaps, something like a circle with a line across it. The line is just the gap though through which blood flows. It’s not dissimilar to a goldfish opening and closing its mouth.</p>

<p>The trouble with only two flaps is they have to do the work of three and over time they wear faster. They get calcified, and stiff and they restrict the flow of blood from the left ventricle of the heart into the aorta. That restriction is called Aortic Stenosis. From here it should flow freely to the rest of the body. Restricting heart flow is never good. The muscle of the left ventricle gets beefed up to try and overcome the restriction and that makes it vulnerable to problems with its electrical system. Left ventricular muscle beefing up is called hypertrophy. It’s a process that takes time, years if not decades, and if unchecked it is a cause of many sudden deaths from abnormalities in electrical conduction and then rapid disorganised contraction of the heart muscle. That ain’t good! In truth, it’s so bad it leads to collapse and often a quick demise.</p>

<p>If that mode of death doesn’t get the hapless folk with an undiagnosed bicuspid valve the widening of the aorta, the big blood vessel that comes out of the heart and leads the blood around the entire body may similarly cause an abrupt ‘game over’. The aorta stretches with each pulse of blood coming out of the heart, sixty or eight times a minute, or 150 times a minute if you’re an athlete working hard. The aorta of someone with a bicuspid valve probably tries to compensate for the restricted flow through the valve by lowering the resistance beyond, and getting wider, but weaker.</p>



<p>Doctors call this dilatation and it leaves the aorta vulnerable to tears, that are known as aortic dissection. When the aorta in the chest tears, the window of opportunity to fix it is pretty small, depending on the extent and speed of the tear. If you’re standing outside a cardiothoracic operating theatre, you have a better chance than the majority who will be miles away living their lives. That said, it is survival for those who get to a hospital capable of treating it, and not all are. The symptoms are interscapular (between the shoulder blades) pain, often described as ripping, which comes on suddenly abruptly. If you know you’re at risk just dial 999 (or 112) if you get it and tell them you think you might have an aortic dissection!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The good news for the patient is the mode of death is pretty quick compared to the lingering deaths of aggressive cancer or dementia. For arrythmias it might be minutes. For dissections it’s a few hours. For those around them it’s awful. They might have to do CPR and try to resuscitate you. It’s worth them learning how to do this, but you and they have to be realistic. The chances of survival are slim. Pathology and physiology just aren’t on your side.</p>



<p>For these very justifiable reasons anyone with a bicuspid aortic valve should have monitoring echocardiograms done regularly. The interval can be 3-5 years when you’re young and annually or less as the valve is seen to stiffen, the ventricle muscle gets beefier or the aorta dilates. All of this is readily measurable with today’s high tech. The pressure difference across the valve can be measured too. I knew my numbers over the years were deteriorating – I’d kept them all. I knew I already had some ventricular hypertrophy, (the thickening of the heart muscle) and the pressure gradient across the valve was increasing. It had reached 50mmHg a couple of years previously. This is classed as moderate stenosis – i.e. moderate restriction of the blood flow out of the heart. Although I knew all this I had never really given the consequences much thought. I had kept pretty fit during my adult life and hadn’t really given any thought about the day things got really bad nor had I realised I was symptomatic of a deterioration. It’s difficult to be objective about symptoms that come on gradually, particularly if you’re a doctor, and especially if you’re a bloke! Perhaps that’s why so many seem to die suddenly around the age of retirement, for all sorts of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>My story</strong></p>



<p>I have been having regular checks for years. In recent years the interval had dropped from every 3 years to every twelve, and then, nine months. In March 2023 I was off-piste skiing, doing what I love, skiing ‘steep and deep’ powder, through trees around Chamonix. My fitness in recent years has not been what it was ten years ago and I was feeling it. Blowing my own trumpet to the max, I was told that the ski instructor leading us (a former Olympic skier herself) judged me to be an advanced skier, (a ‘purple’ for those familiar with Ski Club of Great Britain categories) <em>if only I was fitter</em>. Without the fitness I wasn’t ‘a purple’. I thought that was very fair. I know how to ski, but I just couldn’t find the physical effort needed to match the terrain. Each morning I felt drained and wondered whether I should go out and do it all again. I was enjoying it but I was disappointed with my lack of stamina. Videoing my step-sons doing a similar, if slightly easier pitch, a couple of weeks later my partner commented on my breathlessness, readily audible on the video, when I was standing still. I thought it was just the altitude and not being fit enough. Despite the boys having had less than two weeks of skiing under their belts, and highly annoyingly, becoming adept at off-piste so early into their skiing careers, I was having to work hard to keep up. But I still don’t think the had penny really dropped.</p>



<p>My partner had been commenting on my breathlessness at times for quite a while. I’d put that down to my asthma and had a few months before changed inhaler to see if that helped. I thought my asthma was better, but looking back, I was still becoming breathless after any little exertion.</p>



<p>I was due my annual echocardiogram whilst I was away skiing but the hospital had luckily rescheduled it for just after Easter. It was one of the first junior doctor strike days and I thought it would get cancelled but not needing junior doctors, it went ahead. Jane, the Chief Cardiac Physiologist had scanned me many times and asked how I was. I told her of my less than satisfactory stamina when skiing and she mused as she squeezed out the transducer gel “well perhaps the valve has got worse. Let’s see”.</p>



<p>Jane is very experienced and thorough. She normally takes about ten minutes to do the echo, take all the measurements and tell me the news. This time, it was the fastest echo I’ve ever had. Almost immediately Jane could see the narrowing was worse. The gradient was now 70mmHg and I needed something doing about it. She phoned Simon, a cardiologist colleague who had looked after me for years. Covering for striking juniors that day, he was in the hospital and able to come down to the department where we were. He’s a former cycling buddy and he told me straight: “Shaun, it’s now severe aortic stenosis. You need a new valve. I’ll refer you to the surgeons. Limit your heart rate”.</p>



<p>Six days later, I was in front of the surgeon. I’d never had an operation before, never had a general anaesthetic and here I was learning I urgently needed a new aortic valve. The operation involves splitting my sternum to open the chest, putting me on heart bypass, stopping my heart to be able to open it to put in a new metal valve, putting in some polyester based artificial artery, to replace the dilating aorta and then getting me off bypass, restarting my heart and sewing me up. It’s a 4 or 5-hour job. You wake up in Intensive Care with drips in your neck and arm, drain tubes coming out of your chest, a catheter and a wound over your breastbone. Privately it can costs anywhere from £50,000 to £100,000. Thank God we have the NHS in the UK.</p>



<p>The surgeon explained that I was under no obligation to have surgery although without it, I would probably die within the next two years. He said I had a fifty percent chance of dying within the next twelve months. If hip, hernia and cataract waiting lists had a similar mortality rate then tens of thousands would die before they got their op. Whilst there are fewer patients needing valve replacement there are also far fewer specialists who can perform this type of complex surgery. That said, there are still way too many cases for the NHS in its perilous post-austerity state to be able to fix quickly. Cardiac waiting lists had risen to a record high of 392,698 at the end of May 2023 in England. A third of these were waiting for longer than the NHS target of 18 weeks from identification of need for surgery for actual surgery<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.&nbsp; Heart surgeons perform coronary artery bypass grafts and there are lots of patients that urgently need these.</p>



<div><p>From the prognosis risk I was given I quickly calculated that meant a cumulative 1% risk each week! Waiting three months – a standard NHS wait would give me a 1 in 8 chance of not making it. If I waited 6 months it would be double, a 1 in 4 chance of not making it. Friends in the profession reassured me that these risks were an overall risk for all types of patients, including some who were much older and frailer than I, so in truth my risks were lower but it was still pretty un-nerving.</p><p>The operation itself has a mortality (death) risk of 1% and a risk of a major stroke of 1%. For every hundred patients who have the surgery the chances are one will die during or soon after the procedure and one will have a major stroke and not fully recover. To me, that meant a 98% chance of pulling through well and then having a near normal life expectancy. I would have to take the drug warfarin, for the rest of my life, to anti-coagulate (thin) my blood and prevent small blood clots forming on the new metal valve. Blood clots can stop the metal valve opening properly or they can get detached and float off in the blood stream. They can cause strokes if they get lodged in small blood vessels in the brain, and damage anywhere else in the body, where they get wedged. Good warfarin management is a serious business. </p></div>



<p>The surgeon told me I was too young to have a bioprosthetic valve – from a pig or a cow – as these don’t last like metal ones do, and other surgical options, even though they wouldn’t need warfarin for ever were not recommended for me, as a relatively young patient. Warfarin itself creates a risk of dying from a haemorrhage, but that risk is only about 1% per year. That means of 100 patients who are all on warfarin one will die each year as a result of being on warfarin. It might be from a haemorrhagic stroke (a bleed in the brain) or from the stomach or bowel. A full 99 will live on, and those who do their own monitoring tend to have better control of the extent that their blood is thinned and be less likely to suffer such dire side effects of warfarin. I’ll never be able to binge on booze again but I don’t have to be teetotal.</p>



<p>I would be able to hear the valve ticking for ever but was told my brain would in time filter out the sound. For someone who has had a lifelong intolerance of ticking clocks, in the bedroom at least, that sounded to me like torture. The surgeon told me people sitting next to me wouldn’t be able to hear it so I wasn’t going to be looked at as if I had a bomb on my person! I hoped my brain would soon make this sound disappear although, someone who has had the op, said he doesn’t mind as it reassures him he’s still alive!</p>

<p>I told the surgeon I’d been exercising on a static bike since Simon, the cardiologist, had told me I needed a new valve. I wanted to get fit for surgery and had limited my heart rate to just 130 per minute and felt ok. He immediately told me to not do that again, to limit my exercise to just walking and my heart rate to no more than 100. He warned me of the grave danger of a sudden death from worsening the ventricular hypertrophy. My partner heard that loud and clear, so no cycling, swimming, heavy lifting, or heavy petting! I would be limited to slowly walking the dog. It also meant no foreign holiday – no-one would insure such a risk, until the valve was fixed. I couldn’t play football with the boys or go cycling with them. Having an arrhythmia whilst swimming isn’t great either for long term survival so ruled that out too. I wasn’t aware of how physically limited I was until I found <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/c14851dd-00cb-43c8-921d-6d1e5888eea0">Julien Roux’s Heart Alarm app</a> for Garmin watches. He’d written the software for his father who also had aortic stenosis. Once I’d switched an alarm on to tell me when my heart rate reached 100 I was shocked at how often it was happening with minimal exertion. It was tens of times each day, with minimal exertion.</p>



<p>The surgeon warned me I might get admitted with chest pain, palpitations or a collapse whilst I was waiting and that would get me bumped up the queue, because the condition was becoming more critical. I realised that the twinges of pain I’d been having in my chest were angina, due to a lack of blood and oxygen getting to the heart itself, and the breathlessness was because my heart couldn’t pump out the body’s needs fast enough. No wonder I seemed unfit when skiing. It wasn’t so much physically unfit through lack of training, I was medically unfit. Even walking the dog up a slight slope or too quickly would trigger the alarm as would going up the stairs and even doing anything too quickly – sweeping up, showering, tying my shoe laces! Over time I got fed up with the alarm going off and got into the bad habit of muting it and not looking at the rate. Thinking about the risk of doing that though made me realise in fact, the alarm was a warning. The more I over did it, the more I’d be stimulating my heart muscle to get beefier and the more likely it was to trigger a fatal arrythmia. I had to take notice of it and I had to slow down.</p>



<p>I am now one week away from a third attempt at an admission. The two previous times were aborted, one a couple of weeks before the admission date and one, after I’d arrived at the hospital, with my bag all psyched up for the real deal the following day. The NHS is massively under-resourced for what it is expected to do. Each time I was cancelled it was because other people more seriously ill than I needed treatment first.</p>



<p>I’m sure I’ll survive one more week and be able to write about the surgery, the aftermath and the recovery. Here’s hoping!</p>

<p><em>Translated to <a href="https://pngset.com/ru-weird-cpu-instruction">Russian</a> by <a href="https://pngset.com/">Babur
Muradov</a> and <a href="https://pngflare.com/uz-popcount">Uzbek</a> by
<a href="https://pngflare.com/">Leonid Popov</a>.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a pseudo-transcript of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLFqLfz2Fmc">a presentation I did at !!Con
2019</a>.</em></p>
<p>Most CPU architectures in use today have an instruction called <code>popcount</code>,
short for “population count”. Here’s what it does: it counts the number of set
bits in a machine word. For example (assuming 8-bit words for simplicity),
<code>popcount(00100110)</code> is <code>3</code> and <code>popcount(01100000)</code> is <code>2</code>.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, like I was, if there’s more to this instruction, but
that’s all it does! This doesn’t seem very useful, right?</p>
<p>I thought this might be a recent addition for some hyperspecialised use case,
but it has in fact been present in CPU architectures since at least 1961:</p>
<ul>
<li>1961: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_7030_Stretch">IBM Stretch</a></li>
<li>1964: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC_6000_series">CDC 6000</a></li>
<li>1975: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cray-1">Cray-1</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">SPARC</a></li>
<li>2005: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture#Advanced_SIMD_(NEON)">ARM NEON</a></li>
<li>2007: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD_10h">AMD K10</a></li>
<li>2008: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehalem_(microarchitecture)">Intel Nehalem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>So what’s going on?</p>
<h4 id="the-nsa-instruction">The NSA Instruction</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> is also known as “The NSA Instruction”, and a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.arch/UXEi7G6WHuU/Z2z7fC7Xhr8J">very entertaining
thread on
<code>comp.arch</code></a>
discusses its uses inside and outside cryptography. It is rumoured that it was
originally added to CPU instructions at the behest of the NSA. As <a href="http://cryptome.org/jya/sadd.htm">this
archived email thread</a> puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was almost a tradition that one of the first of any new faster CDC machine
was delivered to a “good customer” - picked up at the factory by an anonymous
truck, and never heard from again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes for a great story, but what were they using it for?</p>
<p>One measure of information content is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming
weight</a>, which is the number of
symbols in a string that are different from the zero-symbol of the alphabet.
For a binary string, this is exactly <code>popcount</code>!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=38521">As explained here</a>, the
NSA wanted to do cryptanalysis on intercepted messages, and since the CDC 6000
had 60-bit words, one word was enough to store most alphabets they were
interested in. They were able to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Split a message into lines</li>
<li>Set a bit for each unique character they encountered per line</li>
<li>Use <code>popcount</code> to count the distinct characters</li>
<li>Use the count as a hash for further cryptanalysis</li>
</ol>
<p>Curiously, <code>popcount</code> seems to have disappeared from instruction sets between
the mid-1970s and the mid-2000s, so there has to be more to it than
cryptographic applications to explain its return. What else can it be used for?</p>
<h4 id="error-correction">Error Correction</h4>
<p>Related to the concept of Hamming weight is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance">Hamming
distance</a>, which is the number
of differing positions between two strings of identical length. For two binary
strings <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, this is just the <code>popcount</code> of them XORed together. For
example:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1">00100110</span>
<span id="cb1-2">01100000 ^</span>
<span id="cb1-3">--------</span>
<span id="cb1-4">01000110</span>
<span id="cb1-5"></span>
<span id="cb1-6">popcount(01000110) = 3</span></code></pre></div>
<p>For telecommunications applications, this helps us calculate the signal
distance, where a known word is sent over the wire and the number of flipped
bits are counted to provide an estimate of the error introduced by transmission.</p>
<p>We can then design an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance#Error_detection_and_error_correction">error-correcting
code</a>
accordingly, e.g.&nbsp;if we want to be robust against up to 2 flipped bits, our
code words need to differ in Hamming distance by at least 5.</p>
<h4 id="binary-convolutional-neural-networks">Binary Convolutional Neural Networks</h4>
<p>And now for something completely different: binary convolutional neural
networks! But first, what are they?</p>
<ul>
<li>Binary means that we’re using matrices consisting of only the values +1 (coded
as <code>1</code>) and -1 (coded as <code>0</code>), as opposed to 32-bit floating-point values.</li>
<li>Convolutional means matrix multiplication is involved?</li>
<li>Neural networks are systems inspired by animal brains (I’m a bit hazy on
this part).</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, we have to do binary matrix multiplication. But what’s special
about binary matrices?</p>
<p>Ordinary matrix multiplication on 32-bit values is a good fit on desktop
computers with powerful CPUs and GPUs, but increasingly we also want to do
useful work on smaller and simpler devices, such as smartphones, routers,
smartwatches, etc. We can decompose these more complex matrices into layers of
binary matrices, and these resulting matrices are so much easier to store and
operate on that we are better off even though there are more layers.</p>
<p>Where does <code>popcount</code> come into play? It’s used to calculate the dot product of
two binary matrices:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1">a = xnor(x, y)</span>
<span id="cb2-2">b = popcount(a)</span>
<span id="cb2-3">c = len(a)</span>
<span id="cb2-4">dot(x, y) = 2 × b − c</span></code></pre></div>
<p>More details are available
<a href="https://sushscience.wordpress.com/2017/10/01/understanding-binary-neural-networks/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metalperformanceshaders/mpscnnbinaryconvolution">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="chess-programming">Chess Programming</h4>
<p>Many chess programs store data using a
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards">bitboard</a> representation, which
conveniently fits into a 64-bit word. <a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Population_Count">Population
Count</a> has been used to
perform meaningful operations with this representation, such as calculating the
<a href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Mobility#Mobility_with_Bitboards">mobility</a>
of a piece.</p>
<h4 id="molecular-fingerprinting">Molecular Fingerprinting</h4>
<p>This is related to the notion of Hamming distance above: molecules are hashed
in some way and compared (with <code>popcount</code>) to determine how similar they are.
More details on that
<a href="http://www.dalkescientific.com/writings/diary/archive/2008/06/26/fingerprint_background.html">here</a>.</p>
<h4 id="hash-array-mapped-tries">Hash Array Mapped Tries</h4>
<p>This is where I first learned about <code>popcount</code>! The HAMT is a data structure
(<a href="https://lampwww.epfl.ch/papers/idealhashtrees.pdf">pioneered by Phil
Bagwell</a>) that can store a
very large number of values (usually 32 or 64) in an array at each node of the
trie. However, allocating memory for a 32 or 64-element array every time can be
incredibly wasteful, especially if the array only actually contains a handful
of elements. The solution is to add a bitmask in which the number of bits that
are set corresponds to the number of elements in the array, which allows the
array to grow and shrink as required. Calculating the index for a given element
efficiently can then be done using <code>popcount</code>. You can learn more about how
they work from <a href="https://vaibhavsagar.com/blog/2018/07/29/hamts-from-scratch/">this blog post</a>, where I
implement them myself.</p>
<h4 id="succinct-data-structures">Succinct Data Structures</h4>
<p>This is an exciting new area of research that focuses on how to store data in
as little space as possible, without having to decompress it in order to do
useful work. One technique is to think in terms of arrays of bits (bitvectors), which can be
queried using two operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rank(i)</code> counts the number of bits set upto the <code>i</code>th index in the bitvector</li>
<li><code>select(i)</code> finds the index where the <code>i</code>th ranked bit is set</li>
</ul>
<p>Making these operations efficient on large bitvectors requires constructing an
index and using it effectively, both involving <code>popcount</code>. There’s <a href="https://alexbowe.com/rrr/">a good
overview of the RRR index here</a>, and as far as I can
tell the current state-of-the-art approach is described in <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./dga/papers/zhou-sea2013.pdf">Space-Efficient,
High-Performance Rank &amp; Select Structures on Uncompressed Bit
Sequences</a>.</p>
<h4 id="compiler-optimisations">Compiler Optimisations</h4>
<p><code>popcount</code> has become so pervasive that both
<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/JUzmD8">GCC</a> and <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/AVqMGl">Clang</a>
will detect an implementation of <code>popcount</code> and replace it with the built-in
instruction. Imagine Clippy going “I see you are trying to implement
<code>popcount</code>, let me go ahead and fix that for you”! The relevant LLVM code is
<a href="https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm/blob/f36485f7ac2a8d72ad0e0f2134c17fd365272285/lib/Transforms/Scalar/LoopIdiomRecognize.cpp#L960">here</a>.
Daniel Lemire points to this as an example of <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2016/05/23/the-surprising-cleverness-of-modern-compilers/">the surprising cleverness of
modern
compilers</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>From beginnings shrouded in mystery, <code>popcount</code> has emerged as a generally
useful, if slightly unusual, CPU instruction. I love how it ties together such
different fields of computing, and I wonder how many other similarly weird
instructions are out there. If you have a favourite, I’d love to hear about it!</p>

<p>
The following is based upon systems of equations found in "Symmetry in Chaos,
A Search for Pattern in Mathematics, Art, and Nature" (the second edition) by
Michael Field and Martin Golubitsky.
They ask the question whether there are aperiodic chaotic attractors that generate
symmetric patterns?
Can there be order within chaotic systems?
</p>

The attractors are based upon the following
formula for the m+1'th term in the series given 5 parameters a<sub>0</sub>
 a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>4</sub>. The integer n is the degree of symmetry.
The z is complex valued and all a<sub>n</sub> are real valued.
</p>

</center><p>
Many of the examples presented here are named as published in the book and by other experimenters. The parameters a<sub>0</sub> 
 a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>4</sub> for some are provided in the book and subsequent papers, 
where they are denoted as lambda, alpha, beta, omega and gamma respectively.

The images here are generated by iterating the series typically 1,000 million times. This is performed in two passes,
the first pass with many fewer iterations is used to find the bounds of the attractor on the complex plane, the second
pass actually "draws" the attractor points. The process of drawing involves treating the bounded region of the complex
plane as a 2D histogram, each time the series passes through a pixel region on the plane the histogram at that
location is incremented. One might imagine the 2D histogram as a height field, a larger values at a point indicate
that the complex series passed through that pixel more often than a point with a smaller value.
At the end of the process the histogram is mapped onto colours depending on the histogram values, there are many
ways to do this based on aesthetic grounds.

A rough guide to parameters.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of n determines the rotational symmetry of the image, it should be greater than or equal to 2.
</li><li>a<sub>0</sub> is usually between -3 and 3, values between -1 and 1 are generally less interesting.
</li><li>a<sub>1</sub> should have the opposite sign as a<sub>0</sub>, and be in the same range.
</li><li>a<sub>2</sub> perturbs the attractor, it can be 0.
</li><li>a<sub>3</sub> controls bilateral symmetry, 0 will result in mirror symmetry. Otherwise typical values
are between -1 and 1.
</li><li>a<sub>4</sub> typically between -1 and 1 and not too close to zero.
</li></ul><center>

Unfortunately, for a system of equations with 6 parameters and therefore a large parameter space, the set of
parameters that yield "interesting" results is quite small.
