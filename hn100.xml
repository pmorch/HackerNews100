<p>A next-generation COVID-19 mucosal vaccine is set to be a gamechanger not only when delivering the vaccine itself, but also for people who are needle-phobic.</p>



<p>New Griffith University research, published in Nature Communications, has been testing the efficacy of delivering a COVID-19 vaccine via the nasal passages.</p>

<p>Professor Suresh Mahalingam from Griffith’s Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics and Griffith Health has been working on this research for the past four years.</p>



<p>“This is a live attenuated intranasal vaccine, called CDO-7N-1, designed to be administered intranasally, thereby inducing potential mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity with just a single dose,” Professor Mahalingam said.</p>



<p>“The vaccine induces strong memory responses in the nasal mucosa offering long-term protection for up to a year or more.</p>



<p>“It’s been designed to be administered as single dose, ideally as a booster vaccine, as a safe alternative to needles with no adverse reactions in the short or long term.”</p>



<p>Live-attenuated vaccines offer several significant advantages over other vaccine approaches.</p>



<p>They induce potent and long-lived humoral and cellular immunity, often with just a single dose.</p>



<p>Live-attenuated vaccines comprise the entire virus thereby providing broad immunity, in contrast to a single antigen which is used in many other vaccine platforms.</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Xiang Liu said the vaccine provides cross-protection against all variants of concern, and has neutralising capacity against SARS-CoV-1.</p>



<p>“The vaccine offers potent protection against transmission, prevents reinfection and the spread of the virus, while also reducing the generation of new variants,” Dr Liu said.</p>



<p>“Unlike the mRNA vaccine which targets only the spike protein, CDO-7N-1 induces immunity to all major SARS-CoV-2 proteins and is highly effective against all major variants to date.</p>



<p>“Importantly, the vaccine remains stable at 4°C for seven months, making it ideal for low- and middle-income countries.”</p>



<p>The vaccine has been licensed to Indian Immunologicals Ltd, a major vaccine manufacturer.</p>



<p>&nbsp;Dr. K. Anand Kumar, co-author of the publication and Managing&nbsp;Director of Indian Immunologicals Ltd. Said: “We are a leading ‘One Health’ company that has developed and launched several vaccines for human and animal use in India and are currently exporting to 62 countries.”</p>



<p>“We have completed all the necessary studies of this novel COVID-19 vaccine which offers tremendous advantages over other vaccines.</p>



<p>“We now look forward to taking the vaccine candidate to clinical&nbsp;trials.”</p>



<p>Professor Lee Smith, Acting Director of the Institute for Biomedicine and Glycomics, said he was delighted with the research findings.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration has been warning for years that some <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/caveat-emptor-90-of-tattoo-inks-have-unlabeled-or-mislabeled-ingredients/">tattoo inks</a> are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetics-recalls-alerts/fda-advises-consumers-tattoo-artists-and-retailers-avoid-using-or-selling-certain-tattoo-inks">brimming with bacteria</a>—a large assortment that, when injected into your skin, can cause inflammatory reactions, allergic hypersensitivity, toxic responses, and, of course, straight-up infections. And, worse yet, the labels that say the inks are sterile are not reliable.</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/sierra-stain-recalls-tattoo-pigments-because-possible-health-risk">a recent recall of three tattoo pigments</a> from the same manufacturer does a good job of illustrating the FDA's concerns. The water-based inks, all from Sierra Stain, had a bizarre array of bacteria, which were found at high levels, according to FDA testing.
</p><p>One ink product—described as "Carolina Blue"—offered a microbial menagerie, with six odd species identified. They included a bacterium that often dwells in the gastrointestinal system and can <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10909985/">inflame the mucosal lining of the intestines</a> (<em>Citrobacter braakii</em>), a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2897476/'">water-borne bacterium</a> (<em>Cupriavidus pauculus</em>), and several that cause opportunistic infections (<em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2849549/">Citrobacter farmer</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6166261/">Achromobacter xylosoxidans</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9499045/">Ochrobactrum anthropi</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4187640/">Pseudomonas fluorescens</a></em>). These are bacteria that don't typically go about attacking humans but will if the conditions are right, including when they find themselves inside a human with a compromised immune system.</p>
<p>An ink called "UV China Pink" contained an unusual soil bacterium (<em>Curtobacterium citreum/pusillum</em>). And an "All Purpose Black" ink puzzlingly contained <em>Acetobacter senegalensis</em>, a bacterium first isolated from <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35182093/">mangos in Senegal</a> and used for industrial vinegar production in low-income countries.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The three inks were sold nationwide through Amazon. To date, there have been no reported infections or adverse reactions linked to these inks. But the FDA notes that reactions to contaminated inks can be difficult to accurately diagnose. The infections and skin responses can look like generic rashes and allergic responses, sometimes including lesions with red papules in areas where the ink was injected, the FDA notes. However, infections from tattoo ink can leave permanent scarring.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.00276-24">a study published in July in Applied and Environmental Microbiology</a>, FDA researchers tested 75 samples of tattoo and permanent makeup inks from 14 manufacturers. Of the 75 inks, 26 (35 percent) were contaminated with a total of 34 types of bacteria, many that were possibly disease-causing. Some of the bacteria were anaerobic, meaning they don't need oxygen to grow, suggesting they could thrive in the low-oxygen environment of skin layers. Of the 40 tattoo inks specifically, nine (22 percent) were contaminated. Among all the ink samples, 49 were labeled "sterile" and, of those, 16 (33 percent) were contaminated.</p>
<p>The recall announcement noted that Sierra Stain is no longer in business. While the company lists a remaining email address, it did not immediately respond to a comment request from Ars on the bacteria found in their inks.</p>
<p>The FDA recommends that consumers be vigilant about the quality and safety of tattoo supplies and techniques. It also encourages tattoo artists to work in professional environments that can reduce the risk of contamination.</p>

            <div>
                <p>U.S. Ambassador to Canada David Cohen says Canadians are consuming too much American news, which he believes is “unhealthy” because of American legacy media’s polarizing and partisan nature.</p>
<p>He added that it’s come at the expense of Canadians consuming news about their own country’s politics.</p>
<p>Cohen made the comments during a recent <a href="https://thehub.ca/podcasts/the-united-states-has-no-more-important-friend-partner-or-ally-than-canada-u-s-ambassador-david-cohen-on-canadian-american-relations-trade-protectionism-and-nato-spending/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with <em>The Hub’s</em> managing editor, Harrison Lowman.</p>
<p>When asked about Canadians’ apparent obsession and preoccupation with the political news of the United States, Cohen, who is a former Comcast media executive, explained that he finds Canada’s consumption of American news from CNN, MSNBC, and Fox to be somewhat strange.</p>
<p>“I do think it is odd, particularly when I contrast it to the United States, where…virtually no one in the United States is paying any attention to Canadian politics,” he said.</p>
<p>“Every major Canadian household has easy access to American cable television news,” he noted.</p>
<p>“I’ll be honest with you, before I came here…Canadian cable television news outlets, I didn’t even know how to get them in the United States,” he added.</p>
<p>According to new <a href="https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/digital-news-report/2024/canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics</a> from the Reuters Institute, a significant number of Canadians, particularly in English Canada, rely on American outlets like CNN and the <em>New York Times</em> on a weekly basis for news.</p>
<p>In 2018, Canada was the <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2018/07/as-the-new-york-times-extends-its-reach-across-countries-and-languages-and-cultures-it-looks-to-locals-for-guidance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest</a> foreign market for the <i>New York Times</i>, making up around 27 percent of its total foreign audience. In an <a href="http://www.canadalandshow.com/podcast/whats-new-york-times-canada/">interview</a> with <i>Canadaland</i>, the then <i>New York Times</i> Canada bureau chief said the paper’s Canadian audience hovered around 94,000.</p>
<p>In 2024, a <i>New York Times </i><a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/the-new-york-times-passes-2m-international-digital-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> announced the paper had reached two million international subscriptions, highlighting that it has “seen subscriber growth in recent years” in Canada. Some estimates have claimed the <i>New York Times</i> has more paying Canadian digital subscribers than any Canadian news outlet.</p>

                <h4><b>A Canadian fixation with America</b></h4>
<p>Within our borders, Canadian media outlets have also become fixated on American politics.</p>
<p><i>True North</i> reported that Canada’s public broadcaster <i>CBC</i> <a href="https://tnc.news/2024/08/20/cbcs-kamala-mania-68-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> 68 stories about the Kamala Harris campaign in one month. Back in 2020, <i>CBC</i> <a href="https://tnc.news/2020/08/17/500-more-cbc-headlines-about-kamala-harris-than-leslyn-lewis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> 500 percent more stories about Harris than about Leslyn Lewis, a black woman running for federal office in Canada.</p>
<p><i>CBC</i> has also held U.S. election night TV specials for the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/how-to-watch-us-election-cbc-1.5782601" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mkb3oFIFAXc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016</a> U.S. presidential elections.</p>
<p>“World coverage has been a hallmark of <i>CBC News </i>since the public broadcaster was founded, and we dedicate more resources to international reporting than any other media outlet in Canada,” <i>CBC</i> general manager and editor-in-chief Brodie Fenlon recently <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/editorsblog/why-cbc-news-follows-the-u-s-presidential-election-1.7299084" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> in an article justifying the public broadcaster’s coverage of U.S. politics.</p>
<p>“​​Within our coverage of the world, the United States occupies a special place for some obvious reasons,” he added. “From arts and culture, national security, the economy to the environment—our countries are inextricably linked.”</p>
<p>As previously reported by <i>The Hub</i>, Canada’s politics are <a href="https://thehub.ca/2024/08/09/elie-cantin-nantel-trudeaus-liberals-are-americanizing-canadas-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">growing</a> more and more Americanized.</p>

                <h4><b>Slanted news</b></h4>
<p>Ambassador Cohen said even American outlets themselves have what he considers to be “an unhealthy preoccupation with American politics.”</p>
<p>“You’re getting an unfiltered and 24/7 perspective on the political structure from all of these cable television news outlets, without the balancing perspective of lots of people around you who have different opinions and who can balance a little bit what you’re seeing on a cable television news show,” he explained.</p>
<p>“I do think it’s unhealthy,” said Cohen, admitting that for his own mental health he took an intentional break from his country’s political news channels this summer.</p>
<p>According to media analysts, America’s “Big Three” news channels—<i>Fox News, CNN, </i>and<i> MSNBC</i>—all have political biases.</p>
<p>The AllSides bias checker rates <i>Fox News</i> as having a <a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fox-news-editorial-media-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right-wing</a> bias, <i>CNN</i> as having a bias that <a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leans Left</a>, and <i>MSNBC</i> as having a <a href="https://www.allsides.com/news-source/msnbc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left-wing</a> bias.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, many American newsrooms are lacking ideological diversity. According to a <a href="https://www.theamericanjournalist.org/_files/ugd/46a507_4fe1c4d6ec6d4c229895282965258a7a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2022 Syracuse University study</a>, just 3.4 percent of American journalists now describe themselves as Republicans, while 36.4 percent describe themselves as Democrats.</p>
<p>“I come from Pennsylvania… [which] I think has been properly identified as maybe the battleground state in the upcoming election,” said Cohen. “So I can’t go anywhere in Pennsylvania where I don’t find equal numbers of people who have very different political opinions than what is being carried on <i>MSNBC</i> and, to a large extent, on <i>CNN</i>.”</p>
<p>“It’s just not necessarily an accurate depiction of the political process and the way people think to just get your news and information from cable television news outlets,” he added.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Cohen has spoken about Canada’s massive appetite for American news.</p>
<p>In a July interview with the<i> Hill Times</i>, Cohen <a href="https://www.hilltimes.com/story/2024/07/10/american-envoy-david-cohen-navigates-unaccustomed-hiatus-from-political-arena-as-presidential-vote-looms/427688/">said</a> he believes one of the reasons why Canadians are often anxious about the United States is because of their media consumption.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><img alt="Pidgin" height="900" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2024/08/27/pidgin-header.jpg" width="1600"></p>
<p>The Pidgin messaging app removed the ScreenShareOTR plugin from its official third-party plugin list after it was discovered that it was used to install keyloggers, information stealers, and malware commonly used to gain initial access to corporate networks.</p>
<p>The plugin was promoted as a screen-sharing tool for secure Off-The-Record (OTR) protocol and was available for both Windows and Linux versions of Pidgin.</p>
<p>According to ESET, the malicious plugin was configured to infect unsuspecting users with <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/darkgate-and-pikabot-malware-emerge-as-qakbots-successors/" target="_blank">DarkGate malware</a>, a powerful malware threat actors use to breach networks since QBot's dismantling by the authorities.</p>
<h2>Sneaky Pidgin plugin</h2>
<p>Pidgin is an open-source, cross-platform instant messaging client that supports multiple networks and messaging protocols.</p>
<p>Although not as popular as in the mid-2000s when multi-protocol clients were in high demand, it remains a popular choice among those seeking to consolidate their messaging accounts into a single app and has a dedicated user base of tech-savvy individuals, open-source enthusiasts, and users who need to connect to legacy IM systems.</p>
<p>Pidgin operates a plugin system that allows users to extend the program's functionality, enable niche features, and unlock new customization options.</p>
<p>Users can download them from the project's official <a href="https://pidgin.im/plugins/?publisher=all&amp;query=&amp;type=" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">third-party plugins list</a>, currently hosting 211 addons.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://pidgin.im/posts/2024-08-malicious-plugin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">an announcement</a> on the project's website&nbsp;last week, a malicious plugin named 'ss-otr' had slipped into the list on July 6, 2024, and was only pulled on August 16 following a user report about it being a keylogger and screenshot capturing tool.</p>
<div><p>"A plugin, ss-otr, was added to the third party plugins list on July 6th. On August 16th we received a report from 0xFFFC0000 that the plugin contained a key logger and shared screen shots with unwanted parties.</p><p>
We quietly pulled the plugin from the list immediately and started investigating. On August 22nd Johnny Xmas was able to confirm that a keylogger was present." – Pidgin</p></div>
<p>A red flag is that ss-otr only provided binaries for download and not any source code, but due to the lack of robust reviewing mechanisms in Pidgin's third-party plugin repository, nobody questioned its security.</p>
<h2>Plugin leads to DarkGate malware</h2>
<p>ESET <a href="https://x.com/ESETresearch/status/1828114327976415445" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reports</a> the plugin installer is signed with a valid digital certificate issued to <em>INTERREX – SP. Z O.O.</em>, a legitimate Polish company.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Signed executable" height="515" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Linux/04/signed.jpg" width="810"><figcaption><strong>Signed executable</strong><br><em>Source: ESET</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The plugin offers the advertised functionality of screen sharing but also contains malicious code, allowing it to download additional binaries from the attacker's server at jabberplugins[.]net.</p>
<p>The downloaded payloads are either PowerShell scripts or the DarkGate malware, which is also signed by an Interrex certificate.</p>
<p>A similar mechanism is implemented for the Linux version of the Pidgin client, so both platforms are covered.</p>
<p>ESET says that the same malicious server, which has been taken down now, hosted additional plugins named OMEMO, Pidgin Paranoia, Master Password, Window Merge, and HTTP File Upload.</p>
<p>These plugins were almost certainly also delivering DarkGate, indicating that ScreenShareOTR was just one small part of a broader-scale campaign.</p>
<div>
<figure><img alt="Threat actor's website" height="600" src="https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/2024/Linux/04/site.jpg" width="800"><figcaption><strong>Threat actor's website</strong><br><em>Source: ESET</em></figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Those who installed it are recommended to remove it immediately and perform a full system scan with an antivirus tool, as DarkGate may be lurking on their system.</p>
<p>After publishing our story, Pidgin's maintainer and lead developer, Gary Kramlich, <a href="https://infosec.exchange/@grimmy@mastodon.social/113035335884182662" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">notified us on Mastodon</a> to say that they do not keep track of how many times a plugin is installed.</p>
<p>To prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, Pidgin announced that, from now on, it will only accept third-party plugins that have an OSI Approved Open Source License, allowing scrutiny into their code and internal functionality.</p>
<p><em>Update 8/27/24: Updated story to note that Pidgin does not keep track of plugin downloads.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Cerebras inference is designed to serve models from billions to trillions of parameters. When models exceed the memory capacity of a single wafer, we split them at layer boundaries and map them to multiple CS-3 systems. 20B models fit on a single CS-3 while 70B models fit on as few as four systems. In the weeks to come we will be adding larger models such as Llama3-405B and Mistral Large with industry leading speed and cost per token.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>16-bit model weights for the highest accuracy</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Some companies try to overcome the memory bandwidth bottleneck by reducing weight precision from 16-bit to 8-bit, often without informing their users. This approach, however, can result in loss of accuracy. Cerebras inference runs Llama3.1 8B and 70B models using the original 16-bit weights released by Meta, ensuring the most accurate and reliable model output. Our evaluations, along with third-party benchmarks, show that 16-bit models score up to 5% higher than their 8-bit counterparts, resulting in substantially better performance in multi-turn conversations, math, and reasoning tasks.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Cerebras Inference API</h3>
</div><p><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span>Cerebras</span><span> inference is available today via </span></span><a href="http://link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">chat</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span> and </span></span><a href="http://link/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="none"><span data-ccp-charstyle="Hyperlink">API</span></span></a><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"><span> access. Built on the familiar OpenAI Chat Completions format, it allows developers to integrate our powerful inference capabilities by simply swapping out the API key. </span><span>Cerebras</span><span> inference API offers some of the most generous rate limits in the industry at </span><span>60 tokens per minute and </span><span>1</span><span> million tokens per day</span><span>, making it the ideal platform for AI developers to </span><span>built</span><span> interactive and agentic applications.</span></span></p><div><p><span data-contrast="auto">Cerebras inference API offers the best combination of performance, speed, accuracy and cost. At 450 tokens per second, it’s the only solution that runs Llama3.1-70B at instantaneous speed. We use Meta’s original 16-bit model weights, ensuring the highest accuracy. For launch we are providing developers with 1 million free tokens daily. For at scale deployments, our pricing is a fraction of popular GPU clouds.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">For initial launch, we are offering Llama3.1 8B and 70B models. We will be adding support for larger models such as Llama3 405B and Mistral Large 2 in the coming weeks. Please let us know what models you’d like to see added.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Why fast inference matters</h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">The implications of high-speed inference extend far beyond raw metrics. By dramatically reducing processing time, we’re enabling more complex AI workflows and enhancing real-time LLM intelligence. Traditional LLMs output everything they think immediately, without stopping to consider the best possible answer. New techniques like scaffolding, on the other hand, function like a thoughtful agent who explores different possible solutions before deciding. This “thinking before speaking” approach provides over 10x performance on demanding tasks like code generation, fundamentally boosting the intelligence of AI models without additional training. But these techniques require up to 100x more tokens at runtime, and thus is only possible in real time running on Cerebras hardware.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With record-breaking performance, industry-leading pricing, and open API access, Cerebras Inference sets a new standard for open LLM development and deployment. As the only solution capable of delivering both high-speed training and inference, Cerebras opens entirely new capabilities for AI. We can’t wait to see the new and exciting applications developers will build with Cerebras Inference.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:278}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p itemprop="text">A “time capsule” has been discovered at London’s National Gallery, buried deep in a column in the foyer of the Sainsbury Wing. It is a letter recording that one of the wing’s funders, John Sainsbury (Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover), believed the architects had committed a serious “mistake”. The 1990 letter, typed on Sainsbury’s supermarket notepaper, has recently been deposited in the gallery’s archive as an historic document.</p><p itemprop="text">John Sainsbury is critical in the letter of the American post-Modernist architect Robert Venturi and his professional partner and wife Denise Scott Brown for inserting two large false columns in the gallery’s foyer that served no structural purpose. Other than the false columns, John Sainsbury was happy with the Venturi and Scott Brown design.</p><p itemprop="text">While building work was under way, Sainsbury gained access to the site and dropped his letter into a concrete column that was under construction. The letter, protected in a plastic folder, was discovered last year, when the foyer was being reconfigured.</p><p itemprop="text">The Sainsbury letter of 26 July 1990 was addressed “To those who find this note”—who turned out to be the 2023 demolition workers.</p><p itemprop="text">The note, typed in capital letters, continues:</p><p itemprop="text">IF YOU HAVE FOUND THIS NOTE YOU MUST BE ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING ONE OF THE FALSE COLUMNS THAT HAVE BEEN PLACED IN THE FOYER OF THE SAINSBURY WING OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY. I BELIEVE THAT THE FALSE COLUMNS ARE A MISTAKE OF THE ARCHITECT AND THAT WE WOULD LIVE TO REGRET OUR ACCEPTING THIS DETAIL OF HIS DESIGN.</p><p itemprop="text">LET IT BE KNOWN THAT ONE OF THE DONORS OF THIS BUILDING IS ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED THAT YOUR GENERATION HAS DECIDED TO DISPENSE WITH THE UNNECESSARY COLUMNS.</p><figure><img alt="" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/e483264430dfee3ca8ed67838ae3808fb9b4bbae-1400x1989.jpg?rect=0,0,1399,1989&amp;w=750&amp;h=1066&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format 1x, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/e483264430dfee3ca8ed67838ae3808fb9b4bbae-1400x1989.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=2728&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format 2x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/e483264430dfee3ca8ed67838ae3808fb9b4bbae-1400x1989.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=2728&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" width="644" height="914.9399999999999" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"><figcaption><p>John Sainsbury's letter of 26 July 1990 was discovered last year, protected in a plastic folder, during building works to reconfigure the foyer of the Sainsbury Wing of London's National Gallery  <span>Courtesy of the National Gallery and by permission of the Sainsbury family</span></p></figcaption></figure><p itemprop="text">John and his wife Anya presumably never imagined that the demolition of the Sainsbury Wing foyer might take place during their lifetimes. John, one of the most generous UK donors to the arts, died in 2022, aged 94. His widow Anya, a former ballerina, was present when her husband’s note was removed. “I was so happy for John’s letter to be rediscovered after all these years,” she says, “and I feel he would be relieved and delighted for the gallery’s new plans and the extra space they are creating.”</p><p itemprop="text">The Sainsbury Wing was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1991, just under a year after John wrote his time capsule letter. It was entirely funded by John and his two Sainsbury brothers: Simon (who died in 2006) and Timothy (a former Conservative minister, now aged 92). It was their great-grandfather who established the London grocery shop which has now become the UK’s second largest supermarket chain, after Tesco.</p><div><blockquote>I was so happy for John’s letter to be rediscovered after all these years, and I feel he would be relieved and delighted for the gallery’s new plans and the extra space they are creating <p>Anya Sainsbury</p></blockquote></div><p itemprop="text">Neil MacGregor, the director of the National Gallery when the Sainsbury Wing was planned and built, tells <em>The Art Newspaper</em>: “Venturi wanted the foyer to have the feel of a mighty crypt, leading upstairs to the galleries, so it was a subsidiary space—the beginning of a journey, not a destination. John Sainsbury argued that sightlines should be as unencumbered as possible, thinking the extra columns would conceal the entrance to the lecture theatre and temporary exhibition galleries, confusing the visitor.”</p><figure><img alt="" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/0a733d1463e90e5134c5bfa604bb0d91ffbfdf6c-1468x1101.jpg?rect=1,0,1467,1101&amp;w=750&amp;h=563&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format 1x, https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/0a733d1463e90e5134c5bfa604bb0d91ffbfdf6c-1468x1101.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=1440&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format 2x" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/cxgd3urn/production/0a733d1463e90e5134c5bfa604bb0d91ffbfdf6c-1468x1101.jpg?w=1920&amp;h=1440&amp;fit=crop&amp;auto=format" width="644" height="483" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" loading="lazy"><figcaption><p>Anya Sainsbury (centre) holds her late husband John’s 1990 letter after being shown it on site in the Sainsbury Wing by the National Gallery’s director, Gabriele Finaldi (left) and chairman, John Booth, last year<br><span>Photo: Sarah Butler-Sloss</span></p></figcaption></figure><p itemprop="text">MacGregor ultimately concluded in the late 1980s that the false columns were acceptable: “Although there were drawbacks, Venturi had a coherent idea of the organic link between entrance hall, staircase and main galleries. I felt that, on balance, we should let the architect be the architect.”</p><p itemprop="text">The size of the Sainsbury family’s original donation has never been officially revealed, but <em>The Art Newspaper</em> understands that it was around £40m (equivalent to £90m today). It might be considered exceedingly gracious of John Sainsbury to have donated a third of this sum—and not to have insisted that his wishes relating to the false columns should be respected.</p><h4>Sainsbury family is largest contributor to £85m  upgrade of Sainsbury Wing</h4><p itemprop="text">Last year the National Gallery embarked on a £85m project to upgrade the Sainsbury Wing and develop new facilities in the adjacent part of its main building. The main improvement in the Sainsbury Wing will be a more open and welcoming foyer, to cope with double the number of visitors that had been envisaged in the 1980s.</p><p itemprop="text">This scheme, designed by the architect Annabelle Selldorf, included the demolition of the two non-structural columns. These were located on the ground floor near the former cloakroom, halfway between the street entrance and the stairs and lift leading down to the basement. Three adjacent structural columns have needed to be retained.</p><p itemprop="text">Demolition of the two columns was criticised by the Twentieth Century Society, which argued that they “contribute to the sense of weight and the lobby’s function as an anticipatory space”. The National Gallery recently took a different view, pointing out that wayfinding is hindered by columns which “restrict views to the lifts and obscures the entrance to the [lecture] theatre and temporary exhibition spaces”. Westminster City Council gave planning permission for the National Gallery’s plan—and the columns in the listed building were demolished last year.</p><p itemprop="text">Venturi died in 2018. His partner Scott Brown has vociferously opposed the redesign of the foyer.</p><p itemprop="text">The Sainsbury family is the largest financial contributor to the present project. Although the gallery has not released the figures, the Linbury Trust (set up by John and Anya) and the Headley Trust (set up by Timothy and his wife Susan) have each committed £5m. Their £10m joint contribution represents one of the largest donations to a UK museum in recent years.</p><p itemprop="text">Building work has taken longer than originally anticipated, but the newly refurbished Sainsbury Wing is now due to reopen in May next year. Visitors will then be able to make their own judgement on the architectural controversy.</p></div></div>]]></description>
