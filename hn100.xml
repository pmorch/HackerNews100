<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    
<p><span>OpenAI this week</span> quietly deleted language expressly prohibiting the use of its technology for military purposes from its usage policy, which seeks to dictate how powerful and immensely popular tools like ChatGPT can be used.</p>



<p>Up until January 10, OpenAI’s “usage policies” <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240109122522/https:/openai.com/policies/usage-policies">page</a> included a ban on “activity that has high risk of physical harm, including,” specifically, “weapons development” and “military and warfare.” That plainly worded prohibition against military applications would seemingly rule out any official, and extremely lucrative, use by the Department of Defense or any other state military. The <a href="https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies">new policy</a> retains an injunction not to “use our service to harm yourself or others” and gives “develop or use weapons” as an example, but the blanket ban on “military and warfare” use has vanished.</p>



<p>The unannounced redaction is part of a major rewrite of the policy page, which the company said was intended to make the document “clearer” and “more readable,” and which includes many other substantial language and formatting changes.</p>



<!-- BLOCK(cta)[0](%7B%22componentName%22%3A%22CTA%22%2C%22entityType%22%3A%22SHORTCODE%22%2C%22optional%22%3Atrue%7D)(%7B%7D) -->

<!-- END-BLOCK(cta)[0] -->



<p>“We aimed to create a set of universal principles that are both easy to remember and apply, especially as our tools are now globally used by everyday users who can now also build GPTs,” OpenAI spokesperson Niko Felix said in an email to The Intercept. “A principle like ‘Don’t harm others’ is broad yet easily grasped and relevant in numerous contexts. Additionally, we specifically cited weapons and injury to others as clear examples.”</p>



<p>Felix declined to say whether the vaguer “harm” ban encompassed all military use, writing, “Any use of our technology, including by the military, to ‘[develop] or [use] weapons, [injure] others or [destroy] property, or [engage] in unauthorized activities that violate the security of any service or system,’ is disallowed.”</p>



<p>“OpenAI is well aware of the risk and harms that may arise due to the use of their technology and services in military applications,” said Heidy Khlaaf, engineering director at the cybersecurity firm Trail of Bits and an expert on machine learning and autonomous systems safety, citing a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14157.pdf">2022 paper </a>she co-authored with OpenAI researchers that specifically flagged the risk of military use. Khlaaf added that the new policy seems to emphasize legality over safety. “There is a distinct difference between the two policies, as the former clearly outlines that weapons development, and military and warfare is disallowed, while the latter emphasizes flexibility and compliance with the law,” she said. “Developing weapons, and carrying out activities related to military and warfare is lawful to various extents. The potential implications for AI safety are significant. Given the well-known instances of bias and hallucination present within Large Language Models (LLMs), and their overall lack of accuracy, their use within military warfare can only lead to imprecise and biased operations that are likely to exacerbate harm and civilian casualties.”</p>



<p>The real-world consequences of the policy are unclear. Last year, The Intercept reported that OpenAI was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/05/08/chatgpt-ai-pentagon-military/">unwilling to say</a> whether it would enforce its own clear “military and warfare” ban in the face of increasing interest from the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence community.</p>



<p>“Given the use of AI systems in the targeting of civilians in Gaza, it’s a notable moment to make the decision to remove the words ‘military and warfare’ from OpenAI’s permissible use policy,” said Sarah Myers West, managing director of the AI Now Institute and a former AI policy analyst at the Federal Trade Commission. “The language that is in the policy remains vague and raises questions about how OpenAI intends to approach enforcement.”</p>

<p>While nothing OpenAI offers today could plausibly be used to directly kill someone, militarily or otherwise — ChatGPT can’t maneuver a drone or fire a missile — any military is in the business of killing, or at least maintaining the capacity to kill. There are any number of killing-adjacent tasks that a LLM like ChatGPT could augment, like writing code or processing <a href="https://asc.army.mil/web/news-chatgpt-in-dod-acquisitions/">procurement</a> orders. A review of custom ChatGPT-powered bots offered by OpenAI suggests U.S. military personnel are <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-r5Jaw1MFS-following-through-gpt">already</a> <a href="https://chat.openai.com/g/g-G0cfHcef9-army-doctrine-publication-6-22">using</a> the technology to expedite paperwork. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which directly aids U.S. combat efforts, has <a href="https://www.nga.mil/news/NGA_brings_products_closer_to_action_in_Middle_Eas.html">openly speculated about using ChatGPT to aid its human analysts</a>. Even if OpenAI tools were deployed by portions of a military force for purposes that aren’t directly violent, they would still be aiding an institution whose main purpose is lethality.</p>



<p>Experts who reviewed the policy changes at The Intercept’s request said OpenAI appears to be silently weakening its stance against doing business with militaries. “I could imagine that the shift away from ‘military and warfare’ to ‘weapons’ leaves open a space for OpenAI to support operational infrastructures as long as the application doesn’t directly involve weapons development narrowly defined,” said Lucy Suchman, professor emerita of anthropology of science and technology at Lancaster University. “Of course, I think the idea that you can contribute to warfighting platforms while claiming not to be involved in the development or use of weapons would be disingenuous, removing the weapon from the sociotechnical system – including command and control infrastructures – of which it’s part.” Suchman, a scholar of artificial intelligence since the 1970s and member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, added, “It seems plausible that the new policy document evades the question of military contracting and warfighting operations by focusing specifically on weapons.”</p>



<p>Suchman and Myers West both pointed to OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, a major defense contractor, which has invested $13 billion in the LLM maker to date and resells the company’s software tools.</p>

<p>The changes come as militaries around the world are eager to incorporate machine learning techniques to gain an advantage; the Pentagon is still tentatively exploring how it might use ChatGPT or other large-language models, a type of software tool that can rapidly and dextrously generate sophisticated text outputs. LLMs are trained on giant volumes of books, articles, and other web data in order to approximate human responses to user prompts. Though the outputs of an LLM like ChatGPT are often extremely convincing, they are optimized for coherence rather than a firm grasp on reality and often suffer from so-called hallucinations that make accuracy and factuality a problem. Still, the ability of LLMs to quickly ingest text and rapidly output analysis — or at least the simulacrum of analysis — makes them a natural fit for the data-laden Defense Department.</p>



<p>While some within U.S. military leadership have expressed <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2023-06/news/chatgpt-sparks-us-debate-over-military-use-ai">concern</a> about the tendency of LLMs to insert glaring factual errors or other distortions, as well as security risks that might come with using ChatGPT to analyze classified or otherwise sensitive data, the Pentagon remains generally eager to adopt artificial intelligence tools. In a November address, Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Speeches/Speech/Article/3578046/remarks-by-deputy-secretary-of-defense-kathleen-h-hicks-on-the-state-of-ai-in-t/">stated</a> that AI is “a key part of the comprehensive, warfighter-centric approach to innovation that Secretary [Lloyd] Austin and I have been driving from Day 1,” though she cautioned that most current offerings “aren’t yet technically mature enough to comply with our ethical AI principles.”</p>



<p>Last year, Kimberly Sablon, the Pentagon’s principal director for trusted AI and autonomy, <a href="https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/3/8/pentagons-top-ai-official-addresses-chatgpts-possible-benefits-risks">told</a> a conference in Hawaii that “[t]here’s a lot of good there in terms of how we can utilize large-language models like [ChatGPT] to disrupt critical functions across the department.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been running Linux full-time pretty much since Valve released Proton. I remember submitting reports to <a href="https://www.protondb.com/">ProtonDB</a> back when it was just a shared Google Sheet! In the years that followed I made it a point to test and report out on different games as new versions of Proton were released and support improved. I thought it important that we have a good data set for what worked and what didn't. Over those years I tested hundreds of games and submitted as many reports to the database.</p>
<p>In thinking back over my gaming in 2023, however, I realized that I fell out of the habit of submitting reports because <strong>I'm so used to Proton working that it's stopped occurring to me that it might not.</strong></p>
<p>That doesn't mean that there aren't some games that don't work -- it simply means that the success rate that I used to have (maybe 30-50% on average) has risen high enough that I'm genuinely surprised if something doesn't work (it's probably somewhere around 95% for me now, though that's biased by the types of games that I play). I actually tried to remember the last game that <em>didn't</em> work, and I genuinely couldn't tell you what it was. Everything I've played recently has booted like it's native.</p>
<p>Honestly, I genuinely don't even know which games are native and which run through Proton anymore. I've stopped caring!</p>
<p>I got my Steam Deck halfway through 2022. It was awesome, but it was definitely a bit rough around the edges. There weren't that many compatible games. The OS had some clunkiness. It matured though, and has gotten better. Among my friend group, I'm the only person who cares even a little bit about Linux. If you asked any of them to name three different Linux distributions they'd stare at you blankly because they wouldn't understand the question. Nevertheless, of my friends, SIX of them have Steam Decks and are now gaming regularly <strong>on Linux.</strong></p>
<p>There are currently <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Verified">~4,300 Deck Verified games</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/?refinementList%5Boslist%5D%5B0%5D=Steam%20Deck%20Playable">~8,700 Deck Playable games</a> according to Valve. On ProtonDB, ~8,600 games have been verified as working on Linux by at least three users, while ~19,700 games have been verified by at least one user. There is SO much variety available, and the speed with which we've gotten here has been pretty breathtaking.</p>
<p>This was my device breakdown for my Steam Replay for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>55% Steam Deck</li>
<li>32% Linux</li>
<li>10% Virtual Reality</li>
<li>4% Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>The only non-Linux gaming I did was VR and some local multiplayer stuff I have on a Windows machine hooked up to my TV.</p>
<p>I don't want to proselytize too much, but if you have a general interest in gaming, you could probably switch over to Linux full time and be perfectly happy with the variety of games you have available to you. Not too long ago, making the jump felt like a huge sacrifice because you'd be giving up so much -- SO many games were incompatible -- but it no longer feels that way. You can transfer and most of -- probably almost all -- your library will still work! Also, if a particular game doesn't work, there isn't too much sting because, well, there are thousands of others you can give your attention to.</p>
<p>If you have a specific game that you <em>must</em> play, then it's possibly a different story. If you love <a href="https://www.protondb.com/app/1085660"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>, for example, then full-time Linux definitely is not for you. The same goes VR -- it's simply not up to snuff on Linux yet. There are other niches too that don't transfer over as well (modding, racing sims, etc.) so, of course, this isn't a blanket recommendation and everyone's situation is different.</p>
<p>But for a prototypical person who's just your sort of general, everyday gamer? It's reached a point where they could be very happy on Linux. In fact, as proven by my friends and their Steam Decks, it's reached a point where people can be gaming on Linux <em>and not even know they're doing that.</em> That's how frictionless it's gotten!</p>
<p>I don't really have a point to this post other than to say it's incredible that we are where we are, and I'm beyond appreciative of all the effort that people have put in to making this possible.</p>

      Security researchers warned Apple as early as 2019 about vulnerabilities in its AirDrop wireless sharing function that Chinese authorities claim they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/10/tech/china-apple-airdrop-encryption-hnk-intl/index.html">recently used</a> to track down users of the feature, the researchers told CNN, in a case that experts say has sweeping implications for global privacy.

      The Chinese government’s actions targeting a tool that Apple customers around the world use to share photos and documents — and Apple’s apparent inaction to address the flaws — revive longstanding concerns by US lawmakers and privacy advocates about Apple’s relationship with China and about authoritarian regimes’ ability to twist US tech products to their own ends.

      AirDrop lets Apple users who are near each other share files using a proprietary mix of Bluetooth and other wireless connectivity without having to connect to the internet. The sharing feature has been used by <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/09/tech/china-airdrop-bluetooth-national-security-intl-hnk/index.html">pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong</a> and the Chinese government has cracked down on the feature in response.

      A Chinese tech firm, Beijing-based Wangshendongjian Technology, was able to compromise AirDrop to identify users on the Beijing subway accused of sharing “inappropriate information,” judicial authorities in Beijing said this week.

      Although Chinese officials portrayed the exploit as an effective law enforcement technique, internet freedom advocates are urging Apple to address the issue quickly and publicly.

      “Apple’s response to this situation is crucial,” said Benjamin Ismail, campaign and advocacy director of Greatfire.org, a group that monitors internet censorship in China. “They should either refute the claim or confirm it and immediately work on securing AirDrop against such vulnerabilities. It’s imperative that Apple is transparent about their response to these developments.”

      The Chinese claim has alarmed top US lawmakers. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the leading Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called on Apple to act swiftly.

      “Anyone using an iPhone should be concerned with the security of Apple’s AirDrop function,” Rubio told CNN. “This breach is just another way for Beijing to target any Apple user it perceives to be an opponent. The time to act is now, and Apple must be held accountable for failing to safeguard its users against such blatant security breaches.”

      A group of Germany-based researchers at the Technical University of Darmstadt, who first discovered the flaws in 2019, told CNN Thursday they had confirmation Apple received their original report at the time but that the company appears not to have acted on the findings. The same group published a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec21-heinrich.pdf" target="_blank">proposed fix</a> for the issue in 2021, but Apple appears not to have implemented it, the researchers said.

      One of the researchers, Milan Stute, shared an email with CNN showing a representative of Apple’s product security team acknowledging the researchers’ report in 2019.

      Chinese authorities claim they exploited the vulnerabilities by collecting some of the basic identifying information that must be transferred between two Apple devices when they use AirDrop — data including device names, email addresses and phone numbers.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000c356hvmkfx98l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Ordinarily, this information is scrambled for privacy reasons. But, according to a separate 2021 <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/04/23/apple-airdrop-has-significant-privacy-leak-say-german-researchers/" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the Darmstadt research by the UK-based cybersecurity firm Sophos, Apple appeared not to have taken the extra precaution of adding bogus data to the mix to further randomize the results — a process known as “salting.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000d356hmrw7lfk6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      That apparent failure allowed the Chinese tech firm to more easily reverse-engineer the original information from the encrypted data, in what seems to be “kind of an amateur mistake” by Apple, said Sascha Meinrath, the Palmer chair in telecommunications at Penn State University. “It certainly merits an explanation from Apple since it would point to a serious flaw in their technology.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000e356h8c29v7m8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      While AirDrop’s device-to-device communications channel is typically protected from third-party snooping by its own layer of security, that wouldn’t shield someone who may have been tricked into connecting with a stranger, perhaps by tapping on a deceptively named device in a list of contacts or by thoughtlessly accepting an unsolicited connection request. This step is required for the sender to be identified, according to security experts.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000f356h07tp2rap@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Once the device-identifying information is exchanged and obtained by an unauthorized third party, the lack of salting would make it straightforward to guess at the correct codes that would unscramble the data, the experts said.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000g356hpfxu88t3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The Chinese tech firm, Wangshendongjian Technology, that claimed to have exploited AirDrop appeared to have used some of the same techniques first identified by the Darmstadt researchers in 2019, said Alexander Heinrich, one of the German researchers.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000h356hmps7z4i7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “As far as we know, Apple did not address the issue so far,” Heinrich told CNN.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000i356h32yzcot8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      Kenn White, an independent security researcher specializing in digital forensics, agreed that what Chinese authorities disclosed about their hack is consistent with what the German researchers found.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000j356huboivjy2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “On my read, I’d say this is almost certainly using the same techniques that Heinrich et al published,” White said. “Three plus years and this design flaw appears not to have been addressed.”

      On the heels of the Chinese claim, Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat and a vocal privacy advocate in Congress, blasted Apple over a “blatant failure” to protect its customers.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000m356hpeavjim1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “Apple has had four years to fix the security hole in AirDrop that put the privacy and safety of its users at risk,” Wyden said in a statement to CNN. “Apple sat on its hands and did nothing, rather than protect human rights activists who depend on iPhones to share messages the Chinese government doesn’t want people to see.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000n356htnzi127l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The tech firm behind the AirDrop exploit has a history of working closely with Chinese law enforcement and security authorities.

      Its parent company is the powerful Chinese cybersecurity firm Qi An Xin, according to corporate database Aiqicha. Qi An Xin was hired to protect the Beijing Winter Olympic Games in 2022 from cyberattacks, <a href="http://www.news.cn/2021-12/24/c_1128196797.htm" target="_blank">according to</a> the official Xinhua news agency.

      “Time and again, the Chinese government turns to the private sector to augment its technical capabilities,” Dakota Cary, a China-focused consultant at US cybersecurity firm SentinelOne, told CNN. “This is an important reminder of the offensive role that ostensibly defensive Chinese cybersecurity companies can play.”
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000q356hn1fp58b7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      It is rare, however, for a government actor such as China to publicly disclose its capabilities, suggesting that the intentional reveal this week speaks to some other motive.

      One reason Chinese officials may have wanted their exploit known, said Ismail, is that it could scare dissidents away from using AirDrop.

      And now that the Beijing authorities have announced it exploited the vulnerability, Apple may face retaliation from Chinese authorities if the tech firm tries to fix the issue, multiple experts said.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000u356hy0t85blu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      China is the largest foreign market for Apple’s products, with sales there representing about a fifth of the company’s total revenue in 2022. Most of its iPhones are produced in Chinese factories, and Apple could face blowback from Beijing if it moves to close off the loophole.
  </p>

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000v356hw9silfw0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      The revelation of the hack could also give China even more leverage to force Apple to cooperate with the country’s security or intelligence demands, said Ismail, because China can argue Apple is already complicit.

  <p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/clraszrj3000w356hv2bxoni8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true">
      “If Apple had fixed it when it was reported in 2019, it would’ve been a challenging technical problem,” said Matthew Green, a cryptography expert and professor at Johns Hopkins University. “Now that Chinese security agencies are exploiting this vulnerability, it’s a tough political problem for Apple.”

<p>Just a couple of hours drive east of Los Angeles lies the Imperial Valley, home to Palm Springs, some of the most productive agriculture on Earth, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Sea">Salton Sea</a>. Together with Los Angeles, this area uses over five million acre-feet (MAF) of water from the Colorado River every year, a river whose flow continues to trend downward due to the changing climate.</p>

<p>For many years, California’s approach to the problem has been to seek comfort from its senior water rights and its outsized power compared to neighboring states, while telling stories of managed decline and fallowing farms in both the Imperial and Central Valleys. Few remember the enormous public works projects that built the dams on the Lower Colorado a century ago and brought water hundreds of miles across the desert, making life possible for the tens of millions of people who now call it home. These projects were visionary and we stand here today because of their embodied will to fight back against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Manly">Holocene desertification</a>. </p>



<p>The advent of cheap solar gives us another powerful tool to fight against the desert and to bring life and water to huge swaths of the western US, starting with the Imperial Valley. In an earlier post I <a href="https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2022/11/20/we-need-more-water-than-rain-can-provide-refilling-rivers-with-desalination/">wrote more generally</a> about supporting rivers. Here, I will discuss the <a href="https://twitter.com/CJHandmer/status/1744247768573706451">outline of a specific project</a> that can transform Southern California and its relation to water, energy, and industry to be ready for another miracle century of growth and wealth creation.</p>

<p>Today, several canals bring water from the Lower Colorado into the US part of the Imperial Valley for irrigation. By treaty the last 1.5 MAF of the Colorado continues into Mexico, which also has vibrant agricultural activity in the Colorado delta area near Mexicali. The agricultural areas are, broadly speaking, low lying and frequently flooded. The modern Salton Sea formed in 1905 when an irrigation mishap diverted the Colorado into the sink, itself formed by crustal extension and rifting. Its previous incarnation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Cahuilla">Lake Cahuilla</a> dried up around 1700. </p>



<p>The Salton Sea’s level continues to drop due to evaporation, leading to increasing salinity (now too high to support any fish, causing several great die-offs in the early 2010s) and infrastructure challenges for communities that live around the lake, in addition to severe and widespread respiratory problems from dust from the exposed lake bed. In short, the Salton Sea is a blight, a festering environmental catastrophe and a source of enduring shame for California, a state that prides itself on environmental sensibility, wealth, and entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

<p>Well may it remain, since the cost of desalinating the lake by itself is prohibitive and there are no convenient sources of water in its catchment by which to regulate its level. </p>



<p>This has now changed. Solar photovoltaic panels are, acre for acre, 100 times more economically productive than farming. A relatively small desert area adjacent to fields, once developed for solar, can deliver enough insanely cheap electricity that it can transform the economy of the entire region. </p>



<p>In short, we need to build a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_osmosis#Desalination">reverse osmosis desalination</a> plant that backs up the natural flow of the Colorado. A solar powered environmental restoration machine that alleviates intense ecological pressures and guarantees water abundance for the southwest forever. </p>



<p>Unlike the previous century’s pioneering irrigation projects, this sort of development requires no new technology, merely the scaled application of existing processes and products at a level that would barely affect existing supply chains. </p>



<p>This is how it works. </p>

<p>A solar PV-powered RO desalination plant is built in the desert west of Yuma, convenient to existing irrigation canals and the Colorado river. It is fed by a large sea water pipeline that runs down the flood plain across the border to the Gulf of California, and also by a separate spur line that draws from the Salton Sea and runs parallel to the Coachella Canal. </p>



<p>RO desal splits the incoming ~3% salinity stream into two halves, one fresh and one ~6% salinity. This concentrated brine is fed to adjacent brine processing facilities (ideally in both countries) that exploit the region’s abundant solar and geothermal energy to extract potentially millions of tonnes of lithium, sodium, magnesium, chloride, and other metals found in sea water. The resulting depleted brine is piped back to the ocean where it is thoroughly mixed with sea water and discharged. </p>



<p>The fresh water is distributed into the region’s irrigation canals, enabling regulation of the Salton Sea’s level as well as its desalination, and the preservation of more of the Colorado’s flow into Mexico. The Coachella Canal passes within a mile of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_River_Aqueduct">Colorado River Aqueduct</a>, so this desalination system could potentially also feed fresh water into the Los Angeles municipal supply. </p>



<p>The project has multiple sources of revenue: water sales, brine products, and land value appreciation once the Salton Sea once again becomes compatible with human habitation. Indeed, were the lake level tamed and restored to support a diverse ecosystem, the excesses of agricultural exploitation remediated, I think it would become comparable to Lake Tahoe in aesthetics, but with a much stronger basis of industry due to abundant energy, water, and minerals. </p>

<p>This map shows the area of solar panels required to feed the RO and brine plants. It seems hard to believe that such a tiny corner of such a huge desert, so far from any roads that its existence would be unknown to all but a handful of airline passengers, could be capable of producing 5 MAF of fresh water per year – California’s entire Colorado River allocation! This is the power of solar energy! The adjacent agricultural areas grow plants that require water, planting, harvesting, fertilizers, pesticides, and the right kinds of weather, all to capture the sun’s energy in the form of digestible leaves, nuts, and fruits – at 0.01% the energy throughput efficiency of solar. </p>

<p>Let’s take a closer look at a block diagram showing how value accrues in the system.</p>

<p>The solar panels convert wasted sunlight into electricity, one of the most useful forms of energy, at the lowest cost ever in human history. The batteries make this power available at night, enabling 100% utilization of the higher capex systems downstream. The RO desal plant uses this power to strip salt out of fresh water, a remarkably efficient and high maturity technology already deployed to the tune of more than 30 MAF/year, primarily in the Middle East. At $1000/AF, this unit alone accrues $5b in annual revenue. </p>



<p>The brine plant is uniquely able to exploit higher concentrations of ocean ions, cheap heat and electricity, and California’s burgeoning demand for critical minerals. 5 MAF/year of 6% salinity brine contains more than 10 million tonnes of magnesium, comparable to current global production, not to mention other light metals. At spot prices around $5000/T, a mature brine extraction industry could net &gt;$50b/year, which can help to keep the water cheap and food plentiful. The brine plant can also recover agricultural chemicals from the Salton Sea, including nitrates and phosphates. While nitrates are plentiful thanks to the Haber Bosch process, phosphates are increasingly scarce.</p>



<p>Finally, the “waste” product is nothing more than concentrated sea water, something anyone can make in their kitchen and which turbulent mixing with the ocean can effectively dilute, nullifying impact at the intake and return. </p>



<p>Ten years ago, solar was too expensive to make this possible. That is no longer the case. The world deployed about 450 GW of solar in 2023, and for the first time energy cost no longer dominates the cost of desalinated water. In other words, we are now in the age of water abundance. </p>



<p>California should unabashedly exploit its mature industrial sector and visionary environmentalism to quell the growing water scarcity catastrophe, mend fences with Mexico, build local industry, bolster agricultural production, restore the Salton Sea, build new shining cities along its shores, and flaunt its unequaled excellence by exporting alfalfa to all corners of the globe. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p itemprop="abstract">
                        An autophage rocket engine that consumes its plastic fuselage for fuel has been built and fired by engineers at Glasgow University.
                    </p><div itemprop="articleBody">
                            <p>The autophage engine uses waste heat from combustion to sequentially melt its own plastic fuselage as it fires. It then feeds the molten plastic into the engine’s combustion chamber as additional fuel to burn alongside its regular liquid propellants.</p>
<div><p>The concept of a self-eating rocket engine was first proposed and patented in 1938. However, no autophage engine designs were fired in a controlled manner until a research partnership between Glasgow University and Dnipro National University, Ukraine achieved this milestone in 2018.</p><p>&nbsp;Now, with support from Kingston University, the Glasgow engineers have demonstrated that more energetic liquid propellants can be used, and that the plastic fuselage can withstand the forces required to feed it into the engine without buckling.</p></div>

<p>The team’s design developments are being showcased <a rel="noopener" href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2024-1604#:~:text=This%20paper%20discusses%20the%20design,fraction%20of%20the%20launch%20vehicle." target="_blank" data-anchor="#:~:text=This%20paper%20discusses%20the%20design,fraction%20of%20the%20launch%20vehicle.">as a paper</a> presented at the international <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech" target="_blank">AIAA SciTech Forum</a> in Orlando, Florida this week.</p>
<div><p>In the paper, the team describe how they test-fired their Ouroborous-3 autophage engine, producing 100 newtons of thrust in a series of controlled experiments. </p><p>&nbsp;The Ouroborous-3 uses high-density polyethylene plastic tubing as its autophagic fuel source, burning it alongside the rocket’s mix of gaseous oxygen and liquid propane.</p><p>&nbsp;The tests showed that the Ourobourous-3 is capable of stable burn throughout the autophage stage, with the plastic fuselage supplying up to one-fifth of the total propellant used.</p></div>



<p>The tests also showed that the rocket’s burn could be controlled, with the team demonstrating its ability to be throttled, restarted and pulsed in an on/off pattern.</p>
<div><p>In a statement, project lead Professor Patrick Harkness from Glasgow University’s James Watt School of Engineering said: “These results are a foundational step on the way to developing a fully-functional autophage rocket engine. Those future rockets could have a wide range of applications which would help advance the UK’s ambitions to develop as a key player in the space industry.</p><p>&nbsp;“A conventional rocket’s structure makes up between five and 12 per cent of its total mass. Our tests show that the Ouroborous-3 can burn a very similar amount of its own structural mass as propellant. If we could make at least some of that mass available for payload instead, it would be a compelling prospect for future rocket designs.”</p></div>
<p>Development of the team’s autophage engine will continue with the support of new funding from the UK Space Agency and the Sciences and Technology Facilities Council.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If your company is using Carta's platform to manage employee stock options, there's a blind spot in the 83(b) election feature you need to know about if you're married and living in a community property state like California.</p>
<p>Here's the deal: Many startups offer early exercise of stock options, which can provide a big tax advantage to employees. Early exercise turns stock options into restricted stock, which normally requires an 83(b) election by the employee to avoid possible painful tax consequences as your stock vests.</p>
<p>Carta conveniently allows you to make the 83(b) election when you early exercise. However, the platform misses one IRS mandate: if you're married in states like California, Texas, or Washington, your spouse must also sign the 83(b) form. Miss this, and you might face some serious tax headaches down the road, as the IRS could invalidate your election.</p>
<p>Carta does not provide a way to have your spouse sign the 83(b) form that they file on your behalf. They also don't conspicuously warn you about this requirement nor that their platform is non-compliant with it. <em>Startups can't even disable the 83(b) feature to prevent the risk that a married employee uses the feature.</em> It seems like a major oversight, especially since Carta is the most popular platform for managing startup stock options.</p>
<p>So, what should you do if you're in this boat? <em>Manually file your 83(b)</em>. Don't use Carta to do it. Instead, download the form from the IRS website, fill it out, and mail it to the IRS within the strict 30-day deadline. You'll need to get a signature from your spouse, too.</p>
<p>If you're in a community property state, this rule could apply to you. Check with your lawyer. Until Carta resolves this, it's up to the companies and their employees to navigate this.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
						<p><span size="1"><i>[This is a slightly edited repost of an essay from my old LiveJournal]</i></span></p>
<p>A friend recently complained about how many people lack the basic skill of believing arguments. That is, if you have a valid argument for something, then you should accept the conclusion. Even if the conclusion is unpopular, or inconvenient, or you don’t like it. He envisioned an art of rationality that would make people believe something <i>after it had been proven to them</i>.</p>
<p>And I nodded my head, because it sounded reasonable enough, and it wasn’t until a few hours later that I thought about it again and went “Wait, no, that would be a terrible idea.”</p>
<p>I don’t think I’m overselling myself too much to expect that I could argue circles around the average uneducated person. Like I mean that on most topics, I could demolish their position and make them look like an idiot. Reduce them to some form of “Look, everything you say fits together and I can’t explain why you’re wrong, I just know you are!” Or, more plausibly, “Shut up I don’t want to talk about this!”</p>
<p>And there are people who can argue circles around me. Maybe not on <i>every</i> topic, but on topics where they are experts and have spent their whole lives honing their arguments. When I was young I used to read pseudohistory books; Immanuel Velikovsky’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ages_in_Chaos">Ages in Chaos</a> is a good example of the best this genre has to offer. I read it and it seemed so obviously correct, so perfect, that I could barely bring myself to bother to search out rebuttals.</p>
<p>And then I read the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct, so devastating, that I couldn’t believe I had ever been so dumb as to believe Velikovsky.</p>
<p>And then I read the rebuttals to the rebuttals, and they were so obviously correct that I felt silly for ever doubting.</p>
<p>And so on for several more iterations, until the labyrinth of doubt seemed inescapable. What finally broke me out wasn’t so much the lucidity of the consensus view so much as starting to sample different crackpots. Some were almost as bright and rhetorically gifted as Velikovsky, all presented insurmountable evidence for their theories, and all had mutually exclusive ideas. After all, Noah’s Flood couldn’t have been a cultural memory both of the fall of Atlantis <i>and</i> of a change in the Earth’s orbit, let alone of a lost Ice Age civilization or of megatsunamis from a meteor strike. So given that at least some of those arguments are wrong and all seemed practically proven, I am obviously just gullible in the field of ancient history. Given a total lack of independent intellectual steering power and no desire to spend thirty years building an independent knowledge base of Near Eastern history, I choose to just accept the ideas of the prestigious people with professorships in Archaeology, rather than those of the universally reviled crackpots who write books about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision">Venus being a comet</a>.</p>
<p>You could consider this a form of epistemic learned helplessness, where I know any attempt to evaluate the arguments is just going to be a bad idea so I don’t even try. If you have a good argument that the Early Bronze Age worked completely differently from the way mainstream historians believe, I just don’t want to hear about it. If you insist on telling me anyway, I will nod, say that your argument makes complete sense, and then totally refuse to change my mind or admit even the slightest possibility that you might be right.</p>
<p>(This is the correct Bayesian action: if I know that a false argument sounds just as convincing as a true argument, argument convincingness provides no evidence either way. I should ignore it and stick with my prior.)</p>
<p>I consider myself lucky in that my epistemic learned helplessness is circumscribed; there are still cases where I’ll trust the evidence of my own reason. In fact, I trust it in most cases other than infamously deceptive arguments in fields I know little about. But I think the average uneducated person doesn’t and shouldn’t. Anyone anywhere – politicians, scammy businessmen, smooth-talking romantic partners – would be able to argue them into anything. And so they take the obvious and correct defensive maneuver – they will never let anyone convince them of any belief that sounds “weird”.</p>
<p>(and remember that, if you grow up in the right circles, beliefs along the lines of “astrology doesn’t work” sound “weird”.)</p>
<p>This is starting to resemble ideas like compartmentalization and <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/">taking ideas seriously</a>. The only difference between their presentation and mine is that I’m saying that for 99% of people, 99% of the time, taking ideas seriously is the wrong strategy. Or, at the very least, it should be the last skill you learn, after you’ve learned every other skill that allows you to know which ideas are or are not correct.</p>
<p>The people I know who are best at taking ideas seriously are those who are smartest and most rational. I think people are working off a model where these co-occur because you need to be very clever to resist your natural and detrimental tendency not to take ideas seriously. But I think they might instead co-occur because you have to be really smart in order for taking ideas seriously not to be immediately disastrous. You have to be really smart not to have been talked into enough terrible arguments to develop epistemic learned helplessness.</p>
<p>Even the smartest people I know have a commendable tendency not to take certain ideas seriously. Bostrom’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_argument#Origins">simulation argument</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument">anthropic doomsday argument</a>, <a href="http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging">Pascal’s Mugging</a> – I’ve never heard anyone give a coherent argument against any of these, but I’ve also never met anyone who fully accepts them and lives life according to their implications.</p>
<p>A friend tells me of a guy who once accepted fundamentalist religion because of Pascal’s Wager. I will provisionally admit that this person “takes ideas seriously”. Everyone else gets partial credit, at best.</p>
<p>Which isn’t to say that some people don’t do better than others. Terrorists seem pretty good in this respect. People used to talk about how terrorists must be very poor and uneducated to fall for militant Islam, and then someone did a study and found that they were disproportionately well-off, college educated people (many were engineers). I’ve heard a few good arguments in this direction before, things like how engineering trains you to have a very black-and-white right-or-wrong view of the world based on a few simple formulae, and this meshes with fundamentalism better than it meshes with subtle liberal religious messages.</p>
<p>But to these I’d add that a sufficiently smart engineer has never been burned by arguments above his skill level before, has never had any reason to develop epistemic learned helplessness. If Osama comes up to him with a really good argument for terrorism, he thinks “Oh, there’s a good argument for terrorism. I guess I should become a terrorist,” as opposed to “Arguments? You can prove anything with arguments. I’ll just stay right here and not blow myself up.”</p>
<p>Responsible doctors are at the other end of the spectrum from terrorists here. I once heard someone rail against how doctors totally ignored all the latest and most exciting medical studies. The same person, practically in the same breath, then railed against how <a href="http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">50% to 90% of medical studies are wrong</a>. These two observations are not unrelated. Not only are there so many terrible studies, but pseudomedicine (not the stupid homeopathy type, but <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/05/23/should-psychiatry-test-for-lead-more/">the type that</a> links everything to some obscure chemical on an out-of-the-way metabolic pathway) has, for me, proven much like pseudohistory – unless I am an expert in that particular subsubfield of medicine, it can sound very convincing even when it’s very wrong.</p>
<p>The medical establishment offers a shiny tempting solution. First, a total unwillingness to trust anything, no matter how plausible it sounds, until it’s gone through an endless cycle of studies and meta-analyses. Second, a bunch of Institutes and Collaborations dedicated to filtering through all these studies and analyses and telling you what lessons you should draw from them.</p>
<p>I’m glad that some people never develop epistemic learned helplessness, or develop only a limited amount of it, or only in certain domains. It seems to me that although these people are more likely to become terrorists or Velikovskians or homeopaths, they’re also the only people who can figure out if something basic and unquestionable is wrong, and make this possibility well-known enough that normal people start becoming willing to consider it.</p>
<p>But I’m also glad epistemic learned helplessness exists. It seems like a pretty useful social safety valve most of the time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://filiph.net/text/we-need-technology-that-is-less-immersive,-not-more.html">https://filiph.net/text/we-need-technology-that-is-less-immersive,-not-more.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38968550">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

      

      <p>I love this quote from Ray Bradbury about Edgar Rice Borroughs, the author of Tarzan and John Carter stories:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out – and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly – <span>Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.</span> By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The boys who read Borroughs’ <em>A Princess of Mars</em> would grow up to be NASA engineers. Or, at the very least, they'd grow up to be in support of real-world exploration and science. It’s not that Borroughs’ books were particularly scientific. Far from it. But they <em>were</em> exciting and inspiring.</p>
<p><img src="https://filiph.net/text/imgs/borroughs-crater-on-mars.jpg"></p><!--Carl Sagan, the astronomer, said: "Science fiction has led me to science."-->
<p>I don’t think that the past few generations have anything that quite reaches the influence of these stories. I grew up in the 1990’s, and while I romanticized space flight and advanced science as much as anyone else, my eyes went the widest from video games. Watching Star Trek, or a documentary about an oceanographer was cool, but you know what was cooler? Running around in a virtual environment where I could be a bad ass gun slinger or space marine or whatever, and have my own adventures, on my own terms.</p>
<p>Being able to immerse myself into a world that <em>exists to entertain me</em> was — surprise surprise! — preferable to doing almost anything else.</p>
<p>I don’t think we talk about this aspect of our era enough. And I believe lots of us have an emotional desire to minimize the negative impact of immersive videogames because <em>it’s our childhood.</em> But in this article, I'd like to posit that having such a different driving force nudges the progress of the whole human race in a direction that we wouldn’t have necessarily chosen if we were to make a rational choice.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-talent-to-the-wrong-problems">Allocating talent to the wrong problems</h2>
<p>Here’s another quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most talented artists of our time don’t do any art — they work in advertising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Unfortunately, I can’t find who said it, which means I’m probably remembering the wording wrong. Consider it a paraphrase.)</p>
<p>Now, I’m not going to delve too deep into the particular topic of art and advertising. I do think there’s truth to it, and that maybe some of these people who are currently gainfully employed making ad jingles could be doing something ultimately more important for society — but I mention this quote here for another reason. It’s an example of outside forces nudging people to work on something that is not really that important in the grand scheme of things.</p>
<p>Here’s my variant of the quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many of the most talented engineers of our time don’t do anything important — instead, they work on making our entertainment more immersive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They work on better 3D renderers, more appealing shaders, faster VR hardware, better spatial sound, more powerful game engines, more immersive games, more colorful phone screens, more eye-catching app animations, etc.</p>
<p>Here’s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>They grew up playing immersive 3D video games, and romanticizing that whole industry.</li>
<li>It pays.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t care how much you’re invested in the VR ecosystem or whatever — I hope you’ll agree that humanity has a variety of important engineering problems to solve, and <em>nicer-looking graphics is quite low on that list.</em> I know there are real-world use cases for better, more immersive rendering or bigger phone screens — but their utility pales in comparison to actual real-world research of actual real-world phenomena, does it not?</p>
<p><img src="https://filiph.net/text/imgs/are-virtual-reality-games-safe-for-kids.jpg"></p><p>The gaming industry has hijacked human play. Instead of an evolutionary learning and relaxation tool, it’s so immersive now that people get sucked into spending hundreds of hours playing games that don’t teach them anything valuable about the real world, and don’t relax them at all. I’m a gamer, and I of course <em>enjoy</em> immersing myself in a good AAA video game, but I had to admit to myself at one point that, long-term, playing video games for any extended period makes me physically miserable and dumber.</p>
<h2 id="going-less-immersive">Going less immersive</h2>
<p>I realize this probably reads as a rant. Please don’t take this as an attack. Instead, I would like for this article to be <em>inspiring</em>. There are so many amazing engineering problems out there. Many of them are more important than what you’re probably working on right now, and yet there are fewer people focusing on them, so there’s less competition, and more opportunity to actually “change the world.”</p>
<p>Focusing on such problems probably pays less, but if you’re reading this, chances are you’re not a starving artist. You’re in the tech industry. Even taking a major hit to your salary will still land you way above average. You’ll live. Take it from a guy who left a nice engineering position at Google in Silicon Valley to work as a solo developer in the Czech Republic.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re like me, and you've already invested much of your career into graphics and UI programming. Maybe you (like me!) just can’t let go of your childhood dream to make videogame-like experiences. Well, there are still options. You can make apps and videogames that don’t immerse. My first (and quite successful!) “videogame” <a href="https://egamebook.com/knights/">looks like the Kindle app</a>. My second one <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2538440/GIANT_ROBOT_GAME/">looks like a CAD program</a>. There are new opportunities in things like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23954584/e-ink-color-tablets-ereader">e-Ink</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24029590/lg-oled-t-transparent-tv-announced-specs-features">transparent screens</a> or <a href="https://techbullion.com/what-to-expect-in-2024-a-deep-dive-into-the-internet-of-things/">IoT</a> that can help people re-focus on the real world around them yet still reap the benefits of technology.</p>
<p>My point is that you have a choice. You can still, of course, choose to push on making our technology as immersive as possible. If you develop your career on autopilot, you will probably end up doing that. But you don’t have to, and maybe you shouldn’t.</p>

         }" data-reading-time="true"><p data-block-key="ipye0">Since we introduced Google Assistant seven years ago, it’s been incredible to see how voice technology has transformed the way we get things done at home and work. Today, Assistant helps hundreds of millions of people around the world cross off their to-do lists.</p><p data-block-key="1p8qk">Over the years, we’ve made it even easier to accomplish your tasks with Assistant — thanks, in large part, to your feedback. And in order to keep improving your experience and build the best Assistant yet, we’re making a few changes to focus on quality and reliability — ultimately making it easier to use Assistant across devices.</p><p data-block-key="7l8bk">First, as we continue to make Google Assistant more helpful, we're prioritizing the experiences you love and investing in the underlying technology to make them even better — which means that some underutilized features will no longer be supported. You can find <a href="http://support.google.com/assistant/?p=assistant_is_changing" rt-link-type="external">a list</a> of these features, including suggestions of what you can use in place of them (where alternatives are available). Beginning on January 26, when you ask for one of these features, you may get a notification that it won’t be available after a certain date.</p><p data-block-key="jj1e">We’re also bringing you a more consistent experience within the Google app: The microphone icon will now trigger Search results in response to your queries, which is its most popular use case. You can continue to activate Assistant as you always have: Just say “Hey Google” or long press on the home or power button (on select phones) on <a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7172657" rt-link-type="external">Android</a>, or open the Google Assistant app on <a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7172657?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;oco=0" rt-link-type="external">iOS</a>. But you’ll no longer be able to use the <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch?p=mic_update" rt-link-type="external">microphone icon</a> in the Search bar to complete actions like “turn on the lights” or “send a message.” This includes the microphone in the Pixel Search bar, which will now activate Voice Search instead of Assistant. And to ensure you have access to the best, most up-to-date version of Google Assistant, you’ll be prompted to upgrade the Google app if you’re using an older version (v12 and older).</p><p data-block-key="354mo">We know change can be disruptive, but we’ll do everything we can to make these transitions as smooth as possible. While Google Assistant has evolved a lot over the last seven years, one thing remains true: Our improvements are driven by your feedback. And we want to hear it. Just say, “Hey Google, send feedback” and share your comments with us.</p></div>

We have made representations to the director of BBC News and Current Affairs," Mr Davies told colleagues.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Post Office cover-up was holding, but Alan Bates - the hero of the ITV drama - had another card to play.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>Alan Bates - played by Toby Jones in the ITV drama - introduced Panorama to the whistleblower</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At a meeting in a garden centre tea room in Shrewsbury, he told Nick Wallis he had been contacted by a whistleblower from Fujitsu - who knew the truth about Horizon and remote access.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That man was Richard Roll, who had worked for Fujitsu on the Post Office's Horizon computer system in the early 2000s.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Bates wanted Panorama to take on the story, so Nick introduced the whistleblower to the programme team.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>For the 2015 programme, he told Panorama reporter John Sweeney on camera how a team of Fujitsu staff had remote access to branch accounts and could make changes to them without the sub-postmasters' knowledge.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>It was explosive testimony that could call into question the convictions of more than 700 sub-postmasters prosecuted on the basis of Horizon evidence, as the denial of the possibility of remote access underpinned the Post Office's legal position.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Post Office was going to fight hard to stop the story from coming out - its misinformation campaign ramped up a gear.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Enormous-regret"><span role="text">'Enormous regret'</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>Panorama journalists Matt Bardo and Tim Robinson were invited to Post Office HQ for an on-the-record briefing about the Horizon system. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Network manager Angela van den Bogerd joined PR boss Mark Davies and another senior manager, Patrick Bourke. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ms van den Bogerd insisted nobody could change the sub-postmasters' accounts without their knowledge.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>She said any alterations "would leave a footprint. And that's the important bit."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Matt Bardo asked: "So in sum, it is not now and never has been possible for anybody from Post Office or Fujitsu to interfere with transactions, without the clear knowledge of the sub-postmaster?"</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Mr Bourke said: "It is 100% true to say we can't change, alter, modify, existing transaction data, so the integrity is 100% preserved."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"And that's true now and has been for the duration of the system?" Mr Bardo asked. "Yeah," said Ms van den Bogerd.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>That wasn't true. Not then, and not for the duration of the system.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Since then, the Post Office has been forced to accept that Fujitsu staff could access and change accounts without the sub-postmasters' knowledge.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>One of the Post Office's lawyers suggested in 2019 that Angela van den Bogerd and her colleagues had denied remote access was possible because they did not know at the time. He told the High Court: "It is a matter of enormous regret that the senior managers who dealt with Panorama were not aware that remote access to Horizon was possible."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>But documents Panorama obtained for a follow-up programme in 2020 show the Post Office had known it was possible for years.</p></div><div data-component="image-block"><figure><figcaption><span>Image caption, </span><p>The Horizon computer system was intended to track transactions in Post Offices, but sub-postmasters complained of mysterious shortfalls</p></figcaption></figure></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>A report by consultants Ernst and Young sent to Post Office directors in 2011 warned that Fujitsu staff had "unrestricted access" to sub-postmasters' accounts, that "may lead to the processing of unauthorised or erroneous transactions".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The misleading on-the-record briefing was just the first step in the Post Office's onslaught to frustrate the 2015 Panorama investigation.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>When it learned the names of experts Panorama was interviewing, lawyers and senior managers sent them intimidating letters.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>Ian Henderson, from the independent forensic accountants Second Sight, had uncovered other evidence of miscarriages of justice at the Post Office. He was warned he did not have the legal expertise to comment on prosecutions and the Post Office threatened to sue him. </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>"If your statements go as far as to harm Post Office's reputation then we may have to take even more serious action in order to protect our brand," he was told. "For the avoidance of doubt, Post Office does not condone you speaking to Panorama and all our legal rights are fully reserved."</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>To protect the whistleblower from similar correspondence, the Panorama team did not tell the Post Office Richard Roll's name. Instead, the journalists said they had spoken to a Fujitsu insider, and outlined the allegations he was making.</p></div><p data-component="subheadline-block"><h2 tabindex="-1" id="Smears-and-false-claims"><span role="text">Smears and false claims</span></h2></p><div data-component="text-block"><p>From the Post Office's response, it was clear that the whistleblower's evidence which would be featured in the film was of particular concern.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>PR boss Mark Davies fired off complaints to ever more senior managers at the BBC, and expensive external lawyers were hired with public money to send letters threatening to sue Panorama.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The programme team received hundreds of pages of correspondence and reports from the Post Office and their lawyers - but none of the paperwork admitted remote access was possible.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>At the time, Mr Davies told Panorama "there is overwhelming evidence that the losses complained of were caused by user actions, including deliberate dishonest conduct".</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>The Post Office's lobbying did secure them a further meeting, this time an off-the-record briefing with the programme's then-editor. Such meetings are viewed with suspicion by many investigative journalists as they can be used as a tactic to hamper inquiries and publication.  </p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>So it proved in this case. The Post Office took the opportunity to smear some of the sub-postmasters Panorama was planning to feature in its programme, hinting at potential motives to steal from the tills.</p></div><div data-component="text-block"><p>In one case, it falsely claimed it had documents showing a postmaster was guilty of theft.

<p>Command line interface (CLI) tools have a reputation for being difficult
to use.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1168"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/tar.png" alt="XKCD 1168: tar"></a></p>
<p>Whilst powerful once mastered, a CLI inherently lacks a litany of user
interface “nice-to-haves”, simply by virtue of its medium:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Common tasks should be easy to perform. This is often
not the case, but worse is when tasks can be tweaked in myriad ways,
leading to a combinatorial explosion of flags, options and modifiers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memorability:</strong> How does one remember all those different options?
It’s not realistic, which is why we so often resort to double-checking
the usage text, <code>man</code> pages, or search engine/generative AI du jour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discoverability:</strong> Reminding ourselves how to perform what we know
(or assume) can be done isn’t the same as guiding us towards the full
gamut of what’s possible. Even when reading the entire reference
manual (or source code), this isn’t a sure thing: useful emergent
behaviour often goes undocumented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Familiarity:</strong> So we effectively resort to guessing. <code>--help</code> <em>must</em>
give us the usage text, right? There are common idioms that are
pervasive, but even this is not a guarantee.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Open, meaningful communication is generally a good idea
in all walks of life. How often have you run a CLI command to be
presented with zero output, relying on <code>echo $?</code> to see if it even
succeeded? Or, at the other extreme, so much logging noise flooding
your terminal that you can’t tell what’s going on?</li>
</ul>
<p><code>tar</code>, lampooned in the above XKCD, is — at nearly 45-years-old — a
product of its age. The current GNU (and, to a lesser extent, BSD) <code>tar</code>
implementations go some way to improve things, but old habits die hard
and it’s still very common to see <code>tar chzPf</code>-and-friends in the wild.
Regardless, more modern tools also suffer from similar problems; anyone
who has used Git, or <em>shudder</em> GnuPG will attest to this.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://topiary.tweag.io/">Topiary</a> — Tweag’s code formatting engine — matures, I took the
opportunity to modernise its CLI before suboptimal patterns become
entrenched.</p>
<h2 id="sowing-the-seeds-of-change"><a href="#sowing-the-seeds-of-change" aria-label="sowing the seeds of change permalink"></a>Sowing the seeds of change</h2>
<p>In its early development, Topiary’s CLI was largely motivated by need.
When features were added, they were often exposed as command line
arguments, with little thought about the overall experience.</p>
<p>This is what it had organically grown into:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>CLI app for Topiary, the universal code formatter.

Usage: topiary [OPTIONS] &lt;--language &lt;LANGUAGE&gt;|--input-files [&lt;INPUT_FILES&gt;...]&gt;

Options:
  -l, --language &lt;LANGUAGE&gt;
          Which language to parse and format [possible values: json,
          nickel, ocaml, ocaml-interface, ocamllex, toml]
  -f, --input-files [&lt;INPUT_FILES&gt;...]
          Path to an input file or multiple input files. If omitted, or
          equal to "-", read from standard input. If multiple files are
          provided, `in_place` is assumed [default: -]
  -q, --query &lt;QUERY&gt;
          Which query file to use
  -o, --output-file &lt;OUTPUT_FILE&gt;
          Path to an output file. If omitted, or equal to "-", write to
          standard output
  -i, --in-place
          Format the input files in place
  -v, --visualise[=&lt;OUTPUT_FORMAT&gt;]
          Visualise the syntax tree, rather than format [possible
          values: json, dot]
  -s, --skip-idempotence
          Do not check that formatting twice gives the same output
      --output-configuration
          Output the full configuration to stderr before continuing
  -t, --tolerate-parsing-errors
          Format as much as possible even if some of the input causes
          parsing errors
      --configuration-override &lt;CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDE&gt;
          Override all configuration with the provided file [env:
          TOPIARY_CONFIGURATION_OVERRIDE=]
  -c, --configuration-file &lt;CONFIGURATION_FILE&gt;
          Add the specified configuration file with the highest priority
          [env: TOPIARY_CONFIGURATION_FILE=]
  -h, --help
          Print help
  -V, --version
          Print version</code></pre></div>
<p>Syntax tree visualisation is a good example: This was toggled with the
<code>--visualise</code> argument, which took an optional parameter to switch the
output format between GraphViz DOT and JSON. Visualisation was designed
as a different mode of operation, to aid the development of formatting
queries, but being expressed as an argument could imply to users that
formatting should still happen. This implication is reinforced by the
presence of formatting-specific arguments, such as <code>--skip-idempotence</code>
and <code>--tolerate-parsing-errors</code>; run together with <code>--visualise</code> is
meaningless, but it worked regardless.</p>
<p>At a more fundamental level, there’s the question of I/O: From where is
input read, and to where is it written? The input to a formatting tool
is kind of important, to say the least, and if Topiary is to do anything
besides cooking silicon wafers, it’s probably a good idea to do
something with its result. Yet an awkward dance of <code>--input-file</code>,
<code>--output-file</code> and <code>--in-place</code> was imposed. Those <em>may</em> seem
self-explanatory — and they were, in the beginning — but things
change:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When support for formatting multiple inputs was added, <code>--input-file</code>
became <code>--input-files</code>. However, what happens if I try to visualise
multiple inputs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do multiple inputs map to outputs? The usage text says that
<code>--in-place</code> is assumed in this case, but what if I also specify an
<code>--output-file</code>?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if I want to work with standard input or standard output? What
about read-only files? Is <code>--in-place</code> permitted in these cases?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do I even have to specify <code>--input-files</code> (or its short form,
<code>-f</code>)? Of course I’m going to be providing an input of some kind, so
it’s a bit redundant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While some of these questions were answered by the usage text, to really
know the behaviour of edge cases, you’d have to experiment or start
reading the source code.</p>
<p>Then there are the little things. Like when providing custom
configuration, how do <code>--configuration-file</code> and
<code>--configuration-override</code> interact? (I actually did have to read the
source code to figure that one out!) What about logging output,
presuming there is any; how does one access that?</p>
<p>Death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong: Topiary’s CLI was certainly functional in this
state. However, it leant too heavily on assumptions and the Topiary
team’s collective (but inscrutable) knowledge. This made it clumsy,
sometimes surprising and, overall, imposed too much friction on new
users.</p>
<h2 id="mighty-oaks-from-little-acorns-grow"><a href="#mighty-oaks-from-little-acorns-grow" aria-label="mighty oaks from little acorns grow permalink"></a>Mighty oaks from little acorns grow</h2>
<p>So I decided to fully rework the CLI. My mandate was clear:</p>
<h3 id="make-illegal-states-unrepresentable"><a href="#make-illegal-states-unrepresentable" aria-label="make illegal states unrepresentable permalink"></a>Make illegal states unrepresentable</h3>
<p>This is a classic idiom from strongly typed functional programming,
where the type system is leveraged to forbid invalid input. The same
logic applies to command line arguments and, as Topiary is written in
Rust, I was able to achieve this using the same mechanism.</p>
<p>Topiary uses the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap">clap</a> command line argument parser library,
which has a feature to derive the parser directly from your types and
their annotations (such as doc comments). This makes the definition of
the CLI arguments purely declarative, leaving you with only the work of
setting up your types correctly. All my other CLI modernisation work
stems from here.</p>
<p>To give some examples of what’s now unrepresentable (i.e., will fail):</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to visualise multiple files;</li>
<li>Specifying a formatting language when formatting files (which instead
use inference on the filename, driven by the configuration) or, vice
versa, specifying an input file when formatting standard input;</li>
<li>Specifying a formatting query file without a formatting language when
formatting standard input.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="separate-modes-of-operation"><a href="#separate-modes-of-operation" aria-label="separate modes of operation permalink"></a>Separate modes of operation</h3>
<p>Formatting and visualisation are two distinct modes of operation; they
do different things and take different options. Visualisation with
<code>--in-place</code> wouldn’t only be wrong, it would be catastrophic! The
former CLI also had an additional “pseudo-mode” of outputting the raw
configuration to standard error, for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned way of separating modes in non-interactive CLI tools
was to have multiple binaries. This tends to both pollute the global
command namespace (ImageMagick’s <code>convert</code>, anyone?) and can be hindered
by a lack of consistency amongst related tools.</p>
<p>The new hotness — and by “new”, I mean “for the last decade, or two”
— is to use subcommands to mark this separation. So that’s what I did:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>topiary format</code> formats your code.</li>
<li><code>topiary visualise</code> visualises your code.</li>
<li><code>topiary config</code> outputs the computed configuration, as TOML.
(Formatted, of course!)</li>
<li><code>topiary completion</code> is a new feature, which generates shell
completion scripts to aid discoverability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All have common options and each have specific options, facilitated by
the types I defined. If a new mode is developed in the future, it can
just be added without breaking backwards compatibility.</p>
<h3 id="make-use-of-familiar-idioms"><a href="#make-use-of-familiar-idioms" aria-label="make use of familiar idioms permalink"></a>Make use of familiar idioms</h3>
<p>Interaction with a CLI tool, that misses out on the visual cues and
metaphors that a GUI can provide, should be like a dialogue. (Preferably
a productive and friendly one, rather than one that ends up with you
questioning your life choices.) To that end, a de facto lexicon exists
amongst CLI tools with common behaviours that should be adhered to. It
would be weird, for example, if <code>--assist</code> was the option to show the
usage text, rather than <code>--help</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few things I’ve done in the new Topiary CLI to improve its
conversation skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While <code>--input-file</code> and the likes are not unheard of, it’s far more
common, when input is required, to use positional <code>FILE</code> arguments.
This also plays nicely with, say, scripts that one may wish to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The point of a formatter is to format its input, it therefore stands
to reason that <code>--in-place</code> is implied when dealing with files. (A
notable exception to this is <code>sed</code>, but as a “stream editor” first,
it has a little more right to an <code>--in-place</code> option, which is not
its default.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ability to format standard input is still important, though. In
which case, rather than using the <code>-</code> file convention, files are
simply omitted. This allows Topiary to be put into a script pipeline
and enables this common interaction:</p>
<div data-language="console"><pre><code>$ topiary format --language json   ⟵ Invocation
{"type":"your code here"}          ⟵ Standard input
&lt;Ctrl+D&gt;                           ⟵ EOF
{ "type": "your code here" }       ⟵ Formatted standard output</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging information has always existed in Topiary, but you wouldn’t
know unless you read the <code>README</code> fairly thoroughly. It used to be
exposed through the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable, which is an
artefact of the <code>env_logger</code> library. This has been changed to a
<code>--verbose</code> flag, following the common idiom of “more occurrences
means more output” (e.g., <code>-vvv</code> maps to <code>debug</code> logging).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="make-common-tasks-easy-and-unsurprising"><a href="#make-common-tasks-easy-and-unsurprising" aria-label="make common tasks easy and unsurprising permalink"></a>Make common tasks easy and unsurprising</h3>
<p>Topiary exposes a number of options. These knobs allow you to change its
behaviour in various ways and, while they shouldn’t be hidden away, they
shouldn’t obstruct the “happy path”. This echoes the design principles
that were laid out for Topiary’s formatting styles: uniform and “good
enough”. The same can be said for the CLI: Simplicity, over steampunk.</p>
<p>Some examples I’ve implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Formatting all your project’s files is just a matter of running
<code>topiary format PROJECT_DIR</code>. Topiary will recursively walk the
directory (no longer having to rely on shell expansion) and format
every file it understands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visualisation defaults to GraphViz DOT output, rather than JSON. A PDF
of the syntax tree can now be created with the very natural:</p>
<div data-language="sh"><pre><code>topiary visualise /path/to/my.file <span>\</span>
<span>|</span> dot <span>-Tpdf</span> <span>\</span>
<span>&gt;</span> syntax-tree.pdf</code></pre></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topiary’s configuration is sourced from a priority list and then
collated in one of three ways. This affords a high degree of
customisation, but can make it difficult to introspect the runtime
configuration. However, <code>topiary config</code> will not only output the
computed configuration — which can then be reused, for
reproducibility’s sake — but Topiary will also annotate it in a way
that lets you understand where it came from:</p>
<div data-language="toml"><pre><code><span># Configuration collated from the following sources,</span>
<span># in priority order (lowest to highest):</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># 1. Built-in configuration</span>
<span># 2. /home/user/.config/topiary/languages.toml</span>
<span># 3. /home/user/my-project/.topiary/languages.toml</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Collation mode: Merge</span>

<span>[</span><span>[</span><span>language</span><span>]</span><span>]</span>
<span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>"json"</span>
<span>extensions</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>"json"</span><span>,</span>
<span>]</span>

<span># etc.</span></code></pre></div>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dont-paint-yourself-into-a-corner"><a href="#dont-paint-yourself-into-a-corner" aria-label="dont paint yourself into a corner permalink"></a>Don’t paint yourself into a corner</h3>
<p>You may be thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If Topiary is primarily a formatter, why can’t I just skip the
<code>format</code> subcommand and have the CLI assume that as the default?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s a good question and one which I asked myself. The most common task
for the Topiary CLI will be formatting, so by my earlier admission of
“making common tasks easy”, surely this optimisation would be
beneficial?</p>
<p>The answer to this has two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><del>Firstly, clap doesn’t make this easy to do, when using its
derivation feature. Subcommands can certainly be optional, but to
force the parser into a “default path or subcommand path” state
machine, while maintaining coherent usage text, significantly goes
against its grain.</del></p>
<p>Shortly after publishing this article, Ed Page — the principal
contributor of clap — reached out to let me know that clap can
actually do this, and quite straightforwardly. As to my second point,
below, while generally true, he also suggested an interesting
<a href="https://github.com/tweag/topiary/issues/641">compromise</a>, which the Topiary team will work on
implementing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More importantly, however, is that if Topiary commits to providing a
stable interface — which it certainly does — then other subcommands
(current and future) are effectively blocked by virtue of the
positional and arbitrary file inputs. What happens, for example, if
you want to format a file called <code>config</code>?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This second point is crucial. Not only does it have the effect of
prohibiting legitimate subcommands, but users will come to rely on this
shorthand which fossilises the interface with suboptimal behaviour.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/1172"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png" alt="XKCD 1172: Workflow"></a></p>
<p>For the same reason, I don’t allow subcommand or long option inference
(that is, expanding partial CLI arguments when there are no
ambiguities). There are, however, a handful of subcommand aliases which
are helpful to make common tasks quicker to type (e.g., <code>fmt</code> for
<code>format</code>), or when alternative spellings are common.</p>
<h2 id="see-the-forest-for-the-trees"><a href="#see-the-forest-for-the-trees" aria-label="see the forest for the trees permalink"></a>See the forest for the trees</h2>
<p>The full usage text for what I ended up with is too long to paste into
this article, but it can of course be <a href="https://github.com/tweag/topiary#usage">found in Topiary’s
documentation</a>. Besides, maybe a little demo would be
more illustrative. Here’s how it looks with completion in <code>zsh</code> (i.e.,
don’t blame Topiary for the clipping):</p>

<p>The path trod to arrive at this destination was not random. It was
informed by my own experience with CLI tools, guided by the direction
in which clap steers you. Further polish was added on the advice of the
<a href="https://clig.dev/">Command Line Interface Guidelines</a> book. That said, UX research
is a legitimate discipline — involving testing and analytics on, you
know, <em>users</em> — which is usually the purview of GUIs. I’m not aware of
any UX research done in the realm of CLIs, but this may be an
interesting lead to follow.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the changes discussed in this article, as well as
numerous “quality of life” improvements to the CLI codebase — and other
enhancements to Topiary, as a whole — landed in <a href="https://github.com/tweag/topiary/releases/v0.3.0">Topiary
v0.3</a>. Making such sweeping changes was a big job that
required careful planning and review. However, I think the results speak
for themselves and that this upfront investment will pay off as Topiary
blooms.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p>A recent tweet contained the phrase “dead languages such as Fortran”, which (although perhaps intended in jest) seemed worth debunking, since it is important that people making funding decisions about investments in compilers do not ignore Fortran as “a legacy language”, or even, as above, a “dead language”, since in its home domain Fortran remains critically important.</p><p>There are a few reasons for this misconception:-</p><ul><li><p>Most programmers are never taught Fortran, and it is not a computer science or web language.</p></li><li><p><span>Fortran is only the 15th most popular language on the </span><a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="">Tiobe index</a><span> for September 2022, and is low down in </span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022" rel="">IEEE’s language popularity estimates</a><span> as well. </span></p></li><li><p>It was released in 1957 (as, indeed, was I), so, since old people know nothing, and anything from the last century is technically suspect, it clearly must be dying.</p></li></ul><p>The issue here is really one of insularity. The web sites and teaching resources that people use depend on the jobs they have and the tasks they are trying to solve. So, one would not expect accountants to be experts in structural mechanics, or to know how to drive a fork-lift truck. We are taught the tools we need for the things we are expected to do, and are interested in. </p><p>Thus, people studying hard sciences such as physics and chemistry are taught to program in Fortran, whereas more general programmers (who, if the language popularity indices are to be believed will likely be developing web applications) are not, since Fortran is not used in that domain.</p><p><span>One particular group for whom this matters is the people writing the compilers. Since most compilers are now written in C or C++ (e.g. the </span><a href="https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc" rel="">Gnu Compiler Collection</a><span> (GCC): 62.6% C++ or C, </span><a href="https://llvm.org/" rel="">LLVM</a><span>: 84% C++ or C </span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-73480898" href="https://cpufun.substack.com/p/is-fortran-a-dead-language#footnote-1-73480898" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>), those are the languages which the compiler writers use every day, so tend to consider as "real" languages. In particular, if they improve those compilers they experience the benefits themselves.</span></p><p><span>Also, since they are not interested in Fortran, many people do not track the status of current Fortran, (which continues to evolve through Fortran 2018, with Fortran 2023 expected next year), but are under the impression that nothing has happened since Fortran 77 (or, at the latest, Fortran 90). While it is still possible to compile code in fixed, punch-card, format, modern Fortran is a more friendly language with useful built-in features for high-performance computing [HPC] codes (such as operations on whole arrays without needing to write a loop, explicitly parallel loops [</span><code>do concurrent</code><span>], and support for Partitioned Global Address Space [PGAS] parallelism via </span><a href="https://www.nag.com/nagware/np/r62_doc/nag_f2008.html#AUTOTOC_3_3:~:text=3.3-,Coarrays,-Coarrays%20are%20variables" rel="">coarrays</a><span>).</span></p><p><span>It is certainly true that Fortran is low down on the programming popularity indices, but they are not measuring anything that gives us useful information about the importance of a language, but rather they tell us how many people ask questions about it (TIOBE</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-73480898" href="https://cpufun.substack.com/p/is-fortran-a-dead-language#footnote-2-73480898" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>), or how many people are programming in it (</span><a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022#:~:text=we%20look%20at%20nine%20metrics%20that%20we%20think" rel="">IEEE </a><span>: “we look at nine metrics that we think are good proxies for measuring what languages people are programming in.”)</span></p><p>However, these measures of popularity miss the point that the number of people writing in a language is a completely separate issue from how important the code is, and how much compute resource it may consume. </p><p><span>Consider the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package [</span><a href="https://www.vasp.at/" rel="">VASP</a><span>], which is the code that consumes the most resources on the UK’s largest HPC machine (</span><a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/" rel="">Archer2</a><span>), and which is written in Fortran. At the VASP site we can see </span><a href="https://www.vasp.at/info/team/" rel="">photos of the VASP team</a><span> which consists of  … 15 people. Clearly 15 people writing Fortran make no impact on the statistics measured by the popularity indices, yet, as we will see below, their code is hugely important. </span></p><p><span>For reasons I cannot understand, “legacy” has become an insult, despite most of our knowledge being a legacy from previous generations. (I don’t see physicists tearing up energy conservation because it wasn’t theorised in this generation, actors complaining about having to learn a part in a Shakespeare play, or musicians complaining about playing Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, or </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hildegard_of_Bingen" rel="">Hildegard of Bingen</a><span> who died in 1169!).</span></p><p>The fact that there are many well tested Fortran codes which are being used and maintained, rather than being thrown away to be replaced by expensive, new, untested code in the language du jour is a good thing, not a bad one.</p><p><span>While you might argue that the weather forecasts you get are bad, the forecasts save lives and many are written in Fortran (e.g. the US’ </span><a href="https://github.com/wrf-model/WRF" rel="">WRF</a><span>, the UK Meteorological Office’s Unified Model [UM], and ECMWF’s Integrated Forecast System [IFS]). </span></p><p>Although Fortran may not be useful to hard-core computer-science folk, it remains one of the most important languages for scientists who are looking for a well understood, performant, portable, language in which to write the codes they need to support their real objectives of advancing knowledge in their field. </p><p><span>As we all know, hardware continues to advance (despite the impact of the end of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennard_scaling" rel="">Dennard scaling</a><span>),  but having a well understood tool that we can continue to use is important. If we buy a cross-head screwdriver we don’t throw away the straight, single slot, one we already owned, even though both are screwdrivers, rather we recognise that we need both in our toolbox. Similarly throwing away Fortran codes makes no sense. Fortran is also under </span><a href="https://wg5-fortran.org/" rel="">continuing development</a><span>, it’s just not visible to the people who make a lot of noise about the state of the C++ standard</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-73480898" href="https://cpufun.substack.com/p/is-fortran-a-dead-language#footnote-3-73480898" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span>!</span></p><p><span>With the addition of </span><a href="https://openmp.org/" rel="">OpenMP</a><span>®, Fortran codes can be extended in a vendor neutral way to operate on machines with both CPUs and GPUs or other accelerators.</span></p><p><span>Many people (including some people writing code themselves, who, if they are logical won’t expect to be paid) think that software, and, in particular, compilers, should all be free. However, in the real world, someone has to pay the developers (</span><a href="https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salaries/us-c-developer-salary-SRCH_IL.0,2_IN1_KO3,14.htm?countryRedirect=true" rel="">glassdoor</a><span> reckons the mean C++ developer salary in the US is $94,466&nbsp;/yr in September 2022, which means that the cost of employing a C++ developer is likely around $150k/yr after allowing for office space, machines, travel expenses, and so on). Of course that means that the people paying the developers must be able to see significant value in the code they produce even if it is given away, since we live in a capitalist economic system, and they want to make a profit. </span></p><p>The compilers used in High Performance Computing [HPC] are mostly written by the providers of the hardware, and, normally, that means the designers of the CPU (or GPU) chips. </p><p>There are good reasons for this:-</p><ul><li><p>To have compilers ready when a new chip comes out work has to start before the specifications are public, so an unrelated software company cannot do it.</p></li><li><p>If they are sane, the hardware architects should be worrying whether their wonderful new features can be used by compilers, so they need to be talking to compiler writers and accepting their feedback even before the specification of new instructions is finalised.</p></li><li><p>Since the price at which a CPU or GPU can be sold is related to its performance, having a compiler which improves the performance of whatever benchmark codes are used for this evaluation is valuable as it allows you to charge more for each machine you sell. Indeed, this may be a simpler, cheaper, way to achieve performance than using an improved process to make the chip, or having it run at a higher clock frequency (and thus consume more power).</p></li><li><p>Having an in-house compiler-team allows rapid fixes to be made if there are problems when running the benchmarks required for specific procurements.</p></li><li><p><span>To compete in a specific market the customers there must be able to run their codes on the machine you are trying to sell. In the HPC market that means having good Fortran support</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-73480898" href="https://cpufun.substack.com/p/is-fortran-a-dead-language#footnote-4-73480898" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span>.</span></p></li></ul><p>That final reason should make it obvious why the number of programmers using a language is not the right metric for the people funding compiler development to use. Since they aren’t selling the compiler and charging people a license for each user, the number of people who will use the compiler is irrelevant. What matters is how much hardware is needed to run code that requires support for the language the compiler supports.</p><p><span>Luckily for us, the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (</span><a href="https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/" rel="">EPCC</a><span>) who run  </span><a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/" rel="">Archer2</a><span> (which is the largest centrally funded machine for scientific research here in the UK and is </span><a href="https://www.top500.org/system/180036/" rel="">25th in the June 2022 Top500</a><span> list of supercomputers) publish </span><a href="https://www.archer2.ac.uk/support-access/status.html#:~:text=0.0-,Historical%20usage%20data,-Period" rel="">information on the applications</a><span> which are being run on the machine</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-73480898" href="https://cpufun.substack.com/p/is-fortran-a-dead-language#footnote-5-73480898" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span>.</span></p><p>Although they don’t currently publish information about the language in which each application is written, a morning on Google and a few emails to code authors let me fill in that information for most of the codes.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://outage.sr.ht/">https://outage.sr.ht/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38966035">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>My name is Drew, I’m the founder of SourceHut and one of three SourceHut staff
members working on the outage, alongside my colleagues Simon and Conrad. As you
have noticed, SourceHut is down. I offer my deepest apologies for this
situation. We have made a name for ourselves for reliability, and this is the
most severe and prolonged outage we have ever faced. We spend a lot of time
planning to make sure this does not happen, and we failed. We have all hands on
deck working the problem to restore service as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In our emergency planning models, we have procedures in place for many kinds of
eventualities. What has happened this week is essentially our worst-case
scenario: “what if the primary datacenter just disappeared tomorrow?” We ask
this question of ourselves seriously, and make serious plans for what we’d do if
this were to pass, and we are executing those plans now – though we had hoped
that we would never have to.</p>
<p>I humbly ask for your patience and support as we deal with a very difficult
situation, and, again, I offer my deepest apologies that this situation has come
to pass.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-happening">What is happening?</h2>
<p>At 06:30 UTC on January 10th, two days prior to the time of writing, a
distributed denial of service attack (DDoS) began targetting SourceHut. We still
do not know many details – we don’t know who they are or why they are
targetting us, but we do know that they are targetting SourceHut specifically.</p>
<p>We deal with ordinary DDoS attacks in the normal course of operations, and we
are generally able to mitigate them on our end. However, this is not an ordinary
DDoS attack; the attacker posesses considerable resources and is operating at a
scale beyond that which we have the means to mitigate ourselves. In response,
before we could do much ourselves to understand or mitigate the problem, our
upstream network provider null routed SourceHut entirely, rendering both the
internet at large, and SourceHut staff, unable to reach our servers.</p>
<p>The primary datacenter, PHL, was affected by this problem. We rent colocation
space from our PHL supplier, where we have our own servers installed. We
purchase networking through our provider, who allocates us a block out of their
AS, and who upstreams with Cogent, which is the upstream that ultimately black
holed us. Unfortunately, our colocation provider went through two acquisitions
in the past year, and we failed to notice that our account had been forgotten as
they migrated between ticketing systems through one of these acquisitions. Thus
unable to page them, we were initially forced to wait until their normal office
hours began to contact them, 7 hours after the start of the incident.</p>
<p>When we did get them on the phone, our access to support ticketing was restored,
they apologised profusely for the mistake, and we were able to work with them on
restoring service and addressing the problems we were facing. This led to
SourceHut’s availability being partially restored on the evening of January
10th, until the DDoS escalated in the early hours of January 11th, after which
point our provider was forced to null route us again.</p>
<p>We have seen some collateral damage as well. You may have noticed that Hacker
News was down on January 10th; we believe that was ultimately due to Cogent’s
heavy handed approach to mitigating the DDoS targetting SourceHut (sorry, HN,
glad you got it sorted). Last night, a non-profit free software forge, Codeberg,
also became subject to a DDoS, which is still ongoing and may be caused by the
same actors. This caused our status page to go offline – Codeberg has been kind
enough to host it for us so that it’s reachable during an outage – we’re not
sure if Codeberg was targetted because they hosted our status page or if this is
part of a broader attack on free software forge platforms.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-doing-about-it">What are we doing about it?</h2>
<p>We maintain three sites, PHL, FRE, and AMS. PHL is our primary and is offline,
FRE is our backup site, and AMS is a research installation we eventually hoped
to use to migrate our platform to European hosting. As we initially had no
access whatsoever to PHL, we began restoring from backups to AMS to set up a
parallel installation of SourceHut from scratch.</p>
<p>We have since received some assistance from our PHL provider in regaining access
to our PHL servers out of band, which is speeding up affairs, but we do not
expect to get PHL online soon and we are proceeding with the AMS installation
for now.</p>
<p>The prognosis on user data loss is good. Our backups are working and regularly
tested, the last full backup of git and hg was taken a few hours before the DDoS
began, and we have out-of-band access to the live PHL servers where all changes
which occured since the most recent backup are safely preserved. The database is
replicated in real-time and was only seconds behind production before it went
offline.</p>
<p>We have replicated the production database in AMS and started spinning up
SourceHut services there: we have meta, todo, lists, paste, and the project hub
fully operational against production data in our staging environment here. We
are still working on the following services in order of priority:</p>
<ol>
<li>git.sr.ht</li>
<li>hg.sr.ht</li>
<li>pages.sr.ht</li>
<li>chat.sr.ht</li>
<li>man.sr.ht</li>
<li>builds.sr.ht</li>
</ol>
<p>These services, particularly git and hg, require large transfers of data across
our networks to restore from backups, and will take some time. Chat does not
require particularly large amounts of data to be managed, but has special
networking concerns that we are addressing as well.</p>
<p>Our goal is to enable read-only access for the community as quickly as possible,
then work on full read/write access following that. Object storage (used for
git/hg releases, build artifacts, and SourceHut pages) presents a special set of
problems; we are working on those separately. Finding suitable compute to run
build jobs is another issue which requires special attention, but we have a plan
for this as well.</p>
<p>One of our main concerns right now is finding a way of getting back online on a
new network without the DDoS immediately following us there, and we have reason
to believe that it will. A layer 3 DDoS like the one we are facing is complex
and expensive to mitigate. We spoke to CloudFlare and were quoted a number we
cannot reasonably achieve within our financial means, but we are investigating
other solutions which may be more affordable and have a few avenues for research
today, though we cannot disclose too many details without risking alerting the
attackers to our plans.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How you can help</h2>
<p>What we need the most right now is your patience and understanding. Mitigating
this sort of attack is a marathon, not a sprint, and we have to be careful not
to overwork our staff, ensure we’re getting enough sleep, and so on – we are
working as hard as we can. There are many people hard at work on this problem
for you – I’d like to thank Simon and Conrad in particular for their work, as
well as the datacenter and network operators upstream of us who are doing their
best as well.</p>
<p>You can receive updates on this page, so long as we’re able to keep it online
(low priority), as well as <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@drewdevault">on Mastodon</a>, where we are posting updates as
well. This is also a good place to share your words of support and
encouragement, as well as the #sr.ht IRC channel on Libera Chat. My inbox at
<a href="mailto:sir@cmpwn.com">sir@cmpwn.com</a> is also working (not without some effort,
I’ll add), if you wish to send your support or offer any resources that might
help.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and support. We are working to make things right
with you.</p>

</a>Why remove cookies?</h2>
<p>The thought of going completely cookieless seems daunting and borderline ludicrous to a lot of the marketers that I talk to. If you were to remove all cookies today, like we did at Sentry in July 2023, it would radically change the functionality of your martech stack. This is covered thoroughly in <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/digital-advertising-trends-cookieless-advertising-is-coming-are-you-ready-for-it/">articles like this</a>, but in brief, things like attribution, remarketing, or Account Based Marketing (ABM) would be rendered much less effective and it would almost certainly lead to a material loss in revenue.</p>
<p>Not to mention If performance marketing is a key driver of revenue for your business, levers like targeting, bidding, reporting, and procurement become extremely challenging. However, with Google’s <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/cookie-countdown-2023oct/">promise to remove cookies for some users in Q1 2024</a> and completely <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/27/google-delays-move-away-from-cookies-in-chrome-to-2024/">remove cookies from Chrome by the second half of 2024</a> looming, you basically have three approaches you can take:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Ignore</strong> that this is happening and wait until you are forced to make changes around Q2/Q3 this year (not recommended).</li>
<li><strong>Become an early adopter</strong> as ad platforms continue to optimize and introduce newer solutions for cookie removal like Enhanced Conversions, GA4, Conversions API, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/221353413010930?id=547299432790676">Conversion Lift</a>, etc. so as to not cause any drastic shake ups until the platforms are ready for the shift.</li>
<li><strong>Completely remove cookies</strong> sooner rather than later, and start directing your time and energy towards future models that respect your users’ privacy.</li>
</ol>

<p>We chose the third route despite Google sending us an entire deck to tell us why we shouldn’t. We actually took it a step further by removing all user tracking, period. Was it worth it? In this post, I’ll share some early results and all of the pitfalls and triumphs that we’ve faced ever since removal of every advertising cookie and user tracking in June 2023. My hope is that this can give others a dos and don’ts list and best practices for the inevitable shift from cookies in 2024.</p>

</a>Why completely remove cookies and user tracking now when I can just wait?</h2>
<p>The way I see it, there are a handful of reasons a marketer might decide to gut their website of cookies and traditional user tracking in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookie consent banners, App Tracking Transparency (ATT), and consent management platforms (CMPs) for GDPR/CCPA compliance have already obfuscated tracking data enough to make you question if the data you have is reliable.</li>
<li>Your audience is probably privacy-conscious. Aren’t we all learning to be as companies <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tiktok-data-privacy">misuse</a> our data? Ultimately you want your brand to align with your audience’s desires and demands. And your audience will appreciate one less banner to dismiss when they just want to load your page.</li>
<li>Your time and effort could be better spent driving towards learning new cookieless tools and techniques and also building sugar-free (bad cookie joke) solutions for acquiring customers, understanding behaviors, reporting, and measurement.</li>
<li>This shift will happen later this year anyway and you’re likely already struggling with increasingly non-traceable user journeys, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_social_media">dark social</a> channels, etc. Being reactive will put you behind while other companies (see Apple) move forward and build moats of differentiation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At Sentry, the idea to strip all advertising cookies was born out of respecting our privacy conscious audience, and our own <a href="https://blog.sentry.io/privacy-by-default/">privacy by default values</a>. We market to developers who notoriously do not like being marketed to (we should know; we are a developer-led company and Sentry users ourselves), so the idea of removing ad cookies instantly intrigued us. And, if given the choice, why not build for tomorrow, today? That decision has had ancillary benefits along our journey that we’ll get into, one being that it gave us an excuse to do away with the annoying cookie consent banners which have come to define modern web browsing.</p>
<p>Sounds like good-enough reasoning, right? Despite the momentum internally to do this, to be honest, as a growth marketer I was excited at the prospect of it, but I started thinking about all of the things that are going to break. The initial response I had was to raise concerns for why we shouldn’t do it or to delay it. The following breakpoints stuck out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our attribution models (first and multi-touch in our case)</li>
<li>Our marketing reports in our business insights tool</li>
<li>Google Analytics</li>
<li>All of our SEO reporting (built on GA and GA4)</li>
<li>Google Ads smart bidding</li>
<li>Procurement of onboarding new tools</li>
<li>Remarketing</li>
</ul>
<p>…And there’s an admittedly large list of stuff we didn’t think through that caused problems when we removed ALL user tracking on our site:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube video embeds on our website used cookies</li>
<li>Our GCLID from Google Ads passing onto our site*</li>
<li>Our bot blocking tool for ads relying on both a pixel and GCLID</li>
<li>Lookalike modeling not being an option b/c of data sharing with ad platforms*</li>
<li>Not being able to use Salesforce x Google Ads integration*</li>
<li>4xing our website’s 404s and redirects on accident (whoops)</li>
<li>Completely losing signups from display marketing and YouTube</li>
<li>Losing referrer data for content analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>*Some of these were more due to extreme measures we took by removing user tracking, cookies, and the cookie banner as a whole, but most were due to the removal of cookies</p>
<p>We’ll cover some of these and share how to avoid the same mistakes we made in the next section.</p>
<p>To state the obvious, performance marketing is critical for many businesses; Gartner says digital spending accounted for <a href="https://www.webstrategiesinc.com/blog/how-much-budget-for-online-marketing">over half of marketing budgets</a> in 2022.  Given the importance of this channel and the challenges laid out above, how can you actually take on the risk of running performance monitoring without cookies?</p>

</a>How to run performance marketing completely cookieless</h2>
<p>Let’s break this down into four sections: targeting, bidding, tracking/reporting, and procurement (don’t skip this!). Each section will cover considerations to be thinking about when going cookieless, the issues that we ran into, and the pivots that we made so that you can help prepare for the future.</p>

</a>Targeting Without Cookies</h3>
<p>The current state of targeting has already been severely impacted by various changes in the last few years. Remember the havoc Apple wreaked on the entire digital advertising ecosystem when they launched <a href="https://www.adjust.com/glossary/app-tracking-transparency/">ATT</a>? At the time, Facebook (now Meta) estimated a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2022/10/08/apples-12-billion-strike-to-facebook-is-suddenly-taking-shape/?sh=4e553fdb1636">loss in 10-13 billion ad revenue dollars</a> related to the change, likely a direct reflection of advertisers shifting budget away from Meta because they lost ROI. And that was just one in a string of privacy changes that likely impacted digital marketing performance.</p>
<p>If that wasn’t enough of a triggering thought, how much less of a remarketing pool did you have across ad platforms when people started opting out of the consent banner on your site, 30% reduction? 50%… or more? On top of that, you were already dealing with ad blockers, and probably depend heavily on walled gardens to give you targeting options that work for your specific audience.</p>
<p>When third-party cookies are fully deprecated this year, there will undoubtedly be more struggles for performance marketers. Without traditional pixels or conversion signals, Google (largest ad platform in the world) struggles to find intent of web visitors to purchase. Shifting now, this made our targeting on Google search much worse, but actually still tolerable because you can use keywords intent and negative search terms as a guiding light. However Youtube, Display, Shopping, <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/13859703?hl=en">Demand Gen</a>, or PMAX campaigns depend on these purchase intent signals paired with black box contextual audiences that Google gives you which, at times, in our case were scattershot at best. For example, one custom intent audience that utilized search terms/history was showing us billions of impressions (more than the current population of the world) in the estimated audience size, even though it utilized long tail search terms. Not exactly precise targeting to reach software developers in our case.</p>

</a>What happened to our targeting?</h3>
<p>Our Google rep, our ad agency, and I all knew that Google’s lack of signals would cut deep, so when we went cookieless, we treated it as an opportunity to learn how we would pivot to find our audience, rather than a doomsday event.</p>
<p>Display and other channels were severely hampered after cookie removal; our traditional retargeting motion died off pretty quickly as we couldn’t use GA4’s audiences or our Google Ads pixel. We had to pivot our strategy fast.</p>
<p>We decided to rely on ad engagement retargeting (rather than traditional retargeting) on most of our ad channels which isn’t the same, but still gives us a semblance of a funnel. We tailored our ads that are focused on middle of funnel (MOF) and bottom of funnel (BOF) to this engaged audience. This is a not-so-bad patch for a broken retargeting effort as long as you have engaging content and the budget to promote it. Engagement retargeting is offered on Meta, LinkedIn, Youtube, and Reddit, and we pair video ads at the top of the funnel to drive engagement.</p>
<p>At the same time we were figuring out remarketing, we also lost confidence in prospecting with Display and decided to migrate budget to sponsorships and publishers that we instinctively knew had our core audience. This may produce less flashy conversion counts depending on your business, but it gave us a place to tell our story to our audience. It also forced us to focus more on content marketing which speaks to the potential customer’s jobs to be done; it also builds trust and goodwill instead of trying to get vanity signups or [insert your BOF KPI] with a cold prospecting audience.</p>
<p>When deciding to remove cookies or user tracking in general, these are your top three targeting considerations IMO:</p>
<ol>
<li>How you’ll segment funnel stages in creative ways</li>
<li>Will you still have faith in your current channels to continue to reach your audience or do you need to explore other channels?</li>
<li>Which bidding model you will shift to and what potential impacts to targeting might you see</li>
<li>BONUS: How will you prepare the stakeholders in your company for the inevitable impact on traceable conversions? This could be its own post, so we’ll keep this one about the nuts and bolts, but you should start thinking about this now. Getting cross-functional buy-in (and crucially, that of leadership) is the best first step, so feel free to share this post with whomever needs to see it</li>

</a>Bidding</h3>
<p>Most ad platforms rely on pixels and cookies to train the bidding algorithm on which type of users convert for your business and which will hit specific KPIs or cost per actions (CPAs) that you’re going after.</p>
<p>In our case most of our ad platforms were set up with pixels that sent conversion signals to the ad platforms when a signup or a request for a demo happened on our website. We were also piping in conversions with offline uploading to get down-funnel events to train Google to find the right user intent. This can be done with Google, Meta conversions API (CAPI), and  LinkedIn (with <a href="https://bit.ly/offline-conversion-upload">offline conversion upload</a>.) For digital marketers this is a way to improve CPAs and level up from 101 digital marketing, but it also involves either cookieing or sending user information back to an ad platform. Quick nuance: for certain tracking technology like hashed offline passbacks—although it isn’t technically a cookie—it may still be subject to “cookie laws” and you may need to keep your screen-eating cookie banner. So in addition to cookies, we had to do away with GCLID passback for example, because we wanted to remove our cookie banner and because our users deserve their privacy. Be sure to discuss with your legal team how this might apply if you want to remove your banner.</p>
<p>For us, our bidding models had the largest impact on revenue; because Google is one of our largest ad platforms and is now no longer trained on clicks/intention to purchase, just that the user clicked. There was actually about a two to three week delay in performance declines after we went cookieless where Google still had data we used to train it on and our campaigns continued to perform well.</p>
<p>However when comparing period over period from before we removed user tracking and cookies on our site to after, <strong>we saw around a 30% increase in our cost per click (CPCs) in Google search</strong>. It varied between brand and non-brand searches, but this shows the impact of what you’re up against. Bottom line: your ad campaigns could get that much worse post-cookie removal if you don’t adopt hashed passbacks or offline signals/apis and if you’re utilizing smart strategies like Target CPA bidding, Maximize Conversions, etc.</p>
<p>Our options became pretty limited without these conversion signals fed into our ad platforms because of our hard line drawn at total cookie banner removal and 0 user tracking:</p>
<p><strong>For Google Search</strong>: we shifted back to Enhanced CPC and Max Clicks which optimizes for less important factors than our old model (definitely a downgrade). We stay on top of our negative keywords and regional data so much more now as a proxy for using a bidding model to sort through intent of users.</p>
<p><strong>For YouTube</strong>: We shifted to Target CPV for any video viewer or engagement and Target CPM for awareness. We had to remove video action campaigns here and so we focused more on reach. Instead of a drastic loss, we actually ended up 13xing our views on our videos period over period, and are getting more quality site visitors than we used to. We’re still getting conversions from this channel and our benchmarks for view rate are right at our industry average (and above the benchmark from Google) so this ended up being a successful shift. We also saw over 100% growth in folks mentioning they heard us from Youtube on our onboarding survey quarter over quarter. Shifting bidding strategies here could be worth trying, regardless of your decision with cookies.</p>
<p><strong>For Display</strong>: We shifted to viewable CPM. As a result, our CPM was nearly cut in half and we saw a surprisingly large increase in impressions (north of 20%) month over month after making this shift. However our conversions tailed off and then dropped off of a cliff with the shift in bidding models.</p>

<em>Note: we kept our bidding model on smart bidding for a while after the cookie change in hopes Google would utilize historical conversion data, it worked for a little but was a sharp decline”</em></p>
<p>These conversions weren’t converting through our funnel to paying customers at a high enough rate anyway (even with a long term view), so our shift in bidding strategy for display was paired with a shift to executing more brand and awareness marketing with display rather than direct response which wasn’t a great fit for the channel anyway.</p>
<p><strong>For most other channels</strong>: We removed pixels and rely on UTMs paired with manual bidding. More on this in the section below.</p>

</a>Cookieless Tracking/Attribution/Reporting</h2>
<p>Consider the challenges you probably already face with regards to reporting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most users on paid social channels are on mobile devices which introduces cross device tracking as well as view-through targeting challenges.</li>
<li>Ad blockers were already plaguing your ability to see a large portion of your audience. <a href="https://backlinko.com/ad-blockers-users">42.7%</a> of internet users worldwide use ad blockers.</li>
<li>Hidden user journey moments like a shared linkedin post or an executive hearing about you on a podcast or at an event are already influencing deals.</li>
<li>If you’re using an attribution model, it’s probably not accounting for the above touches and you are probably favoring certain channels too much given how complex a buyer journey is in today’s age.</li>
<li>Matching up spend to down-funnel events for ROI/ROAS calculations is a big undertaking. Drilling down to the keyword or audience to understand your distribution areas and where to spend your budget is time consuming.</li>
<li>Even if you have everything orchestrated and deduping out of one ad server like CM360, you’re still dealing with the cookie banner and ad blockers removing a chunk of your vision and signals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now take away cookies and user tracking and you’re left with…?</p>
<p>Reporting and attribution became a <strong>huge</strong> lift for us when we went cookieless. Our Business Insights (BI) team flagged that our attribution data was going to break and we needed to migrate to a new underlying table. On top of this, we had to switch attribution models from First and Multi-touch (depending on what we were measuring) to Last-click because we would only be able to track the previous page visited by a user before conversion without storing data on the user’s browser. We were lucky to have a competent BI team and alignment top-down to be able to pivot and get a new attribution model and new table of underlying data.</p>
<p>This took a TON of back and forth, basically building logic that an out-of-the-box attribution solution already has in SQL, but we finally got to a place where we could salvage around 50% of attribution data. This was a huge win for us, to directionally understand the best channels that lead to business outcomes. Because we lost so much data, we also instituted a self-reported attribution “how did you hear about us” survey. Eight months in, and we’ve actually found new channels and learned a lot about our old ones. Ironically, a lack of data actually led to new insights.</p>
<p>My advice here is to figure out where your attribution is done (CRM, Data Warehouse, 3rd party tool?) and if you’re serious about removing cookies, start discussing the lift it would take to move to a model that’s simpler.</p>
<p>After more than a half a year of cookieless attribution, my takeaway is that UTMs and referrer data, when done right, directionally do the trick for understanding which ads, publishers, campaigns, and audiences are performing. The self-reported attribution survey we prioritized now helps remove our bias and uncover new expansion areas. We’re also working on understanding blended data. All of these are excellent muscles to develop for a cookieless future.</p>

<p>Going cookieless doesn’t mean you shouldn’t actively be hunting for new solutions to help improve performance. In the Marketing Technology Landscape, published by <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/">chiefmartec.com</a> and its editor <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjbrinker/">Scott Brinker</a>, the amount of technology options for marketing grew from <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2023/05/2023-marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-11038-solutions-searchable-on-martechmap-com/">150 in 2011 to 11,038 in 2023</a>. There are more options now than ever before, and much more innovation and disruption happening.</p>
<p>We’ve recently met with companies that do Attribution, Account Based Marketing, Demand Sided Platforms (DSPs), Connected TV, and Analytics tools, and every conversation sputters out as soon as we mention privacy and our lack of cookies. Our marketing team would leave demo calls with serious concerns that our new privacy policy would render the tool not worth the sticker price, even if we could use it in a limited fashion.</p>
<p>Despite this challenge, there are going to be more and more tools out there that can navigate user tracking and cookieless well. Here are a few questions that I’ve found to be useful to ask current vendors up for renewal, or prospective tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your software comply with data protection and privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA? If so, can we get access to any documentation that you have?
<ul>
<li>Data Processing Agreement</li>
<li>Terms of service</li>
<li>BONUS: While you’re here asking for docs, you may have a security/compliance team that will ask for these anyway:
<ul>
<li>ISO/SOC2 certifications</li>
<li>Prepopulated security questionnaire like the <a href="https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/consensus-assessments-initiative-questionnaire-v3-1/">CAIQ</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Does it require a tracking script to run?
<ul>
<li>If the script picks up analytics data, e.g., conversion data, then it could violate your cookie policy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you explain the different types of cookies your software utilizes and their specific functions?</li>
<li>How does your software collect and store data related to user interactions?</li>
<li>Does your software share user data with third parties, and if so, how is this handled?</li>
</ul>
<p>Often a tool will claim that they are cookieless and still do some form of user tracking. For example, we switched from GA4 to <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a> and needed to know the nuances of how they use IP addresses. Know that if you want to remove your cookie banner, even if a tool is “cookieless”, you still may not be able to use it because cookie laws can apply broadly to tracking technology. Make sure to get on the same page about this with your legal team early on, before you make any procurement decisions.</p>

</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Going cookieless might seem like a big undertaking with complex cross-functional challenges, so I can see the temptation to put it off. But the cookieless future is coming, whether you like it or not. Shifting away from cookies is a burden, and although you’ll have to sacrifice, you may gain a new perspective, and learn how to market to your users while respecting their privacy.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember the lack of visibility and data issues you’re already facing and how this will step-function degrade as we speed towards H2 2024</li>
<li>Completely cookieless performance marketing is achievable</li>
<li>It takes cross functional alignment from all stakeholders: business insights, website, legal, leadership, etc.</li>
<li>There will be expected outcomes, and unexpected outcomes</li>
<li>Going cookieless forces you to get creative and to start re-imagining the way you do targeting, bidding, tracking, and procurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>We didn’t cover every challenge that we faced in this post, and we still (and will continue to) measure the impacts to KPIs eight months in.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Would we do this all over again?</p>
<p>Because Sentry values privacy and the future of the open internet, yes. We took a firm stance on this despite knowing that paid channels would get a major shake up. But if you work somewhere that will hold on tightly to their cookie banner and rapidly diminishing tracking, at minimum we would suggest the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Institute self-reported attribution somewhere in your conversion flow.</li>
<li>Move all paid channels to utilizing conversion APIs, hashed passbacks, offline uploads, etc. (because of the downsides we experienced firsthand without being able to use them.)</li>
<li>Have conversations about testing new channels that might not have as clear of a ROI as demand capture channels like paid search</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if visitors to your site notice nothing else, they’ll at least have one less cookie banner to dismiss, and that is a win for the entire web.</p>

When the wind gets going, their blades can spin at well over 200km per hour. It is easy to imagine careless birds getting chopped to bits. Campaigners often point to the possibility when opposing the building of new wind farms.</p><p data-component="paragraph">No one doubts that wind turbines do indeed kill at least some birds. But a new analysis of American data, published in <i>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</i>, suggests the numbers are negligible, and have little impact on bird populations.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Wind power has expanded dramatically in America over the past 20 years, from 2.6 gigawatts of installed capacity on land in 2000 to 122 gigawatts in 2020. Many studies have analysed the effects in specific locations or on specific bird species. But few have looked at the effects on wildlife at the population level. Enter Erik Katovich, an economist at the University of Geneva. Dr Katovich made use of the Christmas Bird Count, a citizen-science project run by the National Audubon Society, an American non-profit outfit. Volunteers count birds they spot over Christmas, and the society compiles the numbers. Its records stretch back over a century.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Dr Katovich assumed, reasonably, that if wind turbines harmed bird populations, then the numbers seen in the Christmas Bird Count would drop in places where new turbines had been built. He combined bird population and species maps with the locations and construction dates of all wind turbines in the United States, with the exceptions of Alaska and Hawaii, between 2000 and 2020. He found that building turbines had no discernible effect on bird populations. That reassuring finding held even when he looked specifically at large birds like hawks, vultures and eagles that many people believe are particularly vulnerable to being struck.</p><p data-component="paragraph">But Dr Katovich did not confine his analysis to wind power alone. He also examined oil-and-gas extraction. Like wind power, this has <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/07/10/the-mother-frackers-of-shale-now-resemble-opec">boomed</a> in America over the past couple of decades, with the rise of shale gas produced by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of rocks. Production rose from 37m cubic metres in 2007 to 740m cubic metres in 2020.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Comparing bird populations to the locations of new gas wells revealed an average 15% drop in bird numbers when new wells were drilled, probably due to a combination of noise, air pollution and the disturbance of rivers and ponds that many birds rely upon. When drilling happened in places designated by the National Audubon Society as “important bird areas”, bird numbers instead dropped by 25%. Such places are typically migration hubs, feeding grounds or breeding locations.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Wind power, in other words, not only produces far less planet-heating carbon dioxide and methane than do fossil fuels. It appears to be significantly less damaging to wildlife, too. Yet that is not the impression you would get from reading the news. Dr Katovich found 173 stories in major American news outlets reporting the supposed negative effects that wind turbines had on birds in 2020, compared with only 46 stories discussing the effects of oil-and-gas wells. Wind turbines might look dramatic. But their effect on birds is not. <span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Curious about the world?

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mfkl.github.io/2024/01/10/unity-double-oss-standards.html">https://mfkl.github.io/2024/01/10/unity-double-oss-standards.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38964972">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
        <h2 id="vlc-for-unity-integration">VLC for Unity integration</h2>

<p>For the readers unaware, we started distributing binaries on the Unity Store for the open-source <a href="https://code.videolan.org/videolan/vlc-unity">VLC for Unity</a> integration back in December 2019.</p>

<p>The integration essentially was a bridge between the Unity game engine and the VLC multimedia engine, allowing to build your own media-player based on VLC technology in Unity-based games. Both Unity, through Mono, and LibVLC are highly portable so this is a compelling argument for this cross-platform integration.</p>

<p>Since the start, we have had many users downloading the assets from the Unity Store for their Unity apps and games when requiring demanding multimedia solutions. We had 3 assets targeting specific platforms:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Windows,</li>
  <li>UWP,</li>
  <li>Android.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="unity-store-ban">Unity Store ban</h2>

<p>This all changed at the end of the summer 2023 when Unity emailed us the following:</p>

<p>
    <img src="https://mfkl.github.io/assets/unity-store-email.png">
</p>

<p>And just like this, our <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/39987">publisher account was instantly banned</a>.</p>

<p>After <em>months</em> of slow back-and-forth over email trying to find a compromise, including offering to exclude LGPL code from the assets, Unity basically told us we were not welcome back to their Store, ever. <em>Even if we were to remove all LGPL code from the Unity package</em>.</p>

<p>Where it gets fun is that there are currently hundreds if not thousands of Unity assets that include LGPL dependencies (such as FFmpeg) in the Store <strong>right now</strong>. Enforcement is seemingly totally random, unless you get reported by someone, apparently.</p>

<p>It gets better… Unity itself, both the Editor and the runtime (which means <em>your shipped game</em>) <strong>is already using LGPL dependencies</strong>! Unity is built on libraries such as Lame, libiconv, libwebsockets and websockify.js (at least). Full list of open-source Unity dependencies <a href="https://gist.github.com/mfkl/ad5cbeadf144e52a762a09fac6a05a70">here</a>.</p>

<p>So Unity gets to use and benefit from LGPL open-source libraries, games built with Unity depend on LGPL code by default (hello glibc!), but publishers and Unity users are not allowed to do so through the Unity Store?</p>

<h2 id="introducing-the-videolabs-store">Introducing the <a href="https://videolabs.io/store">Videolabs Store</a></h2>

<p>Numerous companies make use of the LibVLC SDK and other related technologies (like FFmpeg).</p>

<p>Sometimes they will run into issues or request a new feature and while the community can sometimes help, the limited time of a few volunteers only goes so far. I have written about <a href="https://mfkl.github.io/2020/10/25/OSS-sutainability.html">OSS sustainability before</a> and that is very much on topic here.</p>

<p>It is in the best interest of both open-source project maintainers and commercial consumers to have a clear products and services offering for a given project, and that is what we have created with the <a href="https://videolabs.io/store">Videolabs Store</a> for both LibVLC and FFmpeg.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://videolabs.io/store"><img src="https://mfkl.github.io/assets/vlabs-store-1.png"></a>
</p>

<p>If you are a company requiring multimedia products or consulting for your own projects, this store will be of interest to you.</p>

<p>The Coral Dev Board Micro is a microcontroller board with a built-in camera, microphone, and Coral Edge TPU, allowing you to quickly prototype and deploy low-power embedded systems with on-device ML inferencing.</p>
<p>By combining the Cortex M4 and M7 processors with the Coral Edge TPU on this board, you can design systems that gracefully cascade from extreme low-power ML inferencing to more complex—yet still power-efficient—ML inferencing.</p>
