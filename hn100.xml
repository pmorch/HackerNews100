<p>Perchlorate is a compound used as an <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/oxidationreduction-redox?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects">oxidizing</a> agent in fireworks, and is a common component in rocket fuels, explosives and certain nitrogen fertilizers. At high levels in drinking water, perchlorate can interfere with the function of the human thyroid gland. However, the drinking water at Mount Rushmore meets current regulations and is safe for public consumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aerial fireworks displays took place at the memorial around the 1998-2009 Independence Days. The USGS and National Park Service studied perchlorate and metals associated with fireworks in 106 water and 11 soil samples taken from Mount Rushmore during 2011-2015. Perchlorate concentrations were greatest in samples collected from the northeast side of the memorial, and the scientists found perchlorate in soil where the fireworks were launched and where the debris landed.</p>
<p>“The lack of alternative perchlorate sources in the area, such as a military site or agricultural land with applied fertilizers, and the presence of firework debris suggest that past fireworks are the perchlorate source,” said Galen Hoogestraat, a USGS scientist and the lead author of the report. “Our results can help park managers protect water quality at this iconic national landmark.”</p>
<figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>The main findings include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A maximum perchlorate concentration of 54 micrograms per liter (µg/L) measured in a stream sample, and 38 µg/L measured from a groundwater well. In contrast, all groundwater and stream samples collected from sites outside the memorial boundary had perchlorate concentrations less than 0.2 µg/L.</li>
<li>Concentrations of metals in water samples were similar at sites within and outside the memorial, indicating little evidence of metal contamination due to human-made factors.</li>
<li>Dynamite that was used to blast the memorial in the 1930s is not a likely source of the perchlorate because perchlorate is not a component of dynamite formulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Drinking water is provided to about 3 million visitors to the memorial every year and to year-round park personnel. Perchlorate in drinking water is not currently regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, but the park has planned for additional voluntary monitoring and treatment.</p>
<p>“The park will continue to strive to provide safe drinking water that meets and exceeds current standards,” said Cheryl Schreier, the Mount Rushmore National Memorial superintendent. “The USGS was an excellent partner committed to sound science throughout the process of sampling, analyzing, reviewing and finalizing the report and findings. The park is committed to ensuring the safety of the public and all of our employees, and preserving and protecting the natural and cultural resources with which we are entrusted.”</p>

          Strong-Motion Monitor Layer
        </h2>
        <div>
          <div><p>
            The Strong-Motion Monitor layer is a feature that displays the real-time shaking situation throughout Japan, as observed by the Strong-Motion Observation Network (a network of seismometers for recording strong shaking), operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). When an Earthquake Early Warning (Forecast) is issued, the Strong-Motion Monitor layer automatically integrates and displays the information from the EEW, including the forecasted Seismic Intensity distribution, and estimated propagation of the P and S waves along side the Strong-Motion data.</p><p>
            If you enable Shaking Detection Notifications, you can receive Push Notifications when shaking from an earthquake is believed to have been detected. In some cases, it is possible to detect and be notified about earthquakes for which no Earthquake Early Warning has been issued. Please note that the detection method is not perfect, and notifications may be sent due to false positives.

          <p>
            The Strong-Motion Monitor layer has been experimentally worked on since February 2023 based on the "Joint Research Implementation Plan for the Utilisation of Strong-Motion Monitor Data" which was established by four parties: the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED), Gehirn Inc., TBS Television Inc., and TBS / JNN NEWS DIG LLC. This service has been made available to the general public through the "Mutual Cooperation Agreement for the Utilisation of Strong-Motion Monitor Data". Gehirn Inc. processes and distributes the information received from a dedicated communications line installed at NIED. This dedicated line uses a redundant configuration to ensure a fast and reliable service for the NERV Disaster Prevention app. Please note that this is a separate service from the "Strong-Motion Monitor" web service provided by NIED.

            The NERV Disaster Prevention app is a smartphone service that delivers optimised disaster prevention and weather information, such as earthquake, tsunami and volcanic eruption bulletins, as well as landslide, flooding and inundation risk information based on the user’s current and registered locations. The app has been developed to assist residents and visitors to areas where damage is expected to occur to accurately recognise the situation and make quick decisions to be able to take action.</p><p>
            The provided disaster prevention and weather information is received directly through a dedicated line connected to the Meteorological Service Support Centre (in both the main building of the Japan Meteorological Agency and the Osaka District Meteorological Observatory) to ensure the reliability of the information, and our independently developed technology enables the fastest level of information distribution in Japan.

              We send out different types of notifications depending on the device’s location, the type of information and level of urgency. If the information is not urgent, we send a silent notification as not to disturb the user. For more urgent situations where a disaster is time-sensitive, a ‘Critical Alert’ alerts the user to an imminent danger. Notifications like Earthquake Early Warnings (Alert level) and Tsunami Warnings will be forced to sound, even if the device is in Silent or Do Not Disturb modes.

            <h3>Privacy</h3>
            <p>
              The NERV Disaster Prevention app puts user privacy and security first. The app does not acquire any information about the user or their device that are not required to help the app to function. The user’s detailed location information (precise position) is only used for disaster prevention purposes and is calculated and processed entirely on-device, and is never transmitted externally. Location information required for push notifications of disaster prevention information is stored on the device only after having been converted to an area code (similar to that of a postcode). No location history is stored either on your device or the server, so your movements cannot be tracked.

            <h3>Credibility</h3>
            <p>
              The Earthquake Early Warning service of the NERV Disaster Prevention app has been reviewed for operational systems, equipment and technical suitability, and is distributed under a licence from the Director General of the Japan Meteorological Agency to forecast earthquake ground motion. The <a href="https://www.jma.go.jp/jma/kishou/know/bosai/ame_push.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Risk Distribution notification service</a> was jointly developed with the JMA as a cooperating operator. Other disaster prevention and weather information that’s displayed in the app is processed independently based on JMA data. The maps are independently created based on the Geographical Survey Institute’s map data.

            <h3>System Reliability</h3>
            <p>
              The NERV Disaster Prevention app’s information processing system is connected by a dedicated line to the Japan Meteorological Agency’s main office in Tokyo, and the Meteorological Service Support Centre at the Osaka District Meteorological Observatory. The system is geographically redundant with multiple data centres based in Tokyo and Osaka, and is designed to be able to continue working in the event of a major disaster.

          <p>Acquired location information and registered area information is used only for displaying disaster prevention information and sending push notifications. Location information sent from the application to the server is converted into an area code or mesh code in advance, within the application (client side), and only those codes are sent over the internet. In other words, the user’s detailed location coordinates never leave your device.</p>

        <div>
          <h3>Battery Consumption <sup>※4</sup></h3>
          <p>If the app's location setting is set to "Always Allow," the app will periodically retrieve your location in the background. This should have very little impact on your battery life. Also, when "Low Power Mode" is enabled, the app will not update your location in order to reduce power consumption.</p>

          The NERV Disaster Prevention App is a smartphone service that delivers earthquake, tsunami, volcanic eruption and emergency warnings, as well as provides weather-related disaster prevention information for flooding and landslides, optimised based on the user's current and registered locations. It was developed to help people living in or visiting an area where damage is expected to occur, to accurately assess the situation and make quick decisions and actions.</p><p>
          With information received directly through a leased line connected to the Japan Meteorological Agency, our proprietary technology enables the fastest information distribution in Japan.
        </p></div>
        
        <div><p>
          ※3 Gehirn Inc. is first and foremost an information security company. The security and privacy of our users is our highest priority. We take great care not to collect excessive amounts of information about our users through this application.</p><p>
          Acquired location and registered location information is used only for displaying disaster prevention information, and for sending push notifications. The location information that's sent from the app to the server is first converted to an area code. An area code is roughly equivalent to a zip code. Only that code is sent to the server, meaning the user's exact location is never sent to the server.</p><p>For example, if you were located in "Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo", it will be converted to a code that is used by everyone in Chiyoda-ku, so no one will ever be able to trace your exact location back to you. Additionally, the server doesn't store past area codes, so your movements cannot be tracked.</p><p>
          All data sent over the internet is first encrypted, and all data stored in the server's database is encrypted before being stored. If you ever set your location permissions to "Do Not Allow" or "Allow Only While Using", the registration information will be deleted from the server. Additionally, if the user ever uninstalls the app, the registration information will automatically be deleted from the server roughly one month after the app last tried to communicate with the server.
        </p></div>
        <div><p>
          ※4. In order to receive notifications about disasters related to your current location; [iOS] Set Location permissions to "Always Allow" and enable "Background App Refresh". [Android] Set Location permissions to "Always Allow".</p><p>
          When you set the app's location permissions to "Always Allow", the app will periodically retrieve your location in the background. This doesn't happen often, so the battery usage impact is negligible. Additionally, if "Low Power Mode" is enabled, the app will not update your location in the background in order to save power.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.pypy.org/posts/2023/12/pypy-moved-to-git-github.html">https://www.pypy.org/posts/2023/12/pypy-moved-to-git-github.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38834895">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody text">
      <p>PyPy has moved its canonical repo and issue tracker from
<a href="https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy">https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy</a> to <a href="https://github.com/pypy/pypy">https://github.com/pypy/pypy</a>. Obviously,
this means development will now be tracked in Git rather than Mercurial.</p>
<h3 id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We still feel Mercurial is a better version control system. The named branch
model and user interface are superior. But</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>foss.heptapod.net is not well indexed in google/bing/duckduckgo
  search, so people find it harder to search for issues in the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Heptapod has tightened its spam control, we get reports that
  users create issues only to have them flagged as spam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open Source has become synonymous with GitHub, and we are too small to
  change that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much of the current development comes as a reaction to fixing issues.
  Tracking interlocking issues is easier if all the code is on the same
  platform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/faq.html#why-doesn-t-pypy-use-git-and-move-to-github">FAQ</a>
  presents two arguments against the move. <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes">Github notes</a>
  solves much of point (1): the difficulty of discovering provenance of
  commits, although not entirely. But the main problem is point (2), it turns
  out that <strong>not</strong> moving to GitHub is an impediment to contribution and issue
  reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People who wish to continue to use Mercurial can use the same method below to
  push to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>GitHub is more resource rich than foss.heptapod.net. We could add CI
  jobs to replace some of our aging <a href="https://buildbot.pypy.org/">buildbot
  infrastructure</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="method">Method<a href="#method" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The migration required two parts: migrating the code and then migrating the
issues and merge requests.</p>
<h4 id="code-migration-1-code-and-notes">Code migration 1: code and notes<a href="#code-migration-1-code-and-notes" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>I used a <a href="https://github.com/mnauw/git-remote-hg">fork of git-remote-hg</a> to
create a local Git repo with all the changesets. Then I wanted to add a Git
note to each commit with the branch it came from. So I prepared a file with two
columns: the Git commit hash, and the corresponding branch from Mercurial.
Mercurial can describe each commit in two ways: either the commit hash or by a
number index. I used <code>hg log</code> to convert an index <code>i</code> to the Mercurial hash,
and then <code>git-hg-helper</code> from <code>git-remote-hg</code> to convert the Mercurial hash to
a Git hash:</p>
<div><pre>$(cd pypy-git; git-hg-helper git-rev $(cd ../pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T"{node}\n"))
</pre></div>

<p>Then I used <code>hg log</code> again to print the Mercurial branch for the index <code>i</code>:</p>
<div><pre>$(cd pypy-hg; hg log -r $i -T'{branch}\n')
</pre></div>

<p>Putting these two together, I could loop over all the commits by their
numerical index to prepare the file. Then I iterated over each line in the
file, and added the Git note. Since the <code>git note add</code> command works on the
current HEAD, I needed to checkout each commit in turn and then add the note:</p>
<div><pre>git checkout -q &lt;hash&gt; &amp;&amp; git notes --ref refs/notes/branch add -m branch:&lt;branch&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>I could then use <code>git push --all</code> to push to GitHub.</p>
<h4 id="code-migration-2-prepare-the-branches">Code migration 2: prepare the branches<a href="#code-migration-2-prepare-the-branches" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>PyPy has almost 500 open branches. The code migration created all the branch
HEADs, but <code>git push --all</code> did not push them. I needed to check them out and
push each one. So I created a file with all the branch names</p>
<div><pre>cd pypy-hg; hg branches | cut -f1 -d" " &gt; branches.txt
</pre></div>

<p>and then push each one to the GitHub repo</p>
<div><pre><span>while</span><span> </span><span>read</span><span> </span><span>branch</span><span>; do git checkout branches/$branch &amp;&amp; git push origin branches/$branch; done &lt; branches.txt</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Note that the branches were named <code>branches/XXX</code> by the migration, not <code>branch/XXX</code>. This confuses the merge request migration, more about that later.</p>
<h4 id="issue-and-merge-request-migration">Issue and merge request migration<a href="#issue-and-merge-request-migration" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>I used the solution from
<a href="https://github.com/piceaTech/node-gitlab-2-github">node-gitlab-2-github</a> which
worked almost perfectly. It is important to do the conversion on a <strong>private
repo</strong> otherwise every mention of a sucessfully mapped user name notifies
the user about the transfer. This can be quite annoying for a repo the size of
PyPy with 600 merge requests and over 4000 issues. Issues transfered without a
problem: the script properly retained the issue numbers. However the script
does not convert the Mercurial hashes to Git hashes, so the bare hashes in
comments show up without a link to the commit. Merge requests are more of a problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Mercurial named branch "disappears" once it is merged, so a merge request
  to a merged branch does not find the target branch name in Git. The
  conversion creates an issue instead with the label <code>gitlab merge request</code>.</li>
<li>For some reason, the branches created by <code>git-remote-hg</code> are called
  <code>branches/XXX</code> and not <code>branch/XXX</code> as expected by GitLab. This messes up the
  merge request/PR conversion. For some of the branches (open PRs and main
  target branches) I manually created additional branches without the <code>es</code>. The
  net result is that open merge requests became open PRs, merged merge requests
  became issues, and closed-not-merged merge requests were not migrated.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="layered-conversions">Layered conversions<a href="#layered-conversions" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>PyPy already migrated once from Bitbucket to Heptapod. Many of the issues
reflect the multiple transitions: they have lines like "Created originally on
Bitbucket by XXX" from the first transition, and an additional line "In
Heptapod" from this transition.</p>
<h3 id="credits">Credits<a href="#credits" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We would like to express our gratitude to the <a href="https://octobus.net/">Octobus</a>
team who support Heptapod. The transition from Bitbucket was quite an effort,
and they have generously hosted our developement since then. We wish them all
the best, and still believe that Mercurial should have "won".</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps<a href="#next-steps" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>While the repo at GitHub is live, there are still a few more things we need to
do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation needs an update for the new repo and the build automation from
  readthedocs must be adjusted.</li>
<li>The wiki should be copied from Heptapod.</li>
<li>buildbot.pypy.org should also look at the new repo. I hope the code is up to
  the task of interacting with a Git repo.</li>
<li>speed.pypy.org tracks changes, it too needs to reference the new location</li>
<li>To keep tracking branches with Git notes on new commits, I activated a
  <a href="https://github.com/Julian/named-branch-action">github action</a> by Julian to
  add a Git branch note to each commit. Please see the README there for
  directions on using Git notes.</li>
<li>Some of the merge requests were not migrated. If someone wants to, they could
  migrate those once they figure out the branch naming problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, now is the time for all of you to prove the move is worthwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>Star the repo, let others know how to find it,</li>
<li>Help fix some of the open issues or file new ones,</li>
<li>Take advantage of the more familiar workflow to get involved in the project,</li>
<li>Suggest ways to improve the migration: are there things I missed or could
  have done better?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-will-development-change">How will development change?<a href="#how-will-development-change" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Heptapod did not allow personal forks, so we were generous with a commit bit to
the main repo. Additionally, we (well, me) have been using a
commit-directly-to-main workflow. We will now be adopting a more structured
workflow. Please fork the repo and submit a pull request for any changes. We
can now add some pre-merge CI to check that the PR at least passes the first
stage of translation. The live and active branches will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>main</code>: what was "default" in Mercurial, it is the Python2.7 interpreter and
  the base of the RPython interpreter,</li>
<li>
<code>py3.9</code>: the Python3.9 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes
  from <code>main</code>. This is exactly like on Mercurial, and</li>
<li>
<code>py3.10</code>: the Python3.10 interpreter, which also includes all RPython changes
  from <code>main</code> and all bugfixes from <code>py3.9</code>. This is exactly like on Mercurial.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="working-between-the-repos">Working between the repos<a href="#working-between-the-repos" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<h5 id="finding-commits">Finding commits<a href="#finding-commits" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you want to figure out how a Mercurial commit relates to a Git commit, you
can use <code>git-hg-helper</code>. You run it in the Git repo. It takes the full long
hash from one repo and gives you the corresponding hash of the other repo:</p>
<div><pre>$<span> </span>git-hg-helper<span> </span>git-rev<span> </span>d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df

d64027c4c2b903403ceeef2c301f5132454491df
</pre></div>

<h5 id="finding-branches">Finding branches<a href="#finding-branches" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h5>
<p>Branches migrated from Mercurial will have a <code>branches</code> prefix, not <code>branch</code>.
While GitLab uses <code>branch</code> for its prefix, the <code>git-remote-hg</code> script uses
<code>branches</code>. New work should be in a PR targeting <code>main</code>, <code>py3.9</code> or <code>py3.10</code>.</p>
<p>Thanks for helping to make PyPy better.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This book aims to provide an introduction to the topic of deep learning algorithms. We review essential components of deep learning algorithms in full mathematical detail including different artificial neural network (ANN) architectures (such as fully-connected feedforward ANNs, convolutional ANNs, recurrent ANNs, residual ANNs, and ANNs with batch normalization) and different optimization algorithms (such as the basic stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, accelerated methods, and adaptive methods). We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods. We hope that this book will be useful for students and scientists who do not yet have any background in deep learning at all and would like to gain a solid foundation as well as for practitioners who would like to obtain a firmer mathematical understanding of the objects and methods considered in deep learning.

<h2>2024's public domain is a banger (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/20/em-oh-you-ess-ee/#sexytimes">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>They stole something from you. For decades, they stole it. That thing they stole? Your entire culture. For all of human history, works created in living memory entered the public domain every year. 40 years ago, that stopped.</p>
<p>First in 1976, and then again in 1998, Congress retroactively extended copyright's duration by 20 years, for all works, including works whose authors were unknown and long dead, whose proper successors could not be located. Many of these authors were permanently erased from history as every known copy of their works disappeared before they could be brought back into our culture through reproduction, adaptation and re-use (copyright is "strict liability," meaning that even if you pay to clear the rights to a work from someone who has good reason to believe they control those rights, if they're wrong, you are on the hook as an infringer, and the statutory damages run to six figures).</p>
<p>Works that are still in our cultural currents 50 or 70 or 90 years after their creation are an infinitesimal fraction of all the works we create as a species. But these works are – by definition – extraordinarily important to our culture. The creators who made these works were able to plunder a rich public domain of still-current works as inputs to their own enduring creations. The slow-motion arson attack on the public domain meant that two generations of creators were denied the public domain that every other creator in the history of the human race had enjoyed.</p>
<p>As 2019 drew nearer, the copyright resistance who had fought over this grew nervous, then…elated. Was Congress actually going to heed the evidence of a decades-long failed experiment and decline to extend copyright again?</p>

<p>I had pitched email debates with comrades over this. Michael S Hart, visionary founder of the Project Gutenberg, was <em>certain</em> it wouldn't happen (he didn't live to see it). But then, miraculously, astoundingly, 2019 rolled around and <em>we got new works in the public domain</em>!</p>
<p><a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/">https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2019/</a></p>
<p>For decades, Jennifer Jenkins from the Duke Center for the Study of the Public Domain published an annual lament for the public domain works we <em>weren't</em> getting that year. Jenkins painstakingly catalogued the materials that the public would be denied, though their creators had been only too happy to release them with the belief that the copyright would be 40 years shorter than it turned out.</p>
<p>Starting in 2019, those laments turned into celebrations, starter pistols for a generation of creators discovering a living public domain for the first time since the <em>Carter administration</em>. The 1923 works that entered the public domain in 2019 were mostly curiosities, but with each successive year, the public domain's new arrivals get ever more vibrant.</p>
<p>The public domain shipment that arrived on January 1, 2023 was a <em>banger</em>: we got some Virginia Woolf, some Hemingway, some Kafka, some Faulkner, some Agatha Christie and Edith Wharton, as well as Proust and Hesse:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/20/free-for-2023/#oy-canada">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/20/free-for-2023/#oy-canada</a></p>
<p>All of Sherlock Holmes came home to the public domain last year. We also got "Ol' Man River," "Puttin' On the Ritz" and "Mississippi Mud."</p>
<p>What we didn't get 2023? Sound recordings. The Music Modernization Act froze all sound recordings in copyright until 2024 – that is, until 11 days hence.</p>
<p>Those old 78RPM recordings exist in an odd superposition. On the one hand, they have real cultural value and bring great joy to many listeners. On the other hand, they produce either zero (in the case of out-of-print recordings) or very little revenue for labels.</p>
<p>The Internet Archive, a public library, has preserved over 400,000 of these recordings through its Great 78 Project. Like every library with a sound recording collection, the Archive lends out access to these recordings to people with library cards:</p>
<p><a href="https://great78.archive.org/">https://great78.archive.org/</a></p>
<p>But the record industry has decided to attack the library and its founder. In a lawsuit that could shut down the Internet Archive and bankrupt its founder, they claim that internet-based libraries can't do what their physical counterparts have done since literal time immemorial:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/14/internet-archive-responds-to-recording-industry-lawsuit-targeting-obsolete-media/">https://blog.archive.org/2023/08/14/internet-archive-responds-to-recording-industry-lawsuit-targeting-obsolete-media/</a></p>
<p>The Big Three labels (Universal, Sony and Warner) who bought out all their rivals until three companies ended up owning <em>70%</em> of all in-copyright sound recordings do not take seriously their responsibility to preserve the recording history they bought and now would exercise eternal dominance over. Even as they attack independent efforts to preserve our culture, they fail grotesquely to preserve it on their own:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/universal-fire-master-recordings.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/magazine/universal-fire-master-recordings.html</a></p>
<p>January 1 won't change any of that: come this year's public domain day, the record labels will still own the vast majority of all the music in the world, and they'll still be indifferently preserving it, and they'll still be trying to kill the Internet Archive and the Wayback Machine, and they'll still be trying to eviscerate Brewster Kahle.</p>
<p>But at least we'll get some music in the public domain again this year. Indeed, this year's public domain is shaping up to be an even bigger banger than 2023:</p>
<p><a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2024/">https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/publicdomainday/2024/</a></p>
<p>The majority of works entering the public domain this year are from 1928, six years before the Hays Code – a regime of self-censorship overseen by the motion picture cartel that banned sex, radical politics, queerness, and everything else good in this world for generations – came into effect. 1928 was the year that the "Magna Charta" of the movie cartel was adopted – a set of voluntary guidelines that were roundly ignored by the studios:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code#Pre-Code:_%22Don'ts%22_and_%22Be_Carefuls%22,_as_proposed_in_1927">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hays_Code#Pre-Code:_%22Don'ts%22_and_%22Be_Carefuls%22,_as_proposed_in_1927</a></p>
<p>The late 1920s were <em>super horny</em>. This year's public domain time-capsule from 1928 includes DH Lawrence's <em>Lady Chatterley's Lover</em>, Cole Porter's <em>Let's Do It</em>, Virginia Woolf's <em>Orlando</em>, Khan and Donaldson's <em>Makin' Whoopee</em>, and, horniest of all, Milne's <em>House at Pooh Corner</em>, featuring the first appearance of literature's greatest perennial sex-pest: Tigger.</p>
<p>Getting all this sexy stuff from 1928 in 2024 – when panicked bigots are waging war on sex in popular culture – is <em>quite</em> timely. These pietist prigs keep acting like sex in popular culture, "where the children can see it," was invented five years ago by Scholastic editors with purple hair, neopronouns and septum piercings. Earth to Moms For Liberty: the "good old days," free from sex in culture, ended 2 billion years ago when horny eukaryotes invented fucking.</p>
<p>But 1928 wasn't <em>all</em> flappers doing the horizontal Charleston with college men in the backs of jalopies. Our newly liberated cultural forebears found time to create the Marx Brothers' <em>Animal Crackers</em>, Brecht's <em>Threepenny Opera</em> (including <em>Mack the Knife</em>), and Agatha Christie's <em>The Mystery of the Blue Train</em>.</p>
<p>WEB Dubois's <em>Dark Princess</em> comes home to the public domain on Jan 1. So do Robert Frost's <em>West-Running Brook</em> and Buster Keaton's <em>The Cameraman</em>. We're getting Charlie Chaplin's <em>The Circus</em> and Leni's <em>The Man Who Laughs</em>, which Bob Kane plundered to create The Joker. You can record <em>Sonny Boy</em>, <em>I Can't Give You Anything But Love</em> or <em>I Wanna Be Loved By You</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to all the compositions entering the public domain in a few days, there's the first shipment of recordings in two years: the Charleston, <em>Yes, We Have No Bananas</em>, and Satchmo singing with King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band on <em>Dipper Mouth Blues</em> and <em>Froggie More</em>.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy: the works of MC Escher are starting to enter the public domain. The records are fragmentary, but <em>Tower Of Babel</em> is yours for the taking on Jan 1 (this is especially satisfying given that the estate is a noteworthy bully that has sent me baseless threats).</p>
<p>There's a lot of other visual art that may be entering the public domain in 2024, but because the registration records are so poorly organized, it's hard to tell. A lot of that art may not have been registered or renewed, and already be in the public domain. 80% of the books published between 1924 and 1963 are in the public domain on this basis!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crummy.com/2019/07/22/0">https://www.crummy.com/2019/07/22/0</a></p>
<p>Among those works that are Secretly Public Domain? HP Lovecraft's <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>, which has been public domain since <em>1956</em> (the Lovecraft estate is another one of those bullying monsters who will be put out of business soon, thanks to the reawakened public domain).</p>
<p>The main event, of course, is Mickey Mouse, who enters the public domain along with his first two short cartoon appearances: <em>Plane Crazy</em> and <em>Steamboat Willie</em>. Though there's been a lot of FUD about trademark keeping Mickey out of the public domain, it's a lie. He's all yours (mostly):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey">https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/15/mouse-liberation-front/#free-mickey</a></p>
<p>It's wonderful to see the public domain growing again, but spare a thought for the orphan works whose copyright caging outlasted the works themselves. This year saw several silent films entering the public domain – but some of those films no longer exist in their entirety, or at all. They were set afire in the slow-motion arson attack on our culture the monopolistic entertainment industry began 40+ years ago.</p>
<p>Today, the world's worst people remain in charge of that culture, and they're still destroying it. David Zaslav, the loathsome villain of this year's writers' strike and actors' strike, has pioneered the permanent erasure of beloved movies and TV shows as a cheap way of getting tax credits for the bloated post-merger behemoth of that is Discovery-Warner:</p>
<p><a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2023/04/warner-bros-under-fire-for-destroying-history-af1/">https://insidethemagic.net/2023/04/warner-bros-under-fire-for-destroying-history-af1/</a></p>
<p>The purpose of a system is what it does. It's not that the media execs who demanded copyright extensions in the seventies and nineties failed to foresee that this was a mass cultural extinction event. It's that they didn't care. David Zaslav burning down his own company's vault is part of a multigenerational tradition in his industry. Those media execs know <em>exactly</em> what they're doing. They just don't care.</p>

<p>Text is <em>the</em> medium of digital interaction, and text rendering has an outsized impact on the overall fit and finish of any system. It therefore
pains me that axle has for years relied on a low-resolution 8x8 bitmap font. Let’s fix it!</p>
<p>Take a look at the characters composing this sentence. Note the curves, the negative space, the use of size and distance.</p>
<p>If you’ve got a magnifying glass handy, you can even see how ‘black-on-white’ text uses many shades of gray to make the text smoother on the eyes. I’ll show you:</p>

<p>Font rendering comes down to telling the computer which pixels should be on or off, which should be darkened slightly for effect and which should let the background shine through.</p>
<p>The challenge comes from describing this to the computer in a way that’s <em>efficient</em> and <em>resizable</em>. Fonts shouldn’t take up too much storage, and we should be able to scale a font to any size the user requests while preserving the character✱ of the font design. Perhaps most importantly, we’ll want to satisfy these constraints while also making the text pleasant to read.</p>

<h2 id="minimalist-text-renderer">Minimalist Text Renderer</h2>
<p>Let’s do away with all of these requirements for now, and start off with the simplest viable approach to rendering characters. How might we go about coloring pixels into text?</p>
<p>Firstly, we’ll select a fixed size for each character. We’ll agree that every character will be exactly 8 pixels wide and 8 pixels high. That gives us a grid of 64 pixels per character to work with.</p>
<p>We can use a simple data format that describes whether each pixel in our 8x8 grid should be on (colored with the font color) or off (retain the background color). We can draw out our character grid like so:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</span></span><span><span>_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since we’ve got 8 pixels in each row, and each pixel has two states, it’s natural to store each row in our grid as one byte. For example, we could represent a capital <code>A</code> using a representation like the following:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>Byte 1: 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 2: 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 3: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 4: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 5: 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 6: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 7: 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0
</span></span><span><span>Byte 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</span></span></code></pre></div>
<div>
<figure><img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/highlighted_bitmap3.png" width="30%">
</figure>
</div>
<p>This is equivalent to the following hexadecimal representation:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="text"><span><span>Byte 1: 0x0c
</span></span><span><span>Byte 2: 0x1e
</span></span><span><span>Byte 3: 0x33
</span></span><span><span>Byte 4: 0x33
</span></span><span><span>Byte 5: 0x3f
</span></span><span><span>Byte 6: 0x33
</span></span><span><span>Byte 7: 0x33
</span></span><span><span>Byte 8: 0x00</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>… and allows us to very efficiently store render maps for ASCII:</p>

<p>This is quite a tidy encoding! To render a character, we can directly look up its render map using its ASCII representation:</p>

<p>Believe it or not, that’s it. axle has been using the above font rendering technique for the better part of a decade.</p>
<figure><img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/old_desktop.png" width="100%">
</figure>
<p>Although the font above only natively provides 8px bitmaps, it’s pretty easy to scale it to any size we like. However, the font will always appear jagged and low-resolution.</p>
<figure><img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/old_desktop_closeup.png" width="100%">
</figure>
<p>While the 8x8 bitmap font <em>works</em>, it sure isn’t pretty, and it’s quite limited: we can only use whatever font we’re willing to encode into this little 8x8 grid, and
we’re unable to use any of the many fonts available online and in the public domain. Additionally, our 8x8 grid doesn’t give us much of a good way to describe curves, which are essential in some fonts (check out this <code>a</code>!).</p>
<p>Most importantly, writing a new font renderer sounds like fun.</p>
<h2 id="truetype">TrueType</h2>
<p>For the next leap in our text rendering journey, we turn to TrueType: the de facto standard for encoding and distributing fonts. Unlike our humble 8x8 bitmaps, TrueType fonts are distributed as structured binary files (<code>.ttf</code>). We’ll need to parse these files and render their data into pixels.</p>
<p>There’s few things in this world I love more than taking an opaque binary and gradually uncovering the organization that was present all along. Dissecting the underlying and general structure of a binary is as gratifying as anything I can imagine.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/">TrueType specification</a> gives a great introduction to the problem space (I highly recommend the overviews in <code>Digitizing Letterforms</code> and especially <code>Instructing Fonts</code>), but it doesn’t give much in the way of signposting “start parsing here”. I’ll save you the trouble.</p>
<p>TTFs are structured somewhat similarly to Mach-Os. This is quite a nice surprise, because I’ve spent <a href="https://github.com/datatheorem/strongarm/">a lot of time parsing Mach-Os</a>! Both file formats were developed at Apple✱ around the same time, so I suppose they had some design points in the air.</p>
<div>

<p>
I don’t know all the history here. Please feel welcome to correct me if I’ve got this wrong!
</p>
</div>
<p>TTFs and Mach-Os are both largely structured around a flat series of sections, each of which is described by a table of contents at the beginning of the file. In the case of TTFs, each of these sections will contain some metadata or other that we’ll need over the course of rendering the font.</p>
<figure><img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/macho_ttf_comparison.png" width="100%">
</figure>
<p>Before taking a look at these sections becomes fruitful, though, we need to know the fundamental process for describing fonts used by TrueType. The specification does a great job, so I’ll keep myself brief.</p>
<p>The collection of lines and curves used to visually represent a particular letter is referred to as a <em>glyph</em>. As an example, the glyph for <code>b</code> consists of a vertical line and a semicircle.</p>
<p>Without further information, though, our renderer won’t know <em>which</em> glyph represents each character. We’ll need some additional metadata to convert from a character within a <em>character map</em> (such as ASCII or Unicode) to the <em>glyph</em> that a particular font is using to visually represent that character. The job of the TTF is dually to describe how to draw all the glyphs represented by the font, and to describe the correspondence between the character map and these glyphs.</p>
<p>TrueType describes how to draw each glyph by listing a series of points, which collectively compose the <em>outline</em> of each glyph. It’s up to the renderer to connect these points into lines, to turn these lines into curves, and to ‘color inside the lines’ as appropriate. There’s more nuance here, but that’s the bare bones.</p>

Describing and filling closed polygons was missing from axle’s Rust-based graphics stack until the TrueType renderer gave me a reason. It’s implemented <a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/blob/paging-demo/rust_programs/agx_definitions/src/lib.rs#L1554-L1723">here</a>.
</p>
</div>
<p>My first implementation of this renderer didn’t draw any curves, but instead directly connected the points with straight lines. My colleague Amos <a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/pull/47">implemented</a> the ability for the renderer to interpolate the glyph outline along the curves described in the font, which really improved the look of things. Thanks, Amos!</p>

<h2 id="tangled-text-tables">Tangled Text Tables</h2>
<p>Each section in the TTF is identified by a 4-character ASCII name. Different sections in the TTF contain different important metadata, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>glyf</code>: The set of points for each glyph outline in the font (most important!)</li>
<li><code>hmtx</code>:✱ Spacing information, i.e. how far to advance the cursor after drawing each glyph</li>
<li><code>cmap</code>: The correspondence of Unicode✱ codepoints to glyph indexes</li>
</ul>
<div>

<p>
<code>hmtx</code> just gives the <em>horizontal metrics</em>. <code>vmtx</code> gives the metrics for the vertical direction as well.
</p>
</div>
<div>

<p>
I’m simplifying here. TTFs can contain several ‘character maps’ covering many encoding schemes, including several versions of Unicode (such as Unicode v1, Unicode v2, Unicode v2 with <em>just</em> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_(Unicode)#Basic_Multilingual_Plane">basic multilingual plane</a>, etc.). The data within the <code>cmap</code> section will specify which character maps are available, and it’s up to the parser to select whichever character map is convenient.
</p>
</div>
<p>Each of these sections contains a bunch of structured data describing their contents. Here, our first mini challenge presents itself. TTF was designed in an era in which neither RAM nor core cycles were cheap. Therefore, the designers of the format made sure it’d be as easy as possible for the renderer to complete its work. To this end, they offloaded two responsibilities to the font file itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient data structures that the renderer can walk to retrieve info (for example, lookup tables to map a character code to a glyph index)</li>
<li>Pre-computation of some values used during lookup (for example, scaling parameters for binary searching a character map)</li>
</ul>
<p>These optimizations aren’t so relevant today, but we’ll need to work with them nonetheless. The first one is particularly important: TTF is designed to be <em>loaded directly into memory</em> and read by the renderer <em>in-place</em>, without the renderer populating its own intermediary data structures. Inexplicably, though, the TTF stores all fields in big endian, so we’ll definitely have to do some work on our end before we can read any sane values out of font structures.</p>
<p>To be able to define and read from these font structures with minimal boilerplate and repetition, I set things up such that I could wrap any font structure fields in <code>BigEndianValue</code>. After I call <code>.into()</code>, everything is done and dusted and I can move on with my day. A little bit of structure definition upfront for some easy breezy parsing code down the line!</p>

<p>Oh yeah! We can parse our high-level, byte-order-corrected representation directly from the TTF memory without even needing to <em>mention</em> the raw TTF representation at the call-site. I’ll call that a win.</p>
<h2 id="parser">Parser</h2>
<p>Handy APIs in hand, we’ll parse all the section descriptions at the start of the file.</p>
<p>The <code>head</code> section (or <em>table</em>, as TTF prefers) stores some important metadata about the font as a whole. We know that TTF describes glyph outlines via a series of connected points. But if we see a point like <code>(371, 205)</code>, without further information we don’t have a reference point for understanding where this sits visually. The <code>head</code> table gives us such a reference point, by describing the <code>glyph_bounding_box</code> that all points sit within.</p>
<p>Next up, we’ll want to <a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/blob/paging-demo/rust_programs/ttf_renderer/src/character_map.rs#L224">parse a character map</a> to find out how we’ll correspond encoded characters to glyph indexes. Each character map will also be described in an <a href="https://github.com/codyd51/axle/blob/paging-demo/rust_programs/ttf_renderer/src/character_map.rs#L340-L357">extremely gnarly format</a> that the parser will need to know how to read.</p>
<p>And now the exciting bit: parsing glyphs! The <code>maxp</code> table will give us some metadata on how many glyphs the font contains, while the glyph data itself is stored in <code>glyf</code>.</p>
<p>Before we can parse each <code>glyf</code> entry, we’ll need to know where each entry begins. The <code>loca</code> table will give us these offsets. However, nowhere is the <em>size</em> of each glyph’s data given explicitly in the font. Instead, the size of each glyph’s data is implicitly given by the difference with the starting offset of the <em>next</em> glyph.</p>
<p>The intrepid font parser will quickly notice that some glyph descriptions appear to have <em>no</em> size. This is intentional: some glyphs, such as the one corresponding to the space character, have no visible manifestation aside from the negative space they occupy. When the renderer tries to draw one of these zero-sized glyphs, we’ll just advance the cursor based on the corresponding <code>htmx</code> size for this glyph.</p>
<p>We’ve actually got three distinct types of glyphs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Polygon</em> glyphs
<ul>
<li>These glyphs are the classic case, an ordered connection of edge points and control points that should be connected in a series of curves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Blank</em> glyphs
<ul>
<li>Special case for glyphs such as those corresponding to the space character.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Compound</em> glyphs
<ul>
<li>Glyphs manufactured by combining and scaling other glyphs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The third category is really interesting! The glyphs for <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> both share an identical dot on top, and there’s no need to duplicate its description in the draw instructions. Instead, we can just say that <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are each composed of a couple of glyph fragments laid out on the canvas at specific scales and positions.</p>
<figure><img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/compound_glyphs.png" width="100%">
</figure>
<p>There are all sorts of counterintuitive edge cases with compound glyphs. As an example, we know that traditional polygon glyphs specify how far the cursor should advance after drawing them via corresponding entries in the <code>hmtx</code> and <code>vmtx</code> tables. However, how far should the cursor advance for a compound glyph? Sometimes the compound glyph has its own metrics table entries, and sometimes the compound glyph is annotated with a special flag indicating that it should take its cursor advance metrics from a specific child glyph.</p>

<p>Compound glyphs don’t always directly contain polygon glyphs. Instead, a compound glyph can be composed of a tree of other compound glyphs, all stretched and scaled and repositioned across the bounding box.</p>
<h2 id="hinting">Hinting</h2>
<p>TrueType famously defines a hinting VM that’s intended to help retain the essence of a font when rendering at low resolutions to a limited pixel grid. The job of the program running under this VM is to nudge the glyph’s control points into a specific layout on low-resolution bitmaps✱.</p>
<div>

<p>
There’s an interesting inversion here. The job of this hinting program is to <em>keep</em> the visual appeal of the font, but it accomplishes this by <em>intentionally distorting</em> the proportions of each glyph.
</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s say you’re trying to scale down a glyph’s points to fit on a small grid. If the render resolution isn’t exactly divisible by the glyph’s point spacing, you’re going to get scaling artifacts when you round each glyph point to a pixel.</p>

</th>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The font can embed a little program that, when executed, nudges the glyph’s layout points to better represent the glyph within the available grid.</p>

<p>Our renderer will need to implement this VM, which is always a fun endeavor.</p>
<p>The hinting VM is built around a standard (and incredibly satisfying) interpreter loop that modifies a virtual machine state based on the operations indicated by the byte stream:</p>

<h2 id="truetype-quirks">TrueType Quirks</h2>
<h3 id="occult-memorabilia">Occult Memorabilia</h3>
<p>The hinting VM is all about nudging the glyph’s outline points so that they look better on a small pixel grid. All of these points that actually compose a part of the glyph outline are in the ‘Glyph Zone’.</p>
<p>However, the VM designers realized that it was sometimes useful to have a point that wasn’t really part of the outline, but was just used as a reference when doing distance calculations. These points don’t belong in the Glyph Zone, so instead TrueType places them in a different space called… the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/RM05/Chap5.html#SZP0">Twilight Zone</a>.</p>
<p>The TrueType designers were clearly fans of the paranormal. TrueType provides convenient support for describing emboldened and italicized versions of fonts by embedding offsets to apply to each point in a glyph outline. A font variation might need the entire bounding box of a glyph to be modified too, so there are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/tt_instructing_glyphs#phantom-points">‘phantom points’</a> corresponding to the corners of the bounding box that can be stretched and squeezed.</p>
<h3 id="implied-control-points">Implied Control Points</h3>
<p>The TrueType specification suggests to the reader, hey! Maybe it’d be possible to save space by letting the renderer deduce missing control points?</p>
<img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/implied_on_curve_points.png">
<p>Despite the casual tone of observation, renderers are actually required to support this. Fonts rely on this all the time! This is the only mention of it in the whole spec! Everyone needs to detect and insert implied control points, all on the back of one introductory diagram.</p>
<h3 id="hint-assume-nothing">Hint: Assume Nothing</h3>
<p>Like we’ve seen, TrueType has sophisticated support for manipulating the rendering process in constrained font sizes. But like any good programming environment, it also provides lots of escape hatches. One such escape hatch is the <code>bloc</code> table, which essentially says “if the font size is too small, ignore the glyph curves and hinting programs and just render these tiny bitmaps instead.”</p>
<h2 id="firming-up-a-renderer">Firming Up a Renderer</h2>
<p>There’s still work to do to integrate this font renderer neatly in all the stacks that wind up displaying text on axle’s desktop, but the foundations are ready. Here’s what things looked like the last time I worked on propagating TrueType throughout the desktop.</p>
<p><img src="https://axleos.com/writing-a-truetype-font-renderer/log23.png">

<p>My wife and I decided to make an 8-bit, top-down, Zelda-like game written
for the <a href="https://github.com/15-466/15-466-f23-base1">PPU466</a>
(from <a href="http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-466-f23/">CMU 15-466 Computer Game Programming</a> course).
The PPU466 is a graphics API kind of like the <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>
fantasy console, in the sense that it’s restricted to 8-bit graphics,
4 colors per tile, fixed backgrounds, and a low number of sprites.</p>
<p>As a part of the game, I wanted our monsters to chase the player.
So I spent some time exploring and implementing different pathing techniques and
I wanted to share what I discovered, especially some fun A* tricks
not covered by Wikipedia.</p>
<div id="linear-pathing">
<h2>Linear Pathing</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the most basic pathing: draw
a straight line between the monster and the player
and have the monster go in that direction.</p>
<p><img src="https://timmastny.com/blog/a-star-tricks-for-videogame-path-finding/linear-basic.gif"></p>
<p>Everything is great until the monster hits a wall
and then it stops dead. You can fix this particular issue
with <strong>wall-sliding</strong>: instead of stopping when you hit a wall,
you move along the wall.</p>
<p><img src="https://timmastny.com/blog/a-star-tricks-for-videogame-path-finding/linear-wall-slide.gif"></p>
<p>This approach works surprisingly well for pathing,
but it really shines for player movement.
Nearly every game uses this technique for player movement
(and have since Pac-Man) because it makes movement controls more responsive
near walls and edges.
(Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ adds
sparks when the player wall-slides which is really cool)</p>
<p>One side-effect of wall-sliding in linear pathing is monster trapping:</p>
<p><img src="https://timmastny.com/blog/a-star-tricks-for-videogame-path-finding/linear-wall-slide-trap.gif"></p>
<p>This is not necessarily as bad as it looks. Many
games even use this as a feature, adding monster
trapping as a strategic element (e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Safespot">safespotting</a>
in Runescape).
But this isn’t what I wanted for our game, so I looked
into true path-finding algorithms.</p>
</div>
<div id="dijkstras-algorithm">
<h2>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</h2>
<p>This is the algorithm everyone learns in school.
It’s straightforward to implement and
it’s guaranteed to find the shortest path.
But the problem is that it does too much work:
for the starting node, it finds the shortest
path to every other node in the graph. You can
stop once you find your destination node,
but there’s no way to direct the algorithm
to make progress towards that node in particular.
And in a videogame, the monster’s destination
changes every frame as the player moves!
And really, the monster doesn’t even need the full
path: it just needs to know which direction to go.</p>
<p>You could pre-compute the shortest path for every
pixel or tile on your map, but that’s a lot of
memory.</p>
<p>So if you are designing your game to run on a legacy
or resource-constrained platform, Dijkstra’s isn’t
going to work.</p>
<p>Luckily there’s a better way.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-search-algorithm">
<h2>A* Search Algorithm</h2>
<p>Wikipedia has an in-depth overview of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">algorithm</a>
(and a really nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#/media/File:Weighted_A_star_with_eps_5.gif">animation</a>
showing how it works), so I’ll just share my intution
for how it works.</p>
<p>First, steps are weighted by the distance of the starting
node to the destination now. This means the algorithm
starts by trying to go in a straight line to the destination.
Unlike Dijkstra’s, it won’t waste a bunch of time going
in the opposite direction (unless it has to).</p>
<p>Second, if a wall is blocking the path, it will start
investigating nearby nodes to try to get around the wall.
And most importantly, it won’t get stuck:
like Dijkstra, it won’t revisit node’s it’s already seen,
so it will eventually find a way to get around the way,
even it has to backtrack a lot.</p>
<p>Here’s the algorithm in action:</p>
<p><img src="https://timmastny.com/blog/a-star-tricks-for-videogame-path-finding/a-star.gif"></p>
<p>Note that the monster does <em>not</em> get stuck behind the wall.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-tricks">
<h2>A* Tricks</h2>
<p>Here’s a few tricks to make the algorithm faster
and easier to implement.</p>
<div id="implicit-graph-data-structure">
<h3>Implicit Graph Data Structure</h3>
<p>In textbooks, graphs are represented by a list of nodes
and an adjacency matrix or adjacency list. But you can be
a little more flexible about representing adjacency nodes.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say our game screen has 256 * 240 pixels.
We’ll call the coordinates of each pixel a node. Then we can say
there are 8 adjacent pixels: up, down, left, right, and
the 4 diagonals. The cardinal directions have a weight of 1,
while the diagonals have a weight of the square root of 2 (~1.4).</p>
<p>We don’t need to create a huge adjacency list: we can
generate it on the fly. Moreover, not every pixel
is a valid position for the monster: it might be on a wall
or occupied by another sprite. In that case, we can
dynamically exclude that pixel from the adjacency list.</p>
<p>Here’s how this might look:</p>
<pre><code># suppose current is some data structure with x and y coordinates
neighbors = [current + dir for dir in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]]

for neighbor in neighbors:
    if out_of_bounds(neighbor) or occupied(neighbor):
        continue
    # do something with neighbor</code></pre>
<p>So we only need to generate the adjacency list for the nodes
we are actually going to visit, and we don’t have to manually
exclude adjacent nodes with a map editor.</p>
</div>
<div id="geometry-informed-heuristics">
<h3>Geometry Informed Heuristics</h3>
<p>You can also manually tune aspects of the algorithm
based on the geometry of your map.</p>
<div id="step-size">
<h4>Step size</h4>
<p>Above I talked about using the pixels as nodes, but in a 2d
tile based game, you can use the tiles as nodes. This speeds
up the search dramatically, since the monster can find a path
to the player in fewer iterations.</p>
<p>With this method, the path really isn’t an exact sequence of
steps: your monster likely isn’t moving at a speed of
1 tile per frame. Now the path is a series of <em>directions</em> the monster should go.<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>And that’s okay! As I said in the Dijkstra section,
our monster doesn’t actually care about the exact path,
which is changing each frame as the player moves. It just needs
to move in a direction that could possibly reach the player
(i.e.&nbsp;not straight into a wall).</p>
</div>
<div id="iteration-depth">
<h4>Iteration depth</h4>
<p>One cool feature about A*: once a node comes off
the priority queue, we know that that node represents
the last step in the best path we’ve seen so far.
Therefore, if we stopped the algorithm at some fixed number of
iterations, we would know that the resulting path
is our best guess for the shortest path to the destination.
So we can get reasonable progress without the running the algorithm
to completion.</p>
<p>You need to tune this maximum iteration depth to the geometry of the level.
For example, if the depth is too small you can still
have monsters get stuck behind a wall:</p>
<p><img src="https://timmastny.com/blog/a-star-tricks-for-videogame-path-finding/a-star-depth.gif"></p>
<p>With a fixed iteration depth of 30 tiles, we can position the player
so the monster gets traps and can’t make progress towards the player.
How does this happen? Remember that A* is recomputed each frame.
On the first frame once reaching the wall, the monster calculates that it should move down.
But on the next frame, it calculates that it should move up.
This casuses the monster to get stuck in a loop.
However, as soon as the player moves into it’s range,
the monster is able to correctly find a path to the player.</p>
<p>You can see this effect exaggerated with a fixed depth of <code>1</code>:</p>
<pre><code>   frame 1    frame 2

4
3     | .        | m
2   p | m      p | .
1     |          |
0</code></pre>
<p>The monster always returns to pxiel 2 because it’s the shortest
(Euclidean) distance to the player.</p>
<p>If you wanted to be really fancy, you could pre-compute
the maximum depth A* needs to find a path from any position
on the map.
Unlike the pre-computed Dijkstra, you only have to
save that maximum, since you know A* will find a valid path
in real time, given that maximum depth.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2024 17:46:35 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.7.0">https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/releases/tag/3.7.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38833609">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><p>This release of fish includes a number of improvements over fish 3.6.4, detailed below. Although work continues on the porting of fish internals to the Rust programming language, that work is not included in this release. fish 3.7.0 and any future releases in the 3.7 series remain C++ programs.</p>
<h2>Notable improvements and fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improvements to the history pager, including:
<ul>
<li>The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9476" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9476/hovercard">#9476</a>), so you can find a command line like <code>git log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0</code> by searching for <code>gitInt</code>.</li>
<li>Opening the history pager will now fill the search field with a search string if you’re already in a search (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10005" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10005/hovercard">#10005</a>). This makes it nicer to search something with <code>↑</code> and then later decide to switch to the full pager.</li>
<li>Closing the history pager with enter will now copy the search text to the commandline if there was no match, so you can continue editing the command you tried to find right away (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9934" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9934/hovercard">#9934</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Performance improvements for command completions and globbing, where supported by the operating system, especially on slow filesystems such as NFS (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9891" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9891/hovercard">#9891</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9931" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9931/hovercard">#9931</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10032" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10032/hovercard">#10032</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10052" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10052/hovercard">#10052</a>).</li>
<li>fish can now be configured to wait a specified amount of time for a multi-key sequence to be completed,  instead of waiting indefinitely. For example, this makes binding <code>kj</code> to switching modes in vi mode possible.<br>
The timeout can be set via the new <code>fish_sequence_key_delay_ms</code> variable (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7401" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7401/hovercard">#7401</a>), and may be set by default in future versions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Deprecations and removed features</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>LS_COLORS</code> is no longer set automatically by the <code>ls</code> function (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10080" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10080/hovercard">#10080</a>). Users<br>
that set <code>.dircolors</code> should manually import it using other means. Typically this would be <code>set -gx LS_COLORS (dircolors -c .dircolors | string split ' ')[3]</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Scripting improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Running <code>exit</code> with a negative number no longer crashes fish (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9659" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9659/hovercard">#9659</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish --command</code> will now return a non-zero status if parsing failed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9888" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9888/hovercard">#9888</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>jobs</code> builtin will now escape the commands it prints (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9808" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9808/hovercard">#9808</a>).</li>
<li><code>string repeat</code> no longer overflows if the count is a multiple of the chunk size (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9900" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9900/hovercard">#9900</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>builtin</code> builtin will now properly error out with invalid arguments instead of doing nothing and returning true (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9942" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9942/hovercard">#9942</a>).</li>
<li><code>command time</code> in a pipeline is allowed again, as is <code>command and</code> and <code>command or</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9985" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9985/hovercard">#9985</a>).</li>
<li><code>exec</code> will now also apply variable overrides, so <code>FOO=bar exec</code> will now set <code>$FOO</code> correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9995" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9995/hovercard">#9995</a>).</li>
<li><code>umask</code> will now handle empty symbolic modes correctly, like <code>umask u=,g=rwx,o=</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10177" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10177/hovercard">#10177</a>).</li>
<li>Improved error messages for errors occurring in command substitutions (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10054" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10054/hovercard">#10054</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interactive improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>read</code> no longer enables bracketed paste so it doesn’t stay enabled in combined commandlines like <code>mysql -p(read --silent)</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8285" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8285/hovercard">#8285</a>).</li>
<li>Vi mode now uses <code>fish_cursor_external</code> to set the cursor shape for external commands (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4656" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4656/hovercard">#4656</a>).</li>
<li>Opening the history search in vi mode switches to insert mode correctly (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10141" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10141/hovercard">#10141</a>).</li>
<li>Vi mode cursor shaping is now enabled in iTerm2 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9698" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9698/hovercard">#9698</a>).</li>
<li>Working directory reporting is enabled for iTerm2 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9955/hovercard">#9955</a>).</li>
<li>Completing commands as root includes commands not owned by root, fixing a regression introduced in fish 3.2.0 (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9699" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9699/hovercard">#9699</a>).</li>
<li>Selection uses <code>fish_color_selection</code> for the foreground and background colors, as intended, rather than just the background (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9717" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9717/hovercard">#9717</a>).</li>
<li>The completion pager will no longer sometimes skip the last entry when moving through a long list (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9833" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9833/hovercard">#9833</a>).</li>
<li>The interactive <code>history delete</code> interface now allows specifying index ranges like “1..5” (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9736" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9736/hovercard">#9736</a>), and <code>history delete --exact</code> now properly saves the history (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10066" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10066/hovercard">#10066</a>).</li>
<li>Command completion will now call the stock <code>manpath</code> on macOS, instead of a potential Homebrew version. This prevents awkward error messages (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9817" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9817/hovercard">#9817</a>).</li>
<li>A new bind function <code>history-pager-delete</code>, bound to <code>Shift</code> + <code>Delete</code> by default, will delete the currently-selected history pager item from history (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9454" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9454/hovercard">#9454</a>).</li>
<li><code>fish_key_reader</code> will now use printable characters as-is, so pressing “ö” no longer leads to it telling you to bind <code>\\u00F6</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9986" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9986/hovercard">#9986</a>).</li>
<li><code>open</code> can be used to launch terminal programs again, as an <code>xdg-open</code> bug has been fixed and a workaround has been removed  (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10045" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10045/hovercard">#10045</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>repaint-mode</code> binding will now only move the cursor if there is repainting to be done. This fixes <code>Alt</code> combination bindings in vi mode (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7910" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7910/hovercard">#7910</a>).</li>
<li>A new <code>clear-screen</code> bind function is used for <code>Ctrl</code> + <code>l</code> by default. This clears the screen and repaints the existing prompt at first,<br>
so it eliminates visible flicker unless the terminal is very slow (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10044" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/10044/hovercard">#10044</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>alias</code> convenience function has better support for commands with unusual characters, like <code>+</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8720" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8720/hovercard">#8720</a>).</li>
<li>A longstanding issue where items in the pager would sometimes display without proper formatting has been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9617" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9617/hovercard">#9617</a>).</li>
<li>The <code>Alt</code> + <code>l</code> binding, which lists the directory of the token under the cursor, correctly expands tilde (<code>~</code>) to the home directory (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9954" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9954/hovercard">#9954</a>).</li>
<li>Various fish utilities that use an external pager will now try a selection of common pagers if the <code>PAGER</code> environment variable is not set, or write the output to the screen without a pager if there is not one available (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10074" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10074/hovercard">#10074</a>).</li>
<li>Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete <code>git add</code> for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707/hovercard">#3707</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Improved prompts</h3>
<ul>
<li>The default theme now only uses named colors, so it will track the terminal’s palette (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9913" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9913/hovercard">#9913</a>).</li>
<li>The Dracula theme has now been synced with upstream (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9807" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9807/hovercard">#9807</a>); use <code>fish_config</code> to re-apply it to pick up the changes.</li>
<li><code>fish_vcs_prompt</code> now also supports fossil (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9497" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9497/hovercard">#9497</a>).</li>
<li>Prompts which display the working directory using the <code>prompt_pwd</code> function correctly display directories beginning with dashes (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10169" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10169/hovercard">#10169</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Completions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added completions for:
<ul>
<li><code>age</code> and <code>age-keygen</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9813" data-hovercard-type="pull_request" data-hovercard-url="/fish-shell/fish-shell/pull/9813/hovercard">#9813</a>)</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/tf-logo-1.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/tf-logo-1.png" alt="" width="220" height="228" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20220%20228'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/tf-logo-1.png"></a>Any content creator who sees their work being used by unauthorized third-parties can file DMCA notices against platforms communicating that content to the public.</p>
<p>Platforms should respond by taking allegedly-infringing content down but in practice, some do and some don’t.</p>
<p>Full-blown pirate sites may not respond to notices at all for obvious reasons but some entirely legitimate platforms also refuse to comply in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>Google is one of those platforms and without the diligence of the Google Search team, at least 150 articles published on TorrentFreak.com would’ve been disappeared over the years due to bogus DMCA notices. We very much appreciate that first line of defense; since we don’t have to commit resources towards countering wrongful complaints, we can concentrate on our reporting.</p>
<p>To that end, today we can report that DMCA notices continued to be filed against us at Google, all of them demanding the deindexing of links to our news reports in Google search. We also received a few direct to us via email, more than usual in 2023. All complaints/takedown notices had something in common; 100% bogus, right across the board, and a complete waste of resources for everyone involved.</p>
<h2>New Year 2023: Peaceful for 19 Days</h2>
<p>By January 19, 2023, things were looking quite promising. No direct DMCA notices sent by email and no complaints sent to Google either, at least as far as we’re aware. On January 20, Google received a takedown demand to deindex from search results an article published <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/pikashow-police-arrest-student-after-free-piracy-app-drew-global-attention-230116/">just four days earlier</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the popularity of the software, we believed that the alleged operator of pirate app PikaShow being arrested in India was newsworthy. Sadly, India-based anti-piracy outfit Markscan (on behalf of Hotstar and/or rightsholder Novi Digital Entertainment Pvt. Ltd) decided that Google should deindex our work, as the <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/30378466?access_token=HN_HoyqgRLRTwoYm7GZRTw">notice on Lumen Database reveals</a>.</p>
<center><em>One of these is not like the others</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow.png" alt="dont show pikashow" width="650" height="349" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow.png 780w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20349'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow.png 780w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow-300x161.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/dont-show-pikashow.png"></a></center>
<p>Google’s transparency report indicates that the notice, which demanded the removal of 47 URLs, was <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/copyright/request/16623307">rejected in its entirety</a> but because we mentioned PikaShow by name, the takedown notices kept on coming.</p>
<p>On January 21, Markscan sent a <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/30397450?access_token=DzavFq_lRqnaF9wy1CYxYA">substantially similar DMCA takedown notice</a> to Google, this time on behalf of the Disney+ Hotstar “over-the-top streaming service owned by Novi Digital Entertainment of Disney Star and operated by Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution, both divisions of The Walt Disney Company.” </p>
<p>Once again, the complaint demanded the removal of our article. The next day, January 22, Novi Digital Entertainment tried its hand with a <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/30402098?access_token=JYkQJcNB9ev0QoiE0Vat5w">similar takedown notice</a> which targeted the same article once again. It enjoyed the same level of success as the first.</p>
<p>Inexplicably, on the very same day yet another anti-piracy company tried to remove exactly the same article but for different reasons. Working on behalf of Cricket Australia, India-based Copyright Integrity International <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/30402079?access_token=fLswfqHiknCornwJxqTF-Q">claimed our article</a> was in direct violation of its client’s rights in content relating to cricket matches of the KFC Big Bash League.</p>
<p>There were no violations, obviously, but in the cut-and-thrust world of bulk URL disappearance, no one sends notices demanding that content stays up.</p>
<h2>Writing About House of the Dragon Infringes Warner Bros’ Rights</h2>
<p>On October 22, 2022, we <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/house-of-the-dragon-season-finale-leaks-early-on-pirate-sites-221021/">reported</a> that the season finale of HBO’s “House of the Dragon” had leaked online, two days ahead of its official premiere. </p>
<p>After almost two weeks of DMCA silence following the PikaShow debacle, the calm was interrupted by a new complaint from Markscan. Alongside demands to take down links to House of the Dragon episodes and season packs on various pirate sites, <a href="https://lumendatabase.org/notices/30597136?access_token=2pjtoeJ3o-Z8NYkHEVzRSg">this notice</a> informed Google that our report on the months-old leak infringed Warner’s copyrights. It didn’t in any way.</p>
<p>And then, adding insult to injury, Hotstar sent another DMCA takedown notice to Google, this time targeting a <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/anti-piracy-outfits-target-torrentfreak-in-pikashow-crackdown-230212/">different article</a> that also mentioned PikaShow; or ƿᵻꝄɅ§ƕɵꟺ for those who don’t want to be targeted by bogus notices seemingly reliant on basic keyword searches.</p>
<h2>Hey DMCA Bot: ████ █████████ ███████ ██ ██████████</h2>
<p>When anti-piracy companies target a platform directly, Google’s diligence doesn’t enter the equation. Any DMCA notices received must be treated as legal documents and responses must be governed accordingly. On April 3, 2023, we received an email from Turkey-based anti-piracy outfit DigiGuardians Inc. and since the title contained the words ‘Copyright Claim’ we immediately gave it our full attention.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>This is a notice in accordance with the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act (OCILLA) a part of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 requesting the service providers to be held strictly liable for the acts of their users &amp; immediately cease the access to copyrighted material. We have found an infringing material in your website which indeed is our movie ‘Güneşin Kızları’ released worldwide in 2015</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The notice listed three URLs which needed to be “disabled immediately” along with a statement that the “information in the notification is accurate.” Unfortunately, we were unable to comply with the takedown demands because the URLs provided were not for TorrentFreak.com but an entirely different domain that we’d never heard of, under someone else’s control. </p>
<p>We aren’t publishing the domain name here since it’s flagged as malicious by several security vendors and blocked by a laundry list of DNS providers. What we can confirm is that graphics from TF were used on this bogus platform to make it look like a news site, albeit one with our logo, authors’ names, and sundry other pieces of information removed.</p>
<p>Sixty-two minutes after receiving the takedown notice, a detailed report containing all necessary information to show why the notice shouldn’t have been sent to us, was sent back to DigiGuardians. We even included a screenshot and explanatory text using the most sophisticated font available today. </p>
<center><em>Ruthlessly ignored artwork<a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF.png"><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF.png" alt="fake-TF" width="606" height="840" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF.png 606w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF-300x416.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 606px) 100vw, 606px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20606%20840'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF.png 606w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF-300x416.png 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/fake-TF.png"></a></em></center>
<p>We received no response to our detailed response addressing the bogus notice, which was also sent to a file-hosting platform that we’d never heard of, an email address listed in WHOIS records, and hosting company LeaseWeb, apparently.</p>
<h2>More DMCA Notices For Another Site</h2>
<p>On April 4, 2023, DigiGuardians sent another substantially similar DMCA takedown notice, with the domain name of the malicious site in the title, this time demanding the removal of 50 allegedly infringing URLs. Just seconds later we received yet another takedown notice demanding the removal of an additional 50 URLs, followed by another seconds after that containing a further 10 URLs.</p>
<p>“The information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed,” the complaints added, pointlessly.</p>
<p>Then in the middle of October, DigiGuardians unexpectedly reached out, indicating they were interested in working with us to publish news on products or services, that type of thing. Nothing wrong with that of course but since TorrentFreak is a news site, we politely declined and said we’d happily take a look at anything newsworthy, should anything come up. </p>
<p>We also asked about the problematic takedown notices and noted that we’d be grateful if someone could fix the problem. Hard to say with 100% certainty that a bot responded, but the text seemed to assume we were interested in the offer. Sadly, it mentioned nothing about the copyright claims.</p>
<h2>Give That Bot a Slap</h2>
<p>After largely forgetting about the earlier run of nuisance, erroneous notices, on December 14 we started receiving them again. This time we were instructed to remove five allegedly infringing URLs pointing to the movie ‘Muhteşem İkili’ but once again a fundamental problem got in the way.</p>
<p>The infringing URLs listed in the notice were for a completely different and new domain, also nothing to do with us. </p>
<p>On December 29, when we received not one but two ‘Copyright Claims’ demanding the removal of over 50 URLs on <em>someone else’s domain, after our communications about these issues were ignored yet again</em>, inclusion in today’s list of bogus takedown notices was sealed.</p>
<p>In closing, we must acknowledge that these companies face massive challenges in their line of work and as such, mistakes will inevitably get made. We’re not unsympathetic either but when the same mistakes get made over and over again against the same site, one that is more likely to mention these disasters in public than any other online today, you do start to wonder. </p>

Kind of...</h2></p></div><div><p>For anyone vaguely tuned in to the machinations of copyright law, this Public Domain Day (the day at the start of each year on which works enter the public domain) is an extra special one, for it <em>finally</em> sees the appearance of a certain mouse. That's right... Mickey is free! At least the particular iteration of Mickey that first graced our screens in Disney's 1928 film <i>Steamboat Willie</i>. And, at least in the United States, which sees works from 1928 enter the public domain today. </p></div><div><p>To appreciate the monumental nature of this one needs to understand a little about Disney Corporation's relationship to, and perverse effect on, copyright law in the United States — and so how symbolic Mickey has become in the fight to preserve the public domain. The story starts (or at least takes a significant turn) in 1998 with the passing of the Copyright Term Extension Act, which basically did what it says on the tin: extended copyrights for many thousands of works which otherwise would have entered the US public domain, including <i>Steamboat Willie</i> (and also <i>Plane Crazy</i>). While Disney wasn’t the only lobbyist involved, it was certainly one of the most prominent and its involvement earned the legislation the derisory moniker of “The Mickey Mouse Protection Act”. </p></div><div><p>The effect of this Act (and previous extending Acts, also involving Disney) has been devastating to the enlargement of the US public domain, locking up an enormous number of works for many decades, but… all things must pass, and so too the copyright on <em>Steamboat Willie</em>. So what does this mean? In a simple sense it means one can use the film as one wishes (in the US at least). And this relates also to the characters of Mickey and Minnie which star in the film, but with two important caveats: i) it’s only these particular versions of Minnie and Mickey (e.g. long arms, gloveless), later iterations are still under copyright; and ii) Disney still has the trademark, so you can’t reuse in a way which implies an affiliation with the company. For a more in-depth look at the issues involved here (including why aspects of the later Mickey iterations might also be fine to reuse), we highly recommend this <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/" target="_blank">great post by Jennifer Jenkins</a> from the Center for the Study of the Public Domain and also this <a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/" target="_blank">Twitter thread by Cory Doctorow</a>.</p></div><div><p><h2 id="what-else-will-join-the-public-domain-in-2024">What else will join the public domain in 2024?</h2></p></div><div><p>Due to differing copyright laws around the world, there is no one single public domain, but there are three main types of copyright term for historical works which cover most cases.

The book’s 120 plates display Blossfeldt’s remarkable photographs of plants – varieties from Equisetum hyemale (Winter Horsetail) to Tellima grandiflora (Fringe cups) — all captured in extraordinary detail, as if under the microscope, frozen into new forms almost beyond recognition. Using a relatively simple handmade camera, Blossfeldt achieved startling results — the plants becoming graphic, geometric. Blossfeldt’s work was quiet and unassuming, but it quickly aligned with the avant-gardes of Weimar Germany: from “New Vision” to “New Objectivity”. It provided a counterpart in the natural world to what others had attempted to achieve in the excess of the modern city: from the work of August Sander to László Moholy-Nagy. The critic Walter Benjamin was one of the first to review Blossfeldt’s book, claiming his fellow German had discovered the “optical unconscious”: that which was invisible to the naked eye, revealed retrospectively or technically through the apparatus of the camera.

The hand-lettered text, done by the author’s brother, tells the story of an elderly couple who live comfortably, but realize that they are very lonely. The wife wants a cat to love, so her husband sets off in search of a beautiful one to bring home to her. After travelling far away from home, he finds a hillside covered in “cats here, cats there, Cats and kittens everywhere. Hundreds of cats, thousands of cats, Millions and billions and trillions of cats...” This rhythmic phrase is repeated several other times throughout the story. Wanda Gag pioneered the double-page spread in this book. Writer and reviewer Anita Silvey explained, “She used both pages to move the story forward, putting them together with art that sweeps across the entire page spread: her favorite illustration fell in the center of the book - with the old man carrying cats against the rolling hills.” <i>Millions of Cats</i> is on the New York Public Library’s list of 100 Great Children’s Books.

E. B. Du Bois’s <i>Dark Princess</i></h3><p>In <i>Dark Princess</i> (1928), Du Bois, a prominent African American scholar and civil rights activist, delves into themes of race, identity, and international politics. The novel follows the journey of a young African prince, Matthew Towns, as he becomes involved in a political conspiracy to uplift the Black race worldwide. Du Bois explores internationalism and international racial solidarity, as well as corruption and violent radicalism within African-American culture. The book’s subtitle, <i>A Romance</i>, points to the narrative’s double valence. As Michèle Mendelssohn argues, “it is the story of a love affair, as well as the story of an ideological romance that challenges one of the United States’ most cherished ideas about itself, the notion that it is a land of progress and possibility for all. The love lost between the hero and the U. S. is the spur for the novel’s political reorientation.” Not well received when first published, the novel was criticized for its expression of eroticism as well as for what some critics thought was a failed attempt at social realism. Late in life, Du Bois described this as his favorite work.

It opened on 31 August 1928 at Berlin’s Theater am Schiffbauerdamm. The influential play is a satirical take on society, crime, and morality. Set in the grim underbelly of London, the narrative follows the antihero Macheath, known as Mack the Knife, and his exploits as a criminal. and i the process explores the corrupting influence of capitalism, the blurred lines between good and evil, and the nature of justice. With influences from jazz and German dance music, songs from The Threepenny Opera have been widely covered and become standards, most notably “Die Moritat von Mackie Messer” (“The Ballad of Mack the Knife”) and “Seeräuberjenny” (“Pirate Jenny”).

An unexpurgated edition was not published openly in the United Kingdom until 1960, when it was the subject of a watershed obscenity trial against the publisher Penguin Books, which won the case and quickly sold three million copies. The book was also banned for obscenity in the United States, Canada, Australia, India and Japan. The book soon became notorious for its story of the physical (and emotional) relationship between a working-class man and an upper-class woman, its explicit descriptions of sex and its use of then-unprintable profane words.

Produced in black and white by Walt Disney Studios, the cartoon is considered the debut of both Mickey and Minnie Mouse, although both characters appeared in a test screening of <i>Plane Crazy</i> several months earlier. <i>Steamboat Willie</i> is especially notable for being one of the first cartoons with synchronized sound, as well as one of the first cartoons to feature a fully post-produced soundtrack, which distinguished it from earlier sound cartoons. Music for Steamboat Willie was arranged by Wilfred Jackson and Bert Lewis, and it included the songs “Steamboat Bill”, a composition popularized by baritone Arthur Collins during the 1910s, and “Turkey in the Straw”, a composition popularized within minstrelsy during the 19th century. The film has received wide critical acclaim, not only for introducing one of the world’s most popular cartoon characters but also for its technical innovation. In 1994, members of the animation field voted *Steamboat Willie* 13th in the book The 50 Greatest Cartoons, which listed the greatest cartoons of all time. However, the film has been the center of a variety of controversies, notably regarding the 1998 Copyright Term Extension Act passed in the United States. It was close to entering the public domain in the U.S. several times: each time, copyright protection was extended. It could have entered the public domain in four different years: first in 1955, renewed to 1986, then to 2003 by the Copyright Act of 1976, and then to 2023 by the Copyright Term Extension Act (also known pejoratively as the “Mickey Mouse Protection Act”) of 1998. It has been claimed that these extensions were a response by Congress to extensive lobbying by The Walt Disney Company.

G. Wells’s <i>The Open Conspiracy</i></h3><p><i>The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution</i> was published in 1928 by H. G. Wells. Many of its ideas are anticipated in Wells’s 1926 novel <i>The World of William Clissold</i>. The book is, in Wells’s words, a “scheme to thrust forward and establish a human control over the destinies of life and liberate it from its present dangers, uncertainties and miseries.” It proposes that largely as the result of scientific progress, a common vision of a world “politically, socially and economically unified” is emerging among educated and influential people, and that this can be the basis of “a world revolution aiming at universal peace, welfare and happy activity” that can result in the establishment of a “world commonwealth”. This is to be achieved by “drawing together a proportion of all or nearly all the functional classes in contemporary communities in order to weave the beginnings of a world community out of their selection.” This will ultimately “be a world religion.” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Conspiracy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>)</p><hr><p><span>Already public domain in countries with a “life plus 70 years” and “life plus 50 years” copyright.</span></p></div></div><div id="side-by-side-10"><p><img src="https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/features/countdown/2024/radclyffe-hall.jpg?fit=max&amp;w=640&amp;h=1200" data-blursrc="https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/features/countdown/2024/radclyffe-hall.jpg?fit=max&amp;w=640&amp;h=1200&amp;blur=1500&amp;q=20" data-src="https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/features/countdown/2024/radclyffe-hall.jpg?fit=max&amp;w=640&amp;h=1200"><span>Scroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.</span></p><div><h3>Radclyffe Hall’s <i>The Well of Loneliness</i></h3><p><i>The Well of Loneliness</i> (1928) is a lesbian novel by British author Radclyffe Hall. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose “sexual inversion” (homosexuality) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an ambulance driver in World War I, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as typically suffered by “inverts”, with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays “inversion” as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: “Give us also the right to our existence”. Shortly after the book’s publication, it became the target of a campaign by James Douglas, editor of the Sunday Express. Douglas wrote that “I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel.” A British court judged it obscene because it defended “unnatural practices between women” and it would not be published again in England for another two decades. In the United States, the book survived legal challenges in New York state and in Customs Court. Publicity over the legal battles increased the visibility of lesbians in British and American culture, and for decades it was the best-known lesbian novel in English, and often the first source of information about lesbianism that young people could find.

This classic anti-war novel is a poignant and powerful depiction of the horrors of World War I. Narrated by the soldier Paul Bäumer, the story describes the German soldiers’ extreme physical and mental trauma during the war as well as the detachment from civilian life felt by many upon returning home from the war. Remarque’s writing is marked by its stark realism and emotional depth, conveying the futility and senselessness of war. The book and its sequel, <i>The Road Back</i> (1930), were among the books banned and burned in Nazi Germany. It sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print. Three film adaptations of the book have been made, each of which was lauded. The 1930 American adaptation, directed by Lewis Milestone, won two Academy Awards. The 1979 British-American adaptation, a television film by Delbert Mann, won a Golden Globe Award and an Emmy Award. The 2022 German adaptation, directed by Edward Berger, won four Academy Awards.

Prior to its publication, Sassoon’s reputation rested entirely on his poetry, mostly written during and about World War I. Only ten years after the war ended, after some experience of journalism, did he feel ready to branch out into prose. So uncertain was he of the wisdom of this move that he elected to publish <i>Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man</i> anonymously. It is a depiction of his early years presented in the form of an autobiographical novel, with false names being given to the central characters, including Sassoon himself, who appears as “George Sherston”. Sassoon was motivated to write the work by a war incident, when a fox was loose in the trenches and one of his friends shot and killed it, though it also draws heavily on his pre-war life, with riding and hunting being among the favourite pastimes of the author. Much of the material for the novel came from Sassoon’s own diaries and he said he was inspired by the work of Marcel Proust: “A few pages of Proust have made me wonder whether insignificant episodes aren’t the most significant”.

Based, in part, on Waugh’s schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House in north Wales, the book is a social satire that employs the author’s characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s. While the title is a contraction of Edward Gibbon’s <i>The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>, it also alludes  to the German philosopher Oswald Spengler’s <i>The Decline of the West</i> (1918–1922), which first appeared in an English translation in 1926 and which argued, among other things, that the rise of nations and cultures is inevitably followed by their eclipse. Waugh read both Gibbons and Spengler while writing the book. Indeed, Waugh’s satire is unambiguously hostile to much that was in vogue in the late 1920s, and “themes of cultural confusion, moral disorientation and social bedlam...both drive the novel forward and fuel its humour.”  Waugh himself stated in his ‘Author’s Note’ to the first edition: ‘Please bear in mind throughout that IT IS MEANT TO BE FUNNY.’ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_and_Fall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>)</p><hr><p><span>Already public domain in countries with a “life plus 50 years” copyright.</span></p><p><span>Read on <a href="https://gutenberg.ca/ebooks/waughe-declineandfall/waughe-declineandfall-00-h-dir/waughe-declineandfall-00-h.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Gutenberg</a></span></p></div></div><div id="side-by-side-15"><p><img src="https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/features/countdown/2024/joan-of-arc.jpg?fit=max&amp;w=640&amp;h=1200" data-blursrc="https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/features/countdown/2024/joan-of-arc.jpg?fit=max&amp;w=640&amp;h=1200&amp;blur=1500&amp;q=20" data-src="https://the-public-domain-review.imgix.net/features/countdown/2024/joan-of-arc.jpg?fit=max&amp;w=640&amp;h=1200"><span>Scroll through the whole page to download all images before printing.</span></p><div><h3><i>The Passion of Joan of Arc</i> directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer</h3><p><i>La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc</i> is a 1928 French silent historical film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc. The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema, especially for its production, Dreyer’s direction, and Falconetti’s performance, which is often listed as one of the finest in cinema history. Dreyer spent over a year researching Joan of Arc and the transcripts of her trial before writing the script. The performance and devotion to the role of the stage actress Falconetti, in her only major film role, have become legendary among film scholars. The film — shot on one huge concrete set modeled on medieval architecture in order to realistically portray the Rouen prison — is known for its cinematography and use of close-ups. Dreyer did not allow the actors to wear make-up and used lighting designs that made the actors look more grotesque. Despite the objections and cutting of the film by clerical and government authorities, it was a major critical success when first released and has consistently been considered one of the greatest films ever made. It has been praised and referenced by many film directors and musicians. In 1958, the film was voted number 4 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo.

Arguably one of Woolf’s most popular novels, it was inspired by the tumultuous family history of the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, Woolf’s lover and close friend. The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history. Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of women’s writing and gender and transgender studies.

The book details the sexual life of teenagers in Samoan society in the early 20th century, and theorizes that culture has a leading influence on psychosexual development. The book launched Mead as a pioneering researcher and as the most famous anthropologist in the world. The book has sparked years of ongoing and intense debate and controversy on questions pertaining to society, culture, and science. It is a key text in the nature versus nurture debate, as well as in discussions on issues relating to family, adolescence, gender, social norms, and attitudes. Mead’s field work for “Coming of Age” has been scrutinized, and major discrepancies were found between her published statements and her field data. Samoans themselves tend to be critical of what Mead wrote of their culture, especially her claim that adolescent promiscuity was socially acceptable in Samoa in the 1920s.

The collection of tales include Eeyore’s birthday celebration, Pooh’s attempt to catch a Heffalump, and an “expotition” to the North Pole. Amidst the lighthearted moments, the book takes a poignant turn in the final chapter as Christopher Robin and Pooh share a heartfelt conversation about the inevitability of growing up.

Many lives are interwoven in the book: Karl-Arthur, the preacher with his self-defeating ideals of self-denial and sacrifice, the practical valley girl Anna Svärd, who holds on to her own to the very end and does not want to share with anyone in heaven or on earth, Charlotte Schagerström who lives happily with her husband but still cannot forget Karl-Arthur, the obnoxious Thea Sundler, the “baron of jokes” Göran Löwensköld, a cavalier figure, and the entire Löwensköld family in Karlstad and at Hedeby Farm. The story also weaves in many episodes alongside the plot, fairy tales and folk tales, in Lagerlöf’s characteristic narrative style. It is the last book in the so-called Ring trilogy, published together in English in 1931 as <i>The Ring of the Löwenskölds</i>.

It is a celebratory dramatization of the 1917 October Revolution, one of two films commissioned by the Soviet government to honour the tenth anniversary of the event. Eisenstein used the film to further develop his theories of film structure, using a concept he described as “intellectual montage”, the editing together of shots of apparently unconnected objects in order to create and encourage intellectual comparisons between them. One of the film’s most celebrated examples of this technique is a baroque image of Jesus that is compared, through a series of shots, to Hindu deities, the Buddha, Aztec gods, and finally a primitive idol in order to suggest the sameness of all religions; the idol is then compared with military regalia to suggest the linking of patriotism and religious fervour by the state. In another sequence Alexander Kerensky, head of the pre-Bolshevik revolutionary Provisional Government, is compared to a preening mechanical peacock. Eisenstein’s montage experiments met with official disapproval; the authorities complained that *October* was unintelligible to the masses, and Eisenstein was attacked—for neither the first time nor the last—for excessive “formalism”. He was also required to re-edit the work to expurgate references to Leon Trotsky, who had recently been purged by Joseph Stalin.

Considering the many styles that Picabia painted in, observers have described his career as “shape-shifting” or “kaleidoscopic”. After experimenting with Impressionism and Pointillism, Picabia became associated with Cubism. His highly abstract planar compositions were colourful and rich in contrasts. He was one of the early major figures of the Dada movement in the United States and in France before denouncing it in 1921. He was later briefly associated with Surrealism, but would soon turn his back on the art establishment.

He was one of the first major jazz talents to emerge in Europe and has been hailed as one of its most significant exponents. With violinist Stéphane Grappelli, Reinhardt formed the Paris-based Quintette du Hot Club de France in 1934. The group was among the first to play jazz that featured the guitar as a lead instrument. Reinhardt recorded in France with many visiting American musicians, including Coleman Hawkins and Benny Carter, and briefly toured the United States with Duke Ellington’s orchestra in 1946. Reinhardt’s most popular compositions have become standards within gypsy jazz, including “Minor Swing”, “Daphne”, “Belleville”, “Djangology”, “Swing ’42”, and “Nuages”. Jazz guitarist Frank Vignola says that nearly every major popular-music guitarist in the world has been influenced by Reinhardt. He died suddenly of a stroke in 1953 at the age of 43.

Born in Toulouse, he studied law but later turned to the study of art at the École des Beaux-Arts. He moved to London early in the 20th century and in 1905 received his first commission to illustrate the novels of the Brontë Sisters. During World War I, Dulac produced relief books, but after the war, the deluxe children’s book market shrank, and he  turned to magazine illustrations among other ventures, including designing banknotes and postage stamps, most notably those that heralded the beginning of Queen Elizabeth II’s reign. His unique artistic style, characterized by intricate details, imaginative landscapes, and a focus on the fantastical, made him one of the most prominent figures in the world of illustration in the 20th century.

Many artists have covered his songs and he has influenced Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones, among others. He was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, the Native American Music Awards Hall of Fame in 1999, and gained a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist <i>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</i> (1907) and the anti-war painting <i>Guernica</i> (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the bombing of Guernica by German and Italian air forces during the Spanish Civil War. Exceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in 20th-century art.

R. R. Tolkien</h3><p>J.R.R. Tolkien (1892–1973) was an English writer and philologist, renowned as the author of high fantasy works, including <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Hobbit</i></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></a>. From 1925 to 1945, Tolkien was the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a Fellow of Pembroke College, both at the University of Oxford. He then moved within the same university to become the Merton Professor of English Language and Literature and Fellow of Merton College, and held these positions from 1945 until his retirement in 1959. Tolkien was a close friend of C. S. Lewis, a co-member of the informal literary discussion group The Inklings. He was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II on 28 March 1972. After Tolkien’s death, his son Christopher published a series of works based on his father’s extensive notes and unpublished manuscripts, including <i>The Silmarillion</i>. These, together with <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, form a connected body of tales, poems, fictional histories, invented languages, and literary essays about a fantasy world called Arda and, within it, Middle-earth. While many other authors had published works of fantasy before Tolkien, the great success of his books led directly to a popular resurgence of the genre. This has caused him to be popularly identified as the “father” of modern fantasy literature—or, more precisely, of high fantasy.

            <span>Abstract:</span>We introduce OpenVoice, a versatile voice cloning approach that requires only a short audio clip from the reference speaker to replicate their voice and generate speech in multiple languages. OpenVoice represents a significant advancement in addressing the following open challenges in the field: 1) Flexible Voice Style Control. OpenVoice enables granular control over voice styles, including emotion, accent, rhythm, pauses, and intonation, in addition to replicating the tone color of the reference speaker. The voice styles are not directly copied from and constrained by the style of the reference speaker. Previous approaches lacked the ability to flexibly manipulate voice styles after cloning. 2) Zero-Shot Cross-Lingual Voice Cloning. OpenVoice achieves zero-shot cross-lingual voice cloning for languages not included in the massive-speaker training set. Unlike previous approaches, which typically require extensive massive-speaker multi-lingual (MSML) dataset for all languages, OpenVoice can clone voices into a new language without any massive-speaker training data for that language. OpenVoice is also computationally efficient, costing tens of times less than commercially available APIs that offer even inferior performance. To foster further research in the field, we have made the source code and trained model publicly accessible. We also provide qualitative results in our demo website. Prior to its public release, our internal version of OpenVoice was used tens of millions of times by users worldwide between May and October 2023, serving as the backend of MyShell.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Page Replica</h2>
<p dir="auto">"Page Replica" is a versatile web scraping and caching tool built with Node.js, Express, and Puppeteer. It helps prerender web app (React, Angular, Vue,...) pages, which can be served via Nginx for SEO or other purposes.</p>
<p dir="auto">The tool allows you to scrape individual web pages or entire sitemaps trough an api, selectively removing JavaScript, and caching the resulting HTML.</p>
<p dir="auto">Additionally, it features an Nginx configuration that optimally handles user and search engine bot traffic.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong></p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="git clone https://github.com/html5-ninja/page-replica.git
cd page-replica"><pre>git clone https://github.com/html5-ninja/page-replica.git

<li>index.js
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="const CONFIG = {
baseUrl: &quot;https://example.com&quot;,
removeJS: true,
addBaseURL: true,
cacheFolder: &quot;path_to_cache_folder&quot;,
}"><pre>const CONFIG = {
baseUrl: <span><span>"</span>https://example.com<span>"</span></span>,
removeJS: true,
addBaseURL: true,
cacheFolder: <span><span>"</span>path_to_cache_folder<span>"</span></span>,

</ul>
<ol start="4" dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Start the API:</strong></p>

</li>
</ol>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2>
<p dir="auto">By scraping a page or a sitemap, a copy of the prerendered page will be stored in the cache folder.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scraping Individual Pages</h3>
<p dir="auto">To scrape a single page, make a GET request to <code>/page</code> with the <code>url</code> query parameter:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl http://localhost:8080/page?url=https://example.com"><pre>curl http://localhost:8080/page<span>?</span>url=https://example.com</pre></div>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scraping Sitemaps</h3>
<p dir="auto">To scrape pages from a sitemap, make a GET request to <code>/sitemap</code> with the <code>url</code> query parameter:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="curl http://localhost:8080/sitemap?url=https://example.com/sitemap.xml"><pre>curl http://localhost:8080/sitemap<span>?</span>url=https://example.com/sitemap.xml</pre></div>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Serve the Cached Pages to Bots with Nginx (My Recipe)</h2>
<p dir="auto">In this case, the cached pages are served using Nginx. You can adapt this configuration to your needs and your server.</p>
<p dir="auto">The Nginx configuration, residing in <code>nginx_config_sample/example.com.conf</code>, thoughtfully manages traffic.
It efficiently routes regular users to the main application server and redirects search engine bots to a dedicated server block for cached HTML delivery.</p>
<p dir="auto">Please review the <code>nginx_config_sample/example.com.conf</code> file to gain an understanding of its functionality.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contribution</h2>
<p dir="auto">We welcome contributions! If you have ideas for new features or server/cloud configurations that could enhance this tool, feel free to:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open an issue to discuss your ideas.</li>
<li>Fork the repository and make your changes.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Feature Requests and Suggestions</h3>
<p dir="auto">If you have any feature requests or suggestions for server/cloud configurations beyond Nginx, please open an issue to start a discussion.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Folder Structure</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>nginx_config_sample</code>: Presents a sample Nginx configuration for redirecting bot traffic to the cached content server.</li>
<li><code>api.js</code>: An Express application responsible for handling web scraping requests.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p><a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination/"><em>Procrastination</em></a> is a <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-statistics/">common issue</a>, which occurs when people unnecessarily postpone decisions or actions, generally despite knowing that doing so is likely to <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-dangers/">cause them issues</a>.</p><p>One reason why people procrastinate is <i>perfectionism</i>. For example, perfectionistic students might be so critical of themselves for making mistakes in school assignments, that they will postpone doing homework to avoid dealing with the associated negative emotions. Similarly, perfectionistic writers might be so worried about their book being criticized, that they will delay sending the book for feedback.</p><p>The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination can have serious implications, so it’s important to understand it. As such, in the following article you will learn more about how perfectionism and procrastination are connected, and see what you can do about this in practice.</p><div id="ez-toc-container"><nav><ul><li><a href="#The_relationship_between_perfectionism_and_procrastination" title="The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination">The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination</a></li><li><a href="#Associated_psychological_mechanisms" title="Associated psychological mechanisms">Associated psychological mechanisms</a></li><li><a href="#Other_causes_of_procrastination" title="Other causes of procrastination">Other causes of procrastination</a></li><li><a href="#Perfectionistic_procrastinators" title="Perfectionistic procrastinators">Perfectionistic procrastinators</a></li><li><a href="#Dealing_with_perfectionistic_procrastination" title="Dealing with perfectionistic procrastination">Dealing with perfectionistic procrastination</a></li></ul></nav></div><h2><span id="The_relationship_between_perfectionism_and_procrastination"></span>The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination<span></span></h2><p>The relationship between perfectionism and procrastination is <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.736776">complex</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-012-0149-5">depends</a>&nbsp;on the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">specific aspects</a> of perfectionism that a person has:</p><ul><li><strong>Some aspects of perfectionism generally <em>increase</em></strong><strong> procrastination.</strong> These include, most notably, <em>perfectionistic concerns</em>, which are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">characterized primarily</a> by critical and negative self-evaluations, excessive preoccupation with other people’s expectations, lack of satisfaction from successful performance, excessive <a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026474715384">worry</a> over <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.10.104">making mistakes</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2014.896454">doubts</a> about one’s abilities and actions, often in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013">irrational</a> ways or to irrational degrees. Such concerns <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">represent</a> the more <em>maladaptive</em> side of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2014.10.009">perfectionism</a>, since they generally lead people to experience negative outcomes, in terms of factors such as their performance and wellbeing. For example, these concerns can lead a student to unnecessarily delay submitting their assignments, because they’re excessively worried that they’ve made mistakes.</li><li><strong>Some aspects of perfectionism generally <em>decrease</em> procrastination.</strong> These include, most notably, <em>perfectionistic strivings</em>, which are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">characterized primarily</a> by setting and striving for excessively high personal standards, often with a focus on attaining flawlessness in one’s work. Such strivings <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">represent</a> the more <em>adaptive</em> side of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2014.10.009">perfectionism</a>, since they generally lead people to experience positive outcomes, in terms of factors such as their performance and wellbeing. For example, these strivings can lead a student to submit all their assignments on time, because they want to get a perfect grade.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013">other characteristics</a> of people’s perfectionism can also <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2016.1213374">play a role</a> in determining how their perfectionism influences their procrastination. For example, <em>socially-prescribed perfectionism</em>, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-397045-9.00166-X">involves</a> people having high standards <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4899-0227-6_6">set</a> for them by <a href="https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2008.36.6.753">others</a>, is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65">more likely</a> to increase procrastination, whereas&nbsp;<em>self-oriented perfectionism</em>, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013">involves</a> people <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2017.04.010">setting</a> high standards for <a href="https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.1992.20.2.85">themselves</a>, is more likely to decrease procrastination.</p><p>In addition, various issues can influence people’s perfectionism, and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.2224/sbp.2008.36.6.753">relationship</a> between it and their procrastination. For example, when people receive <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2016.1213374">parental criticism</a>, this can exacerbate their perfectionistic concerns, which in turn can exacerbate their procrastination. Alternatively, when people have high <em><a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/">self-efficacy</a></em>, this can improve their ability to control any perfectionistic concerns that they have, which in turn can decrease their procrastination.</p><p><strong>In summary</strong>, perfectionism can either increase or decrease procrastination, depending on various factors. These factors include the aspects of perfectionism involved (e.g., concerns vs. strivings), the types of perfectionism involved (e.g., self-oriented vs. socially-prescribed), and personality traits, such as self-efficacy. This means that while perfectionism can sometimes cause procrastination, not all perfectionists procrastinate.</p><h2><span id="Associated_psychological_mechanisms"></span>Associated psychological mechanisms<span></span></h2><p>There are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">various ways</a> in which perfectionism can lead to procrastination. For example, it can increase the negative emotions that people experience when they make mistakes, which leads people to delay their work as a way to <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/emotion-regulation/">delay</a> the associated <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z">negative emotions</a>. Alternatively, perfectionism can substantially increase people’s expectations of themselves, which <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/per.2098">increases</a> the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2017.02.059">discrepancy</a> between people’s current situation and their desired situation so much that their goals feel unattainable, which causes them to give up.</p><p>These mechanisms can <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrp.2012.08.006">cause people</a> to enter a <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-cycle/">perfectionism-procrastination cycle</a>. For example, this can happen when someone’s perfectionism makes them afraid of negative feedback, which causes them to procrastinate, which leads them to perform poorly and get negative feedback, which makes them more afraid of getting negative feedback again in the future, and so on.</p><h2><span id="Other_causes_of_procrastination"></span>Other causes of procrastination<span></span></h2><p>People can procrastinate for <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/">many reasons</a> beyond perfectionism, such as <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/anxiety/">anxiety</a>, <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/">fear of failure</a>, and <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/depression/">depression</a>. Accordingly, although perfectionism can sometimes lead to procrastination, not all procrastinators are perfectionists, and even those who are don’t necessarily procrastinate because of their perfectionism, or <em>only</em> because of it. Nevertheless, many <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/">other causes of procrastination</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013">such as</a> anxiety and fear of failure, are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941930733pt123">associated</a> with perfectionism in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1026474715384">various ways</a>, for example by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/03069885.2014.896454">co-occurring</a> with it, or by being <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02653-z">involved</a> in perfectionistic concerns.</p><h2><span id="Perfectionistic_procrastinators"></span>Perfectionistic procrastinators<span></span></h2><p>There’s no universal definition for what constitutes a <em>perfectionistic procrastinator</em>. Nevertheless, this term generally refers to people who suffer from <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/chronic-procrastination/">substantial procrastination</a> that’s caused primarily by their perfectionism. For example, an artist can be considered a perfectionistic procrastinator if they unnecessarily delay publishing their work for a long time, because they worry the public won’t think it’s perfect.</p><p>In addition, the term “perfectionistic procrastinator” can be when perfectionism is only one of the key causes of a person’s procrastination, in conjunction with other key causes as descriptors. For example, if someone procrastinates due to a combination of perfectionism and depression, then they may be referred to as a <em>perfectionistic and depressed procrastinator</em>.</p><h2><span id="Dealing_with_perfectionistic_procrastination"></span>Dealing with perfectionistic procrastination<span></span></h2><p>If you realize that your perfectionism is causing you to procrastinate, there are several key things that you can do about it:</p><ul><li><strong>Set reasonable goals and standards.</strong> This doesn’t mean that you should aim low, but rather that you should assess the situation, to determine what performance will be&nbsp;<em><a href="https://effectiviology.com/good-enough-is-good-enough-letting-go-of-perfectionism-to-get-things-done/">good enough</a></em> for you to achieve what you want and need to achieve.</li><li><strong>Focus on yourself, rather than on others.</strong> Many of the issues associated with perfectionism come from caring too much about what others expect of you, or about what others will say or think. If this is a problem for you, then you should instead focus on goals and standards that you set for yourself, and minimize the degree to which you care about other people’s opinions.</li><li><strong>Question and address your fears.</strong> For example, if you realize that you’re <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/fear/">afraid</a> of someone criticizing you for not having perfect work, you can ask yourself things such as “how likely is it that they will actually care if I make some small mistakes” or “so what if this person criticizes my work?”. When doing this, it could help to use <a href="https://effectiviology.com/self-distancing-rational-decisions/">self-distancing techniques</a>, for example by asking yourself “why should <em>you</em> care so about making small mistakes?” or by considering what advice you would give to a friend if they were in your situation.</li><li><strong>Consider the negative impact of your perfectionism.</strong> For example, you might consider how your perfectionism-driven procrastination means that you’re not getting any feedback on your work, which is preventing you from making progress.</li><li><strong>Give yourself permission to make mistakes.</strong> For example, if you’re writing a paper, accept that your work won’t be perfect, especially when it comes to the first draft. Essentially, you should <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/10808-013">avoid</a> an&nbsp;<em>all-or-nothing</em> approach, both when it comes to your work, and when it comes to your attempts to reduce procrastination (i.e., don’t let <em>perfect</em> become the enemy of&nbsp;<em>good enough</em>).</li><li><strong>Develop self-efficacy.</strong> Specifically, this is your <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/">belief</a> in your ability to perform the actions needed to achieve your goals. You can develop it in <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-efficacy/">various ways</a>, such as identifying the strategies that you can use to achieve your goals, and then thinking about how you can execute those strategies successfully.</li><li><strong>Develop self-compassion.</strong> Specifically, you should develop the three components of <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-compassion/">self-compassion</a>:&nbsp;<em>self-kindness</em>, which involves being nice to yourself,&nbsp;<em>common humanity</em>, which involves recognizing that everyone experiences challenges, and&nbsp;<a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/procrastination-study-mindfulness/"><em>mindfulness</em></a>, which involves accepting your emotions in a non-judgmental manner. There are <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/self-compassion/">many techniques</a> for doing this, including some that are particularly relevant in the case of perfectionism, such as changing your critical self-talk to make it more positive and compassionate.</li><li><strong>Get support and encouragement from others.</strong> For example, you can talk with a professional therapist about your perfectionistic concerns, or you can ask a friend to be by your side and motivate you when it’s time to act. If you’re reluctant to ask for help because of your perfectionism, remind yourself that it’s perfectly fine and normal to ask for help, and that doing so can help you achieve better outcomes and feel better in the long term.</li></ul><p>Before choosing which of these techniques to use, you should assess your perfectionism and procrastination, to understand how they’re connected. This can help you figure out which specific aspects of your perfectionism you should address and how you should address them.</p><p>In addition, there are many other <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating/">anti-procrastination techniques</a> that you might benefit from using to reduce your perfectionism-driven procrastination. These include the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Break your work into small and manageable steps.</strong> For example, if you have a large project that feels overwhelming, such as writing a research paper, you can break it down into a series of small steps, such as creating an outline, finding relevant resources, and writing the introduction.</li><li><strong>Start with a tiny step.</strong> For example, commit to writing only a single sentence or exercising for only 2 minutes, while giving yourself permission to stop after taking that tiny first step, to reduce the pressure associated with getting started.</li><li><strong>Switch between tasks.</strong> For example, if you’re stuck on a task and can’t make progress, switch to a <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/productive-procrastination/">different task</a> until you’re ready to go back to the first one.</li><li><strong>Acknowledge and reward your progress.</strong> For example, you can treat yourself to some pleasant treat once you’ve managed to achieve your study goals for a week in a row.</li><li><strong>Schedule your work according to your productivity cycles.</strong> For example, if you find it easier to concentrate on creative tasks in the morning, then you should schedule such tasks for that time period as much as possible.</li><li><strong>Improve your work environment.</strong> For example, if your current work environment has a lot of irritating background noise, get noise-canceling headphones or go somewhere quieter.</li><li><strong>Get enough rest.</strong> For example, if you need to work hard on tasks that require deep concentration, make sure to take enough breaks that you don’t get burnt out. To encourage yourself to do this, you can remind yourself that even if getting rest can reduce your productivity in the short term, it will often be much better for you in the long term, both in terms of your productivity and in terms of your wellbeing.</li><li><strong>Forgive yourself for past procrastination.</strong> For example, if you need to get started on a task that you’ve been postponing for a long time, you can say “I shouldn’t have postponed this task in the first place, but that’s in the past, and what’s important now is to move on and just get this done”.</li></ul><p>Before using these techniques, you should figure out <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/">why you procrastinate</a>, especially if there are other reasons for your procrastination beyond perfectionism, as well as when and how you procrastinate. This will then help you find the best <a href="https://solvingprocrastination.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating/">anti-procrastination techniques</a> to use in your particular situation, and will also figure out how to use these techniques as effectively as possible.</p> </div></div>]]></description>

		<h2>What makes Standard Ebooks different?</h2>
		<section>
			<h3>Modern &amp; consistent typography</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Other free ebooks don’t put much effort into professional-quality typography: they use "straight" quotes instead of “curly” quotes, they ignore details like em- and en-dashes, and they look more like early-90’s web pages instead of actual books.</p>
					<p>Standard Ebooks applies a rigorous and modern <a href="https://standardebooks.org/manual">style manual</a> when developing each and every ebook to ensure they meet a professional-grade and consistent typographical standard. Our ebooks look <em>good</em>.</p>

			<h3>Full proofing with careful corrections</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Transcriptions from other sources are often filled with typos or suffer from issues like inconsistent spelling, missing accent marks, or missing punctuation. Submitting corrections to such sources can be difficult or impossible, so errors are rarely fixed.</p>
					<p>At Standard Ebooks, we do a careful and complete readthrough of each ebook before releasing it, checking it against a scan of the original pages to fix as many typos as possible. Even if we <em>do</em> miss something, our ebooks are stored in the hugely popular Git source control system, allowing anyone to easily submit a correction.</p>

			<h3>Quality covers</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Everyone knows a book is judged by its cover, but most free ebooks leave it to your ereader software to generate a drab default cover.</p>
					<p>Standard Ebooks draws from a vast collection of public domain fine art to create attractive, unique, appropriate, and consistent covers for each of our ebooks.</p>

			<h3>Clean code &amp; semantic markup</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>Our strict coding standards allow technologists and ebook producers to use Standard Ebooks files as reliable, easy to read, and robust bases for their own work—not to mention as models of what well-crafted ebook files look like. Common code patterns are repeated through different ebooks, so the code never surprises you.</p>
					<p>Each ebook is also enhanced with careful standards-based semantic markup that opens the gateway for exciting new kinds of machine processing.</p>

			<h3>Free, open-source, &amp; public domain</h3>
			<div>
				<div>
					<p>We use the popular Git source control system to track each and every change made to our ebooks. Anyone can easily see a history of changes, or contribute their own changes with the click of a mouse.</p>
					<p>And while all of the ebooks we feature and the cover art we draw from are <em>already</em> believed to be in the public domain in the U.S., Standard Ebooks releases all of the work we put in to each ebook into the public domain too. That makes each and every one of our ebook files not just free, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre">libre</a> too—because the world deserves more unrestricted culture.</p>

For reasons that escape me there seems to a trend for standby lights on home electronics to be blue "searchlights".
This "feature" is especially annoying when the electronics are in a bedroom or the home is a one room flat for that matter.  Some
manufacturers helpfully allow these to be turned on, but not all, and not on the <a href="http://www.jvc.co.uk/">JVC</a> LT-39C740
I recently bought from <a href="http://www.currys.co.uk/">Currys</a>.
</p><p>
 A bit of black will fix the problem but often, like on the LT-39C740, the
same window for the blue light is also the window for the remote control sensor so the black tape solution also disables the
remote control.  However, with a bit a lateral thinking there is a solution.  Remote controls use infra-red so adding a filter to allow
infra-red only is another solution.  The trend for using blue LEDs helps now.  A red filter will likely extend down to infra-red
but certainly block blue light.
</p><p>
Luckily Quality Street chocolates have a transparent wrapper that is a nice deep red.  I found that 2 layers
of this still allowed the remote control to work from across the room while reducing the blue light to near zero.  Pulled tight
around the square block that contains the blue LED and remote sensor and secured with a bit of sellotape round the back, out of sight,
the fix is near invisible.  Only the very observant would notice the the square block that contains the blue LED and remote sensor
is purple black rather than the same black as the rest of the plastic surround.
</p><p>
A free fix and you get to eat the chocolate.  What could be better?

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OVERVIEW</h2>
<p dir="auto">Durdraw is an ASCII, Unicode and ANSI art editor for UNIX-like systems (Linux,
macOS, etc). It runs in modern Utf-8 terminals and supports frame-based
animation, custom themes, 256 and 16 color modes, terminal mouse input, DOS
ANSI art viewing, CP437 and Unicode mixing and conversion, HTML output, mIRC
color output, and other interesting features.</p>
<p dir="auto">Durdraw is heavily inspired by classic ANSI editing software for MS-DOS and
Windows, such as TheDraw, Aciddraw and Pablodraw, but with a modern Unix twist.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">REQUIREMENTS</h2>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Python 3 (3.10+ recommended)</li>
<li>Linux, macOS, or other Unix-like System</li>
</ul>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">INSTALLATION</h2>
<p dir="auto">If you just want to run it without instalilng, scroll down to the next section.</p>
<p dir="auto">1: Download and extract, or use git to download:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="   git clone https://github.com/cmang/durdraw.git  
   cd durdraw "><pre><code>   git clone https://github.com/cmang/durdraw.git  
   cd durdraw 
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">2: Install or upgrade using pip:</p>

<p dir="auto">Or run the installer:</p>

<p dir="auto">3: Optionally, install some themes and a sample configuration file for your local user into ~/.durdraw/:</p>

<p dir="auto">You should now be able to run <code>durdraw</code>. This tries to run in 256-color mode by default. To start in 16-color mode for viewing MS-DOS style ANSI art, use <code>durdraw --16color</code>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">RUNNING WITHOUT INSTALLING</h2>
<p dir="auto">You may need to install the "PIL" or "pillow" python module first:</p>

<p dir="auto">Then you can run Durdraw with:</p>

<p dir="auto">To look at some included example animations:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    ./start-durdraw -p examples/*.dur"><pre><code>    ./start-durdraw -p examples/*.dur
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">To edit 16-color PC Scene (MS-DOS/CP437) ANSI art files in a Utf-8 terminal, use the --16colors option:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    ./start-durdraw --16colors"><pre><code>    ./start-durdraw --16colors
</code></pre></div>

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">COMMAND LINE USAGE</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can play a .dur file or series of .dur files with:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="    $ durdraw -p filename.dur
    $ durdraw -p file1.dur file2.dur file3.dur ..."><pre><code>    $ durdraw -p filename.dur
    $ durdraw -p file1.dur file2.dur file3.dur ...
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">Other command-line options:</p>
<pre>usage: start-durdraw [-h] [-p PLAY [PLAY ...]] [-q | -w | -x TIMES] [--256color | --16color] [-b]
                     [-W WIDTH] [-H HEIGHT] [-m] [--nomouse] [-A] [-u UNDOSIZE] [-V] [--debug]
                     [filename]

positional arguments:
  filename              .dur or ascii file to load

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PLAY [PLAY ...], --play PLAY [PLAY ...]
                        Just play .dur file or files, then exit
  -q, --quick           Skip startup screen
  -w, --wait            Pause at startup screen
  -x TIMES, --times TIMES
                        Play X number of times (requires -p)
  --256color            Try 256 color mode
  --16color             Try 16 color mode
  -b, --blackbg         Use a black background color instead of terminal default
  -W WIDTH, --width WIDTH
                        Set canvas width
  -H HEIGHT, --height HEIGHT
                        Set canvas height
  -m, --max             Maximum canvas size for terminal (overrides -W and -H)
  --nomouse             Disable mouse support
  --cursor CURSOR       Cursor mode (block, underscore, or pipe)
  --notheme             Disable theme support
  --theme THEME         Load a custom theme file
  --cp437               Encode extended characters using Code Page 437 (IBM-PC/MS-DOS) encoding
                        instead of Utf-8. (Needs CP437 capable terminal and font)
  --export-ansi         Export loaded art to an ANSI file and exit
  -u UNDOSIZE, --undosize UNDOSIZE
                        Set the number of undo history states - default is 100. More requires more
                        RAM, less saves RAM.
  -V, --version         Show version number and exit

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">CONFIGURATION</h2>
<p dir="auto">You can create a custom startup file where you can set a theme.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you did not already do so during installation, you can install a sample configuration and some themes into ~/.durdraw/ with the command:</p>

<p dir="auto">This will place durdraw.ini into ~/.durdraw/ and the themes into ~/.durdraw/themes/.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example durdraw.ini file:</p>
<pre>; Durdraw 0.20 Configuration File
[Theme]
theme-16: ~/.durdraw/themes/purpledrank-16.dtheme.ini
theme-256: ~/.durdraw/themes/mutedform-256.dtheme.ini
</pre>
<p dir="auto">The option 'theme-16' sets the path to the theme file used in 16-color mode, and 'theme-256' sets the theme file used for 256-color mode.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that you can also load a custom theme file using the --theme command-line argument and passing it the path to a theme file, or disable themes entirely with the --notheme command line option.</p>
<p dir="auto">Here is an example 16-color theme:</p>
<pre>[Theme-16]
name: 'Purple Drank'
mainColor: 6
clickColor: 3
borderColor: 6
clickHighlightColor: 5
notificationColor: 4
promptColor: 4
</pre>
<p dir="auto">and a 256-color theme:</p>
<pre>[Theme-256]
name: 'Muted Form'
mainColor: 104
clickColor: 37
borderColor: 236
clickHighlightColor: 15
notificationColor: 87
promptColor: 189
menuItemColor: 189
menuTitleColor: 159
menuBorderColor: 24
</pre>
<p dir="auto">The colors and theme options are as follows:</p>
<p dir="auto">colors for 16-color mode:
1 black
2 blue
3 green
4 cyan
5 red
6 magenta
7 yellow
8 white</p>
<p dir="auto">color codes numbers for 256-color mode can be found in Durdraw's 256-color selector.</p>

<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="* To use themes, copy durdraw.ini to ~/.durdraw/ and edit it. Durdraw
  will also check in the current directory for durdraw.ini.

* The mouse can be used for moving the cursor (even over SSH) and

  In iTerm2 this is under Profiles, Terminal and Terminal Emulation.

* If IBM-PC characters (-A) are not working in gnu screen, try running the

<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">OPTIONAL INSTALLATION</h2>
<p dir="auto">For PNG and animated GIF export, install Ansilove (<a href="https://ansilove.org/" rel="nofollow">https://ansilove.org/</a>) and make sure it is is in your path. PNG and GIF export only work in 16-color mode for now.</p>
<p dir="auto">If you want to try making animated IBM-PC/MS-DOS ANSI art with durdraw, you
need a terminal and font that supports ASCII encoding and IBM's Code Page 437.
You can find fonts in the "extras" directory for this purpose. Once this is done,
start Durdraw with the -A or --ibmpc command-line argument.</p>
<p dir="auto">Note that ANSI art character support is experimental (see FAQ).</p>
<p dir="auto">In Linux/X11, here is one possible way to set up a terminal for IBM-PC ANSI art:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Install mrxvt</li>
<li>Install vga.pcf by copying it to /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc and then running
these commands. This may be different on your OS:
$ mkfontdir /usr/share/fonts/X11/misc/
$ xset fp rehash</li>
<li>Give mrxvt IBM-PC colors by copying the contents of Xdefaults into your own
~/.Xdefaults file. You can create ~/.Xdefaults if it does not exist.</li>
<li>Launch mrxvt with: mrxvt -fn vga -bg black -fg grey</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If you are using macOS or MacOS X and want IBM-PC ANSI art support in
Terminal.app:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Install dos437.ttf font (included) by double-clicking it.</li>
<li>Create a profile in Terminal Preferences/Settings with the following
settings (similar settings can be applied in iTerm):
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In Text tab, Font set to dos437 (I like 9pt) and "Display ANSI colors"<br>
and "Use bright colors for bold text" are checked</li>
<li>In Keyboard tab, "Use option as meta key" selected</li>
<li>In "Advanced" tab, Character encoding set to "Western (ISO Latin 1)"</li>
<li>Set background color to black (low or no transprency) and foreground
color to white</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto">Once this is setup, pass "-A" to durdraw's command-line to allow you to use
F1-F12 to input ANSI block characters.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">FAQ</h2>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Don't TheDraw and some other programs already do ANSI animation?</h4>
<p dir="auto">A: Yes, but traditional ANSI animation does not provide any control over timing, instead relying on terminal baud rate to control the speed. This does not work well on modern systems without baud rate emulation. Durdraw gives the artist fine control over frame rate, and delays per frame. Traditional ANSI animation also updates the animation one character at a time, while Durdraw updates the animation a full frame at a time. This makes it less vulnerable to visual corruption from things like errant terminal characters, resized windows, line noise, etc. Finally, unlike TheDraw, which requires MS-DOS, Durdraw runs in modern Unicode terminals.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Can I run Durdraw in Windows?</h4>
<p dir="auto">A: Short answer: It's not supported, but it seems to work fine in the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Long answer: Some versions run fine in Windows Command Prompt, Windows Terminal, etc, without WSL, but it's not tested or supported. If you want to help make Durdraw work better in Windows, please help by testing, submitting bug reports and submitting patches.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Can I run Durdraw on Amiga, MS-DOS, Classic MacOS, iOS, Android, etc?</h4>
<p dir="auto">A: Probably not easily. Durdraw requires Python 3 and Ncurses. If your platform can support these, it will probably run. However, the file format for Durdraw movies is a plain text JSON format. It should be possible to support this format in different operating systems and in different applications.</p>
<h4 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Q: Does Durdraw support IBM-PC ANSI art?</h4>
<p dir="auto">A: Yes - Kind of. Durdraw can support IBM-PC (Code Page 437) extended ASCII characters using the -A command-line option, and can export ANSI files. However, ANSI importing is not currently supported. Please see the "OPTIONAL INSTALLATION" section above for more details. If you do not pass the -A command-line option, then Unicode block characters similar to IBM-PC block characters are enabled by default.</p>

<p dir="auto">Web application UI design is not just about how a product looks but how it works. Using web technologies in your UI makes your product modern and professional, And a well-designed web application will help you make a solid first impression on potential customers. Great web application design also assists you in nurturing leads and increasing conversions. In addition, it makes navigating and using your web app easier for your users.</p>
<h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Why Use Web Browsers?</h3>
<p dir="auto">Today's web browsers have everything a modern UI needs. Web browsers are very sophisticated and optimized. Therefore, using it as a GUI will be an excellent choice. While old legacy GUI lib is complex and outdated, a WebView-based app is still an option. However, a WebView needs a huge SDK to build and many dependencies to run, and it can only provide some features like a real web browser. That is why WebUI uses real web browsers to give you full features of comprehensive web technologies while keeping your software lightweight and portable.</p>

<p dir="auto">Think of WebUI like a WebView controller, but instead of embedding the WebView controller in your program, which makes the final program big in size, and non-portable as it needs the WebView runtimes. Instead, by using WebUI, you use a tiny static/dynamic library to run any installed web browser and use it as GUI, which makes your program small, fast, and portable. <strong>All it needs is a web browser</strong>.</p>

<p><span>A grab bag of less frequently talked about git adjacent points.</span></p>
<section id="Not-Rocket-Science-Rule-Applies-To-Merge-Commits">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Not-Rocket-Science-Rule-Applies-To-Merge-Commits"><span>Not Rocket Science Rule Applies To Merge Commits</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Should every commit pass the tests? If it should, then your </span><a href="https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/1597.html"><span>not rocket science</span>
<span>rule</span></a><span> implementation must be verifying this property. It</span>
<span>probably doesn</span>’<span>t, and only tests the final result of merging the feature branch into the main</span>
<span>branch.</span></p>
<p><span>That</span>’<span>s why for typical project it is useful to </span><em><span>merge</span></em><span> pull requests into the main branch </span>—<span> the</span>
<span>linear sequence of merge commits is a record of successful CI runs, and is a set of commits you want</span>
<span>to </span><code>git bisect</code><span> over.</span></p>
<p><span>Within a feature branch, not every commit necessary passes the tests (or even builds), and that is a</span>
<span>useful property! Here</span>’<span>s some ways this can be exploited:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>When fixing a bug, add a failing test first, as a separate commit.</span>
<span>That way it becomes easy to verify for anyone that the test indeed fails without the follow up</span>
<span>fix.</span></p>
<p><span>Related advice: often I see people commenting out tests that currently fail, or tests that are yet</span>
<span>to be fixed in the future. That</span>’<span>s bad, because commented-out code rots faster than the JavaScript</span>
<span>framework of the day. Instead, adjust the asserts such that they lock down the current (wrong)</span>
<span>behavior, and add a clear </span><code>// TODO:</code><span> comment explaining what would be the correct result. This</span>
<span>prevents such tests from rotting and also catches cases where the behavior is fixed by an</span>
<span>unrelated change.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>To refactor an API which has a lot of usages, split the work in two commits. In the first commit,</span>
<span>change the API itself, but don</span>’<span>t touch the usages. In the second commit, mechanically adjust all</span>
<span>call sites.</span></p>
<p><span>That way during review it is trivial to separate meaningful changes from a large, but trivial</span>
<span>diff.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git mv</code><span> is fake. For a long time, I believed that </span><code>git mv</code><span> adds some special bit of git metadata</span>
<span>which tells it that the file was moved, such that it can be understood by </span><code>diff</code><span> or </span><code>blame</code><span>.</span>
<span>That</span>’<span>s not the case: </span><code>git mv</code><span> is essentially </span><code>mv</code><span> followed by </span><code>git add</code><span>. There</span>’<span>s nothing in git to</span>
<span>track that a file was moved specifically, the </span>“<span>moved</span>”<span> illusion is created by the diff tool when it</span>
<span>heuristically compares repository state at two points in time.</span></p>
<p><span>For this reason, if you want to reliably record file moves during refactors in git, you should do</span>
<span>two commits: the first commit </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> moves the file without any changes, the second commit applies</span>
<span>all the required fixups.</span></p>
<p><span>Speaking of moves, consider adding this to your </span><code>gitconfig</code><span>:</span></p>

<figure>


<pre><code><span>[diff]</span>
<span>  colormoved = "default"</span>
<span>  colormovedws = "allow-indentation-change"</span></code></pre>

</figure>
<p><span>This way, moved lines will be colored differently in </span><code>diff</code><span>, so that code motions not confused</span>
<span>with additions and deletions, and are easier to review. It is unclear to me why this isn</span>’<span>t the</span>
<span>default, and why this isn</span>’<span>t an option in GitHub</span>’<span>s UI.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span>Merge into main, but rebase feature branches</span>”<span> might be a hard rule to wrap your head around if you</span>
<span>are new to git. Luckily, it</span>’<span>s easy to use not-rocket-science rule to enforce this property. The</span>
<span>history is as much a part of your project as is the source code. You can write a test that shells</span>
<span>out to git and checks that the only merge commits in the history are those from the merge bot. While</span>
<span>you are at it, it would be a good idea to test that no large large files are present in the</span>
<span>repository </span>—<span> the size of a repository only grows, and you can</span>’<span>t easily remove large blobs from the</span>
<span>repo later on!</span></p>
</section>
<section id="Commit-Messages">

    <h2>
    <a href="#Commit-Messages"><span>Commit Messages</span> </a>
    </h2>
<p><span>Let me phrase this in the most inflammatory way possible :)</span></p>
<p><span>If your project has great commit messages, with short and precise summary lines and long and</span>
<span>detailed bodies, this probably means that your CI and code review process suck.</span></p>
<p><span>Not all changes are equal. In a typical project, most of the changes that </span><em><span>should</span></em><span> be made are small</span>
<span>and trivial </span>—<span> some renames, visibility tightening, </span>“<span>attention to details</span>”<span> polish in user-visible</span>
<span>features.</span></p>
<p><span>However, in a typical project, landing a trivial change is slow. How long would it take you to fix</span>
<code>it's/its</code><span> typo in a comment? Probably 30 seconds to push the actual change, 30 minutes to get the</span>
<span>CI results, and 3 hours for a review roundtrip.</span></p>
<p><span>The fixed costs to making a change are tremendous. Main branch gatekeeping strongly incentivizes</span>
<span>against trivial changes. As a result, such changes either are not being made, or are tacked onto</span>
<span>larger changes as a drive by bonus. In any case, the total number of commits and PRs goes down. And</span>
<span>you are crafting a novel of a commit message because you have to wait for your previous PR to land</span>
<span>anyway.</span></p>
<p><span>What can be done better?</span></p>
<p><em><span>First</span></em><span>, make changes smaller and more frequent.</span>
<span>Most likely, this is possible for you.</span>
<span>At least, I tend to out-commit most colleagues (</span><a href="https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/graphs/contributors"><span>example</span></a><span>).</span>
<span>That</span>’<span>s not because I am more productive </span>—<span> I just do work in smaller batches.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Second</span></em><span>, make CI asynchronous.</span>
<span>At no point in your workflow you should be waiting for CI to pass.</span>
<span>You should flag a change for merging, move on to the next thing, and only get back if CI fails.</span>
<span>This is something bors-ng does right </span>—<span> it</span>’<span>s possible to </span><code>r+</code><span> a commit immediately on submission.</span>
<span>This is something GitHub merge queue does wrong </span>—<span> it</span>’<span>s impossible to add a PR to queue until checks on the PR itself are green.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Third</span></em><span>, our review process is backwards. Review is done </span><em><span>before</span></em><span> code gets into main, but that</span>’<span>s</span>
<span>inefficient for most of the non-mission critical projects out there. A better approach is to</span>
<span>optimistically merge most changes as soon as not-rocket-science allows it, and then later review the</span>
<span>code in situ,  in the main branch. And instead of adding comments in web ui, just changint the code</span>
<span>in-place, sending a new PR ccing the original author.</span></p>

</figure>
<p><span>I am skeptical that this exact workflow would</span>
<span>ever fly, but I am cautiously optimistic about </span><a href="https://zed.dev/"><span>Zed</span>’<span>s</span></a><span> idea about just allowing</span>
<span>two people to code in the same editor at the same time. I think that achieves a similar effect, and</span>
<span>nicely dodges unease about allowing temporarily unreviewed code.</span></p>
<p><span>Ok, back to git!</span></p>
<p><em><span>First</span></em><span>, not every project needs a clean history. Have you ever looked at the git history of your</span>
<span>personal blog or dotfiles? If you haven</span>’<span>t, feel free to use a </span><code>.</code><span> as a commit message. I do that for</span>
<span><a href="https://github.com/matklad/matklad.github.io">https://github.com/matklad/matklad.github.io</a><span>,</span></span>
<span>it works fine so far.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Second</span></em><span>, not every change needs a great commit message. If a change is really minor, I would say</span>
<code>minor</code><span> is an okay commit message!</span></p>
<p><em><span>Third</span></em><span>, some changes absolutely do require very detailed commit messages. If there </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> a context,</span>
<span>by all means, include all of it into the commit message (and spill some as comments in the source</span>
<span>code). And here</span>’<span>s a tip for this case: </span><em><span>write the commit message first!</span></em></p>
<p><span>When I work on a larger feature, I start with</span>
<code>git commit --allow-empty</code>
<span>to type out what I set to do. Most of the time, by the third paragraph of the commit message I</span>
<span>realize that there</span>’<span>s a flaw in my plan and refine it. So, by the time I get to actually writing the</span>
<span>code, I am already on the second iteration. And, when I am done, I just amend the commit with the</span>
<span>actual changes, and the commit message is already there, needing only minor adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span>And the last thing I want to touch about commit messages: </span><code>man git-commit</code><span> tells me that the summary</span>
<span>line should be shorter than 50 characters. This feels obviously wrong, that</span>’<span>s much too short!</span>
<a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/submitting-patches.html"><span>Kernel docs</span></a><span> suggest a much</span>
<span>more reasonable 70-75 limit! And indeed, looking at a some recent kernel commits, 50 is clearly not</span>
<span>enough!</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

        

        <p>The day before 2023 on of my favorite artists decided to drop a new track (link)! Amazing, I thought, I’ll add it to my Spotify playlist.</p>
        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/Spotify.png" alt="me searching for the song on spotify">

    	<p>Unfortunately it was no where to be found, and this wasn’t the only song. Easy! I can just download the mp3 off YouTube and add it to my Spotify playlist manually. Let me just find a website.</p>
        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/ytmp3.png" alt="mp3 downloader website">

        <p>Admittedly the website was pretty nice with only a single strange ad, however it still left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. Downloading random files off websites like these probably isn’t the most hygienic computing practice. After all I’ve been a full stack dev for a little bit (just graduated college!) This should be no problem let’s just see what YouTube does…</p>
        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/youtubeNetwork.png" alt="youtube network traffic">
        <p>Oh... that's ALOT of parameters</p>
        <p>wondering if anyone else had already reversed it, which led me to a hackernews post and then to this site <a href="https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube-revisited">https://tyrrrz.me/blog/reverse-engineering-youtube-revisited</a></p>
        <p>After reading throught the entire AMAZING post I created a fetch request in node using the android example only to get back a 403 error...Not readable. No biggie I'll switch to the embedded web player it seems much more useful anyway! I carefully extracted the decoder from the youtube player just as the blog said and prepared the request</p>

        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/embeddedAttempt.png" alt="my fetch request to youtube using an embeded context">
        <p>I sent it off and BOOM! ....wait what? a 403?? I double cheked my code and the decryption but didn't find any faults. At this point I was pretty bummed but remembered about an open source project called invidious that Lous Rossman mentioend. I nagivated to the website and noticed that they were pulling the videos directly from youtube's rr endpoint. Exactly what I wanted to do! How is this possible? On a closer inspection of the netowrk traffic I saw the keywork ANDROID. The original method I was using, but how did they get theirs to work?</p>

        
        <p>Since the project is open source I parsed their github only to find it was in a language called crystal. Despite me being unfamilliar it was easy enough to read and reminded me of bash. Eventually I stumbeled on two functions</p>

        <img src="https://vincentsg.dev/images/article/dec31/invidiousPlayer.png" alt="invidious player source code">
        <p>This was the function I needed! Looking at the request it seems that they had additional context compared to what I had especially the html5 context. I found where the function was called and determined that they initally used and ANDROID client for the first attempt, matching what I initally saw in their network traffic. With all of this I put together my own network call and.... BOOM!!! FINALLY A STREAM. Since this wasn't using the web client I didn't need to decode the signature it was free to access.</p>

        <p>
     
            let data = { <br>
                "videoId": videoId,<br>
                "context": {<br>

                    },<br>
                },<br>
            }<br>

        </p>

        
        <p>I quickly threw together an ugly frontend and posted it to digital ocean under an express server and prepped another project to repair my broken discord bot.</p>

        <p>Hopefully this is usefull to someone or just an interesting read. Big shoutout to the invidious project and tyrrrz's blog they did basically all of the heavy lifting for this new developer! </p>
        <p>If this ever makes it to Hacker News, I love you guys! I read the site multiple times a day. You all keep me motivated especially in times like this where I'm not sure if I should continue being a developer. Thanks for keeping me sane and happy new year!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="container">

<p>November 2023</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Go to:</strong> <a href="#the-algorithm">Algorithm</a> | <a href="#some-better-examples">Examples</a> | <a href="#python-implementation">Python implementation</a> | <a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recently learned how to generate text using a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>. The generated text is readable but is also complete nonsense; as prose it’s not worth much, but for predicting the next word like your phone keyboard’s suggestions, it’s surprisingly useful.</p>

<p>I learned about this algorithm in chapter 3 of Kernighan and Pike’s book <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/"><em>The Practice of Programming</em></a>, where they implement such a generator in various programming languages to discuss program design and data structures.</p>

<p>Note that this algorithm is only one small use for Markov chains, which are a much more general statistical concept.</p>

<h2 id="the-algorithm">The algorithm</h2>

<p>The algorithm is easy to explain: start with an input text whose phrases will be used to generate the output. For every pair of words in the input, record a list of the possible words that come after the word pair.</p>

<p>Once you’ve built that data structure, you can generate as much or as little output as you want. Start with any pair of words that occurs in the input, and then randomly pick one of the possible third words. Then move along, so the second word in the pair is the word you just generated, randomly pick another word, and so on.</p>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>This algorithm uses pairs of words, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigram">bigrams</a>. You could generalise the algorithm to use single words or trigrams instead of pairs. However, as <em>The Practice of Programming</em> points out:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Making the prefix shorter tends to produce less coherent prose; making it longer tends
to reproduce the input text verbatim. For English text, using two words to select a
third is a good compromise; it seems to recreate the flavor of the input while adding
its own whimsical touch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s work through an example. For small inputs, you want some repetition for it to work, so as input we’ll use the last five of the Ten Commandments from the King James Bible:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thou shalt not kill.</p>

  <p>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p>

  <p>Thou shalt not steal.</p>

  <p>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p>

  <p>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbours.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s what the “possible third words” data structure looks like, showing the first few entries with the word pair on the left and the possibilities separated by <code>|</code> on the right:</p>

<div><pre><code>shalt not         kill. | commit | steal. | bear | covet | covet
Thou shalt        not | not | not | not | not
nor his           manservant, | maidservant, | ox, | ass,
not covet         thy | thy
covet thy         neighbours | neighbours
thy neighbours    house, | wife,
not kill.         Thou
kill. Thou        shalt
not commit        adultery.
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>So if you start with “shalt not”, you randomly choose “kill.”, “commit”, “steal.”, “bear”, or “covet” as the next word. Because “covet” appears twice in the list of possibilities, it’s twice as likely to be chosen as the next word.</p>

<p>You can see how we’ve included capital letters and punctuation in the words. This keeps the word-splitting simpler, but it also means the generated output will automatically generate “sentences” with capitalization and punctuation that actually occurred in the input. It’s quite a neat trick!</p>

<p>What does the generated output look like? Let’s try it using the Ten Commandments input above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt
not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not covet thy
neighbours house, thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not covet
thy neighbours house, thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not commit
adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the problem with using such a small input text is that the output is often a verbatim copy of the input text – or something randomly close to it.</p>

<p>If you use a larger input text, you get much more interesting output.</p>

<h2 id="some-better-examples">Some better examples</h2>

<p>Below are some more fun outputs using larger input texts. We’ll generate 100 words from each input. The books were sourced from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>.</p>

<h3 id="using-my-articles">Using my articles</h3>

<p>Using the <a href="https://benhoyt.com/writings/">articles I’ve written</a> as input:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Especially if you need to return a value, but are now very flat – almost 5x as fast. Still, if you need a custom exception; use built-in exceptions if appropriate. Only break backwards compatibility if you’re on Linux, this uses the x86’s SSE/SIMD instructions to process CSV using AWK, such as <code>NF</code> are read-only in AWKGo. What does “Pythonic” mean? That’s a lot of fun. My recommendation: roll your own type-safe <code>OrderedMap&lt;int&gt;</code>. But because Lox strings don’t support escape sequences, there’s no <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, and you have it! A minimalist Make in one of its revenue comes from the…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love how it captures most of my technical interests: performance, idiomatic code, backwards compatibility, AWK, CSV, little languages, and so on. It’s no ChatGPT, but if you squint the text looks quite plausible!</p>

<p>Note how the output even includes valid Markdown from the input (though I removed a couple of links).</p>

<h3 id="using-alice-in-wonderland">Using <em>Alice in Wonderland</em></h3>

<p>Here’s one using Lewis Carroll’s <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> as input. The book is more or less nonsense to begin with, so this almost works:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the cakes, and was
delighted to find that her flamingo was gone in a great hurry; “and
their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they can’t prove I did:
there’s no use denying it. I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on
messages next!” And she opened the door began sneezing all at once.
The Dormouse had closed its eyes again, to see what was going off into
a large fan in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the hand,
it hurried off, without waiting for the limited right of replacement…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-the-old-testament-from-the-king-james-bible">Using the Old Testament (from the King James Bible)</h3>

<p>Note how the output includes (nonsensical) verse numbers, which were part of the input.</p>

<p>Look for the roast the king of Babylon gets!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Berachiah, the son of Jehoiakim king of
Gomorrah, and toward the holy gods is in your own will. 22:30 On the
south in the porch of the sea, over against the mount out of the LORD
shall smite the waves thereof. 107:26 They mount up to mount up to
bury them, them, their children, shewing to the priest; 13:17 And the
king of Babylon roasted in the name of the dust. 18:1 Then answered
one of them, did Joshua take, and put his hand over the servants of
Saul my father nor my life from perishing by…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-the-new-testament-from-the-king-james-bible">Using the New Testament (from the King James Bible)</h3>

<p>Kind of funny that the New Testament output starts with “Moses”, a key Old Testament figure (but whose name appears 80 times in the New Testament too).</p>

<p>My computer also seems rather heretical: “we have preached the word of the body is the will of man”.</p>

<p>And yes, <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/throughly">“throughly”</a> is an (archaic) word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Moses, ye would that we dwell in them. 2:11 Wherefore remember, that
by my voice against them. 20:20 And they said, Is not this he that
humbleth himself shall be given, and he will throughly purge his
floor, and gather the wheat into the sea, and get victuals: for we
have preached the word of the body is the will of man, it shall be:
but we have sent for me? 10:30 And Jesus went into the kingdom of God.
5:6 Let no man may say, Thou fool, that he was nigh to Joppa, and the
other side. 10:33 But whosoever shall…</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="using-the-war-of-the-worlds">Using <em>The War of the Worlds</em></h3>

<p>And one more, for good measure. This is using <em>The War of the Worlds</em>, by H. G. Wells.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At Halliford I had the appearance of that blackness looks on a Derby
Day. My brother turned down towards the iron gates of Hyde Park. I had
seen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and
in the pit—that the man drove by and stopped at the fugitives, without
offering to help. The inn was closed, as if by a man on a bicycle,
children going to seek food, and told him it would be a cope of lead
to him, therefore. That, indeed, was the dawn of the houses facing the
river to Shepperton, and the others. An insane resolve possessed…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With insane resolve, let’s now look at the Python code I used to implement this.</p>

<h2 id="python-implementation">Python implementation</h2>

<p>First, here’s the full program – it’s 24 lines with blanks and comments, 16 without:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>collections</span><span>,</span> <span>random</span><span>,</span> <span>sys</span><span>,</span> <span>textwrap</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>You can judge for yourself, but I think it’s fairly readable.</p>

<p>The program expects the number of words as a command-line argument (<code>sys.argv[1]</code>), and the input text on standard input. To run it, use a command like this:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ python3 markov.py 100 &lt;AliceInWonderland.txt 
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the cakes, and was
...
</code></pre></div>

<p>The code is also available as a GitHub Gist: <a href="https://gist.github.com/benhoyt/619cf3113866450aa31d8a2c1f8e01dc">markov.py</a>. This program is hardly original – I hereby give you permission to do whatever you want with it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I find it fascinating that a simple data structure and a random number generator can produce such interesting output.</p>

<p>I also think the trick of including capital letters and punctuation in the recorded “words” is quite clever. It’s not a trick at all, of course, but an elegant design choice that makes the program simpler <em>and</em> the output better. I wonder how many similar design choices are hiding in existing programs, waiting to be simplified?</p>

<p>Have fun generating text from your own inputs!</p>

<p>I’d love it if you <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/benhoyt/">sponsored me on GitHub</a> – it will motivate me to work on my open source projects and write more good content. Thanks!</p>
