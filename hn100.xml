      <!-- First artwork/project -->
      <article>

  
  

        <div><p>
            Sometime during winter 2024, I found myself at a thrift store. I was staring at rows of appliances, 
            wrapped in plastic and clinging to life, trying to answer one question: which of these is the right 
            chassis for a retro gaming computer?
            </p><p>
            Driving home, I took corners carefully, checking that the General Electric (GE) drip coffee maker I’d 
            chosen was safe in the backseat. The coffee maker's given name was Coffeematic.  Circa 1980, 
            it is boxy yet athletic – unfazed by any considerations of future internet connectivity. Best, it is perfect for being hacked.
            </p><p>
            Coffeematic is now Coffeematic PC – part gaming computer, part coffee maker. 
            A newly synthesized machine percolating processes well beyond its original configuration. 
            <span>Coffeematic PC is part of a lineage of coffee maker computers made since 2002</span>. 
            I'll describe that fascinating lineage here, and how it inspired an art exhibition called <a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/Sparklines.html">Sparklines</a> 
            where hand-drafted data visualizations accompany Coffeematic PC.
            <br>

<a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/images/coffeematic-pc-final-build-doug-macdowell.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="View full-size image of Coffeematic PC by Doug MacDowell">

</a></p></div><p>
            Profound and poetically articulated. Elegant and assertive. Highly scaleable with dynamic acceleration. 
            No. These do not describe Coffeematic PC or its peers (one of those phrases describes a bottle of wine.)
            A custom built computer can be basic and functional, or an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJMYik2ptvJ/">elaborate, absurd, 
            spinning piece of art.</a>  <span>Coffeematic PC falls somewhere in that spectrum 
            while also being nearly self-destructive.</span>
        </p>
        <br>

<img src="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/images/coffeematic-pc-in-progress-doug-macdowell.jpeg" alt="Coffeematic PC, a coffee maker computer in progress on artist Doug MacDowell’s workspace" width="600" height="800" loading="lazy">


      
      <p>
        This is how Coffeematic PC works. 
        <span>The computer is fully functional. The coffee maker is too</span>, 
        it percolates Java like a regular coffee maker. Very hot Java. 
        Computers usually use fans or liquid cooling systems to reduce heat. 
        Coffeematic PC uses the hot Java it brews to heat? cool? caffeinate? the computer. 
        A pump takes the hot, caffenated slurry (~90C/194F) 
        and circulates it thru two radiators sitting on top of Coffeematic PC's crown -&gt; 
        down to a central processing unit (CPU) tucked within an ASUS M2NPV-VM 
        motherboard snugly strapped to Coffeematic PC's back. 
        Java continues through an artery returning to Coffeematic PC's caraffe.
        The process repeats until Java is integrated with the user or the machine is powered off.
      </p>
      <br>

    <p>
    ↑ Coffeematic PC has a dedicated pump to aggressively dispense Java for user.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    CPU's are meant to be cool and Java hot. <span>Despite circulating hot Java, 
      Coffeematic PC does not crash.</span>
    To understand more, I wrote command line code to gather data on Coffeematic PC every 5 seconds, 
    and monitored Coffeematic PC for 75 minutes.
    The graph below shows the results. 
    The machine is just barely non-destructive. <span>Coffeematic PC's CPU, body, 
    and circulatory system eventually find equilibrium. A warm 33C/91F - 
    amazingly close to the temperature of the slurry that flows through you and me.</span>

  <div><p>
    An important part of this project is the lineage of coffee maker computers. 
    Before discussing that, <span>
    this is how Coffeematic PC was made.</span>
    The build is a mix of discarded electronics and newly purchased 
    hardware, pumps, and radiators. The motherboard, CPU, RAM, and graphics card are from the mid 2000's and were 
    sourced from a recycling center. This is a parts list for Coffeematic PC.

<p>
I spent about a month designing and building Coffeematic PC with the help from my beautiful fiance. 
<span>The build traverses time</span>. The coffee maker is from the late 1970's, the motherboard, CPU, and graphics card from the 2000's, and 
the SSD, operating system, and hardware from the today's (2020's). The General Electric coffee maker needed only a minor repair of 
replacing a small vinyl tube that had cracked. It takes awhile to brew a pot of coffee, but once it is brewed... it tastes like 
coffee made from a plastic coffee maker from the 1970's. I'lllll drink it!

  <p><span>The lineage of coffee maker computer builds spans 
    22 years with a curious 15 year gap in the middle.</span> 
    I'm not the first person to synthesize a coffee maker and a computer. 
    But, I think I am the first to use hot Java as a cooling method. The graph below shows the lineage of 
    coffee maker computers. There are a total of 5.  In 2002 Nick Pelis built the first ever coffee maker computer named 
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20131210043642/http://themodzoo.com/forum/index.php?/topic/931-the-caffeine-machine/" target="_blank">The Caffeine Machine</a>. 
    Then, the builds went cold for 15 years until 2018, when a person named Ali “THE CRE8OR” Abbas collaborated with a company named 
    Zotac to make the 
    <a href="https://thecre8or.de/mekspresso.htm" target="_blank">Zotac Mekspresso</a> 
    to feature in a trade show. One year after in 2019, a man whose username is Logarythm made the 
    <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/b/mngwrH" target="_blank">Mr. Coffee PC</a>. This unassuming build is perhaps 
    my favorite. 
    5 years later, after COVID-19, NerdForge, a youtube channel specializing on fun builds, built a 
    <a href="https://youtu.be/oSVPkuplVRY" target="_blank">"PC that 
      makes coffee"</a>. During this time I was making 
      <a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/Percolating%20Human%20Computer%20Interaction,%202024.html" target="_blank">Coffeematic PC</a>.
    </p>

Were people tired of 
      drinking coffee?</span> I don't think so. We're people tired of building fun computers? Were they distracted? Could they not afford it?
      I'm not sure. But something is wrong. There should be a steady output of absurd coffee maker computers being made. 
      What happened in those 15 years? To look into it I created the graph above. It shows a timeline of 
      coffee maker computers along with important events compiled from the 
      <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/timeline/computers/" target="_blank">The Timeline of Computer History</a> 
      from the Computer History Museum. Of course, there are many important things that happened worldwide between 2002 and 2018 like 
      war, natural disasters, financial crisis, shootings, refugee crisis, and the apocalypse in 2012 determined by the end of 
      the Mayan calendar. Its too much to capture in this dinky graph. But maybe focusing on tech, and the culture of tech, 
      can reveal something about this large gap in absurd creativity. Do you see any trends?
      </p><p>

        Coffeematic PC inspired an art exhibition called <a href="https://www.dougmacdowell.com/sparklines.html">Sparklines</a>. In Sparklines I elaborate on 
        the curious 15 year gap in coffee maker computers being built and create data portraits of a group of people I call 
        artist-hackers. The work is all drawn by hand using drafting tools and a vintage lettering kit. Check it out at the link 
        above!
        
        Do you know of any other coffee maker computer builds that I missed?

OpenAI was informed that its access was cut off due to violating the terms of service.</p><p>“Claude Code has become the go-to choice for coders everywhere, and so it was no surprise to learn OpenAI's own technical staff were also using our coding tools ahead of the launch of GPT-5,” Anthropic spokesperson Christopher Nulty said in a statement to WIRED. “Unfortunately, this is a direct violation of our terms of service.”</p><p>According to Anthropic’s <a data-offer-url="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms&quot;}" href="https://www.anthropic.com/legal/commercial-terms" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">commercial terms of service</a>, customers are barred from using the service to “build a competing product or service, including to train competing AI models” or “reverse engineer or duplicate” the services.

This allowed the company to run tests to evaluate Claude’s capabilities in things like coding and creative writing against its own AI models, and check how Claude responded to safety-related prompts involving categories like CSAM, self-harm, and defamation, the sources say.

    <p>Recently, “the bitter lesson” is having a moment. Coined in <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">an essay by Rich Sutton</a>, the bitter lesson is that, “general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.” Why is the lesson bitter? Sutton writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning. The eventual success is tinged with bitterness, and often incompletely digested, because it is success over a favored, human-centric approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sutton walks through how the fields of computer chess, computer go, speech recognition, and computer vision have all experienced the bitter lesson.</p>

<p>Lately, people have been citing the bitter lesson a lot.</p>

<h3 id="a-blow-to-the-human-ego">A Blow to the Human Ego</h3>

<p>The first time I read “The Bitter Lesson”, I thought of <a href="https://feministstudies.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.php?uid=haraway">Donna Haraway</a>, one of my professors at UCSC. During a seminar on the history of science, she presented her list of the <strong>four major blows to the human ego</strong> (<a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2013/10/26/the-5-blows-to-the-human-ego.html">which I previously wrote about</a>):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution">The Copernican Revolution</a>, which allowed us to realize we weren’t the center of the universe.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Origin_of_Species">Darwinian thought</a>, which allowed us to realize we weren’t separate from animals.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_mind#Freud.27s_view_of_the_unconscious">Freud’s ideas of the unconscious</a>, which allowed us to realize that we weren’t in full control of our selves.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg">Cyborgs</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot">robots</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automaton">automatons</a>, which allowed us to realize that non-humans could do the work of humans.</li>
</ul>

<p>These concepts undermined humans’ imagined central position in the universe.</p>

<p>The bitter lesson slots in naturally here; really a sub-point of <em>cyborgs</em>, a topic which Haraway has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Cyborg_Manifesto">exploring for decades</a>. Within this framework, it’s easy to believe! My instinctual belief reminds me of an exchange from a <a href="https://radiolab.org/podcast/91522-its-not-about-you/transcript">2010 RadioLab segment with Neil deGrasse Tyson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>ROBERT KRULWICH:</strong> Is it your working bias that if I came to you with a new discovery in which we were less important, or a discovery which proposed that we were more important, that you would guess that my scientific discovery that said we are less important is more likely to be right?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON:</strong> No doubt about it. That’s correct. Now you call that a bias, but I don’t. I call that track record.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="bitter-skepticism">Bitter Skepticism</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, the bitter lesson landed on my LinkedIn feed this week. Among the emoji-laden bulleted lists and grindset slop was a new Ethan Mollick piece, “<a href="https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/the-bitter-lesson-versus-the-garbage">The Bitter Lesson versus The Garbage Can</a>”. In it, Mollick contrasts the step-by-step way businesses are building agents with the reality of business processes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One thing you learn studying (or working in) organizations is that they are all actually a bit of a mess. In fact, one classic organizational theory is actually called the Garbage Can Model. This views organizations as chaotic “garbage cans” where problems, solutions, and decision-makers are dumped in together, and decisions often happen when these elements collide randomly, rather than through a fully rational process. Of course, it is easy to take this view too far - organizations do have structures, decision-makers, and processes that actually matter. It is just that these structures often evolved and were negotiated among people, rather than being carefully designed and well-recorded.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Garbage Can represents a world where unwritten rules, bespoke knowledge, and complex and undocumented processes are critical. It is this situation that makes AI adoption in organizations difficult, because even though 43% of American workers have used AI at work, they are mostly doing it in informal ways, solving their own work problems. Scaling AI across the enterprise is hard because traditional automation requires clear rules and defined processes; the very things Garbage Can organizations lack.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The bitter lesson is about to be rediscovered, Mollick suggests. “If AI agents can train on outputs alone, any organization that can define quality and provide enough examples might achieve similar results, whether they understand their own processes or not,” he writes. Org charts and workflows are UX for us humans, unneeded by our agents.</p>

<p>But while I found myself quickly accepting the original bitter lesson essay, Mollick’s essay triggered my inner skeptic. Two practical issues immediately arose:</p>

<p><strong>The bitter lesson is dependent on high-quality data.</strong></p>

<p>Data has an embedded perspective. It is not objective. Further, data is <em>reductive</em>, a shadow of the information it represents. And many things resist being reduced to data points<sup id="fnref:haraway" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:haraway" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Without sufficient data, the bitter lesson cannot be learned.</p>

<p>When Mollick writes, “any organization that can define quality and provide enough examples might achieve similar results,” I immediately focus on the word “can”. Most organizations I’ve encountered have an incredibly hard time defining their objectives <em>firmly</em> and <em>clearly</em>, if they’re able to at all.</p>

<p>Already, companies rely on goal-setting metrics or rubrics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results">OKRs</a> to attempt to measure that which resists measurement. These can be helpful, but their reductive nature leads to gaming<sup id="fnref:goog" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:goog" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Any metrics organizations use to optimize agents with likely be argued over, squishy, and inadequate.</p>

<p>Unlike the workplace, the fields Sutton cites as having met the bitter lesson are ones where the objective is easy to quantify. Victory in go and chess is clear, speech can be directly matched to written text, and most subjects in images can be easily annotated. It’s okay if you find a way to game the system to win a chess game; the rules are air tight.</p>

<p>Further, these fields can be easily represented with data – which is necessary for any general program that needs to learn how to achieve the quantifiable goal. Even <em>if</em> a company can give a clear, firm definition of quality, it still has to figure out how to measure all the interactions involved in producing this output. Otherwise, the program has no ideas what levers if can pull.</p>

<p>If we wish to teach agent-builders the bitter lesson, we need to get better at defining outputs concretely that are resistant to reward hacking (even if they’re not perfect, as <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/07/31/how-kimi-rl-ed-qualitative-data-to-write-better.html">we explored yesterday</a>) and figure out how to represent “Garbage Can” organizations with data.</p>

<p><strong>Adding compute is often not practical nor optimal.</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of chess, to illustrate his point, Mollick used both Manus and ChatGPT Agent Mode to create charts documenting the performance of human and computer chess play over time. Here’s ChatGPT’s:</p>

<p><img src="https://www.dbreunig.com/img/chatgpt_agent_chess.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you’re a chess nerd, you might catch how this plot undermines the bitter lesson: <strong><a href="https://stockfishchess.org/">Stockfish</a>, the top performing program since 2020 is <em>not</em> an example of a, “general method that leverages computation.”</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://yellow-apartment-148.notion.site/AI-Search-The-Bitter-er-Lesson-44c11acd27294f4495c3de778cd09c8d">Aidan McLaughlin explains</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stockfish always had clever search algorithms, but in 2019, its ability to grind out billions of positions didn’t matter because its understanding of each position was kneecapped by human creators. To fix this, the Stockfish team heisted Leela’s deep learning techniques and trained a model hundreds of times smaller than the top Leela model.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>After they trained their tiny model, they threw it into their search pipeline, and Stockfish crushed Leela overnight. The Stockfish team utterly rejected scaling laws. They went backward and made a smaller model. But, because their search algorithm was more efficient, took better advantage of hardware, and saw further, they won.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leela_Chess_Zero">Leela</a> is a deep learning model that, “started with no intrinsic chess-specific knowledge other than the basic rules of the game.” It learned by playing chess, at an absurd scale, until it was the best in the world. A true example of the bitter lesson.</p>

<p>Then Stockfish adopted a small, purpose-built search model inside its conventional chess program. Today, Stockfish remains unbeaten – and can run on your iPhone. By not embracing compute as the primary lever, the Stockfish team not only delivered quality, but delivered something everyone can use, often.</p>

<p>We’re starting to see hints that this pattern might be coming for our best AI benchmarks. <a href="https://arcprize.org/">ARC-AGI-1</a>, a highly-respected reasoning benchmark, saw its first breakout high score from OpenAI’s o3, <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2024/12/20/the-new-game-in-town.html">last December</a>. This score supported the compute component of the bitter lesson: OpenAI reportedly spent ~$30,000 <em>per task</em> to achieve this milestone. Since this score, ARC has added a “cost per task” metric to their leaderboard, and made efficiency a requirement for their grand prize.</p>

<p>But 3 weeks ago, <a href="https://sapient.inc/">Sapient</a> published a “<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21734">Hierarchical Reasoning Model</a>” (HRM), that achieves a 40.3 score on ARC-AGI-1 with only <em>27 million parameters</em> – besting large models like o3-mini-high and Claude 3.7. (As a reminder, LLM model parameter counts are measured in the billions.) HRM achieves this feat<sup id="fnref:sapient" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sapient" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> with a handful of new techniques, but also each model is trained for only a specific task: the model that scored highly on ARC was trained on 1,000 ARC problems. It’s not built for general use.</p>

<p>A model like HRM could likely run on your phone, just like Stockfish. These aren’t general purpose programs, and they’re not excelling with copious compute. Further, Stockfish is incredibly practical! It can be run basically anywhere (which is actually a growing problem in the online chess scene…) While the bitter lesson did demonstrate new mechanisms for search humans wouldn’t have anticipated, wrapping those in human-knowledge-based rules proves both more performant and practical.</p>

<hr>

<p>The bitter lesson is an <em>incredibly</em> well written essay. And the argument it makes is compelling because of its simplicity.</p>

<p>But like any rule of thumb, it’s imperfect when it meets the real world. I embrace the idea that general methods that leverage computation will lead us to new ideas and techniques. For many domains, once we understand these mechanisms we can apply them in focused, efficient applications.</p>

<p>And of course – this is entirely dependent on our ability to represent our challenges as data. We can easily model chess and annotate images, but modeling workplace dynamics is much harder.</p>

<p>For those building agents and other AI-powered applications today, it’s good to keep in mind the bitter lesson. Consider where <a href="https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/05/27/will-the-model-eat-your-stack.html">the model might eat your stack</a>, but don’t be afraid to thoughtfully apply custom, human-crafted logic or embrace non-general models to get the job done. And remember: compute is a constraint.&nbsp;Don’t let the bitter lesson stand in the way of actually <em>running</em> your tool. Slightly less accuracy at a fraction of the cost is often the best way.</p>

Sparse attention offers a promising direction for improving efficiency while maintaining model capabilities. We present NSA, a Natively trained Sparse Attention mechanism that integrates algorithmic innovations with hardware-aligned optimizations to achieve efficient long-context modeling. NSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context awareness and local precision. Our approach advances sparse attention design with two key innovations: (1) We achieve substantial speedups through arithmetic intensity-balanced algorithm design, with implementation optimizations for modern hardware. (2) We enable end-to-end training, reducing pretraining computation without sacrificing model performance. As shown in Figure 1, experiments show the model pretrained with NSA maintains or exceeds Full Attention models across general benchmarks, long-context tasks, and instruction-based reasoning. Meanwhile, NSA achieves substantial speedups over Full Attention on 64k-length sequences across decoding, forward propagation, and backward propagation, validating its efficiency throughout the model lifecycle.</span></p></div><dl><dt>Anthology ID:</dt><dd>2025.acl-long.1126</dd><dt>Volume:</dt><dd><a href="https://aclanthology.org/volumes/2025.acl-long/">Proceedings of the 63rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)</a></dd><dt>Month:</dt><dd>July</dd><dt>Year:</dt><dd>2025</dd><dt>Address:</dt><dd>Vienna, Austria</dd><dt>Editors:</dt><dd><a href="https://aclanthology.org/people/w/wanxiang-che/">Wanxiang Che</a>,

            <p>Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is the simplest form of an agent. This architecture, however, can yield agents that are “shallow” and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks. Applications like “<a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/?ref=blog.langchain.com">Deep Research</a>”, “<a href="https://manus.im/?ref=blog.langchain.com">Manus</a>”, and “<a href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code?ref=blog.langchain.com">Claude Code</a>” have gotten around this limitation by implementing a combination of four things: a planning tool, sub agents, access to a file system, and a detailed prompt.</p><p>Acknowledgements: this exploration was primarily inspired by Claude Code and reports of people using it for <a href="https://x.com/alexalbert__/status/1948765443776544885?ref=blog.langchain.com">more than just coding</a>. What about Claude Code made it general purpose, and could we abstract out and generalize those characteristics?</p><h2 id="deep-agents-in-the-wild">Deep agents in the wild</h2><p>The dominant agent architecture to emerge is also the simplest: running in a loop, calling tools.</p><p>Doing this naively, however, leads to agents that are a bit shallow. “Shallow” here refers to the agents inability to plan over longer time horizons and do more complex tasks.</p><p>Research and coding have emerged as two areas where agents have been created that buck this trend. All of the major model providers have an agent for Deep Research and for “async” coding tasks. Many startups and customers are creating versions of these for their specific vertical.</p><p>I refer to these agents as “deep agents” - for their ability to dive deep on topics. They are generally capable of planning more complex tasks, and then executing over longer time horizons on those goals.</p><p>What makes these agents good at going deep?</p><p>The core algorithm is actually the same - it’s an LLM running in a loop calling tools. The difference compared to the naive agent that is easy to build is:</p><ul><li>A detailed system prompt</li><li>Planning tool</li><li>Sub agents</li><li>File system</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.langchain.com/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-9.08.32-AM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1056" height="460" srcset="https://blog.langchain.com/content/images/size/w600/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-9.08.32-AM.png 600w, https://blog.langchain.com/content/images/size/w1000/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-9.08.32-AM.png 1000w, https://blog.langchain.com/content/images/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-30-at-9.08.32-AM.png 1056w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="characteristics-of-deep-agents">Characteristics of deep agents</h2><p><strong>Detailed system prompt</strong></p><p>Claude Code’s <a href="https://github.com/kn1026/cc/blob/main/claudecode.md?ref=blog.langchain.com">recreated system prompts</a> are long. They contain detailed instructions on how to use tools. They contain examples (few shot prompts) on how to behave in certain situations.</p><p>Claude Code is not an anomaly - most of the best coding or deep research agents have pretty complex system prompts. Without these system prompts, the agents would not be nearly as deep. Prompting matters still!</p><p><strong>Planning tool</strong></p><p>Claude Code uses a <a href="https://claudelog.com/faqs/what-is-todo-list-in-claude-code/?ref=blog.langchain.com">Todo list tool</a>. Funnily enough - this doesn’t do anything! It’s basically a no-op. It’s just context engineering strategy to keep the agent on track.</p><p>Deep agents are better at executing on complex tasks over longer time horizons. Planning (even if done via a no-op tool call) is a big component of that.</p><p><strong>Sub agents</strong></p><p>Claude Code can spawn <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents?ref=blog.langchain.com">sub agents</a>. This allows it to split up tasks. You can also create custom sub agents to have more control. This allows for <a href="https://x.com/dexhorthy/status/1950288431122436597?ref=blog.langchain.com">"context management and prompt shortcuts"</a>.</p><p>Deep agents go deeper on topics. This is largely accomplished by spinning up sub agents that specifically focused on individual tasks, and allowing those sub agents to go deep there.</p><p><strong>File System</strong></p><p>Claude Code (obviously) has access to the file system and can modify files on there, not just to complete its task but also to jot down notes. It also acts as a shared workspace for all agents (and sub agents) to collaborate on.</p><p>Manus is another example of a deep agent that makes <a href="https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus?ref=blog.langchain.com">significant use</a> of a file system for “memory”.</p><p>Deep agents run for long periods of time and accumulate a lot of context that they need to manage. Having a file system handy to store (and then later read from) is helpful for doing so.</p><h2 id="build-your-deep-agent">Build your deep agent</h2><p>In order to make it easier for everyone to build a deep agent for their specific vertical, I hacked on an open source package (<a href="https://github.com/hwchase17/deepagents?ref=blog.langchain.com" rel="noreferrer"><code>deepagents</code></a>) over the weekend.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span>Major Australian tech company Atlassian has terminated 150 staff with a pre-recorded video, as the company pushes its AI-embedded customer contact solutions.</span></p><div>
                    
<p dir="ltr"><span>Atlassian CEO and co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes sent the video titled “Restructuring the CSS Team: A Difficult Decision for Our Future” to staff on Wednesday morning (30 July), informing them that 150 staff had been made redundant. The video reportedly did not make it seem that the decision was difficult, but rather said it would allow its staff “to say goodbye”.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The video itself did not announce who was leaving, but it told employees they would have to wait 15 minutes for an email about their employment. Those who were terminated had their laptops blocked immediately. They reportedly will receive six months’ pay.</span></p>

<section>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Atlassian has always set itself as a company that doesn’t mince words and is majorly transparent, displaying the core value “Open Company, No Bullshit” in its offices around the world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>While not specifically outlined, the affected staff seem to be from the company’s European operations, with </span><em>The Australian</em><span><em> </em>saying that Cannon-Brooke’s overshared that it would be difficult to axe its European staff due to contract arrangements, but that the company had already begun moving in that direction.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The company has also embedded AI in its customer contact form.</span></p>
    





<p dir="ltr"><span>Former co-CEO and co-founder Scott Farquhar, at the same time, has said that embracing AI on a daily basis is something Australians should be doing.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“AI is going to change Australia,” he told t</span><span>he ABC.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“Every person should be using AI daily for as many things as they can.”</span></p>
    






<p dir="ltr"><span>“Like any new technology, it will feel awkward to start with, but every business person, every business leader, every government leader, and every bureaucrat should be using it.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>He also said that governments should be implementing AI more broadly.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Staff believe that Farquhar, who announced his resignation as co-CEO of Atlassian in April 2024 before stepping down in September, would have been more gentle in delivering the termination message.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“[Cannon-Brookes] is the colder person out of the couple,” said one person who saw the pre-recorded video, according to </span><em>The Australian</em><span>.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“[Farquhar] was the warmer one.”</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Commenting on the termination, Farquhar said the mass termination was due to the customer service team no longer being needed in the same capacity, as larger clients required less complex support following a move to the cloud.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Cyber Daily has reached out to Atlassian for confirmation that no Australian staff were impacted and for comment on the incident.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Atlassian closely follows </span><a href="https://www.cyberdaily.au/digital-transformation/12434-cba-cuts-at-least-45-jobs-to-make-room-for-ai-unions-furious" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Commonwealth Bank</span></a><span> (CBA), which culled at least 45 jobs as it makes room for AI.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The country’s largest bank said it would be making at least 45 roles redundant in the wake of its push to use AI, and only a month after it announced that it had launched a new customer assistance AI voice bot system.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“Our investment in technology, including AI, is making it easier and faster for customers to get help, especially in our call centres,” a CBA spokesman said regarding the voice bot.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“By automating simple queries, our teams can focus on more complex customer queries that need empathy and experience.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>“To meet the changing needs of our customers ... we review the skills we need and how we’re organised to deliver the best customer experiences and outcomes. That means some roles and work can change.”</span></p>
<hr>
<p dir="ltr"><em>Updated 31/07/25 - Atlassian says the jobs are not being replaced by AI, but that it has embedded AI in its customer service. Updated to remove claims of AI replacing jobs.</em></p></section>

Attorneys for the plaintiffs had asked the jury to award damages of around $345 million. The trial in the Southern District of Florida started on July 14.</p><p>The suit centered around who shouldered the blame for the deadly crash in Key Largo, Florida. A Tesla owner named George McGee was driving his Model S electric sedan while using the company's Enhanced Autopilot, a partially automated driving system.</p><p>While driving, McGee dropped his mobile phone that he was using and scrambled to pick it up. He said during the trial that he believed Enhanced Autopilot would brake if an obstacle was in the way. His Model S accelerated through an intersection at just over 60 miles per hour, hitting a nearby empty parked car and its owners, who were standing on the other side of their vehicle.</p><p>Naibel Benavides, who was 22, died on the scene from injuries sustained in the crash. Her body was discovered about 75 feet away from the point of impact. Her boyfriend, Dillon Angulo, survived but suffered multiple broken bones, a traumatic brain injury and psychological effects.</p><p>"Tesla designed Autopilot only for controlled access highways yet deliberately chose not to restrict drivers from using it elsewhere, alongside <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> telling the world Autopilot drove better than humans," Brett Schreiber, counsel for the plaintiffs, said in an e-mailed statement on Friday. "Tesla's lies turned our roads into test tracks for their fundamentally flawed technology, putting everyday Americans like Naibel Benavides and Dillon Angulo in harm's way."</p><p>Following the verdict, the plaintiffs' families hugged each other and their lawyers, and Angulo was "visibly emotional" as he embraced his mother, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/tesla-autopilot-crash-trial-verdict-partly-liable-rcna222344" target="_blank">according to NBC</a>. </p><p>Tesla told NBC that it plans to appeal and said, "Today's verdict is wrong and only works to set back automotive safety and jeopardize Tesla's and the entire industry's efforts to develop and implement life-saving technology."</p><p>The verdict comes as Musk, Tesla's CEO, is trying to persuade investors that his company can pivot into a leader in autonomous vehicles, and that its self-driving systems are safe enough to operate fleets of robotaxis on public roads in the U.S.</p><p>Tesla shares dipped 1.5% on Friday and are now down 25% for the year, the biggest drop among tech's megacap companies.</p><p>The verdict could set a precedent for Autopilot-related suits against Tesla. About a dozen active cases are underway focused on similar claims involving incidents where Autopilot or Tesla's FSD— Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — had been in use just before a fatal or injurious crash. </p><p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/12/13/tesla-software-fix-rolls-out-after-regulators-recall-2-million-cars-over-autopilot-defect.html">initiated</a>&nbsp;a probe in 2021 into possible safety defects in Tesla's Autopilot systems. During the course of that investigation, Tesla made changes, including a number of over-the-air software updates.</p><p>The agency then opened a second probe, which is ongoing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/tesla-must-provide-nhtsa-with-autopilot-recall-data-or-face-fines.html">evaluating</a>&nbsp;whether Tesla's "recall remedy" to resolve issues with the behavior of its Autopilot, especially around stationary first responder vehicles, had been effective.</p><p>The NHTSA has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/08/tesla-social-media-posts-falsely-say-cars-are-robotaxis-nhtsa-warns.html">also warned&nbsp;Tesla</a>&nbsp;that its social media posts may mislead drivers into thinking its cars are capable of functioning as robotaxis, even though owners manuals say the cars require hands-on steering and a driver attentive to steering and braking at all times.</p><p>A site that tracks Tesla-involved collisions, <a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/" target="_blank">TeslaDeaths.com</a>, has reported at least 58 deaths resulting from incidents where Tesla drivers had Autopilot engaged just before impact.</p><p><strong>WATCH:</strong> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/07/24/ex-tesla-board-member-tough-quarter-for-the-ev-maker.html">Tesla's tough quarter</a></p></div><div id="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108176215" data-test="VideoPlaceHolder" role="region" tabindex="0" data-vilynx-id="7000383327" aria-labelledby="Placeholder-ArticleBody-Video-108176215"><p><img src="https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108176216-17533473381753347335-40867300248-1080pnbcnews.jpg?v=1753347337&amp;w=750&amp;h=422&amp;vtcrop=y" alt="Ex-Tesla Board Member: Tough quarter for the EV-maker"><span></span><span></span></p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Here’s the fun irony: I was the founder of Trieve, the company that powered search for their 30,000+ documentation sites, yet their debounced search queries weren’t being aborted as you typed. Check out this delightful chaos:</p>

<p>I had brought this up in our shared Slack before when I was just a vendor to <del>them</del> <strong>us</strong> (weird), but it wasn’t a priority and never got fixed. It was extra frustrating because the race condition on the query was apparent enough that search would sometimes feel low quality since it would return results for a query many characters before the user was done typing.</p>
<p>Even worse, as the founder of the search company powering this experience, it felt like a poor reflection on Trieve every time someone encountered these wonky results.</p>

<p>Now that I’m on the team, I was able to finally fix it. I added an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController">AbortController</a> to the debounced search function, so that it aborts any previous queries when a new one is made. This means that the search results are always relevant to what the user is currently typing.</p>
<p>There’s something deeply satisfying about finally being able to fix the things that bug you. It reminds me of George Hotz’s legendary <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221122050324/https://twitter.com/realGeorgeHotz/status/1594908473875173377">single week at Twitter</a> in 2022, where he boldly joined with perhaps overambitious plans to fix Twitter search, got humbled by the complexity, but still managed to ship a useful login popup fix before his characteristically dramatic exit. Classic hacker hubris meeting reality, but still getting something done.</p>
<p>I’ve always admired engineers who are part hacker, part entrepreneur - people who see a problem and just… fix it. Getting to do something similar here (minus the dramatic exit) felt like a small win in steering my career toward that kind of direct approach.</p>
<h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
<p>I prefer building and using open source software whenever possible, and this whole situation is a great example of why.</p>
<p>With open source - when you encounter a bug or pain point, you can actually fix it yourself. Had this been an open source project during the year I was frustrated with the search race condition, I could have submitted a pull request with the AbortController fix and saved myself (and thousands of other users) the daily annoyance.</p>
<p>Instead, it remained a persistent irritation until I happened to join the company and gain access to the codebase. There’s something to be said for the immediate empowerment that comes with open source - though I understand why many companies choose different models for various business reasons.</p>
<h2 id="self-congratulation">Self-Congratulation</h2>
<p>If search feels just a bit crisper and more responsive on Mintlify, it’s because of me! I fixed a bug that bothered me for over a year, and it feels great to have made that little improvement to the product.</p>
<p>I can’t wait to make more. Fixing small issues like this over and over again is how products become legendary. There’s something deeply satisfying about finally having the power to fix the things that annoy you - even if they’re tiny.</p>
<p><strong>Especially if they’re tiny.</strong></p> </article>  </div></div>]]></description>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>It’s not that anyone ever said sophisticated math problems can’t be solved by teenagers who haven’t finished high school. But the odds of such a result would have seemed long.</p>
<p>Yet <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06137">a paper posted on February 10</a> left the math world by turns stunned, delighted and ready to welcome a bold new talent into its midst. Its author was <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/hannah-cairo/">Hannah Cairo</a>, just 17 at the time. She had solved a 40-year-old mystery about how functions behave, called the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture.</p>
<p>“We were all shocked, absolutely. I don’t remember ever seeing anything like that,” said <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/oliveira-itamar">Itamar Oliveira</a> of the University of Birmingham, who has spent the past two years trying to prove that the conjecture was true. In her paper, Cairo showed that it’s false. The result defies mathematicians’ usual intuitions about what functions can and cannot do.</p>
<p>So does Cairo herself, who found her way to a proof after years of homeschooling in isolation and an unorthodox path through the math world.</p>
<h2><strong>A World Without Bounds</strong></h2>
<p>Cairo grew up in Nassau, the Bahamas, where her parents had moved so that her dad could take a job as a software developer. She and her two brothers — one three years older, the other eight years younger — were all homeschooled. Cairo started learning math using Khan Academy’s online lessons, and she quickly advanced through its standard curriculum. By the time she was 11 years old, she’d finished calculus.</p>
<p>Soon she had consumed everything that was readily available online. Her parents found a couple of math professors to tutor her remotely — first Martin Magid of Wellesley College, then Amir Aazami from Clark University. But much of her education was self-directed, as she read and absorbed, on her own, the graduate-level math textbooks that her tutors recommended. “Eventually,” Cairo recalled, Aazami “said something like, he feels uncomfortable being paid, because he feels like he’s not really teaching me. Because mostly I would read the book and try to prove the theorems.”</p>

    <p>But Cairo found homeschooling confining.</p>
<p>“There was this inescapable sameness, in a way. No matter what I did, I was in the same place doing mostly the same things,” she said. “I was very isolated, and nothing I could do could really change that. I’d wake up on certain days and realize, I’m just older.”</p>
<p>Math became a kind of escape, a space that felt expansive when her daily life was not.</p>
<p>“Mathematics was another world I could explore. A world that was not confining, a world I could access at any point just by thinking about it,” she said. “That’s how I grew up, thinking about mathematics as this world of ideas that I can explore on my own. That sort of process helped me see math differently than a lot of people.”</p>
<p>In 2021, amid the Covid pandemic, Cairo’s world began to widen, even as it was narrowing for so many others. Travel restrictions stranded her family at her grandparents’ house in Chicago. While they were there, she joined the Math Circles of Chicago, where teachers and students gather to solve difficult problems together.</p>
<p>The experience led her to apply the following year to a two-week online summer program run by the Berkeley Math Circle, which has nurtured some of the most exceptional math talent in the world. In her application, she listed a set of self-taught subjects that together comprised the equivalent of an advanced undergraduate math degree. She was 14 years old.</p>

    <p>“Hannah is above and beyond the ordinary,” said <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~stankova/">Zvezdelina Stankova</a>, a mathematician at Berkeley and the founder of the Berkeley Math Circle. “Every time she applies for school or a program, she is several levels ahead.”</p>
<p>Yet these scattered experiences never convinced Cairo that she had exceptional mathematical ability. She is soft-spoken, open and humble, and seems genuinely unsure of how her ability stacks up against anyone else’s — in part because for years her only reference point was herself.</p>
<p>“Growing up, I didn’t really know if I was talented,” she said. “I like to play piano, and people around me would tell me that I was really talented at math and at piano. And in retrospect, now that I look at it, I can see, sure, my piano was above average. But it was by no means exceptional. While on the other hand, it looks like mathematically I’m, like, whatever.”</p>
<h2><strong>Finding Her Place</strong></h2>
<p>In 2023, after a second summer with the Berkeley Math Circle, Cairo wondered what her next step should be. She had already applied to several universities, and while most schools rejected her — she hadn’t finished high school yet — she was accepted by the University of California, Davis. Should she start her undergraduate studies three years early? Or should she pursue educational opportunities elsewhere?</p>
<p>Stankova encouraged her to instead participate in Berkeley’s concurrent enrollment program, where she could take graduate-level math courses from leading researchers in the field.</p>

                            <p>The math world was taken aback when Cairo announced her counterexample to the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture — both because it settled a major open problem, and because Cairo was still in high school at the time.</p>

    <p>Cairo followed this advice. In the fall of 2023, her family moved to Davis, 60 miles northeast of Berkeley. There, her older brother enrolled as a freshman at UC Davis, and her parents allowed her to commute to Berkeley on Tuesdays and Thursdays. By the spring, she was going five days a week and taking several more classes. She recalls it as a time in her life when she began to feel full of possibility.</p>
<p>“I had started making friends, and I was feeling good,” she said. After the spring semester ended, her family moved from Davis to Berkeley — her brother had decided to transfer there — and Cairo finally felt able to settle in.</p>
<p>Even so, it was an adjustment. “I didn’t have many social experiences, so I still had to learn how to interact with other humans,” she said.</p>
<p>As the 2024–2025 academic year neared, Cairo considered what courses she would take. One class in particular caught her eye — a graduate course in Fourier restriction theory, a branch of harmonic analysis. “It was one of the most advanced analysis classes being offered that semester, so I thought, I’ll just go take it,” she said.</p>

<p>The professor for the course was <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ruixiang-zhang">Ruixiang Zhang</a>, an accomplished mathematician whose path into the field had followed a more traditional arc: a gold medal at the 2008 International Mathematical Olympiad, the prestigious high school competition; a doctorate from Princeton University; a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study; a tenure-track position at Berkeley, one of the top math departments in the world.</p>
<p>Cairo emailed Zhang, asking to enroll. “Hannah was very focused and seemed to be passionate about the topic,” he said. “This attitude alone is enough for me, so I just gave her permission.”</p>
<p>Within a few weeks, while working on a problem set, she came across a problem that she couldn’t stop thinking about.</p>
<h2><strong>Extra Credit</strong></h2>
<p>The problem was a simplified version of the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture. Zhang had included it in one of his homework assignments as a warm-up, hoping to encourage students to practice advanced techniques in a deep area of math. The assignment also included an optional extension, inviting them to consider whether the proof they’d found for the simplified case could be extended to more complicated formulations of the problem.</p>
<p>Cairo completed the problem set and took Zhang up on the invitation to keep thinking. To her, it seemed natural to follow the thread of an idea as far as it would go. “Why would I stop?” she said.</p>
<p>The Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture is a problem in harmonic analysis, a field that studies how functions are assembled from wavelike components.</p>
<p>Any given function can be written as the sum of simpler wavelike pieces, called sine waves. Each of those sine waves, in turn, has a frequency. Mathematicians often want to understand the nature of functions that can only be built out of sine waves with certain frequencies. In these cases, the only permitted frequencies are those that satisfy equations that carve out specific surfaces, like a sphere. That’s because the functions that define many physical waves — such as light, sound and quantum particles — are restricted to these kinds of frequencies.</p>

    <p>The Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture considers functions built out of waves whose frequencies lie on such a surface. It states that the energy of the function — a measure of how big the function gets — can only be spread out and concentrated in particular patterns.</p>
<p>It’s as if you’re playing music in a strangely shaped room. Sometimes, the music might echo and amplify, getting very loud. But when that happens, it can only happen in certain spots.</p>
<p>Over the decades, mathematicians made limited progress on a few special cases of the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture. But the general problem remained wide open. None of the standard methods seemed able to touch it. That imperviousness made some mathematicians suspect that the conjecture was false; others felt that its elegance made it more likely to be true.</p>
<p>“Some mornings, I’d wake up with the idea that because it’s so simply and elegantly stated, and it’s so broad, in the end it had to be true,” said Tony Carbery, a mathematician at the University of Edinburgh who worked on the problem for decades. “Other mornings, I’d wake up and say … it can’t possibly be true in any simpleminded way.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians found themselves at an impasse.</p>

<p>In the path toward a proof of any hard problem, there’s a lot of doubt. Mathematicians doubt their approaches, doubt their intuitions, doubt that the idea they’re following — so promising in the moment — will actually hold up.</p>
<p>In Cairo’s case, those doubts were amplified. She was new to the field, and her early efforts to prove the full conjecture were tentative and incomplete. She questioned whether she was headed in the right direction. So did Zhang.</p>

    <p>“I went to office hours and asked him, ‘Do these ideas work?’ It turned out they didn’t because they were silly,” she said. “There’d be this back-and-forth. I’d come to office hours with new ideas and ask if they work. And he’d say no.”</p>
<p>Cairo kept reading and thinking. Eventually, she found a way to construct a strange, complicated function out of waves whose frequencies all lay on a curved surface — the type of surface the conjecture required. Usually, when you add these kinds of waves together, they interfere, canceling each other out in some places and reinforcing each other elsewhere.</p>
<p>But Cairo showed that in her function, they didn’t cancel out as expected. Instead, their interference created uneven patterns, causing the function’s energy to spread out over some areas and concentrate in others in a fractal-like way that the Mizohata-Takeuchi conjecture prohibited. She found herself staring at a mathematical construction that by many accounts shouldn’t exist.</p>
<p>At first it made her wary. “This is something that happens to me often,” she said. “I come to something that looks like a proof, and I think I have a proof, but [then] I’ve actually been wrong.”</p>
<p>Then two things happened. The first was that she realized she could replace her complicated construction with a much simpler one and achieve the same result.</p>
<p>The other was that she convinced herself, and Zhang, that the result was right.</p>
<p>“Cairo’s paper is a great example of how natural and elegant conjectures can fail in ways we didn’t think of,” Oliveira said. “But to see that, we need to look through the right lenses.”</p>
<h2><strong>A New Landscape</strong></h2>
<p>The proof, and its unlikely author, have energized the math community since Cairo posted it in February. “I was absolutely, ‘Wow.’ This has been my favorite problem for nigh on 40 years, and I was completely blown away,” Carbery said. “When I found out [Cairo] was much younger than I previously thought, I was much more impressed. The elegance with which the paper is written is quite extraordinary.”</p>
<p>Mathematicians are excited about how Cairo’s work will inspire new research. “I am certain that, from now on, whenever we come upon a problem of similar flavor, we will try to test it against Cairo-like constructions,” Oliveira said.</p>
        
        
<p>He and others in the harmonic analysis community will also have to reckon with a changed landscape. In harmonic analysis, there’s a <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-tower-of-conjectures-that-rests-upon-a-needle-20230912/">constellation of questions</a> about how the energy of a wave concentrates. If a conjecture known as Stein’s conjecture were true, it would cement connections between some of the most important questions in that broader constellation. But Cairo’s work shows that Stein’s conjecture is false. It eliminates one of the most promising links mathematicians had hoped to establish between different parts of harmonic analysis.</p>
<p>The math world is also adjusting to the fact of Cairo herself. After completing the proof, she decided to apply straight to graduate school, skipping college (and a high school diploma) altogether. As she saw it, she was already living the life of a graduate student. Cairo applied to 10 graduate programs. Six rejected her because she didn’t have a college degree. Two admitted her, but then higher-ups in those universities’ administrations overrode those decisions.</p>
<p>Only the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins University were willing to welcome her straight into a doctoral program. She’ll start at Maryland in the fall. When she finishes, it will be her first degree.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
							<p><span>Linda Martin found out the hard way that the most powerful law enforcement agency in the U.S.—the FBI—can seize your assets without articulating why. Worse: Law enforcement took her savings in a raid that was itself unconstitutional. Worse still: A lawsuit she filed met its demise last week, allowing the federal government to continue the dubious practice of taking people's valuables without having to explain the reason it is justified in doing so.</span></p>
<p><span>The agency never did furnish a specific reason in Martin's case—because she wasn't charged with a crime. Her saga began in 2021, when the FBI sought to take more than $100 million in assets from U.S. Private Vaults, a business that offered safe-deposit boxes. That company was suspected of, and ultimately charged with, criminal wrongdoing. But the warrant expressly </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20700649-21-notice-of-motion-and-motion-for-return-of-property-pursuant-to-fed-r-crim-p-41g/#document/p10"><span>forbade</span></a><span> agents from engaging in a "criminal search or seizure" of customers' boxes, like Martin's.</span></p>
<p><span>They did so anyway, rummaging through approximately 800 of them and seizing assets that belonged to a <a href="https://reason.com/2021/06/11/fbi-raid-safety-deposit-boxes-los-angeles-jennifer-paul-snitko-85-million-civil-forfeiture/">slew of innocent people.</a> That included Travis May, who stored gold and $63,000 in cash; Jeni Verdon-Pearsons and Michael Storc, who kept $2,000 in cash, as well as approximately $20,000 worth of silver; Paul and Jennifer Snitko, whose box contained personal items, like marriage, birth, and baptismal certificates; and Don Mellein, who had invested in gold coins, many of which the FBI said it lost (to the tune of over $100,000).</span></p>
<p><span>A federal court later ruled that the bureau's actions <a href="https://reason.com/2024/01/23/appeals-court-fbis-safe-deposit-box-seizures-violated-fourth-amendment/">violated the Fourth Amendment</a>. </span><span>But it was too late for Martin, who received notice that the FBI had taken $40,200, her life savings, from her box. To justify that, the notice listed hundreds of federal crimes that would lead to a seizure. As Institute for Justice (I.J.) Director of Media Relations Andrew Wimer </span><a href="https://x.com/andrewwimer/status/1948831860622053716"><span>points out</span></a><span>, that included things like copyright infringement and doing business with North Korea. But the bureau notably did not specify how Martin was supposedly connected to any of those offenses, because it is not required to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>So she sued. "When the FBI attempts to forfeit someone's property, due process requires that it say why, citing </span><i><span>specific facts and laws</span></i><span>," reads her appellant </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CADC-15-Brief-of-Appellant.pdf"><span>brief</span></a><span>. "By sending notices that initiate and, often, consummate property's forfeiture—all without ever saying what exactly the FBI thinks justifies the forfeiture, the FBI deprives owners of crucial information they need to protect their rights." After she filed the lawsuit, and about two years post-seizure, the agency returned Martin's cash. But she continued in court in hopes that the judiciary would agree that the FBI was violating people's due process rights by seizing assets with effectively no explanation.</span></p>
<p><span>That died last week, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia </span><a href="https://media.cadc.uscourts.gov/opinions/docs/2025/07/24-5144-2126635.pdf"><span>dismissed</span></a><span> the suit for lack of jurisdiction.</span></p>
<p><span>"The FBI took Linda's savings without clearly saying what she did wrong. That shouldn't happen in America, but taking on the entrenched federal civil forfeiture system is challenging," said Bob Belden, an attorney at I.J. (which represented Martin), in a statement via email. "Unfortunately, there is not a clear path to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. We know that several Justices are alarmed at how civil forfeiture works in America and hope that the right case will work its way to the Court."</span></p>
<p><span>Robert Frommer, a senior attorney at I.J., </span><a href="https://reason.com/2025/03/20/the-fbi-seized-this-womans-life-savings-without-telling-her-why/"><span>told</span></a><span> me in March that "without specific notice, property owners can't understand what this is all about, and therefore can't do any investigation or get meaningful advice from attorneys." That helps explain, he says, why the agency is so successful at avoiding scrutiny for its seizures. "Owners must decide whether to fight against the federal government, default, or plead for mercy, all without knowing why the FBI is doing this to them," he says. "It's therefore little surprise that 93% of federal forfeitures never get to a court, meaning the FBI gets to keep the money without ever telling anyone why they should be allowed to"—which, at least for now, will remain the status quo.</span></p>

<em>An observation on Software Engineering</em>

<p>Put succinctly, the observation is this:</p>
<blockquote>With a sufficient number of users of an API,<br>
it does not matter what you promise in the contract:<br>
all observable behaviors of your system<br>
will be depended on by somebody.</blockquote>

<p>Over the past couple years of doing low-level infrastructure migrations in one of the most complex software systems on the planet, I’ve made some observations about the differences between an interface and its implementations.  We typically think of the interface as an abstraction for interacting with a system (like the steering wheel and pedals in a car), and the implementation as the way the system does its work (wheels and an engine).  This is useful for a number of reasons, foremost among them that most useful systems rapidly become too complex for a single individual or group to completely understand, and abstractions are essential to managing that complexity.</p>

<p>Defining the correct level of abstraction is a completely separate discussion (see Mythical Man-Month), but we like to think that once an abstraction is defined, it is concrete.  In other words, an interface should theoretically provide a clear separation between consumers of a system and its implementers.  In practice, this theory breaks down as the use of a system grows and its users start to rely upon implementation details intentionally exposed through the interface, or which they divine through regular use.  Spolsky’s “Law of Leaky Abstractions” embodies consumers’ reliance upon internal implementation details.</p>

<p>Taken to its logical extreme, this leads to the following observation, colloquially referred to as “The Law of Implicit Interfaces”: Given enough use, there is no such thing as a private implementation.  That is, if an interface has enough consumers, they will collectively depend on every aspect of the implementation, intentionally or not.  This effect serves to constrain changes to the implementation, which must now conform to both the explicitly documented interface, as well as the implicit interface captured by usage.  We often refer to this phenomenon as "bug-for-bug compatibility."</p>

<p>The creation of the implicit interface usually happens gradually, and interface consumers generally aren’t aware as it’s happening.  For example, an interface may make no guarantees about performance, yet consumers often come to expect a certain level of performance from its implementation.  Those expectations become part of the implicit interface to a system, and changes to the system must maintain these performance characteristics to continue functioning for its consumers.</p>

<p>Not all consumers depend upon the same implicit interface, but given enough consumers, the implicit interface will eventually exactly match the implementation.  At this point, the interface has evaporated: the implementation has become the interface, and any changes to it will violate consumer expectations.  With a bit of luck, widespread, comprehensive, and automated testing can detect these new expectations but not ameliorate them.</p>

<p>Implicit interfaces result from the organic growth of large systems, and while we may wish the problem did not exist, designers and engineers would be wise to consider it when building and maintaining complex systems.  So be aware of how the implicit interface constrains your system design and evolution, and know that for any reasonably popular system, the interface reaches much deeper than you think.</p>

<h3>Who's Hyrum?</h3>
<p>I'm a Principal Scientist at Adobe, and before that, a software engineer at Google.  I work on large-scale code change tooling and infrastructure, and spent several years improving Google's core C++ libraries.  The above observation grew out of experiences when even the simplest library change caused failures in some far off system.</p>

<p>While I may have made the observation, credit goes to Titus Winters for actually naming it as "Hyrum's Law" and popularizing the concept more broadly.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>






<p>
The intent of the developers is to support SQLite through
the year 2050.

</p><p>
At this writing, 2050 is still 25 years in the future.
Nobody knows what will happen in that time, and we cannot
absolutely promise that SQLite will be viable or useful that
far out.
But we can promise this: we plan as if we will be
supporting SQLite until 2050.
That long-term outlook affects our
decisions in important ways.

</p><ul>
<li><p>
<b>Cross-platform Code</b> →
SQLite runs on any platform with an 8-bit byte,
two's complement 32-bit and 64-bit integers, 
and a C compiler.  It is actively
tested on all currently popular CPUs and operating
systems.
The extreme portability of the SQLite code and file
format will help it remain viable on future platforms.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Stable, Cross-platform Database Files</b> →
SQLite <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">database files</a> are bit-for-bit identical on
32-bit, 64-bit, big-endian, and little-endian platforms.  You
can copy an SQLite database file from one system to another
without having to translate or convert the database.
Furthermore, the file format is well documented and stable.
Database files created today will be readable and writable by
future versions of SQLite decades in the future.

</p></li><li><p>
<b><a href="https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html">Aviation-grade testing</a></b> →
Every machine-code branch instruction is tested in both
directions.  Multiple times.  On multiple platforms and with
multiple compilers.  This helps make the code robust for
future migrations.  The intense testing also means that new
developers can make experimental enhancements to SQLite and,
assuming legacy tests all pass, be reasonably sure that the
enhancement does not break legacy.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Extensive, detailed documentation</b> →
SQLite has candid, developer-friendly,
and open-source documentation.  Docs are written by and
for programmers.
(A few examples:
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/arch.html">[1]</a>

The extensive documentation helps new developers
come up to speed on SQLite very quickly.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Heavily commented source code</b> →
The SQLite source code is over 35% comment.  Not boiler-plate
comments, but useful comments that explain the meaning of variables
and objects and the intent of methods and procedures.  
The code is designed
to be accessible to new programmers and maintainable over a span
of decades.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Disaster planning</b> →
Every byte of source-code history for SQLite is cryptographically
protected and is automatically replicated to multiple
geographically separated servers, in datacenters 
owned by different companies.
Thousands of additional clones exist on private servers around the
world.
The primary developers of SQLite live in different regions of the world.
SQLite can survive a continental catastrophe.

</p></li><li><p>
<b>Old school</b> →
Nobody is completely immune to trends and fads, but the SQLite
developers work hard to avoid being sucked into the latest programming
fashion.  Our aim is to produce timeless code that will be
readable, understandable, and maintainable by programmers 
who have not yet been born.
</p></li></ul>

<p>
In addition to "supporting" SQLite through the year 2050, the developers
also promise to keep the SQLite 
<a href="https://www.sqlite.org/cintro.html">C-language API</a> and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/fileformat2.html">on-disk format</a> 
fully backwards compatible.
This means that application written to use SQLite today should be able to
link against and use future versions of SQLite released decades in the
future.

</p><p>
Our goal is to make the content you store in SQLite today as 
easily accessible to your grandchildren as it is to you.

</p><p>
<b>Update on 2018-05-31:</b>
Our goal of supporting SQLite long-term have apparently come to the
notice of the preservationist at the 
<a href="https://www.loc.gov/">US Library Of Congress</a> who have identified
SQLite as a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/locrsf.html">recommended storage format</a> for the preservation of
digital content.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people enjoy live coding interviews. I’m not one of them.</p><p>Two days ago, I stumbled upon a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sklivvz_we-ask-every-candidate-a-trivial-coding-question-activity-7356034496846094336-KHaE/">post on LinkedIn</a>:</p><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ln-post" src="https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/ln-post.png" width="693" height="479"></p></figure><p>Sounds absurd at first. Why would a senior engineer, who has been writing code for years, struggle with
something as simple as a basic algorithm? Did they suddenly forget how to code? Maybe. But I have a different
perspective.</p><h3 id="a-quick-story">A quick story
<a href="#a-quick-story">#</a></h3><p>Four years ago, I applied for <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal</a>. I passed the initial stage(s). I passed a 90-minute Codility assessment (three
problems as I recall it). Then, I failed to finish a live coding test for a full 30 minutes (more or less, I don’t
remember exactly). I revisited the test a few hours later, and I solved the problem in no time.</p><p>That was super confusing. The problem wasn’t that hard really. I was able to solve it, but failed to do so in the live
coding session.</p><p>This triggered my curiosity, and I did some research back then. Turns out it’s a well-known phenomenon in the scientific
literature. It’s all about stress.</p><h3 id="your-brain-under-stress">Your brain under stress
<a href="#your-brain-under-stress">#</a></h3><p>When you’re placed in a high-stakes, time-pressured situation, like live coding, your brain reacts exactly like it would
to any other threat. The amygdala <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29896088">gets activated</a>. Cortisol levels <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30859159/">spike</a>. Your prefrontal cortex, the part of the
brain <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28448453/">responsible</a> for complex reasoning and working memory, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19455173/">gets impaired</a>. Either mildly, moderately, or severely,
depending on the individual and their baseline stress resilience.</p><p>Working memory is the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21037165/">most reliable proxy</a> (I know of) for fluid intelligence, your ability to reason, solve novel
problems, and think abstractly. It’s what you mostly need to pass live coding tests, I believe. When your prefrontal
cortex is impaired due to stress, your working memory capacity shrinks.</p><p>For some people, especially those with even mild <em>performance anxiety</em>, it becomes nearly impossible to think clearly.
Your attention narrows. You can’t hold multiple steps in your head. You forget what you just typed a few seconds ago. It
feels like your IQ dropped by 30 points. In fact, it feels like you’re a completely different version of yourself; a
much dumber one.</p><h3 id="the-definitive-paper">The definitive paper
<a href="#the-definitive-paper">#</a></h3><p>As I was writing this post, I found a paper that absolutely surprised me. It’s a rigorous scientific study done on this
exact topic: performance during live coding.</p><p><a href="https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10196170">The paper</a> titled “Does Stress Impact Technical Interview Performance?”, and it’s co-authored by researchers at
<em>Microsoft</em>. They basically asked participants to solve a coding problem in two settings:</p><ul><li>Private setting: Alone in a room; no one watching.</li><li>Public setting: In front of a proctor, while thinking aloud.</li></ul><figure><p><img loading="lazy" alt="private-vs-public-setting" src="https://hadid.dev/posts/living-coding/private-vs-public-setting.png" width="1337" height="386"></p></figure><p>Same task. Same time limit. Just different levels of stress.</p><p>Here’s what they found: <strong>The participants being watched scored half compared to those who were alone.</strong></p><p>The cognitive performance in the public setting had both a lower average and much wider spread (high variance);
indicating that some candidates are disproportionately impaired under stress, while others perform as usual or even
slightly better. That’s why live coding is so unfair.</p><p>All of these findings are no surprise to me. But here’s a surprising finding: <strong>not a single woman in the public setting
passed</strong>, while every woman in the private setting did. So if your company wants to “support women in tech” but still
do live coding interviews… congrats, you’re running a scientifically validated exclusion filter.</p><h3 id="performance-under-stress">Performance under stress
<a href="#performance-under-stress">#</a></h3><p>I like to think of live coding as a proxy for <em>performance under stress</em>. The paper I just mentioned shares the same
view.</p><p>Some companies genuinely care about this. Some even mention it in their job descriptions. They want candidates who
perform well under pressure. If that’s the case, then sure, live coding might help.</p><p>But that’s not how most companies frame it.</p><p>Most hirings don’t mention stress resilience. They don’t describe the job as “high-pressure.” They’re not looking for
someone to “perform well under pressure.” They just want a good engineer.</p><p>The engineer who <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17880916/">froze</a> during a 30-minute LeetCode exercise might be the same person who quietly ships flawless code,
writes excellent docs, and debugs complex systems. You’re not rejecting a bad engineer, you’re rejecting someone who
doesn’t perform well while being watched.</p><p>That’s not a skill most jobs require.</p><p>Companies frame live coding as a test of your coding skills; it’s misleading. Even worse, it compounds performance
anxiety. It makes candidates believe this test is a reliable measure of their coding skills. That’s never true for most
engineers.</p><p>Live coding fails to measure what we think it measures. It’s more accurately measuring cortisol under stress than coding
skills.</p><h3 id="mitigating-the-stress">Mitigating the stress
<a href="#mitigating-the-stress">#</a></h3><p>We can’t change the fact that live coding is a common practice in tech interviews. But we can try to mitigate the stress
it causes.</p><p>The best way to desensitize your brain to stress is repeated exposure. Do mock live coding sessions that mimic the real
thing: use platforms like <a href="https://www.pramp.com/">Pramp</a>, <a href="https://interviewing.io/">Interviewing.io</a>, or <a href="https://leetcode.com/assessment">LeetCode’s mock assessment</a>.</p><p>You could also set a timer, record yourself (to simulate being “watched”), and think aloud. Gradually increase
pressure (e.g., invite a friend to watch).</p><p>I’ve also been thinking of experimenting with some supplements that I believe might help with performance under stress.</p><ul><li><p><strong>L-tyrosine</strong>: Stress depletes catecholamines, which <em>may</em> underlie the cognitive deficits we see during stressful
situations. Supplementing with L-tyrosine <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26424423/">may help</a> replenish these neurotransmitters under stress.</p></li><li><p><strong>L-theanine</strong>: An amino acid found in tea that promotes relaxation. It has been shown to <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34562208/">reduce stress</a> and improve
focus.</p></li></ul><p>I haven’t tried any of these yet (during an interview), and I’m not encouraging anyone to do so. But I think it <em>might</em>
be worth experimenting with, especially if you struggle with performance anxiety. You should definitely test it in
practice sessions first. Everyone is different, and what works for one person may not work for another.</p><p>Being bad at live coding doesn’t mean you’re a bad engineer. It means you’re human.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        The Untold Impact of Cancellation
      </h2>
      
      <p>
        I have never before been open about the impact that being cancelled had upon me. Cancellations try to silence their targets, so their stories are less often heard.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my account.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you read about my experience over the last four years, you may come to understand why I have found it so hard to share. This is my own unique story, but other targets of online “mob justice” may find similarities.
      </p>

          <p>
            The author recounts being publicly accused online in 2021 of sexual misconduct, leading to immediate social and professional ostracism from the Scala programming community. He lost his job, income, home, friendships, and reputation overnight without due process. Despite supportive statements from some women, he faced isolation, financial ruin, and health problems, eventually becoming homeless. Legal action was settled in his favor, but his reputation damage remained significant. He discusses the psychological trauma, financial struggles, and advocates awareness of cancellation's severe consequences, urging caution when participating in public condemnation due to its profound impact on individuals' mental health and livelihoods.

          </p>
        </details>
      </div>
      <p>
        Before my cancellation, I was an active and prominent software developer, conference organizer and frequent speaker in a vibrant community of software developers working with the Scala programming language. Scala is a powerful and deeply technical programming language that’s used by a lot of companies, including X (Twitter) and many large banks. The Scala Community is based all over the world and has anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 members, depending on how you count.
      </p>
      <p>
        I lost my reputation in that community overnight. I lost many of my friends. Soon after, I lost my job and my income. I then lost my home, and later I even lost my pension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overwhelming majority of those involved in the cancellation, I believe, acted in good faith. They believed that the allegations they read were true, and that their actions were moral and just. They had conviction that they were on the side of good; that it was right. And with the one-sided evidence they had, probably nothing was more obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obvious as it may have been, their “evidence” was false, and the action that led to my cancellation was executed in the complete and total absence of due process.
      </p>
      <p>
        This account is not about the lies told about me, or the shoddy investigation that led to their publication. This is not about whether I deserved to be condemned or not. This is about what I suffered as a consequence.

      <h2 id="the-evening-of-the-cancellation">
        The Evening of the Cancellation
      </h2>
      <p>
        On the evening of 27 April 2021, I was accused by two women, in coordinated blog posts, of a pattern of sexually-predatory behavior. Both had been in relationships with me, one lasting nearly two years; the other, much shorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Minutes later, an “open letter” appeared online and was shared widely on social media throughout the community I had been part of since 2004. The letter was co-signed by 23 authoritative figures from that community, more than half of whom I had considered my friends until that moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        That instant cut my life into the time before, and the time after.
      </p>
      <p>
        I only found out about the publication of the two statements from a friend. Nobody had told me it was going to happen then; nobody had told me it was going to happen at all. Nobody had ever put any of the claims to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an ambush, and I was blindsided.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was also the moment that I discovered the identity of the second of my two accusers. This shocked me because I had no reason to expect it. It might seem incredible that I wouldn’t have known who she was, but her portrayal of our relationship was untrue; she was never part of the Scala community; and most importantly, she just didn’t have a reason to condemn me. While our two-year relationship had an unhappy end for both of us, and we stopped speaking afterwards, it was over three years earlier, and I believed we had both moved on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The substance of the blog posts was the greatest shock. I remember standing in a doorway, reading them on my phone, over and over again, in stunned disbelief. It was like reading a fiction about me concocted from benign fragments of reality, transplanted into new context to make them sound abominable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew it wasn’t true, but I also knew in that moment that thousands of people would read it and believe it. And they did.
      </p>
      <h2 id="signing-my-condemnation">
        Signing My Condemnation
      </h2>
      <p>
        With publication, the Open Letter collected signatures. I watched in horror throughout the evening as it grew, unable to do anything about it. I wrote and published my own rushed response, which was roundly ignored. Many of the names I didn’t know, but others were familiar; people I had interacted with online or in person over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many had been friends. Some had visited my home or hosted me at theirs. I had been a guest at the wedding of another. None of them contacted me about it before signing—with the exception of one who simply <em>told</em> me he would be signing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each name added to that letter smote me with psychological torture that was particular and personal to that name and the person I knew behind it; bound up with years of pleasant memories about them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each name I read took the breath out of me. It felt similar to learning of their untimely death because reading their name meant they were <em>gone</em> from my life—but it was more brutal because it was their choice and they were all doing it at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every happy memory of times spent with them—at conferences, in conversations, video calls, dinners and even on vacations—were transformed into stains on my psyche. Thousands of friendly interactions I had with hundreds of people over more than a decade were tainted in less than a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The torrent of signatures continued throughout the evening, but had reduced to a slow trickle after a couple of days.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few others contacted me that evening to offer support, but they were outnumbered by the public messages of condemnation from former friends and strangers alike. But I remain grateful for those supportive messages which helped me through the next few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the face of this onslaught, three women who knew me independently wrote unprompted blogposts strongly supporting me, and disputing my characterization in the allegations. I saw them, and each one was touching. But unfortunately, they were largely ignored, unseen or dismissed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe even sadder were the dozens of people who neither contacted me nor signed the letter. Even without condemning me, many people who had been my friends never made contact again. Either their perception of me changed, or our friendship became too burdensome to maintain. I may never know.
      </p>
      <p>
        I became afraid to reach out to people I once counted on as friends, unless they contacted me first.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time passed, exclusion became so familiar to me that I began to find it hard even to talk to people I knew were categorically my friends, particularly when I knew they shared friends with signatories of the letter. I felt uncomfortable having them straddle the community divide on my behalf.
      </p>
      <h2 id="my-life-in-scala">
        My Life in Scala
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Scala Community was central to my life. Nobody else attached so much of their life to that community. Nobody attended and spoke at so many conferences. Nobody gave as many presentations to meetup groups. Nobody traveled to so many different countries in support of Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I did it for the love of that community; for the satisfaction I got from interacting with other people who shared my interest in Scala; for the stimulating conversations I so often had in a community that was dense with intelligence and rich with kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had spent the previous few years traveling. I had been partly nomadic, living in AirBnbs in several different countries, before I had settled down the previous year.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that time, the one constant in my life was the Scala Community. It was the people I interacted with daily, talked to and dined with at conferences, and met up with on any other occasion I had the chance. It went beyond my professional life; it was my social life too. Its members were not just work associates; they were friends. As I traveled between countries and continents, the Scala Community felt like my home.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-end-of-my-life-as-i-knew-it">
        The End of My Life as I Knew It
      </h2>
      <p>
        And in that one moment, I lost most of the life I knew. I offered my resignation from my developer advocacy job because it became untenable and it was damaging my employer, even though we both knew there was no cause to terminate my employment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I gave away my most successful open-source project to new maintainers so that it could continue. I abandoned training courses I had planned. The free educational website I devoted six months to was shut down, to my detriment and to Scala’s.
      </p>
      <p>
        I abandoned a charitable foundation to promote Functional Programming in Africa, which I was just starting. Online videos of my presentations were deleted, and my name was even removed from historical conference programs, as if I had never been there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my online interactions just stopped dead. My ability to earn a living was obliterated. A huge swathe of my friends would no longer talk to me. I was no longer welcome at the events I once considered the center of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        My then-girlfriend, for all the love and support she gave me, found herself in a very different relationship from the one we started a year earlier, and it survived only a few months more, though we remain friends. And although I did not realize it until much later, the experience had a long-term impact on my health.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also did not realize <em>then</em> that 18 months later, I would be unable to afford to continue paying rent, and would be forced to move out of my home.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m well aware of the many ills of this world, but it’s hard to imagine anything so sweeping as to devastate one’s professional life, social life, private life and health; even less so, an action perpetrated by a group of professional software developers in the name of “justice”.
      </p>
      <h2 id="recontextualization">
        Recontextualization
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have come to understand psychology and human nature better since then.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you learn something which permanently changes how you see the world, you undergo a process of <em>recontextualization</em>, where you re-evaluate past beliefs in the context of the new knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you become a parent, it changes your life, and changes your outlook on life. You recontextualize your entire future to accommodate a new person being there with you, and dependent on you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once revealed, the new context never goes away. You can’t forget it or escape it. But old thoughts that made sense in the <em>old</em> context can return days, weeks or years later, and each must be processed so it fits into the <em>new</em>. In the beginning, this happens frequently and the mental burden is enormous. But it reduces over time, with a long tail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe surprisingly, I did not lose sleep during the first few weeks. Instead, although I had no work and no deadlines, I felt overwhelmingly exhausted, day after day. I had several calls with friends, but struggled to speak to more than one person per day. When I went to bed, I slept easily, slept long and slept well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be explained. In those first weeks, my waking hours were consumed by the heavy toll of recontextualization, as years of my professional and social life was forced into a new context. This was the same community of people whose enthusiasm I had shared, and whose qualities and characters were the reason I devoted so much time and energy to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But not only did I have to come to terms with losing most of my friends, I started questioning why I had devoted so much to a community that so willingly condemned me upon unproven accusations. The burden was all-encompasing and tiring, and it took its toll on me. It was weeks before I began to feel closer to normal, and I still don’t feel the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might seem like the obvious thing to do would have been to publish a response to the allegations. But for weeks, I was simply not mentally fit to do so. Furthermore, I was scared: my last interactions with the Scala Community had been the most traumatic experience of my life, and the condemnation had been so comprehensive I became convinced that anything I said would just be ignored.
      </p>
      <h2 id="the-financial-toll">
        The Financial Toll
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was cancelled in the middle of the Coronavirus pandemic. Besides the isolation, which affected everyone, the pandemic was not kind to me, as a professional trainer and conference organizer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the previous years, I had created and run four editions of a conference, Scala World, which attracted about 200 attendees each time. It had established a good reputation, but it never made any profit, and would have made a loss if I had paid myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I had also offered an advanced programming course since 2018, which could be very profitable for a couple of days at a time. And with just four or five training sessions per year, I covered my basic living costs and budget travel, and it allowed me to work on the open source projects I cared about. So for about three years, I did no more paid work than necessary. I traveled to and spoke at almost every conference I could, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I knew these were the best years of my life, and I was grateful; this was my lifestyle choice, and it was a luxury.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never had any trouble rationalizing those years as a kind of startup that failed. It was a gamble I took, a gamble I devoted all my time to, which I hoped might make me a decent salary doing something I loved. And it was a gamble which didn’t pay off—not even slightly. But I accepted the failure was on me and I owned it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second half of 2019, with hapless timing, I decided to focus on my training and conference, and I invested my modest savings in that. I sponsored Scala Days, the biggest conference of the year. And I placed an early booking on accommodation for my conference in 2020, and devoted time to developing further training material and planning several training events.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then the pandemic started. Conferences and training became impossible. My investment was wasted. So I entered the first lockdown without savings and without an income. My most valuable asset at that time was a deposit on the conference accommodation for later in the year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to these unlucky choices I made, I was in debt and needed to find work. I approached the company I had recently been working with, and we began employment discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many small businesses at that time, I kept going thanks to a government business loan. And in the summer of 2020, as lockdowns were relaxed, I planned a small hybrid conference with my prospective employer at the pre-booked venue.
      </p>
      <p>
        But within a couple of weeks, this event had to be cancelled, in part due to the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there was a second reason: around that time, my co-organizers were informed by a third party of vague “concerns about my behavior,” but which lacked sufficient clarity to act on. They were nevertheless enough to seal the event’s cancellation, pause my hiring process, and trigger an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        That investigation lasted around four months, and found no evidence of wrongdoing. But at a time when I most needed to earn, I was forced to wait a further four months without pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was not the first I learned of the actions that led to my cancellation, nine months later, but it was the first time it caused me material losses.
      </p>
      <h2 id="employment-and-unemployment">
        Employment and Unemployment
      </h2>
      <p>
        With the exception of the creator of the language, and one other, there was not a single person in the Scala Community with a longer continuous history of working with Scala. I had been one of the first users in 2004, when I started using it in the first months after my graduation. Almost my entire professional career had been Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the seventeen years covered by my résumé, every success was a success with Scala. Every contract or job I worked used Scala. My entire public output was related to Scala. And I wanted to continue working with Scala.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if they didn’t already associate my name with the allegations in 2021, any potential employer reading my résumé could search for me and immediately find content that would raise justifiable concerns about hiring me. (My name is unique enough that there’s little doubt that the publications refer to me.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have felt like I’ve had a choice when applying for work: to be open and upfront about my situation, and give the employer the option to back out right away; or to remove all Scala references from my résumé, hide my experience, and hope that nobody ever searches for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could I apply for a job in another language? Perhaps: my programming skills may be transferrable to other languages and other communities. But unfortunately, my undeserved reputation is a red flag that’s more universally transferrable. Even if I got a job writing another language like Haskell or Rust, I would forever be one tip-off and a Google search away from having to explain the publications, and risk losing my job. I cannot take the risk of learning a new language, and <em>then</em> losing my job over the same false accusations. I’m an expert at Scala, and that’s where my future lies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also considered—and quickly rejected—changing my name.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of these are good options. I’m not comfortable hiding who I am, and what I’ve been through has become part of my identity. I choose to be open about it, because anything less feels like living a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequently, I have found very little work, even with friendly companies in the Scala Community. To be specific, in the three years between my last job after cancellation, and the contract I started last year, I earned an average of $14,600 per year, before tax.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent about a third of this income on compulsory health insurance, and more than the total amount I earned went on legal costs. I also needed to pay for rent, bills and sustenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        These numbers clearly don’t add up. I survived only thanks to financial help from friends, and selling some assets. This included withdrawing everything from my small private pension account for less than I paid into it. I was reluctant to add to my problems by getting into more debt, but with few options available to me, I accepted help when it came.
      </p>
      <h2 id="escapism">
        Escapism
      </h2>
      <p>
        In January 2022 I found the courage and finance to begin legal action against the few people involved in my cancellation who shared my jurisdiction. I hoped that this would trigger real scrutiny into my case.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, by September 2022, it became clear that I would not be able to keep paying my rent. I was already in debt, and as a recent immigrant to Germany, I was not eligible for any kind of state support. My legal action was proceeding very slowly, accruing costs, and the risk of abandoning it would not only have thrown away my one hope of definitively clearing my name, but would have made me liable for my opponents’ costs as well, which I certainly could not afford.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I lived the most frugal life I could for as long as I could. When that was no longer possible, I moved out of my flat, taking a backpack, tent and sleeping bag, as well as my laptop. I took a train and spent €20 on a shared ride to France, where I started walking the <em>Camino de Santiago de Compostela</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This decision was not rushed. I knew for months that I was spending more than I was earning, and not because I was spending a lot. For months I had been looking for work, or some other way to fix my situation. I had hoped for serendipity to relieve me of my financial problems: serendipity had already intervened to delay that moment a couple of times.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so my decision was made only in desperation. I left my home with no certainty of what would come next; not knowing where I would be in a month or through the winter; or in a year. I had no idea how difficult it would be. I had no idea what I would do when the cash in my pocket ran out.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I was also deceiving the people who cared about me. The choice to walk a long-distance path across Europe appealed to me because it was a way to mask my desperation from the people I didn’t want to worry; a way to maintain my pride that I wasn’t relying on charity; a way to make it look like a <em>choice</em>. But it was no choice. That was a lie, first of all to them, and second to myself. The situation was diabolical, and it was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was also relief, in a way. It gave me exercise and time to think. I spent nearly six weeks living each day as it came, walking by daylight, and spending most nights sleeping outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were nights where I suffered in the conditions and had to endure bitterly cold temperatures. It would have been easy to dismiss these as “just camping”, except that most people go camping with a comfortable home to come back to afterwards. I did not.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all, I walked 800km in six weeks. I had time alone, and time walking with others. I made new friends. I kept my circumstances private. And despite the physical challenges, not only did the simpler life allow me to escape my financial problems for a few more weeks, but it was a mental escape, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was <em>escapism</em>, but it too was unsustainable. It ended when I finally ran out of money and had to call on my last lifeline. It ended with losing my independence and becoming financially dependent on someone else. This was the end of my walk, but not the end of my hardship. However, beyond this point I prefer to keep private.
      </p>
      <p>
        My legal action continued for more than a year after this, as I looked for opportunities to conclude it without incurring unaffordable costs, or revealing to my opponents that I was in financial trouble. The risk of default lingered over me. We reached a settlement in my favor in early 2024, avoiding an expensive court hearing by a few days. However, this compromise meant that I missed the chance for my case to be scrutinized in court.
      </p>
      <h2 id="perseverance">
        Perseverance
      </h2>
      <p>
        I have found the last four years tough, even though I have tried to pretend they weren’t. I got through them by indulging in my work: unpaid open-source software. The intellectual stimulation it has given me, day after day, has kept me going and provided motivation to continue—and hope that people may one day give me a fair hearing. Without a project to work on, I believe I would not have had the resilience to continue, and I credit Scala’s endless learning curve with giving me the grit to carry on.
      </p>
      <p>
        To those people who have suggested I would be better leaving Scala to do something else, I respectfully disagree. I shouldn’t have to, and I’m not going to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year I learned more about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and recognized that I was suffering from some of its symptoms. Most of these only began three years after my cancellation. They are real, but thankfully mild, and should not be overstated: they affect my quality of life, but are not debilitating. I take some non-prescription medication to help.
      </p>
      <h2 id="a-lesson">
        A Lesson
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my own particular way, I am getting through this. But I know that a different person thrust into a similar situation could decide on a very different way out. My experience has taught me how it feels to be the target of cancel culture, and unless you go through a similar experience, you’re unlikely ever to feel the same visceral sense of isolation that can trigger an extreme resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not idle scaremongering. The same concerns about “self-policing” were raised after the tragic death of a student at Oxford University in 2024, who fell victim to cancel culture. In the <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Alexander-Rogers-Prevention-of-Future-Deaths-Report-2024-0624.pdf">Prevention of Future Deaths Report</a> published following his death, the coroner poses legitimate concerns about social ostracism as “self-policing”, and the normalization of exclusionary behavior. I fully support the findings in the report, and they should be taken seriously by the Scala Community and other communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Group action coordinated by powerful authority figures against an individual has to be recognized for what it is, and understood for the dangers it poses to its target.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I have this advice: if you are invited to sign a letter condemning someone, please stop, remember what happened to me, and think about the potential consequences. If you are in a position of authority and find yourself considering coordinated social ostracism against an individual, please stop, and seek an alternative resolution. If you witness someone targeted by cancel culture—regardless of what they’re accused of—show them your support, either publicly or privately; your contact could make the small difference that saves their life.
      </p>
      <h2 id="a-request">
        A Request
      </h2>
      <p>
        Unfortunately in today’s world, too many claims today are valued for their <em>popularity</em>, over their <em>substance</em>. Each name that remains on the Open Letter adds the perception of popularity and the appearance of credibility to the words of the letter that has caused me so much misery for four years. Each name dilutes the scrutiny on the actual claims. And each name continues to cause real harm.
      </p>
      <p>
        I make this clear request now to each of the signatories: please <a href="https://pretty.direct/removal">remove your name</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you did not sign the letter, but know one of the signatories as a friend or colleague, please contact them and respectfully encourage and support them in making the right decision. Make them aware of what they contributed to.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider the signatories to be misguided; not malicious. I believe that they wanted to do the right thing. I judge them by their intent, not their lack of foresight into the consequences. You should too.
      </p>
      <p>
        And they should be judged for their ability to recognize their mistake, and correct it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always had a hopeful and positive outlook on life. My faith in the innate goodness of people has been shaken, but remains intact.

We know from the documents that various domains belonging to Snapchat, Amazon and Youtube were of interest. It's not known if any other user traffic was intercepted, or just proxied on. This type of information we can't obtain from looking at the archived Onavo Protect apps, rather for the time being, we have to rely on the content in the court documents made available to the public.</p><p>Over time the success of their strategy to employ a transparent TLS proxy was diminishing due to improved security controls in Android.  Additionally certificate pinning adoption was said to be an issue. As an alterative, Facebook were considering using the <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10964491?hl=en&amp;ref=haxrob.net#:~:text=Google%20Play%20permits%20the%20use,that%20they%20are%20accessibility%20tools." rel="noreferrer">Accessibility API</a> as an alternative. </p><figure><img src="https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-14.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="818" height="161" srcset="https://haxrob.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-14.png 600w, https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-14.png 818w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Page 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is what Google has to say about using the accessibility features on their operating system:</p><blockquote>"only services that are designed to help people with disabilities access their device or otherwise overcome challenges stemming from their disabilities are eligible to declare that they are accessibility tools."</blockquote><p>It's somewhat telling of a company that would consider abusing features designed to support people with disabilities for a competitive advantage. Generally, Android accessibility functionality misuse is attributed to malicious applications such as <a href="https://blog.pradeo.com/accessibility-services-mobile-analysis-malware?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">banking malware</a>.</p><h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2><p>Mark Zuckerberg states the need for "<em>reliable analytics</em>" on Snapchat:</p><figure><img src="https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="617" height="335" srcset="https://haxrob.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-4.png 600w, https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-4.png 617w"></figure><p>The solution? "<em>Kits that can be installed on iOS and Android that intercept traffic for specific sub-domains</em>":</p><figure><img src="https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-6.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1311" height="614" srcset="https://haxrob.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-6.png 600w, https://haxrob.net/content/images/size/w1000/2024/04/image-6.png 1000w, https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-6.png 1311w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>My take on the above is that in addition to utilizing the Onavo Protect VPN app to intercept traffic for specific domains, there was an intention to rebrand the core technology and having it distributed in other applications. Facebook had <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/10/13/facebook-buys-mobile-analytics-company-onavo-and-finally-gets-its-office-in-israel/?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">acquired </a>Onavo for approximately $120M USD in 2013 and needed to put this technology in good use. That price point should give a clear indication on the value they placed on the ability to gain competitor intelligence from people's phones and tablets. </p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@chronic_9612/notes-on-analytics-and-tracking-in-onavo-protect-for-ios-904bdff346c0?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">Prior research</a> on the iOS version notes that the Onavo VPN app was collecting some usage telemetry from iPhones. On Android we can see the app was pulling much more fine grained statistics from their user's devices by utilizing permissions granted under the pretext of showing the user app data usage (we will see how this looked in an embedded video below). But that was not enough, Facebook wanted to take this one step further and intercept encrypted traffic towards specific competitor's analytics domains in order to obtain data on the "<strong>in-app actions"</strong>.</p><p>All they would need to do is to get the user to install a custom certificate into the user's phone's trust store (and be on specific Android releases).</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p>The wiretapping information is new and perhaps not to be confused with what occured prior:</p><p>In 2023, two subsidiaries of Facebook was ordered to pay a total of $20M by the Australian Federal Court for "engaging in conduct liable to mislead in breach of the Australian Consumer Law", according to the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/20m-penalty-for-meta-companies-for-conduct-liable-to-mislead-consumers-about-use-of-their-data?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">ACCC</a>.</p><p>Facebook had shutdown Onavo in 2019 after an <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">investigation </a>revealed they had been paying teenagers to use the app to track them. Also that year, Apple went as far as to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220609072355/https://www.vox.com/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app" rel="noreferrer">revoke Facebook's developer program certificates</a>, sending a clear message. </p><p>Despite the apps being taken offline, we are able to find old archived versions which enabled the technical insights offered in this post. </p></div></div><h2 id="technical-analysis">Technical analysis</h2><p>Websites and applications on end user devices trust remote websites or servers over HTTPS/TLS due to public certificates that are stored in the device's trust store. These "certificate authority" certs are the "trust anchor" that applications rely on to verify they communicating with the intended party. These certificates are generally distributed and stored within the operating system. By adding your own self-signed certificate to the appropriate trust store, it is often possible to intercept encrypted TLS traffic. Corporations may also do this as a means of inspecting outbound traffic from employee's devices. Security testers may also do this on their own devices. There are legitimate reasons for doing this. The question here is if what Facebook did was legitimate, meaning, was it legal or not.</p><div><p>There is some irony that the documentation for software that Facebook is said to employ to do the interception contains the following <a href="https://wiki.squid-cache.org/Features/SslBump?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">warning</a>:</p></div><blockquote>HTTPS was designed to give users an expectation of privacy and security. Decrypting HTTPS tunnels without user consent or knowledge may violate ethical norms and may be illegal in your jurisdiction. </blockquote><p>Unlike iOS on the iPhone, Google has made numerous changes to make it extremely difficult to install a CA cert that will be trusted by most applications on the phone. In Android 11, released in September 2020, Google had completely blocked the mechanism which the app used to prompt a user to install the cert and no application would trust any certificate in the user store by default.</p><div><p>💡</p><div><p>People have asked "<i><em>what about cert pinning? wouldn't this have prevented successful MITM of the traffic?</em></i>"</p><p>While that would be the case, as we will see later, at the time, the Snapchat app did not implement cert pinning for it's analytics domain. This would likely hold true for the other app domains. So it appears Facebook had leveraged off this technical limitation / oversight by it's competitors.</p></div></div><p>So today, technically speaking, is is simply is not possible to do what Facebook had done back in 2016 to 2019. But it worked - so how did they do it? Fortunately, at least with Android and the Play store ecosystem, we are able to often go back in time and sometimes dig up old Android app packages.</p><p>The first thing is to install the Onavo app on a test handset to see how users would interact with the app.  Despite the VPN connectivity not working and the actual backend service being down, we do get a glimpse on how the application coerces the user into accepting multiple permissions:</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://haxrob.net/content/media/2024/04/zszPzD8NSHAFb9W1_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

It's still somewhat high level statistics and clearly not enough granularity for what Mark was after, implied by one of the emails in the court documents. Intercepting the actual encrypted traffic towards the analytics domains of various competitors on the other hand, would do the trick. And to do this, Facebook would have to get a CA certificate somehow on the device.</p><p>But we don't see any prompt to install any certificate. This is because the VPN did not successfully connect to the remote service, which appears to be precondition.

A user would have to manually install the certificate. It would no longer be possible to have Facebook's CA cert installed directly in the app.</p><p>Another notable change in Android 7 - According to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-config?ref=haxrob.net" rel="noreferrer">Android documentation</a> (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote>By default, secure connections (using protocols like TLS and HTTPS) from all apps trust the pre-installed system CAs, and <strong>apps targeting Android 6.0 (API level 23) and lower also trust the user-added CA store by default</strong></blockquote><p>In other words, it appears other apps would have trusted certs in the user store from Android Marshmallow (Android 6) and below, but from Android 7, released in August 22, 2016, they would no longer be trusted at all by other applications, unless due to a security configuration in the app's manifest file.</p><p>Another  improvement to Android in version 7 was that it was made impossible to install certificates into the system store by <em>any</em> means except by fully rooting the device. </p><p>Regardless, the functionality remained in both the older version and newer, all the way to the last published app in 2019. The actual MITM certificate was removed in 2017. Detail in the court documents may offer plausible explanation:</p><blockquote>Where is the key generated that's used for the SSL bump and how it protected from abuse? (e.g., is generated on the device, specific to that device, and never leaves the device, or is there a shared key that's downloaded with the app and installed)<p><strong>The certificate is generated on the server and being sent to the device</strong></p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="933" height="104" srcset="https://haxrob.net/content/images/size/w600/2024/04/image-15.png 600w, https://haxrob.net/content/images/2024/04/image-15.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Page 3 - Case 3:20-cv-08570-JD Document 736</span></figcaption></figure><p>So we need to go back to much older releases before 2019, specifically a version from September 2017.

<p>The aim is to deter piracy by making sites more difficult to find, but these measures are only partially effective.</p>
<p>More recently, site-blocking requests have begun to target other intermediaries. This includes DNS providers, such as Google and Cloudflare, which were ordered to block sites in France, Italy, and elsewhere. </p>
<p>A few months ago DNS blocking arrived in Belgium, where several orders required both ISPs and DNS resolvers to restrict access to pirate sites. This prompted significant pushback, most notably Cisco’s OpenDNS ceasing operations in the country.</p>
<h2>Broad Blocking Order Targets Internet Archive’s ‘Open Library’</h2>
<p>A new order, issued by the Brussels Business Court in mid-July, targets an even broader set of intermediaries and stands out for other reasons as well. </p>
<p>Requested by various publishing and author organizations, the order aims to block access to known pirate libraries including Anna’s Archive, LibGen, OceanofPDF, and Z-Library. In addition, it also targets the Internet Archive’s <a href="https://openlibrary.org/">Open Library</a> project. </p>

<p>Open Library was created by the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz">Aaron Swartz</a> and Internet Archive’s founder Brewster Kahle, among others. As an open library its goal is to archive all published books, allowing patrons to borrow copies of them online. </p>
<p>The library aims to operate similarly to other libraries, loaning only one copy per book at a time. Instead of licensing digital copies, however, it has an in-house scanning operation to create and archive its own copies.</p>
<center><em>Open Library</em></center><br><center><picture loading="lazy" decoding="async">

<p>The Open Library project was previously sued by publishers in the United States, where the Internet Archive ultimately <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/internet-archive-loses-landmark-e-book-lending-copyright-appeal-against-publishers-240905/">losing</a> the case. As a result, over 500,000 books were made unavailable. </p>
<p>However, many other books remain available to patrons. The authors and publishers in Belgium argue that, since this is done without permission, the site should be blocked alongside Anna’s Archive, LibGen and Z-Library.</p>
<h2>Clear and Significant Infringement</h2>
<p>The rightsholders describe Open Library as a website where registered members of the public can easily access and download their books. This includes 1,542 works from the publisher Dupuis, over 5,000 works from the publisher Casterman, and many others. </p>
<p>According to the publishers, the operators of the Open Library are not easily identified, while legally required information is allegedly missing from the site, which they see as an indication that the site is meant to operate illegally. </p>
<p>This description seems at odds with the fact that Open Library is part of the Internet Archive, which is a U.S.-registered  501(c)(3) non-profit.</p>

</picture>
</center>
<p>The publishers also reference a U.S. court order in favor of other publishers, which allegedly confirms the unlawful nature of Open Library. </p>
<p>The Brussels court, after reviewing these arguments and the submitted evidence, concluded that there was a <em>prima facie</em> case of “clear and significant infringement,” which justified granting a provisional blocking order against Open Library and the other targeted sites.</p>
<h2>Broad Blocking Order Targets ISPs, Search, Payments, and More</h2>
<p>Internet Archive was not heard in this case, as the blocking order was issued <em>ex parte</em>, without its knowledge. This is remarkable, as the organization is a legal entity in the United States, which receives support from many American libraries.</p>
<p>The broad nature of the order doesn’t stop there either. In addition to requiring ISPs, including Elon Musk’s Starlink, to block the library’s domain names, it also directs a broad range of other intermediaries to take action. </p>
<p>This includes search engines, DNS resolvers, advertisers, domain name services, CDNs, and hosting companies. An abbreviated overview of the requested measures is as follows; </p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Search Engines</strong></p>
<p><em>Google</em> must remove the target sites from search results, deactivate related Google Ads, remove an infringing app from the Google Play Store, and block DNS requests for the associated domains.</p>
<p><em>Microsoft</em> is ordered to remove the target sites from the “Bing” search engine and block related DNS queries.</p>
<p><strong>Hosting, DNS, CDNs, and Domain Name Services</strong></p>
<p>The following companies must terminate hosting, and deactivate or suspend the domain names of the target sites: Hostinger, GoDaddy, Amazon Web Services, SEDO, Cloudflare, Unmanaged Ltd, AlexHost, and Internet Archive.</p>
<p><strong>Payment Intermediaries</strong></p>
<p>These companies are ordered to suspend all payment services benefiting the target sites: Alipay (Europe), Cash App and Squareup Europe, and PayPal (Europe).</p>
<p><strong>ISPs including Starlink</strong></p>
<p>The following ISPs, active in Belgium, are required to implement DNS blocking measures: Telenet, Proximus, Mobile Vikings, Orange Belgium, Voo, DIGI Communications, Cybernet, EDPnet, CENTREA, Yoin, Tchamba Refinder, IPTelecom, United Mobile, SkyDSL Europe, Starlink Internet Services.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Given the broad nature of the order, pushback from some of the intermediaries is expected. The Internet Archive’s Open Library won’t be pleased either, as the order effectively blocks their service in Belgium, including all access to public domain content. </p>

From our humble beginnings with Privacy Friendly Torchlight, our apps have always been available in the Google Play Store. Our current selection of Privacy Friendly Apps has grown since then to more than 30. And with more than 350,000 installs we believe we left a dent. We want to take this opportunity to also thank all our users for their continued support!</p>

<p>However, in 2025, eight years after we took on this project, things have changed. Not in regards to apps demanding more permissions than they need. No, unfortunately not that. What changed, however, is the effort to keep the apps updated. The maintenance for the provision of privacy-friendly apps in the Google Play Store is significantly greater than on F-Droid and is no longer feasible for a research group.</p>

<p>Please note that existing installations of our apps on your devices will not be deleted or affected by this change. However, you will no longer receive updates through the Google Play Store, which means that our apps may eventually stop working properly as the Android operating system evolves and compatibility issues arise. We recommend switching to the F-Droid Store for continued support and updates.</p>

<p>Our Privacy Friendly Apps will continue to be available on the F-Droid Store. For your convenience, we created instructions that explains how you can easily make the switch to the F-Droid Store while keeping all your data: <a href="https://secuso.aifb.kit.edu/downloads/play-store-to-f-droid-migration.pdf">Migration Instructions</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <article>
        <p>Hear me out, I can already read the descenting opinions:</p>
<ul>
<li>But I need session persistence!</li>
<li>But I need split windows!</li>
<li>But I need to group windows per project!</li>
<li>But I need lots of terminals inside of a remote server!</li>
</ul>
<p>I had the exact same response whenever someone would argue against using <code>tmux</code>.
For context, I've been a huge fan of <code>tmux</code> and have been using it as a daily
part of my workflow for 7+ years. Whether I'm developing on my local machine or
in SSH, I was using <code>tmux</code>.</p>
<p>However, a couple of years ago I stumbled across a
<a href="https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/391#issuecomment-638320745" rel="nofollow">GitHub issue in the kitty project</a>
that has stuck in my mind like an itch that I cannot scratch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In summary: multiplexers add unnecessary overhead, suffer from a complexity
cascade, because they actually have to <em>translate</em> escape codes, modifying
them in hackish ways to get them to work with their concepts of
windows/sessions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And then a couple of weeks ago I watched this excellent interview from
<code>linkarzu</code> and kovid (creator of kitty). In it, they
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOK4EJDyjcM" rel="nofollow">discussed <code>tmux</code></a>.</p>
<p>I have to say, the arguments are convincing. Over the years, I have had a
handful of problems with <code>tmux</code> that were not necessarily deal breakers but very
annoying to deal with on a regular basis.</p>
<p>For example, if you do not set <code>TERM</code> with <code>tmux</code> properly, your colors will
render incorrectly. Without <code>tmux</code> everything looks good, but with it things can
look washed out or just wrong. So when debugging issues related to terminal
features, you need to consider both your terminal emulator and <code>tmux</code>. Now add
another layer like <code>ssh</code> and you're really pulling your hair out.</p>
<p>Another example is buffer scrollback. It's one of those things where you have to
learn the <code>tmux</code> way of scrolling a window. You get used to it, of course, but
it's just not great.</p>
<p>And what about mouse select to copy/paste? It works most of the time, but
sometimes <code>tmux</code> gets ignored and I'm selecting across splits which makes the
thing I'm copying impossible to grab without bailing.</p>
<p>Another issue I ran into a couple of times is the lack of experimental protocol
support. I use "experimental" loosely since some of them are gaining popularity
inside terminal emulators, like the
<a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/" rel="nofollow">kitty graphics protocol</a>.
Even if your terminal emulator supports the kitty graphics protocol,
<a href="https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/3395#issuecomment-1327312472" rel="nofollow"><code>tmux</code> does not</a>.</p>
<p>This is why kovid argues that terminal multiplexers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[...] act as a drag on the ecosystem as a whole, making it very hard to get
any new features."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I get it, I'm sympathetic to the issue terminal multiplexers cause to the
wider terminal ecosystem, but what's the alternative? <code>tmux</code> solves problems
that are not easy to replace:</p>
<ul>
<li>session persistence (detach + attach process from terminal)</li>
<li>window management (tabs, splits, moving them around)</li>
</ul>
<p>Session persistence can be accomplished in a number of ways, with varying
degrees of feature overlap with what <code>tmux</code> provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ctrl-z</code> + <code>fg</code></li>
<li><code>nohup {cmd} &amp;</code></li>
<li><code>disown</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These are discussed in this
<a href="https://superuser.com/questions/178587/how-do-i-detach-a-process-from-terminal-entirely" rel="nofollow">stack exchange</a>
post. None of them quite work the way <code>tmux</code> works. In particular, these
commands will either a) get killed when you close your terminal, or b) cannot
reattach easily.</p>
<p>For window management, the argument is we should use our window managers to
manipulate our windows. That works great for local development, but what happens
when you are SSH'd into a server? How do you let your window manager manipulate
windows within an SSH session?</p>
<p>Darn, built-in tools don't quite check all of our boxes, I wonder, are there any
<code>tmux</code> alternatives that could work?</p>
<p>I was desperate for a solution and I really did not want to build my own. I also
didn't want to replace <code>tmux</code> with something equally as large of a dependency.
Here's what I found:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dtach.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">dtach</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/martanne/abduco" rel="nofollow">abduco</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool" rel="nofollow">shpool</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these tools embody the unix philosophy of doing one thing, well. So they
are targeting session persistence (detach and attach functionality). What's
exciting about this idea is since there are no virtual splits, I can get native
scrollback!</p>
<p>Most of them work by <strong>creating a daemon<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="nofollow">1</a></sup></strong> with some permutation of <code>fork()</code>
and communicating with a unix socket between the detached process and "client"
terminals. Some of them support buffer playback so when you reattach you can see
where you left off. Most of them haven't quite nailed this aspect of what <code>tmux</code>
does well, but <code>shpool</code> does a pretty good job.</p>
<p>I tried all of them with varying degrees of success. They could do what they
claim, but they are buggy. In particular, I could not get them to detach when
inside of <code>nvim</code>, which is a deal breaker. I assumed it was because the
shortcuts I was using to detach were being captured by <code>nvim</code>. Who knows, it
might be something misconfigured on my end.</p>
<p>However, out of those tools I used, <code>shpool</code> checked the most boxes.
Specifically they have a command <code>shpool detach</code> which allowed me to run a
command to detach the current process. So I was able to create a keymap that
sent the detach command to <code>shpool</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>1</span><span><span>-- https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool/issues/71#issuecomment-2632396805</span>
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span><span>vim.keymap</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>({</span> <span>"n"</span><span>,</span> <span>"v"</span><span>,</span> <span>"i"</span><span>,</span> <span>"t"</span> <span>},</span> <span>"&lt;C-space&gt;&lt;C-d&gt;"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span>
</span></span><span><span>3</span><span>  <span>vim.cmd</span><span>(</span><span>"!shpool detach"</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>4</span><span><span>end</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p>Nice, this is working well for session persistence. Let's move onto window
management. I'm using <code>ghostty</code> on my work laptop and <code>sway+foot</code> on my personal
machines. I can use both of them for window management, but as a note I employ a
client+server development workflow. This means my client (e.g. laptop, desktop)
connects to a headless VM on my <code>proxmox</code> box where I do all of my dev. So I am
always SSH'd during development. So how can I use my local window managers to
control all my <code>shpool</code> sessions on a remote server?</p>
<p><code>shpool</code> has some docs on how to
<a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-automatically-connect-to-shpool" rel="nofollow">automatically connect to <code>shpool</code></a></p>
<p>The idea is simple: use your window manager to create new terminal windows and
then <code>ssh</code> into each <code>shpool</code> session. Here's the <code>ssh_config</code> I use to make
this easier:</p>
<pre><code>Host *
    # ping server to make sure it's still responding
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3

Host = d.*
    HostName 192.168.88.xxx
    User erock
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

    # attach to shpool session based on the name provided
    RemoteCommand shpool attach -f %k
    RequestTTY yes

    # share ssh connection with all terminals that try to connect to this host
    ControlPath ~/.ssh/cm-%r@%h:%p
    ControlMaster auto
    ControlPersist 10m
</code></pre>
<p>Now I can automatically create or attach to my <code>shpool</code> sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ssh d.chat</code> -&gt; connect to IRC</li>
<li><code>ssh d.dot</code> -&gt; connect to my dotfiles <code>neovim</code> client</li>
<li><code>ssh d.term</code> -&gt; connect to a running terminal</li>
<li><code>ssh d.pico</code> -&gt; connect to my pico <code>neovim</code> client</li>
</ul>
<p>I can spin up as many <code>shpool</code> sessions as I want and connect to them as-needed.
Then when I combine this with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/autossh" rel="nofollow"><code>autossh</code></a>,
I can keep my terminal windows open on my client and reconnect automatically
when the client reconnects to my network!</p>
<pre><code><span><span>1</span><span>autossh -M <span>0</span> d.chat
</span></span></code></pre><p>So, did I finally replace <code>tmux</code>? For me, the answer is a resounding yes! Once I
got all of this setup on my dev machine, I haven't used <code>tmux</code> or feel like a
massive downgrade. I did have to adjust my normal workflow slightly, but that's
been fun. Further, I'm slowly noticing things that <code>tmux</code> didn't handle well,
but now, "just work": native scrollback, terminal notifications, and terminal
titles being the most notable changes.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, there are active issues with <code>shpool</code>, like it doesn't restore
terminal state properly when reattaching which can make
<a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool/issues/240" rel="nofollow">resizing broken while using <code>nvim</code></a>.
But as noted in that issue, there is a work-around:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>1</span><span><span>vim.keymap</span><span>.</span><span>set</span><span>(</span><span>"n"</span><span>,</span> <span>"&lt;leader&gt;l"</span><span>,</span> <span>function</span><span>()</span>
</span></span><span><span>2</span><span>  <span>io.stdout</span><span>:</span><span>write</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>\027</span><span>[?2048h"</span><span>)</span>
</span></span><span><span>3</span><span><span>end</span><span>,</span> <span>opts</span><span>)</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p><code>shpool</code> also
<a href="https://github.com/shell-pool/shpool/issues/40" rel="nofollow">doesn't support "multiplayer"</a>
which has caused some issues with using <code>autossh</code> on multiple clients since they
will disconnect each other.</p>
<p>Could this workflow replace <code>tmux</code> for you? Let me know!</p>
