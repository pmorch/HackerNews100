<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
<p>I created <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/">The low-tech guys</a>, a brand under which I develop macOS apps for a living.</p>
<p>I started this business with a good friend of mine, thinking I could help him stop working long hours at his consulting job and ease into more creative work.</p>
<p>However, getting to a state where you earn enough to live off the app sales takes time, and he did not have that time. So it's just one "low-tech guy" doing all this, and that is me.</p>
<p>So what are the largest costs of running such a business?</p>
<p>Well to be honest, that is <strong>time</strong>. Time I could have spent with my wife, my brother, my dog, instead of answering support emails from my first waking moment to right before sleeping. Time I could have walked outside, do some handy work in natural light, instead of sit on my butt and wreck my spine 6-12h a day.</p>
<p>But time is hard to quantify, so let's talk about money instead.</p>
<h2 id="app-store"><a href="#app-store">#</a> App Store</h2>
<p>I sell 3 apps on the App Store:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/rcmd">rcmd - App switcher using the ⌘ Right Command key</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/grila/">Grila - Keyboard-centric calendar</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lowtechguys.com/gammadimmer/">Gamma Dimmer - Basic screen brightness dimmer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>rcmd makes the bulk of the sales, but mostly because I didn't have time to further develop and act on feedback for the other two.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales (how much people paid in total): <code>$14.9k</code></li>
<li>Proceeds (how much I get from the sales): <code>$11.5k</code></li>
<li>Costs: <code>$3.4k</code>
<ul>
<li>App Store commission fee (small business 15%): <code>$2.3k</code></li>
<li>VAT, Sales Tax, foreign currency exchange fees: <code>$1.1k</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="paddle"><a href="#paddle">#</a> Paddle</h2>
<p>I publish apps independently as well because the App Store has some strict restrictions regarding what you can do in an app <em>(no private APIs allowed, no IOKit for talking to hardware directly etc.)</em>.</p>
<p>So the apps where I can use code to tickle my curiosity and experiment more are not on the App Store.</p>
<p>I use <a href="https://paddle.com/">paddle.com</a> for selling these apps because they handle all tax work for me (calculate VAT and sales tax, send it to the relevant authority, handle reverse charge and chargebacks etc.). They also provide a useful Mac SDK for licensing and checkout.</p>
<p>For most year, I only sold <a href="https://lunar.fyi/">Lunar</a> there, an app for adaptive monitor brightness. Just recently I also started selling <a href="https://lowtechguys.com/clop">Clop</a> (an image, video and PDF optimizer), but most numbers will be relative to Lunar's price.</p>
<p>Here are the numbers for 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sales (how much people paid in total): <code>$93.5k</code></li>
<li>Proceeds (how much I get from the sales): <code>$73.3k</code></li>
<li>Costs: <code>$20.2k</code>
<ul>
<li>Paddle commission fee (5%): <code>$4.7k</code></li>
<li>VAT, Sales Tax, foreign currency exchange fees: <code>$15.5k</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The disadvantage of using a Merchant of Record like Paddle is that I don't get to reclaim the VAT at the end of the year. That's because it's some kind of B2B relation: I sell them my app in gross with 0% VAT, and then they resell it and collect taxes themselves.</p>
<p>Oh well, the price of convenience and peace of mind...</p>
<h2 id="romanian-corporate-income-tax"><a href="#romanian-corporate-income-tax">#</a> Romanian corporate income tax</h2>
<p>So in 2023, people paid a total of <code>$108.4k</code> <em>(wow.. 108400 US dollars.. I’m amazed to see that number myself, thank you good people for helping me keep doing this)</em> and after paying fees to a bunch of states and platforms, I’m left with <code>$84.8k</code>.</p>
<p>Before taxes. Yep, it doesn’t stop here, you didn't think I'd get to spend eighty-five thousand dollars, did you?</p>
<p><strong>THE LOW-TECH GUYS S.R.L.</strong> is a business incorporated in Romania so it has to pay taxes on the income. Calculating that final tax needs applying such a chaotic and stupidly complex formula that I think I’ll spare you the details.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you really want to know, it’s something like: I have to pay myself a minimum salary of about $1k/month on which I pay half as taxes, then I pay 3% from the remaining sum as income tax, then I pay 8% as dividend tax, then I pay 10% of 24 minimum monthly salaries for mandatory health insurance, then I have to pay a mandatory accountant and a mandatory billing software, and a mandatory business bank account... I most surely forgot something and I'll also have to pay a mandatory fine next year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, another <code>$13k</code> flies out the window to Romanian corrupt politicians to line up their greasy pockets. A small amount of those might end up in healthcare and education, so that corrupt hospital managers and inspectors can get their part as well.</p>
<p>I'm left with <code>$71.8k</code>. Before expenses.</p>
<p>Thankfully, a macOS app business doesn't have many of those. Here's what I currently have to pay:</p>
<ul>
<li>A bare metal Hetzner server: <code>$600</code>
<ul>
<li>This is where I host all my DMGs, websites, APIs, analytics, experiments etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>An IPStack subscription as a fallback for Lunar's <a href="https://lunar.fyi/#location">Location Mode</a>: <code>$140</code></li>
<li>Apple Developer Membership: <code>$100</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the app features, I might also need to buy the latest MacBook or iPhone to develop and test hardware-related features <em>(like <a href="https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/journey-to-ddc-on-m1-macs/">DDC support for M1</a> or <a href="https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/over-500nits-failed/">XDR Brightness for MacBook HDR screens</a>)</em>, or for example I needed to buy a bunch of varying light sensors and ESP32/ESP8266 boards to develop adaptive monitor brightness using <a href="https://lunar.fyi/sensor">wireless light sensors</a>.</p>
<p>These are not recurring so I can't count them in, just thought I'd note them here for whoever's interested.</p>
<p>I'm also a Romanian, living in Romania, earning USD but spending RON so I'll also lose a significant amount on foreign currency exchange. I calculated that to be at least <code>$1k</code></p>

</span></span></code></pre><p>In the end, I get the equivalent of a <code>$5800/month</code> net salary. Not bad, but very far from what I could earn as a consultant.</p>
<p>To put it in perspective, this summer I took a <code>$120/hour</code> consulting gig for an MDM company because they said they need a few days worth of work for a macOS app and I said <em>why not, it's just a few days</em>. It turned out they needed a lot more and were happy to continue paying that amount because macOS skills are not easy to find.</p>
<p>But I could not fit into the same old <em>Slack chat + Zoom meetings + SCRUM + daily report + doing something that you feel it has no purpose in the real world for 8 hours a day</em> madness that consulting work needs. So I said "no, I'm sorry, I'd like to continue building my apps".</p>
<p>At <code>$120/hour</code>, one would get <code>$120 * 8 hours * 21 days - ~12% taxes</code> → <code>$18k/month</code> after taxes. Which is a mind boggling amount of money for a Romanian. And it's 3x more than my app revenue.</p>
<p>But I like to believe that with that difference of <code>$12k</code> I'm buying time.</p>
<p>Time that I can spend as late mornings, drinking coffee quietly while playing with my dog. Time that I can spend eating a quiet meal with my wife without being in a hurry for a meeting, and then taking time after to talk about our house projects. Time for taking weeks off from being in front of a laptop without having to ask someone for my own time back.</p>

<p><strong>Santa's data collection has always been compliant with GDPR, so he has no need to change his ways.</strong> The nature of his data collection is more transparent than most companies, and he is open to updating his records if you contact one of his representatives.</p>
<p>For example, he makes it clear that he is operating in your town:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You better watch out</p>
<p>You better not cry</p>
<p>Better not pout</p>
<p>I'm telling you why</p>
<p><strong>Santa Claus is coming to town</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The legitimate business purpose of his data collection is to create a list of those who are naughty and nice this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He's making a list</strong></p>
<p>And checking it twice;</p>
<p><strong>Gonna find out Who's naughty and nice</strong></p>
<p>Santa Claus is coming to town</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He even gives some examples of what data he's collecting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He sees you when you're sleeping</p>
<p><strong>He knows when you're awake</strong></p>
<p><strong>He knows if you've been bad or good</strong></p>
<p>So be good for goodness sake!</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>The GDPR has some other requirements to it, <a href="https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/30509/how-are-gdpr-fines-actually-enforced-for-us-companies-with-no-physical-presence/30513#30513">such as an EU-based representative</a> being necessary for operating in the EU, allowing users to request data updates, and getting consent for data collected.</p>
<p>Thankfully for Santa, he's been operating compliant representative systems for decades: Just go to any mall during the holiday season to meet with <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MallSanta" rel="noreferrer">a representative</a>. To ensure open and accurate records, the representative will ask the child if they've been naughty or nice that year and what type of present they want.</p>
<p>As long as the child's parent/legal guardian is nearby to confirm the data change requests, Santa will be happy to update his database to ensure the naughty/nice data is accurate and that the requested presents are delivered.</p>
<p>As for consent, the children are obviously too young to provide consent and must rely on their parent/guardian to consent to Santa's data collection. <strong>I doubt there's a single house that is receiving presents from Santa without the parent's explicit consent</strong>, and I'm sure we've all been told by our parents at some point to "be good or Santa won't give you presents this year!".</p>

<p>Santa is Christian priest (bishop as far as I remember). As you can see <a href="https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/16-02-25_personal_data_protection_church_warsaw_en.pdf" rel="noreferrer">here</a> he is covered by exemption:</p>

<p>Well you are making a fundamental misunderstanding about the GDPR (as many have), that consent is the only basis for holding and processing information.</p>

<p>There are actually <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/#ib3" rel="noreferrer">six legal bases</a> for holding data (you have to scroll down a little as the link doesn't work properly).<br>
Those six bases are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Consent</li>
<li>Contract</li>
<li>Legal obligation</li>
<li>Vital interests</li>
<li>Public task</li>
<li>Legitimate interests</li>
</ol>

<p>So let's look at each of them and see if Santa has any basis for collecting our information.</p>

<p><strong>Consent</strong> - Actually this one may not even be as troublesome as it first seems. Presumably we're all writing letters to Santa asking for presents, this could potentially be seen as a form of consent for collecting our data, though I think that's a little iffy.</p>

<p><strong>Contract</strong> - The letter to Santa could also form the basis for a contract for the provision of services (present delivery), so I think this works.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Obligation</strong> - Unless you want to argue that Santa is legally obligated to perform his duties I don't think this one works.</p>

<p><strong>Vital Interests</strong> - No one is going to die if Santa doesn't do his job, probably doesn't work either.</p>

<p><strong>Public Task</strong> - I think this is a strong contender. From the website I linked above; "the processing is necessary for you to perform a task in the public interest or for your official functions, and the task or function has a clear basis in law." I would say the worldwide provision of joy and happiness is in the public interest, and the processing of our information is definitely required for Santa's official functions.</p>

<p><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong> - This is a little of a grey area and many businesses have used it as the basis for continuing to hold and process information, I see no reason why Santa couldn't do the same.</p>

<p>So in short, there is no real issue at all and Santa can continue doing what he needs to do as long as he properly deals with our information and updates his privacy policies.</p>

<p>The GDPR seems to be a lesser violation compared to others he willfully commits each year.</p>

<h3>Everyone gets the same present - a letter about sending your personal data</h3>
<p>This year we will all get a letter about the updated general terms and conditions and how you will be required to send a certain set of information to Santa so that he may send you your presents next year. Everyone will be required to send their address, name and age. You will also have to allow your parents to send Santa the data about you being nice or naughty. In case you don't want to disclose the naughty-or-nice information you will receive a generic probably-not-that-naughty present, which will most likely consist of old chocolate he found lying around in the elven workshops.</p>
<p>Be careful to send your data as fast as you can. It will be harder to get into contact with Santa after the timeframe he had allocated for everyone to send in their address, name and age. If you don't send that information you will receive nothing because Santa is not allowed to use your address any longer. If he still sends you something you can sue him - and thereby make sure that lots of children will cry because they won't get any presents after the EU is done with Santa. Good job, now it's clear on which list you are...</p>
<p>There is also talk about Santa cooperating with the Easter Bunny in 2019 for a late present delivery.</p>

<p>I'd like to take another route to answering your question:</p>

<p><strong>He simply doesn't care.</strong></p>

<p>For years, he has been punishing kids and breaking into houses; despite attempts from kids and governments, he has never been caught. He doesn't have an aviator's license or a landing permit for his sled, while flying very close to houses and otherwise endangering people.</p>

<p>Though, if you put him to a D&amp;D scale, he may be chaotic good, he is nonetheless chaotic:  he breaks the law to reach his goals.<br>
I'm certain he doesn't pay VAT on his gifts.  Also, the working conditions of his elves are questionable.</p>

<p>But it's the same with every other criminal:<br>
As long they can't catch him, he will continue.</p>

<p>Note: This answer pertains to Santa Claus, as distinct from St Nicholas, Sinterklaas, Krampus, etc. - as per the question.</p>

<p>He is not bound by GDPR.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>an entity or more precisely an "enterprise" has to be engaged in "economic activity" to be covered by the GDPR</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation</a></p>

<p>What qualifies as "economic activity"? I'm glad you asked:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the Court determins that an activity is economic on the basis  of two criteria of agreement and renumeration</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(from 
<a href="https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789462651166-c2.pdf" rel="noreferrer">https://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9789462651166-c2.pdf</a> )</p>

<p>I do not agree with other posts that the recipients of the gifts agree (in the legal sense, nor in any sense that would stand up in court). I am not aware of any way a person can "agree" to be the recipient of gifts from Santa (there are obvious ways to object, of course).</p>

<p>Santa Clause also does not seem to meet the criteria for remuneration. He brings "gifts" or "presents" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus</a>); "A gift or a present is an item given to someone without the expectation of payment or return" - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift</a></p>

<p>In many cultures, something that may be considered payment is left for Santa (e.g. milk &amp; cookies in the US &amp; Canada; sherry or beer and mince pies in Britain &amp; Australia; rice porridge in Denmark, Norway &amp; Sweden); however, I can find no source that indicates that failing to leave these items will result in suspension of gifts. - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus</a></p>

<p>Also:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'enterprise' means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, Santa Clause is neither a natural nor legal person. Human Beings "acquire legal personhood when they are born (or even before...", juridical persons "acquire legal personhood when they are incorporated" (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person" rel="noreferrer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person</a>). I am not aware of Santa Clause having been born, nor incorporated.</p>

<p>Addendum:</p>

<p>There was a question if "being nice" qualifies as remuneration. I would argue against this for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>If an item is traded for remuneration, it is, by definition, not a present. The items are clearly declared as presents.</li>
<li>Santa is not the recipient of the "niceness" (in almost all cases). </li>
<li>Although it is clearly document in "Santa Claus is coming to town", (H. Gillespie et al.) that "he's going to find out who's been naughty or nice", "He knows when you've been bad or good" and "He's making a list", there is nothing in this thesis that claims that this list affects the presents. Wikipedia claims it does, but none of the sources it cites (that I checked) back this up. Does anybody know of a reasonable source for this, or is it just an urban myth? Does anybody know of a child that has not received a present, <em>because they were naughty</em>?</li>
</ul>

<p>IANAL but here is my take of things.</p>

<p>In a nuthsell, GPDR requires any businesses/organizations/pineapples that have users in the European Union to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disclose what they do with the info they have on you, and why they need it;</li>
<li>Disclose with whom they share that information, and what those other businesses/organizations/pineapples do with it;</li>
<li>Allow you to order them to "forget" you. Once you give them the order, they (and their partners) have to delete all your data that <strong>can be used to identify you</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>All within limits of reasonability, of course. You can't order the government or a bank to forget that you have not paid your credit card bill and your income tax in months, for example.</p>

<hr>

<p>Santa has to adhere to the GDPR only for some europeans. For starters, many european countries are not members of the EU, such as Norway and Serbia. Santa Claus also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befana" rel="noreferrer">does not operate in Italy</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>What would most probably happen is that the elves in charge of Santa's legal department will have sent every parent or legal guardian in the 28 (soon to be 27) member states a letter around May 25 stating that:</p>

<ul>
<li>They collect personal data from their children in order to assess a naughtiness score;</li>
<li>They are the keepers of the data. The processors of the data are Tencent and Alibaba, two chinese companies that specialize in social credit systems;</li>
<li>The legal guardian or parent may choose to opt-out of the system at any time, if they so wish. They may also request their children's personal data removed from the system at any moment, no questions asked;</li>
<li>However, opting out means their kids will never receive christmas presents again, at least until they join the program once more. Gifts not received due to non-participation will not be resent when they rejoin;</li>
<li>Participation does not imply in presents. Should a child receive a low reputation score due to naughty actions, they may instead receive a lump of coal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus" rel="noreferrer">a visit from Krampus</a>, or whatever punishment is seen as fit for the culture of the country where they live.</li>
</ul>

<p>Adults capable of having children will also receive a notice that in the future, they will have to manually input any future children's data in the system if they wish to receive christmas presents. Of course, people who have opted out of any social credit system will not receive such messages.</p>

<hr>

<p>Finally, Santa will not be the only one sending such letters. So will every imaginary folklore people who bring any joy to kids:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tooth fairy (and her rat affiliates in France) will promise that any data linking fallen teeth to their owners is anonymized;</li>
<li>Sandman will make sure that parents/legal guardians dream with his new EULA ASAP. Their children will not have sweet dreams until their parents agree to it. Should they opt out, their children will have neither dreams not nightmares.</li>
<li>When winter comes, rather than patterns on windows, people will see Jack Frost new service terms, and a couple of ice buttons for opt-in and opt-out;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Easter Bunny is the only one having an easy time. AFAIK in Europe he does not hide chocolate  eggs for kids to look for - rather, people paint actual eggs and give those as presents. He will provide an easy opt out for people who don't want to pay him his royalties.</p>

<p>A letter to Santa is considered to be implied consent for data storage, as the data is required for the requested delivery of presents. </p>

<p>This is similar to the implied consent between a patient and a healthcare provider. </p>

<p>Santa will use the data for the purposes of direct gift-giving, without breaching confidentiality.</p>

<p>If you would like to remove your data, or would like to access your data to see if you are considered naughty or nice, you will have to write another letter to Santa. </p>

<p>Santa will have 30 days to respond to your request. If this is in terms of working days, you should expect a reply by 2048.</p>

<p>He's not a regular person, he's Santa, why shouldn't he simply know all he needs to know? In fact, even under GDPR, no one is obliged to call everyone whose number they have in their head. So personal memories are very clearly exempt from the "any collection of data" clause.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Santa is not in any way a commercial entity and doesn't act commercially. To project our usual human assumptions about our economic system onto a being like Santa is flawed reasoning.</p>

<p>He simply informs everyone involved in the enforcement of GDPR that if they take action against him he will replace everyone's present that year with a note explaining why they didn't get what they asked for and giving the names and addresses of those responsible.</p>

<p><strong>He doesn't have to</strong></p>

<p>I might point out that as he is based in the North pole, an area that doesn't fall within the EU's borders, arguably he doesn't have to <em>technically</em> comply with GDPR because the regulation only impacts European businesses, and Santa isn't in Europe.</p>

<p>How GDPR impacts countries outside of the EU is another question altogether, and is certainly a grey area legally because how would the EU enforce it's laws over that of another sovereign nation state or a company located in another country?</p>

<p>They could certain legislate some absurd law (sounds like great grounds for a story) but then how can they enforce against a man who travels faster than the speed of light and can disappear down small chimneys? I'd love to see some lawyers try to serve notice to the man in red in the North pole. A full arctic expedition just to serve some legal documents.</p>

<p>On a legal technicality, GDPR allows for data to be retained where it's needed to provide a service - in this case, knowing the address and whether they're children who meet the eligibility criteria (asleep, good) for present delivery is fundamental. Although, if he's bound to GDPR, then he's probably also bound to anti-discrimination laws regarding good and bad kids.</p>

<p>Santa did forsee this decades ago. Once he understood where our law-addicted society was headed, he instructed his huge apparatus of elven servants to foster the belief that he didn’t exist. This strategy has been so successful, that no member of the EU executive dares taking action against him, for they would be branded as crazy and sent to uncomfortable places. In fact last year around Christmas I saw something big and distinctly sledge-like in the sky. I was naive enough to point it out, but when I heard someone at the table mutter „97, hampf, dampf, retirement home“, I started giggling and pretending to be drunk... </p>

<p><strong>The elf's head loophole</strong></p>

<p>Santa could hire more elves and teach them memorization techniques for committing all the personal information to memory. The elves would self-organize into groups by cities and would then label themselves with their city region that they have memorized.</p>

<p>Santa can then have easy access to the data without violating any GDPR restrictions.</p>

<p>I'm not a GDPR expert but I can't imagine it prohibiting people (or elves) from remembering personal information. To stop Santa from using this loophole I guess the next move for GDPR is to prohibit systematic memorization of personal information.</p>

<p>But until then Santa is likely to be wanting an AI for predicting which presents that are going to be popular next year so that he can get his elves producing them already. We better stop him before he attempts to do this because it will require quite a few elves in some really ridiculous jobs. Although it would be a really impressive setup of elves!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9780/did-english-ever-have-a-formal-version-of-you">https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/9780/did-english-ever-have-a-formal-version-of-you</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38755412">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>Actually, somewhat contrary to the fine answer selected above, <strong><em>you</em></strong> was not originally the form that paired with the familiar singular <strong><em>thee</em></strong>. Rather, the nominative (and vocative) form was <strong><em>ye</em>.</strong> The now-common <strong><em>you</em></strong> was originally used in objective forms alone, so accusative or dative.</p>

<p>For example, Wordsworth draws the nominative–dative distinction when he writes in <em>Lyrical Ballads</em> vii: “Yet <em>ye</em> are seven! — I pray <em>you</em> tell, Sweet Maid, how this may be.” A vocative example by Shakespeare can be found in <em>Richard II</em> III. ii. 84: “Looke not to the ground, <em>Ye</em> fauorites of a King.”</p>

<p>The <em>OED</em> explains of  ‘<em>ye</em>’ how:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the earliest periods of English <em>ye</em> was restricted to the nominative plural. In the 13th cent. it came to be used as a nominative singular = ‘thou’, first as a respectful form addressed to a superior. This use survives in modern dialects, especially (in the form <em>ee</em>) in interrog. and imperative formulæ (e.g. <em>Dee</em> = ‘do ye’), but also in objective uses = ‘thee’ (e.g. <em>Oi tell ee</em>). When <em>you</em> had usurped the place of <em>ye</em> as a nominative, <em>ye</em> came to be used (in the 15th cent.), vice versa, as an objective singular and plural (= ‘thee’ and ‘you’).</p>
  
  <p>Now (in all uses) only <em>dial</em>., <em>arch</em>., or <em>poet</em>.; in ordinary use replaced by <strong>you</strong> <em>pron</em>.</p>
  
  <p>Illustration of Forms:</p>
  
  <p><strong>a.</strong> OE <strong>ge</strong>, <strong>gie</strong>, <strong>gee</strong>, ME <strong>ȝie</strong>, (<strong>gie</strong>, <strong>ge</strong>), ME ( ME–17 <em>Sc.</em> printed <strong>ze</strong>) <strong>ȝe</strong>, ME <strong>ȝee</strong>, <em>north.</em> <strong>yhe</strong>, ME–15 north. <strong>ȝhe</strong>, ME–16 <strong>yee</strong> (ME <strong>jȝe</strong>, <strong>hye</strong>, ME <strong>iȝe</strong>, <strong>iye</strong>, (<strong>i)he</strong>, 16, 18 <em>dial.</em> <strong>yea</strong>), ME– <strong>ye</strong>.</p>
  
  <p><strong>b.</strong> In combination, proclitically or enclitically, with other words, as: †<em>ȝet</em> = ye it, <em>yare</em> = ye are, y’have; <em>d’ee</em>, <em>dee</em> = do ye, <em>hark’ee</em>, <em>harkee</em>. Now <em>dial</em>.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>1  a.</strong> The pronoun used (as the plural of 2nd singular <strong>thou</strong> <em>pron</em>.) in addressing a number of persons (or, rhetorically, of things), in the nominative (or vocative).</p>
    
    <p><strong>†2 b.</strong> In apposition to <em>self</em> (<strong>ye self</strong>, <strong>ye selven</strong> = yourselves): see <strong>self</strong> <em>pron</em>. 2. <em>Obs</em>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>1 c.</strong> In apposition to and preceding a <em>n</em>. (or <em>adj</em>. used <em>absol</em>.) in the vocative.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2 a.</strong> Used instead of <em>thou</em> in addressing a single person (originally as a mark of respect or deference, later generally: cf. <strong>thou</strong> n., <strong>you</strong> <em>pron</em>.).</p>
    
    <p><strong>2 b.</strong> In apposition to and preceding a n. in the vocative.</p>
    
    <p><strong>3 a.</strong> Used as objective (accusative or dative) instead of <em>you</em> (in plural or singular sense).</p>
    
    <p><strong>†3 b.</strong> Used redundantly (‘ethical dative’). <em>Obs</em>.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>In contrast, here’s its note about <em>you</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Originally the accusative and dative plural of the second personal pronoun: see <strong>thou</strong> <em>n</em>.  for the declension of the 2nd person pronoun in Old English and Middle English. Between 1300 and 1400 it began to be used also for the nominative <strong>ye</strong> <em>pron</em> which it had replaced in general use by about 1600. During the 14th century it also appears as a substitute for the singular obj. <strong>thee</strong> <em>n</em>.  and nominative <strong>thou</strong> <em>n</em>., being originally used in token of respect in addressing a superior, but later also to an equal, and ultimately generally: compare <strong>thou</strong> <em>pron</em>. 1. Thus <strong>you</strong> is now the general pronoun of the second person, nominative or objective, singular or plural.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The historical forms given for <em>you</em> are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Forms:  OE–ME <strong>eow</strong>, (OE <strong>ieow, iow</strong> ME <strong>ȝeau, heou, heow, how, ȝehw</strong>) ME <strong>eou, ȝeu, ȝew,</strong> ME <strong>ou, hou, ȝu,</strong> ME <strong>iou, æu, ew, heu, eo, oeu, howe, ȝeow, ȝuw, ov,</strong> ME <strong>ow, owe, ȝiu,</strong> ME <strong>eu, yu,</strong> (15 <em>Sc</em>.) <strong>ȝou</strong>, ME <strong>iow, ȝue, ȝuu, ȝouȝ, yuu, youu, yhow,</strong> ME <strong>ȝowe, ȝhow, ȝo,</strong> (15–16 <em>Sc</em>.) <strong>ȝow</strong>, ME–16 <strong>yow</strong>, ME <strong>ȝoue, ȝewe, ȝhu, yowe, yoow, yw, yo, yewe,</strong> <em>Sc</em>. <strong>yhu, yhw,</strong> ME–15 <strong>youe</strong>, 15 <strong>iow</strong>, 16 <strong>yew</strong>, ME– <strong>you</strong>, (18 <em>dial</em>. and <em>vulgar</em> <strong>yah, yer</strong>, also <strong>yez</strong> <em>pron</em>.).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whereas the historical forms given for <em>thou</em> are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OE–ME <strong>ðu</strong>, OE–ME <strong>þu</strong>, (ME <strong>tu, tou, -te</strong>), ME (<strong>þe, þeou</strong>), <strong>ðhu</strong>, ME <strong>þou</strong>, ME–15 <strong>thu</strong>, (ME <strong>þouȝ</strong>), ME <strong>þow</strong>, ( -<strong>tow</strong>), ME–15 <strong>thow</strong>, ME, 15 (18 <em>dial</em>.) <strong>th</strong>-, <strong>th’</strong>, (ME <strong>thowe</strong>), ME– <strong>thou</strong>. (Mod. <em>dial</em>. <strong>thau, thaw, thah, tha; theau, theow, thoo, thu; tau, taw, ta, tay; teau, teaw, teu, too, tou, tow; doo, dou, du,</strong> etc.: see <em>Eng. Dial. Dict</em>.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s a lot more than that there if you check out the <em>OED</em> entries for <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/231466"><em>ye</em></a>, <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/201051"><em>thou</em></a>, and <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/232147"><em>you</em></a>.</p>

I wasted at least 5 years building stuff nobody needed.</p><p>2. Kill your EGO.
It's not about me, but the user. I must want what the user wants, not what I want.</p><p>3. Don't chaise investors, chase users, and then investors will be chasing you.</p><p>4. Never hire managers.
Only hire doers until PMF.</p><p>5. Landing page is the least important thing in a startup.</p><p>6. Hire only fullstack devs.
There is nothing less productive in this world than a team of developers.</p><p>7. Chase global market from day 1.
You'll win or fail despite the market you target in most cases, so go for bigger upside.</p><p>8. Do SEO from day 2.
As early as you can. I ignored this for 14 years. It's my biggest regret.</p><p>9. Sell features, before building them.
Ask existing users if they want this feature. I run DMs with 10-20 users every day, where I chat about all my ideas and features I wanna add.</p><p>10. Hire only people you would wanna hug.
My mentor said this to me in 2015. And it was a big shift. I realized that if I don't wanna hug the person, it means I dislike them. Even if I can't say why, but that's the fact. Sooner or later, we would have a conflict and eventually break up.</p><p>11. Invest all money into your startups and friends.
Not crypt0, not stockmarket, not properties.
I did some math, if I kept investing all my money into all my friends’ startups, that would be about 70 investments.
3 of them turned into unicorns eventually. Since 2022, I have invested all my money into my products, friends, and network.</p><p>12. Post on Twitter daily.
I started posting here in March this year. It's my primary source of new connections and traffic.</p><p>13. Don't work/partner with corporates.
Corporations always seem like an amazing opportunity. They're big and rich, they promise huge stuff, millions of users, etc. But every single time none of this happens. Because you talk to a regular employees there. They waste your time, destroy focus, shift priorities.</p><p>14. Don't get ever distracted by hype, e.g. crypt0.
I lost 1.5 years of my life this way.
I met the worst people along the way. Fricks, scammers, thieves. Some of my close friends turned into thieves along the way, just because it was so common in that space.</p><p>15. Don't build consumer apps. Only b2b.
Consumer apps are so hard, like a lottery. It's just 0.00001% who make it big. The rest don't.
Even if I got many users, then there is a monetization challenge.</p><p>16. Don't hold on bad project for too long, max 1 year.
Some projects just don't work. In most cases, it's either the idea that's so wrong that you can't even pivot it or it's a team that is good one by one but can't make it as a team.</p><p>17. Tech conferences are a waste of time.
They cost money, take energy, and time and you never really meet anyone there. Most people there are the "good" employees of corporations who were sent there as a perk for being loyal to the corporation.</p><p>18. Scrum is a Scam.
If I had a team that had to be nagged every morning with questions as if they were children in kindergarten, then things would eventually fail.
The only good stuff I managed to do happened with people who were grownups and could manage their stuff. We would just do everything over chat as a sync on goals and plans.</p><p>19. Outsource nothing at all until PMF.
In a startup, almost everything needs to be done in a slightly different way, more creative, and more integrated into the vision. When outsourcing, the external members get no love and no case for the product. It's just yet another assignment in their boring job.</p><p>20. Bootstrap.
I spent way too much time raising money. I raised more than 10 times, preseed, seed, and series A. But each time it was a 3-9 month project, meetings every week, and lots of destruction. I could afford to bootstrap, but I still went the VC-funded way, I don't know why. To be honest, I didn't know bootstrapping was a thing I could do or anyone does.</p><p>That's it.</p></div></td></div></div>]]></description>

A little more than a century ago, these woods brimmed with American chestnuts—stately Goliaths that could grow as high as 130 feet tall and more than 10 feet wide. Nicknamed “the redwoods of the East,” some 4 billion American chestnuts dotted the United States’ eastern flank, stretching from the misty coasts of Maine down into the thick humidity of Appalachia.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The American chestnut was, as the writer Susan Freinkel <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Chestnut-Death-Rebirth-Perfect/dp/0520259947">noted in her 2009 book</a>, “a perfect tree.” Its wood housed birds and mammals; its leaves infused the soil with minerals; its flowers sated honeybees that would ferry pollen out to nearby trees. In the autumn, its branches would bend under the weight of nubby grape-size nuts. When they dropped to the forest floor, they’d nourish raccoons, bears, turkey, and deer. For generations, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://indiananativeplants.org/images/resources/Gordon%20Mitchell%20Articles/GM_american_chestnut.pdf">Indigenous</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/2021/10/26/plantofthemonth-american-chestnut/">people</a> feasted on the nuts, split the wood for kindling, and laced the leaves into their medicine. Later on, European settlers, too, introduced the nuts into their recipes and orchards, and eventually learned to incorporate the trees’ sturdy, rot-resistant wood into fence posts, telephone poles, and railroad ties. The chestnut became a tree that could shepherd people “from cradle to grave,” Patrícia Fernandes, the assistant director of the American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry, told me. It made up the cribs that newborn babies were placed into; it shored up the coffins that bodies were laid to rest inside.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But in modern American life, chestnuts are almost entirely absent. In the first half of the 20th century, a fungal disease called blight, inadvertently imported from Asia on trade ships, wiped out nearly all of the trees. Chestnut wood disappeared from newly made furniture; people forgot the taste of the fruits, save those imported from abroad. Subsistence farmers lost their entire livelihoods. After reigning over forests for millennia, the species went functionally extinct—a loss that a biologist once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/chestnutty-180940693/">declared</a> “the greatest ecological disaster in North America since the Ice Age.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Most of the people who lived during the American chestnut heyday are gone. But the nutty world they lived in could yet make a comeback. For decades, a small cohort of volunteers and scientists—many of them the children and grandchildren of chestnut growers long gone—has been working to return the American chestnut to its native range. It’s a quest that’s partly about salvaging biodiversity and partly a mea culpa. “The hope is that you can fix something that we as humans broke,” says Kendra Collins, the American Chestnut Foundation’s director of regional programs in New England. If restoration is successful, it’ll bring back a tree unlike any other—versatile, practical, nourishing, uniquely American.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1874/12/old-trees/630598/">From the December 1874 issue: Old trees</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">For all of its woes, the American chestnut isn’t technically rare: An estimated 430 million of the trees can still be found in the forests of the American East. But more than 80 percent of these trees never grow past an inch or so in diameter, Sara Fitzsimmons, the American Chestnut Foundation’s chief conservation officer, told me. Blight infiltrates cracks in the bark, essentially girdling the stem until it starves; the roots below can survive to resprout but seldom live long enough to reproduce. Locked into an endless cycle of adolescence, death, and rebirth, the plant can no longer sustain the ecological functions it once did. When the tree went into decline, at least a few animal species that depended on it did too—among them, the American chestnut moth and the Allegheny woodrat, both of which, under additional pressure from deforestation and human encroachment, were driven to near extinction.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Reinstating the American chestnut’s former glory won’t be easy. Blight is now entrenched in North America, impossible to eradicate; the best hope for the trees is to imbue them with pathogen tolerance. Decades ago, that plan seemed simple: All American breeders would need to do, the thinking went, was cross the American species with their naturally more blight-resistant Chinese cousins a few times over, making it possible to pull off “the biggest restoration in history” in as little as two decades, says Brian Clark, the vice president of orchard development for the American Chestnut Foundation’s Massachusetts/Rhode Island chapter. But in recent years, researchers have discovered that the blight resistance is scattered across “just about every chromosome” in the Chinese chestnut genome, Collins told me, making it difficult to reliably breed the trait into mixed-lineage trees. Forty years into its tenure, the foundation has successfully bred a relatively blight-resistant cultivar whose genome is roughly 5 percent Chinese. But the process of producing the trees is a lot more of a pain than researchers hoped.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/a-new-chestnut/302742/">Read: A new chestnut</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Other chestnut enthusiasts have instead hung their hopes on a transgenic tree known as Darling 58, developed by a team of scientists at the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Its genome is entirely American chestnut, save for a single gene, borrowed from wheat, that can help the plant neutralize one of the blight’s most toxic weapons. But with only a single genetic shield against the fungus, “I suspect blight will eventually evolve around” the borrowed gene, says Yvonne Federowicz, the past president of the American Chestnut Foundation’s Massachusetts/Rhode Island chapter. The lineage’s resilience against blight <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tacf.org/tacf-discontinues-development-of-darling-58/">has already been spotty</a>—to the point that the American Chestnut Foundation recently withdrew its support for Darling 58. (The ESF team that designed the Darling trees, meanwhile, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.esf.edu/chestnut/progress-report/2023.php">stands by</a> them.) And some Indigenous communities have expressed skepticism about introducing GMOs into the chestnut-restoration fight; in 2019, two members of the Foundation’s MA/RI chapter—one of them the chapter’s president—<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.telegram.com/story/news/local/south-west/2019/03/28/chestnut-champions-quit-to-protest-genetic-engineering/5579303007/">announced their resignation</a> in protest of the organization’s support for transgenic trees.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Regardless of which American-chestnut strains remain in contention, Fitzsimmons told me, restoration could take centuries. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://extension.unh.edu/sites/default/files/migrated_unmanaged_files/Resource004119_Rep5869.pdf">Some 100 million acres</a> of suitable chestnut habitat, she said, are waiting to be filled in the United States—no sole solution will likely be enough on its own. But maybe that’s fitting for a tree that refuses to relegate itself to a single purpose. “There are other trees that can produce bigger crops in a given year, or maybe grow taller, or can be more dense, or make more valuable lumber,” Andrew Newhouse, the director of ESF’s American Chestnut Research and Restoration Project, told me. “But not all in the same tree.” The American chestnut is, to our forests and our livelihoods, irreplaceable: “There aren’t really any modern equivalents.”</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/plants-for-the-planet/483132/">Read: The fading meaning of ‘GMO’</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Chestnuts of any variety are also absolutely delicious—phenomenal plain, roasted, or even raw, thanks to their sweet-savory flavor and starchy texture reminiscent of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/11/sweet-potato-thanksgiving/672174/">a baked sweet potato</a>. Japanese speakers often describe them as <em>hoku hoku</em>—hot, fluffy, and flaky, a sensation that’s like a cozy balm on chilly, wintry days, Namiko Hirasawa Chen, the chef behind the food blog <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/">Just One Cookbook</a>, told me. In Europe and Asia, where other species of the trees still thrive, days-long festivals have been dedicated to eating chestnuts. Here, though, chestnuts are largely forgotten, save for in nostalgic Christmas songs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But some people remember. Earlier this month, I drove to Central Massachusetts to attend the American Chestnut Foundation’s MA/RI chapter’s annual meeting, where board members and volunteers had prepared a stunning potluck. Among the tastiest dishes were a creamy chestnut stew, a turkey-chestnut chili, and a cabbage-and-sausage dish studded with chestnuts. Best of all were two desserts: flaky chestnut oat bars that melted like pie crust in my mouth and a luxurious chestnut ice cream that made me forget my lactose intolerance.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As far as I can tell, no one seemed to have bothered cooking with American chestnuts; they’re the smallest of the varieties—some as teeny as chickpeas—and not efficient to work with. But at the close of the meeting, a local grower, Mark Meehl, handed me a bag of Americans from his Massachusetts orchards. The next evening, I scored them, parboiled them, and roasted them next to some gargantuan Europeans, easily six times their size. It was, admittedly, a <em>lot </em>of work. But it made each nut precious, almost like a hard-won prize.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-3" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 4" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="4"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1897/08/the-american-forests/305017/">From the August 1897 issue: John Muir’s case for saving American forests</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I pried the Americans open, I found them to be consistently sweeter, crunchier, and, well, <em>nuttier </em>than their European counterparts. And although several of the European chestnuts—imported from Italy—appeared to have rotted during their long journey to my oven, every American nut was fresh. Not a single one of them had traveled more than 50 miles from its source. I scarfed all 10 of them down, and only wished I could have strolled into the woods near my house to gather up some more.</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<b>SOME THOUGHTS ON THE REAL WORLD BY ONE WHO GLIMPSED IT AND FLED</b>
<br>
Bill Watterson<br> Kenyon College Commencement<br> May 20,
1990</center>
<p>
I have a recurring dream about Kenyon. In it, I'm walking to the post
office on the way to my first class at the start of the school year.
Suddenly it occurs to me that I don't have my schedule memorized, and
I'm not sure which classes I'm taking, or where exactly I'm supposed to
be going.
<br>
As I walk up the steps to the postoffice, I realize I don't have my box
key, and in fact, I can't remember what my box number is. I'm certain
that everyone I know has written me a letter, but I can't get them. I
get more flustered and annoyed by the minute. I head back to Middle
Path, racking my brains and asking myself, "How many more years
until I graduate? ...Wait, didn't I graduate already?? How old AM
I?" Then I wake up.
</p><p>
Experience is food for the brain. And four years at Kenyon is a rich
meal. I suppose it should be no surprise that your brains will probably
burp up Kenyon for a long time. And I think the reason I keep having the
dream is because its central image is a metaphor for a good part of
life: that is, not knowing where you're going or what you're doing.
<br>
I graduated exactly ten years ago. That doesn't give me a great deal of
experience to speak from, but I'm emboldened by the fact that I can't
remember a bit of MY commencement, and I trust that in half an hour, you
won't remember of yours either.
</p><p>
In the middle of my sophomore year at Kenyon, I decided to paint a copy
of Michelangelo's "Creation of Adam" from the Sistine Chapel
on the ceiling of my dorm room. By standing on a chair, I could reach
the ceiling, and I taped off a section, made a grid, and started to copy
the picture from my art history book.
<br>
Working with your arm over your head is hard work, so a few of my more
ingenious friends rigged up a scaffold for me by stacking two chairs on
my bed, and laying the table from the hall lounge across the chairs and
over to the top of my closet. By climbing up onto my bed and up the
chairs, I could hoist myself onto the table, and lie in relative comfort
two feet under my painting. My roommate would then hand up my paints,
and I could work for several hours at a stretch.
</p><p>
The picture took me months to do, and in fact, I didn't finish the work
until very near the end of the school year. I wasn't much of a painter
then, but what the work lacked in color sense and technical flourish, it
gained in the incongruity of having a High Renaissance masterpiece in a
college dorm that had the unmistakable odor of old beer cans and older
laundry.<br>
The painting lent an air of cosmic grandeur to my room, and
it seemed to put life into a larger perspective. Those boring, flowery
English poets didn't seem quite so important, when right above my head
God was transmitting the spark of life to man.<br>
My friends and I liked the finished painting so much in fact, that we
decided I should ask permission to do it. As you might expect, the
housing director was curious to know why I wanted to paint this elaborate
picture on my ceiling a few weeks before school let out. Well, you don't
get to be a sophomore at Kenyon without learning how to fabricate ideas
you never had, but I guess it was obvious that my idea was being proposed
retroactively. It ended up that I was allowed to paint the picture, so
long as I painted over it and returned the ceiling to normal at the end
of the year. And that's what I did.
</p><p>
Despite the futility of the whole episode, my fondest memories of
college are times like these, where things were done out of some
inexplicable inner imperative, rather than because the work was
demanded. Clearly, I never spent as much time or work on any authorized
art project, or any poli sci paper, as I spent on this one act of
vandalism.
</p><p>
It's surprising how hard we'll work when the work is done just for
ourselves. And with all due respect to John Stuart Mill, maybe
utilitarianism is overrated. If I've learned one thing from being a
cartoonist, it's how important playing is to creativity and happiness.
My job is essentially to come up with 365 ideas a year.<br>
If you ever want to find out just how uninteresting you really are,
get a job where the quality and frequency of your thoughts determine
your livelihood. I've found that the only way I can keep writing
every day, year after year, is to let my mind wander into new
territories. To do that, I've had to cultivate a kind of mental
playfulness.
</p><p>
We're not really taught how to recreate constructively. We need to do
more than find diversions; we need to restore and expand ourselves. Our
idea of relaxing is all too often to plop down in front of the
television set and let its pandering idiocy liquefy our brains. Shutting
off the thought process is not rejuvenating; the mind is like a car
battery-it recharges by running.<br>
You may be surprised to find how quickly daily routine and the demands
of "just getting by: absorb your waking hours. You may be surprised
matters of habit rather than thought and inquiry. You may be surprised
to find how quickly you start to see your life in terms of other people's
expectations rather than issues. You may be surprised to find out how
quickly reading a good book sounds like a luxury.
</p><p>
At school, new ideas are thrust at you every day. Out in the world,
you'll have to find the inner motivation to search for new ideas on your
own. With any luck at all, you'll never need to take an idea and squeeze
a punchline out of it, but as bright, creative people, you'll be called
upon to generate ideas and solutions all your lives. Letting your mind
play is the best way to solve problems.<br>
For me, it's been liberating to put myself in the mind of a fictitious
six year-old each day, and rediscover my own curiosity. I've been amazed
at how one ideas leads to others if I allow my mind to play and wander.
I know a lot about dinosaurs now, and the information has helped me out
of quite a few deadlines.<br>
A playful mind is inquisitive, and learning is fun. If you indulge your
natural curiosity and retain a sense of fun in new experience, I think
you'll find it functions as a sort of shock absorber for the bumpy road
ahead.
</p><p>
<br>
So, what's it like in the real world? Well, the food is better, but
beyond that, I don't recommend it.
</p><p>
I don't look back on my first few years out of school with much
affection, and if I could have talked to you six months ago, I'd have
encouraged you all to flunk some classes and postpone this moment as
long as possible. But now it's too late.<br>
Unfortunately, that was all the advice I really had. When I was sitting
where you are, I was one of
the lucky few who had a cushy job waiting for me. I'd drawn political
cartoons for the Collegian for four years, and the Cincinnati Post had
hired me as an editorial cartoonist. All my friends were either dreading
the infamous first year of law school, or despondent about their chances
of convincing anyone that a history degree had any real application
outside of academia.
</p><p>
Boy, was I smug.
</p><p>
As it turned out, my editor instantly regretted his decision to hire me.
By the end of the summer, I'd been given notice; by the beginning of
winter, I was in an unemployment line; and by the end of my first year
away from Kenyon, I was broke and living with my parents again. You can
imagine how upset my dad was when he learned that Kenyon doesn't give
refunds.<br> Watching my career explode on the lauchpad caused some soul
searching. I eventually admitted that I didn't have what it takes to be
a good political cartoonist, that is, an interest in politics, and I
returned to my firs love, comic strips.<br> For years I got nothing but
rejection letters, and I was forced to accept a real job.
</p><p>
A REAL job is a job you hate. I designed car ads and grocery ads in the
windowless basement of a convenience store, and I hated every single
minute of the 4-1/2 million minutes I worked there. My fellow prisoners
at work were basically concerned about how to punch the time clock at
the perfect second where they would earn another 20 cents without doing
any work for it.<br> It was incredible: after every break, the entire
staff would stand around in the garage where the time clock was, and
wait for that last click. And after my used car needed the head gasket
replaced twice, I waited in the garage too.
</p><p>
It's funny how at Kenyon, you take for granted that the people around
you think about more than the last episode of Dynasty. I guess that's
what it means to be in an ivory tower.
</p><p>
Anyway, after a few months at this job, I was starved for some life of
the mind that, during my lunch break, I used to read those poli sci
books that I'd somehow never quite finished when I was here. Some of
those books were actually kind of interesting. It was a rude shock to
see just how empty and robotic life can be when you don't care about
what you're doing, and the only reason you're there is to pay the
bills.<br> Thoreau said, </p><blockquote>"the mass of men lead lives of
quiet desperation."</blockquote><br> That's one of those dumb
cocktail quotations that will strike fear in your heart as you get
older. Actually, I was leading a life of loud desperation.<p>

When it seemed I would be writing about "Midnite Madness
Sale-abrations" for the rest of my life, a friend used to console
me that cream always rises to the top. I used to think, so do people who
throw themselves into the sea.</p><p> <br>


I tell you all this because it's worth recognizing that there is no such
thing as an overnight success. You will do well to cultivate the
resources in yourself that bring you happiness outside of success or
failure. The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we
arrive. At that time, we turn around and say, yes, this is obviously
where I was going all along. It's a good idea to try to enjoy the
scenery on the detours, because you'll probably take a few.</p><p>

I still haven't drawn the strip as long as it took me to get the job. To
endure five years of rejection to get a job requires either a faith in
oneself that borders on delusion, or a love of the work. I loved the
work.<br> Drawing comic strips for five years without pay drove home the
point that the fun of cartooning wasn't in the money; it was in the
work. This turned out to be an important realization when my break
finally came.</p><p>

Like many people, I found that what I was chasing wasn't what I caught.
I've wanted to be a cartoonist since I was old enough to read cartoons,
and I never really thought about cartoons as being a business. It never
occurred to me that a comic strip I created would be at the mercy of a
bloodsucking corporate parasite called a syndicate, and that I'd be
faced with countless ethical decisions masquerading as simple business
decisions.<br> To make a business decision, you don't need much
philosophy; all you need is greed, and maybe a little knowledge of how
the game works.</p><p>

As my comic strip became popular, the pressure to capitalize on that
popularity increased to the point where I was spending almost as much
time screaming at executives as drawing. Cartoon merchandising is a $12
billion dollar a year industry and the syndicate understandably wanted a
piece of that pie. But the more I though about what they wanted to do
with my creation, the more inconsistent it seemed with the reasons I
draw cartoons.<br> Selling out is usually more a matter of buying in.
Sell out, and you're really buying into someone else's system of values,
rules and rewards.<br> The so-called "opportunity" I faced
would have meant giving up my individual voice for that of a
money-grubbing corporation. It would have meant my purpose in writing
was to sell things, not say things. My pride in craft would be
sacrificed to the efficiency of mass production and the work of
assistants. Authorship would become committee decision. Creativity would
become work for pay. Art would turn into commerce. In short, money was
supposed to supply all the meaning I'd need.<br> What the syndicate
wanted to do, in other words, was turn my comic strip into everything
calculated, empty and robotic that I hated about my old job. They would
turn my characters into television hucksters and T-shirt sloganeers and
deprive me of characters that actually expressed my own thoughts.</p><p>

On those terms, I found the offer easy to refuse. Unfortunately, the
syndicate also found my refusal easy to refuse, and we've been fighting
for over three years now. Such is American business, I guess, where the
desire for obscene profit mutes any discussion of conscience.</p><p> <br>


You will find your own ethical dilemmas in all parts of your lives, both
personal and professional. We all have different desires and needs, but
if we don't discover what we want from ourselves and what we stand for,
we will live passively and unfulfilled. Sooner or later, we are all
asked to compromise ourselves and the things we care about. We define
ourselves by our actions. With each decision, we tell ourselves and the
world who we are. Think about what you want out of this life, and
recognize that there are many kinds of success.<br> Many of you will be
going on to law school, business school, medical school, or other
graduate work, and you can expect the kind of starting salary that, with
luck, will allow you to pay off your own tuition debts within your own
lifetime.</p><p>

But having an enviable career is one thing, and being a happy person is
another.</p><p>

Creating a life that reflects your values and satisfies your soul is a
rare achievement. In a culture that relentlessly promotes avarice and
excess as the good life, a person happy doing his own work is usually
considered an eccentric, if not a subversive. Ambition is only
understood if it's to rise to the top of some imaginary ladder of
success. Someone who takes an undemanding job because it affords him the
time to pursue other interests and activities is considered a flake. A
person who abandons a career in order to stay home and raise children is
considered not to be living up to his potential-as if a job title and
salary are the sole measure of human worth.<br> You'll be told in a
hundred ways, some subtle and some not, to keep climbing, and never be
satisfied with where you are, who you are, and what you're doing. There
are a million ways to sell yourself out, and I guarantee you'll hear
about them.</p><p>

To invent your own life's meaning is not easy, but it's still allowed,
and I think you'll be happier for the trouble.<br> Reading those turgid
philosophers here in these remote stone buildings may not get you a job,
but if those books have forced you to ask yourself questions about what
makes life truthful, purposeful, meaningful, and redeeming, you have the
Swiss Army Knife of mental tools, and it's going to come in handy all
the time.</p><p>

I think you'll find that Kenyon touched a deep part of you. These have
been formative years. Chances are, at least of your roommates has taught
you everything ugly about human nature you ever wanted to know.<br> With
luck, you've also had a class that transmitted a spark of insight or
interest you'd never had before. Cultivate that interest, and you may
find a deeper meaning in your life that feeds your soul and spirit. Your
preparation for the real world is not in the answers you've learned, but
in the questions you've learned how to ask yourself.<br> Graduating from
Kenyon, I suspect you'll find yourselves quite well prepared indeed.
</p><p>
<br>
I wish you all fulfillment and happiness. Congratulations on your
achievement.
</p><p>

<h2 id="advancing-debugging-with-irb">Advancing Debugging with IRB</h2>

<p>In Ruby 3.2’s IRB (<code>v1.6</code>), we introduced a set of shortcut commands such as <code>debug</code> and <code>next</code> that allowed for a swift
transition to the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/debug"><code>debug</code> gem</a>’s session from a <code>binding.irb</code> breakpoint.
(To avoid confusion, I’ll refer to the <code>debug</code> gem’s session as <code>rdbg</code> from here on.)</p>

<p>This was a significant improvement. However, with the switch, users would instantly lose certain IRB features, such as multi-line input:</p>

<div><pre><code>irb<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:001:0&gt; debug
<span>(</span>ruby<span>)</span> <span>if </span><span>true
eval </span>error: <span>(</span>rdbg<span>)</span>/test.rb:1: syntax error, unexpected end-of-input, expecting <span>`</span><span>then</span><span>' or '</span><span>;</span><span>' or '</span><span>\n</span><span>'
if true
       ^
nil
(rdbg)
</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This year, we’ve taken the user experience to a new level by introducing the <code>irb:rdbg</code> session, which allows users to execute all <code>rdbg</code> commands without exiting the IRB session.</p>

<div><pre><code>irb<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:001&gt; debug
irb:rdbg<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:002<span>*</span> <span>if </span><span>true
</span>irb:rdbg<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:003<span>*</span>   puts <span>"Multi-line input and more!"</span>
irb:rdbg<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:004&gt; end
Multi-line input and more!
nil
irb:rdbg<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:005&gt; th
<span># `th` (show all threads) is a example of a command only present in a `rdbg` session</span>
<span>--</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>#0 (sleep)@test.rb:2:in `&lt;main&gt;'</span>
irb:rdbg<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:006&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>This deep integration offers several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Access to both <a href="https://github.com/ruby/irb?tab=readme-ov-file#commands">IRB</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ruby/debug?tab=readme-ov-file#debug-command-on-the-debug-console">rdbg’s commands</a></li>
  <li>Multi-line input</li>
  <li>Autocompletion</li>
  <li>Symbol aliases to commands, like <code>@</code> (<code>whereami</code>) and <code>$</code> (<code>show_source</code>)</li>
  <li><a href="#pager-support">Pager support</a></li>
</ul>

<p>But most importantly, it offers users a debugging experience equivalent to <code>pry-byebug</code>.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-irbrdbg-from-bindingbreak--debugger">Accessing <code>irb:rdbg</code> from <code>binding.break</code> / <code>debugger</code></h3>

<p>With the <code>debug</code> gem <code>v1.9.0</code>, which will also be part of Ruby 3.3, you can configure it to run <code>irb:rdbg</code> either by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting its <code>irb_console</code> config through the <code>RUBY_DEBUG_IRB_CONSOLE=1</code> environment variable</li>
  <li>Running the <code>irb</code> command in a <code>rdbg</code> session</li>
</ul>

<p>Doing so will give you the same <code>irb:rdbg</code> session in your <code>debug</code> console:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$ RUBY_DEBUG_IRB_CONSOLE</span><span>=</span>1 bundle <span>exec </span>rdbg test.rb
<span>[</span>1, 1] <span>in </span>test.rb
<span>=&gt;</span>   1| a <span>=</span> 1
<span>=&gt;</span><span>#0    &lt;main&gt; at test.rb:1</span>
irb:rdbg<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:002&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="enhancing-autocompletion">Enhancing Autocompletion</h2>

<h3 id="addressing-completion-dropdown-issues">Addressing Completion Dropdown Issues</h3>

<p>In Ruby 3.1, IRB introduced the autocompletion feature. While it has proven to be a useful feature for many users, it
also came with some issues that were hard to overlook:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The dropdown could push up the prompt when the candidate list is long. This not only distracts users but also pushes up
the output history, forcing users to frequently scroll up and down through the session.</li>
  <li>The dropdown’s colors are not configurable, making text hard to read with some terminal themes.</li>
  <li>Under certain conditions, the dropdown could erase previously rendered content.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s a short demonstration of these issues:</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-19-irb-for-ruby-3-3/images/autocompletion-issues.gif" alt="autocompletion issues demo" width="80%"></p>

<p>However, thanks to several fixes on the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/reline">Reline</a> gem (a pure-Ruby replacement of <code>readline</code>),
these issues have been addressed.</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-19-irb-for-ruby-3-3/images/improved-autocompletion.gif" alt="improved autocompletion demo" width="80%"></p>

<p>We are aware that there are other existing issues, such as the lack of debouncing or tab-completion options.
And we will keep improving the feature in future releases.</p>

<h3 id="customizing-dropdown-ui-with-relineface">Customizing Dropdown UI with <code>Reline::Face</code></h3>

<p>With <a href="https://github.com/ruby/reline"><code>Reline</code></a> <code>v0.4.0+</code>, you can use the <code>Reline::Face</code> class to customize the dropdown
UI’s style in your <code>.irbrc</code>.</p>

<p>For instance, this snippet will change the dropdown from its default color scheme to a black-and-white theme:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>Reline</span><span>::</span><span>Face</span><span>.</span><span>config</span><span>(</span><span>:completion_dialog</span><span>)</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>conf</span><span>|</span>
  <span>conf</span><span>.</span><span>define</span> <span>:default</span><span>,</span> <span>foreground: :white</span><span>,</span> <span>background: :black</span>
  <span>conf</span><span>.</span><span>define</span> <span>:enhanced</span><span>,</span> <span>foreground: :black</span><span>,</span> <span>background: :white</span>
  <span>conf</span><span>.</span><span>define</span> <span>:scrollbar</span><span>,</span> <span>foreground: :white</span><span>,</span> <span>background: :black</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The result can be seen below:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-19-irb-for-ruby-3-3/images/black-and-white-completion-dropdown-with-reline-face.png">
  <figcaption>left: default, right: with the customization</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="experimenting-with-more-accurate-completion-using-rbs">Experimenting with More Accurate Completion Using RBS</h3>

<p>Currently, IRB’s autocompletion is powered by a combination of regular expressions and runtime information from <code>Binding</code>.</p>

<p>This provides a decent result for the first level of completion, but can’t support chained method calls.</p>

<p>For example, when the user types <code>'Ruby'.up</code>, IRB can list <code>upcase</code> and <code>upcase!</code>, because it knows <code>'Ruby'</code> is a <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>But when the user types <code>'Ruby'.upcase.</code>, IRB can’t make another suggestion.
This is because it cannot evaluate <code>'Ruby'.upcase</code> to get its value as it risks causing side-effects
(for example, calling <code>User.all.</code> in a Rails app).</p>

<p>However, there is another way we can get an object’s information without evaluation in Ruby: gradual typing.
Therefore, this year <a href="https://github.com/tompng">@tompng</a> initiated the <a href="https://github.com/ruby/repl_type_completor"><code>repl_type_completor</code></a> project to explore if it’s a feasible replacement for the current regexp-based completor.</p>

<p>To give it a try, you need to add this to your Gemfile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>gem</span> <span>"repl_type_completor"</span><span>,</span> <span>group: </span><span>[</span><span>:development</span><span>,</span> <span>:test</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And to activate it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pass the <code>--type-completor</code> flag when starting IRB</li>
  <li>Or add this to your <code>irbrc</code> file:</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><code><span>IRB</span><span>.</span><span>conf</span><span>[</span><span>:COMPLETOR</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>:type</span> <span># default is :regexp</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>For more details, please refer to IRB readme’s <a href="https://github.com/ruby/irb?tab=readme-ov-file#type-based-completion">type completion section</a>.</p>

<h2 id="quality-of-life-improvements">Quality of Life Improvements</h2>



<p>This year, IRB has introduced pager support on the output of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>show_source</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>show_cmds</code> commands</li>
  <li>The new <code>history</code> command</li>
  <li>Evaluation result</li>
</ul>

<p>When these outputs’ height exceeds your terminal’s, IRB will now paginate them:</p>

<p><img src="https://railsatscale.com/2023-12-19-irb-for-ruby-3-3/images/pager-demo.gif" alt="pager demo" width="90%"></p>

<p>This offers several benefits:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can freely scroll up and down with your arrow-up/down keys</li>
  <li>You won’t overscroll to some previous IRB output</li>
  <li>By typing <code>/[search_term]</code>, like <code>/foo</code>, inside a pager, you can easily search any text that contains <code>foo</code>
    <ul>
      <li>This could be extremely useful when inspecting record(s) in a Rails console</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We understand that for some users or under certain conditions, a pager could be more of a hindrance than a help.
Therefore, it’s also possible to disable it with the <code>--no-pager</code> flag, or by adding this to your <code>irbrc</code> file:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>IRB</span><span>.</span><span>conf</span><span>[</span><span>:USE_PAGER</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="omitting-return-value-inspection-with-">Omitting Return Value Inspection with <code>;</code></h3>

<p>Even though paging evaluation result should make long output easier to inspect, sometimes we simply don’t want to see
the return value of certain expressions. For example, the result of <code>users = User.all</code> when it returns hundreds of records.</p>

<p>In such cases, the new IRB allows users to omit the return value by adding a <code>;</code> at the end, like <code>users = User.all;</code>.</p>

<h4 id="example">Example</h4>

<div><pre><code>irb<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:001&gt; long_string <span>=</span> <span>"foo"</span> <span>*</span> 10000<span>;</span>
irb<span>(</span>main<span>)</span>:002&gt; long_string.size
<span>=&gt;</span> 30000
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="history-command">History Command</h3>

<p>IRB now has a <code>history</code> command to display all stored input history (which by default is limited to <code>1000</code>).</p>

<p>Since we usually have a long input history, this command also comes with a <code>-g [term]</code> flag for filtering.</p>

<pre><code>irb(main):006&gt; history -g self
1000: history -g self
803: self
769: self
731: watch self @foo
698: break self.inspect
584: self
582: self
</code></pre>

<h3 id="streamlined-prompt">Streamlined Prompt</h3>

<p>As you may have noticed, IRB’s prompt is now a bit shorter:</p>

<h4 id="before">Before</h4>



<h4 id="after">After</h4>



<p>The removed part is the indent level number, which became redundant after IRB implemented a robust auto-indent feature
for multi-line input.</p>

<h3 id="enhanced-show_source-command">Enhanced <code>show_source</code> Command</h3>

<p>The <code>show_source</code> command has always been an essential tool for many IRB users, especially for debugging.
This year it received two enhancements that will make it even more useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can now use <code>-s</code> to get the method’s super definition if it has one</li>
  <li>It can now display private methods too</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the--s-flag">The <code>-s</code> Flag</h4>

<p>Given this script:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>foo</span>
    <span>"foo"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Bar</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Foo</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>foo</span>
    <span>super</span> <span>+</span> <span>"bar"</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can now get both <code>Bar#foo</code> and its super method (<code>Foo#foo</code>)’s definition:</p>

<pre><code>irb(main):001&gt; show_source Bar#foo

From: test.rb:8

  def foo
    super + "bar"

=&gt; nil
irb(main):002&gt; show_source Bar#foo -s

From: test.rb:2

  def foo
    "foo"
  end

=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<p>You can also stack the flag, like <code>-ss</code>, to walk up the super method chain. And if IRB can’t find the super definition anymore,
it’ll notify you with:</p>

<pre><code>irb(main):003&gt; show_source Bar#foo -ss
Error: Couldn't locate a super definition for Bar#foo
=&gt; nil
</code></pre>

<h2 id="whats-on-the-horizon-for-ruby-34">What’s on the Horizon for Ruby 3.4?</h2>

<h3 id="the-help-command-will-print-help-message">The <code>help</code> Command Will Print Help Message</h3>

<p>When we use a terminal-based application, the first thing we normally do is to type <code>help</code> and learn how to use it.</p>

<p>However, due to historical reasons, IRB’s <code>help</code> command opens up an <code>ri</code> input for Ruby document lookup instead.
This unconventional design can make it hard, especially for new Ruby developers, to learn IRB’s usage.
So we decided to change it in several steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>In Ruby 3.2, we added <code>show_cmds</code> to print the help message and <code>show_doc</code> command as an alias to the <code>help</code> command.</li>
  <li>In Ruby 3.3, IRB will warn users that <code>help</code> is going to be repurposed to act as <code>show_cmds</code>.</li>
  <li>In early 2024, we plan to release IRB <code>v2.0</code>, with the repurposing of <code>help</code> command being one of the breaking changes.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="enhancing-extensibility-command-and-helper-method">Enhancing Extensibility: Command and Helper Method</h3>

<p>Several major Ruby web frameworks, such as <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hanami/hanami">Hanami</a>,
utilize IRB as a platform for their consoles. Additionally, other libraries extend IRB with their custom features via commands.</p>

<p>However, until now, there have been no standard APIs on the IRB side to accommodate new commands or helper methods.
This situation leads to several challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>IRB is unable to display these extended features in its help message.</li>
  <li>Refactoring the relevant parts becomes challenging because they are essentially public when private APIs are used directly.</li>
  <li>Projects need to devise their own ways to utilize IRB, often resulting in similar but slightly different solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>To address these issues, we plan to provide official APIs and relevant documentation to help libraries and applications extend IRB.
Our goal is to transform IRB from not just a great tool, but also into a great platform for other tools.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>I believe that there's an element to this question which has not been covered.  This is very much a personal response.</p>

<p>Your question specifically asks whether it can help you to learn how to fly or become a better pilot.  This is actually two questions in one.</p>

<p>Physical and mental limitations not withstanding, I would say that just about anyone can learn how to fly.  But I don't believe that everyone who can learn how to fly could be a good pilot.  Flying and pilotage are very much more than successfully operating a flying machine in order to fly.  It's even a lot more than doing that and following the procedures (ATC, operating in controlled airspace etc) which accompany it.</p>

<p>Being a good pilot requires a certain aptitude and attitude (and I'm not talking about what you see on the AH).  It needs, let's not beat about the bush, a reasonably good IQ and education.</p>

<p>A pilot becomes good when the operation of the machine or the following of the procedures is not enough to to produce a safe, successful conclusion.  A good pilot avoids the traps and pitfalls that catch the unwary and have proved the rule, all to often, that in the ongoing contest between the earth and flimsy machines arriving in other than controlled circumstances, the earth has yet to lose.  </p>

<p>A good pilot takes care of the machine and it's passengers.  A good pilot can deal with the unexpected and make sound decisions to continue a flight or not or perhaps even to not commit aviation at all.  A good pilot has situational awareness which tells them, via sixth sense, that the bizjet calling left base is a potential threat and is already looking by the time the tower calls.</p>

<p>But much more than this, there are some very important elements to flying which a sim can never provide.</p>

<p>There is the emotional response; that thrill, that feeling of privilege, that unquantifiable human response to flying that is so much more than operating the machine.  There is also a set of skills and mental and physical responses without which, it is not possible to be a "good pilot" (IMHO).</p>

<p>Let me give a brief background of where I'm coming from and a concrete example of what I mean.</p>

<p>I have only a couple of hundred hours.  A handful on fixed wing, the rest on helicopters.  I also have about 3500 hours "flying" big tin on VATSIM (if you are serious about PC simming and don't know about VATSIM, Google for it right now!).</p>

<p>In VATSIM, I can operate a 777 (my favourite) very successfully including all of the related procedures which VATSIM does a remarkably good job of simulating.  I can fly a SID, follow my planned route, follow a STAR and do a visual onto 26R at Heathrow without breaking sweat, talking to and complying with ATC all the way. I can deal with an unexpected hold or a last minute change of arrival without fluster. I know this all works because I have also been lucky enough to do this in a "real" sim (737) and I had no problems at all using the automatics and hand flying the machine for the first 500 and last 1000 feet to depart and arrive safely back at Heathrow.</p>

<p>However, when I was learning to fly a helicopter, the reality of it all was very different.  Hovering is like learning to ride a bike.  I would say anyone with reasonable co-ordination can learn to do it.  I can hover all helicopters I've flown with ease.  Without even thinking about it.  Thing is, I can't really tell you how to do it and I have never been able to keep a PC sim helicopter in the air for more than a few minutes without getting into horrible shape.  Try explaining to a child how to ride a bike.  I reckon it's impossible.</p>

<p>When you switch from lurching around the sky with your instructor calling "I have control" every 20 seconds to that magical moment when you are suddenly in a steady hover, there are some things which simply cannot be simulated which your brain needs.  </p>

<p>The beginners mistake is to focus on the ground, I think most people are looking about 15 metres ahead.  You cannot succeed like that.  What you want to do is focus your eyes well into the distance and let your peripheral vision do the work.  It's almost subconscious and I can't even tell you how it all works but you do realise that you are moving over the ground with subtle cues coming in from your periphery.  </p>

<p>The second, and more important set of cues, are those that come through the "seat of your pants".  With a little experience, you just "know" when the helicopter moves, even before your peripheral vision has picked up the movement and you've already put that pressure on the cyclic (and it generally is pressure, not movement) to arrest the movement before the machine has deviated from it's position.  There are always small movements but to an external observer, you are sitting there, in the air, without so much as a ripple.</p>

<p>Subtle sounds are also important.  I can tell you pretty much where the rotor RPM is without looking at the tach and can certainly tell instantly when it's going down.  The second cue is from the tach but by that time, I'm already on the collective to adjust.  The tach just qualifies what I know and shows me that I'm doing the right thing to correct.</p>

<p>I'm sure that the fixed wing guys could provide good parallels.</p>

<p>My experience on sims tells me that you can indeed learn how to operate the machine and prosecute the procedures around it but it cannot help you to fly, nor to be a good (or better) pilot.  Where a sim can help is in teaching you the operation and procedures to the point where your brain is free to concentrate on flying and pilotage and your heart free to enjoy the sensations, because the mechanical stuff has moved into your subconscious and has become muscle memory.</p>

<p>Flying is emotional; it's passionate; it's determination; it's personal conquest; it runs in your veins. It's many things more than a sim can ever provide.</p>

<p>If you don't get "Oh I have slipped the surly bonds", then you are an operator, not a flyer.</p>

<p>[EDIT]
Am I a good pilot?  I'd say I'm average, and striving to be better, but that, in reality, probably describes most pilots, since it is impossible for most to be better than average.  I do recognise that I'm in that statistically dangerous zone where I have enough hours to think I'm good but not enough hours to prove it.  In my experience, ego and cahonas tell many pilots that they <strong>are</strong> good pilots ;)</p>

The team behind it, led by Dennis Meadows, found that continuing with a “business as usual” growth model would likely lead to environmental and economic collapse within a century. At the time, their discoveries sparked huge controversy among scientists, scholars, and the general public. In the decades since, those discoveries have been supported by patterns of growth, environmental health, and resource use.</p>
<p>Today, forty years after its release, <em>The Limits to Growth</em> remains an important resource for anyone hoping to understand more about the complex system that is our planet.

<p><em>Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Halmos">Paul Halmos</a>, “I want to be a mathematician”)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you learn mathematics, whether in books or in lectures, you generally only see the end product – very polished, clever and elegant presentations of a mathematical topic.</p>
<p>However, the process of discovering <em>new</em> mathematics is much messier, full of the pursuit of directions which were naïve, fruitless or uninteresting.</p>
<p>While it is tempting to just ignore all these “failed” lines of inquiry, actually they turn out to be essential to one’s deeper understanding of a topic, and (via the process of elimination) finally zeroing in on the correct way to proceed.</p>
<p>So one should be unafraid to ask “stupid” questions, challenging conventional wisdom on a subject; the answers to these questions will occasionally lead to a surprising conclusion, but more often will simply tell you why the conventional wisdom is there in the first place, which is well worth knowing.</p>
<p>For instance, given a standard lemma in a subject, you can ask what happens if you delete a hypothesis, or attempt to strengthen the conclusion; if a simple result is usually proven by method X, you can ask whether it can be proven by method Y instead; the new proof may be less elegant than the original, or may not work at all, but in either case it tends to illuminate the relative power of methods X and Y, which can be useful when the time comes to prove less standard lemmas.</p>
<p>It’s also acceptable, when listening to a seminar, to ask “dumb” but constructive questions to help clarify some basic issue in the talk (e.g. whether statement X implied statement Y in the argument, or vice versa; whether a terminology introduced by the speaker is related to a very similar sounding terminology that you already knew about; and so forth). If you don’t ask, you might be lost for the remainder of the talk; and usually speakers appreciate the feedback (it shows that at least one audience member is paying attention!) and the opportunity to explain things better, both to you and to the rest of the audience. However, questions which do not immediately enhance the flow of the talk are probably best left to after the end of the talk.</p>

<p dir="auto">RCFG is a method for approximately realizing CFG with competitive computational complexity compared to cases where CFG is not used. It can be specified through the cfg_type argument in the StreamDiffusion. There are two types of RCFG: one with no specified items for negative prompts RCFG Self-Negative and one where negative prompts can be specified RCFG Onetime-Negative. In terms of computational complexity, denoting the complexity without CFG as N and the complexity with a regular CFG as 2N, RCFG Self-Negative can be computed in N steps, while RCFG Onetime-Negative can be computed in N+1 steps.</p>
<p dir="auto">The usage is as follows:</p>

<p><b>Crown shyness</b> (also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-JWG_2008_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-JWG_2008-1">[1]</a></sup> <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> or <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup id="cite_ref-FEP_1984_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-FEP_1984-3">[3]</a></sup>) is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_(botany)" title="Crown (botany)">crowns</a> of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, instead forming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canopy_(biology)" title="Canopy (biology)">canopy</a> with channel-like gaps.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sup id="cite_ref-AJR_1988_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-AJR_1988-6">[6]</a></sup> It has been discussed in scientific literature since the 1920s.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The variety of hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution" title="Convergent evolution">convergent evolution</a>.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (February 2023)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind" title="Wind">winds</a>. The abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup> This  explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sup id="cite_ref-AJR_1988_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-AJR_1988-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-ROL_1980_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-ROL_1980-12">[12]</a></sup> According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
</p><p>Similarly, some research suggests that constant abrasion at growth nodules disrupts bud tissue such that it is unable to continue with lateral growth. Australian forester M.R. Jacobs, who studied the crown shyness patterns in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus" title="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> in 1955, believed that the trees' growing tips were sensitive to abrasion, resulting in canopy gaps.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> Miguel Franco (1986) observed that the branches of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picea_sitchensis" title="Picea sitchensis">Picea sitchensis</a></i> (Sitka spruce) and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larix_kaempferi" title="Larix kaempferi">Larix kaempferi</a></i> (Japanese larch) suffered physical damage due to abrasion, which killed the leading shoots.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>A prominent hypothesis is that canopy shyness has to do with mutual light sensing by adjacent plants. The photoreceptor-mediated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shade_avoidance" title="Shade avoidance">shade avoidance</a> response is a well-documented behavior in a variety of plant species.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup> Neighbor detection is thought to be a function of several unique photoreceptors. Plants can sense the proximity of neighbors by sensing backscattered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far-red" title="Far-red">far-red</a> light, a task widely thought to be accomplished by the activity of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytochrome" title="Phytochrome">phytochrome</a> photoreceptors.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17">[17]</a></sup> Many species of plant respond to an increase in far-red light (and, by extension, encroaching neighbors) by directing growth away from the far-red stimulus and by increasing the rate of elongation.<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> Similarly, plants use blue light to induce the shade-avoidance response, likely playing a role in the recognition of neighboring plants,<sup id="cite_ref-19"><a href="#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup> though this was just starting to be recognised in 1988.<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>The characterization of these behaviors might suggest that crown shyness is simply the result of mutual shading based on well-understood shade avoidance responses.<sup id="cite_ref-AJR_1988_6-3"><a href="#cite_note-AJR_1988-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F.S.P._Ng_1997_34–37_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-F.S.P._Ng_1997_34–37-21">[21]</a></sup> Malaysian scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_S.P._Ng" title="Francis S.P. Ng">Francis S.P. Ng</a>, who studied <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dryobalanops_aromatica" title="Dryobalanops aromatica">Dryobalanops aromatica</a></i>, suggested that the growing tips were sensitive to light levels and stopped growing when nearing the adjacent foliage due to the induced shade.<sup id="cite_ref-AJR_1988_6-4"><a href="#cite_note-AJR_1988-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F.S.P._Ng_1997_34–37_21-1"><a href="#cite_note-F.S.P._Ng_1997_34–37-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>A 2015 study has suggested that <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabidopsis_thaliana" title="Arabidopsis thaliana">Arabidopsis thaliana</a></i> shows different leaf placement strategies when grown amongst kin and unrelated conspecifics, shading dissimilar neighbors and avoiding kin. This response was shown to be contingent on the proper functioning of multiple photosensory modalities.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup> A 1998 study proposed similar systems of photoreceptor-mediated inhibition of growth as explanations of crown shyness,<sup id="cite_ref-AJR_1988_6-5"><a href="#cite_note-AJR_1988-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-F.S.P._Ng_1997_34–37_21-2"><a href="#cite_note-F.S.P._Ng_1997_34–37-21">[21]</a></sup> though a causal link between photoreceptors and crown asymmetry had yet to be experimentally proven. This might explain instances of intercrown spacing that are only exhibited between conspecifics.<sup id="cite_ref-AJR_1988_6-6"><a href="#cite_note-AJR_1988-6">[6]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-KP_1973_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-KP_1973-7">[7]</a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New York will create a database that will identify the names of owners of many limited liability companies within the state for the first time. But the public won’t be able to access it, thanks to a legislative amendment secured by Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office.</p><p>The Democratic governor <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/wrongful-deaths-frankensteining-and-more-heres-whats-on-ny-gov-hochuls-desk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">signed 42 bills late Friday and vetoed another 43</a>, part of an end-of-year push to clear her desk of legislation approved by state lawmakers earlier this year.</p><p>Among the bills she signed was <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/llcs-might-soon-have-to-list-their-owners-should-new-yorkers-get-a-look" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the LLC Transparency Act</a>, a measure that will force limited liability companies to list their “beneficial owners” when they create a new company or change the structure of a current one. The bill’s sponsors pushed the measure as a way for New York residents to, for example, find out who their true landlord is if their building is owned by an otherwise nameless LLC.</p><p>But Hochul negotiated an amendment to the bill that will keep that database from the public. Instead, she said, that information will only be maintained for law-enforcement purposes, such as if a district attorney needs to access it for an investigation.</p><p>“The bill as drafted was overly broad, and required changes to ensure it serves the core purpose of exposing unlawful activity while balancing personal privacy,” Hochul wrote in a memo.</p><p>Among the other bills Hochul acted on late Friday:</p><ul><li>Hochul vetoed a <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/future-of-noncompete-agreements-in-ny-in-gov-hochuls-hands" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bill that would have effectively banned noncompete agreements</a>, which employers use to prevent their employees from going to work for a competitor for a period of time after their employment.</li><li>She also vetoed a bill that would have required New York City to install recycling bins at every park, playground and historical site in the five boroughs, arguing it would have placed an unfunded mandate on the city.</li><li>She approved a bill that will move many county- and town-level elections to even-numbered years, much to the chagrin of Republicans.</li></ul><p>Major business interests, including Wall Street firms and the state Business Council, lobbied Hochul to reject the ban on noncompete clauses, arguing they are necessary to protect trade secrets and retain talent. They argued companies would move jobs out of state if New York were to enact the ban.</p><p>Hochul had previously floated a compromise that would allow the ban only to apply to those with salaries under $250,000. But in a statement, bill sponsor Sen. Sean Ryan of Buffalo said Hochul rejected the Legislature’s final offer, which he says would have ceded to the $250,000 cap but indexed it to inflation and exempted all medical workers.</p><p>In her veto message, Hochul said she was trying to find a compromise that protected middle-class and lower-wage workers while allowing businesses “to retain highly compensated talent.” She said she’s “open to future legislation that achieves that right balance.”</p><p>The bill Hochul signed <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-moving-some-ny-elections-to-even-years-could-nyc-be-next" rel="noopener" target="_blank">moving many town- and county-level elections to even years</a> will be phased in over the coming years, eventually aligning them with federal elections in a move supporters say is designed to boost voter turnout.</p><p>Republicans deeply opposed the measure, accusing Democrats of orchestrating the change to benefit from New York’s traditionally heavy Democratic turnout in presidential election years.</p><p>Stephen Acquario, executive director of the state Association of Counties, an organization that lobbies for county governments, criticized Hochul for signing the bill into law.</p><p>“At a time when we should be keeping the divisiveness at the federal and state levels out of our local communities, this bill does the opposite, burying the local issues that impact New Yorkers’ daily lives at the back of exceedingly long ballots,” he said in a statement.</p><p>In a statement Friday afternoon, Hochul said the measure is “about expanding to the ballot box and promoting a more inclusive democracy.”</p><p>While the measure would not apply to New York City (or other city) elections or positions like district attorney —&nbsp;which <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/lawmakers-moving-some-ny-elections-to-even-years-could-nyc-be-next" rel="noopener" target="_blank">are set by the state constitution</a> — Hochul said she would support a constitutional amendment to adjust the election calendar to “to save taxpayer dollars and avoid voter fatigue.” But such a move would be several years away; changing the constitution is a multi-year process, and then any change would have to be gradually phased in after that.</p><p>The governor’s action on the batch of bills leaves just five pieces of legislation to approve or reject by the end of the calendar year.</p><p>That includes a measure known as the Grieving Families Act, which, if signed, would make it easier for family members to seek civil damages for their grief and anguish in wrongful death cases.</p><p>Another pending bill would make changes to the state’s nascent public-campaign-finance system, which good-government advocates oppose.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>We demonstrate a high-performance vendor-agnostic method for massively parallel solving of ensembles of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on GPUs. The method is integrated with a widely used differential equation solver library in a high-level language (Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl) and enables GPU acceleration without requiring code changes by the user. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to hand-optimized CUDA-C++ kernels while performing 20--100$\times$ faster than the vectorizing map (vmap) approach implemented in JAX and PyTorch. Performance evaluation on NVIDIA, AMD, Intel, and Apple GPUs demonstrates performance portability and vendor-agnosticism. We show composability with MPI to enable distributed multi-GPU workflows. The implemented solvers are fully featured -- supporting event handling, automatic differentiation, and incorporation of datasets via the GPU's texture memory -- allowing scientists to take advantage of GPU acceleration on all major current architectures without changing their model code and without loss of performance. We distribute the software as an open-source library <a href="https://github.com/SciML/DiffEqGPU.jl" rel="external noopener nofollow">this https URL</a>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GM has issued a stop-sale order for the Chevy Blazer EV just weeks after its release following reports of software problems that made the vehicle undrivable. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Edmunds;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?merchantId=6a686c6e-b7e2-4710-a51c-d3aa72b17ad0&amp;siteId=us-engadget&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Edmunds&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5lZG11bmRzLmNvbS9jYXItbmV3cy9jaGV2eS1ibGF6ZXItZXYtc3RvcC1zYWxlLmh0bWwiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6IjI3YjNjMTg5LWI2MTItNGRmMC05YzUyLTcwYmNlMTg0YTBiNyJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAZVMfuAojMqpxX1HwJGLL7rh7n4GQAzuXy2vumXTf_dR&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Fchevy-blazer-ev-stop-sale.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Edmunds;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Edmunds;elmt:;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0"><em><ins>Edmunds</ins></em></a>, which received confirmation on Friday night that the company is halting deliveries, previously documented 23 issues during tests of the SUV, including the infotainment system repeatedly crashing and displaying a multitude of error messages. <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://insideevs.com/reviews/701169/2024-blazer-ev-stranded-broken/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inside EVs;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0"><em><ins>Inside EVs</ins></em></a> writer Kevin Williams also tested the Blazer EV and not only encountered similar problems with the display, but was left stranded after the car broke down while charging.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Edmunds</em>, Chevrolet said, “We are aware that a limited number of Blazer EV owners have experienced some software quality issues. To ensure our customers have a great experience with their vehicle, we are temporarily pausing sales of Blazer EVs.” All new deliveries are on pause, VP Scott Bell said.</p><p>The Chevrolet Blazer EV is powered by GM’s Ultium battery system, which is being used in a slew of other vehicles including the GMC Hummer EV and the Cadillac Lyriq. Those, too, have been the subject of plenty of complaints, as <a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://insideevs.com/news/702126/ultium-platform-owners-gm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Inside EVs;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0"><em><ins>Inside EVs</ins></em></a> reported.
