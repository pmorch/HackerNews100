<p>
Version 0.2.0 of the Chawan TUI browser has been released.
</p><p>
A tarball of the source tree is available
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-src.tar.xz">here</a>.  Please refer to the README
file for compilation instructions.
</p><p>
A static binary distribution for
<a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-linux-amd64.tar.xz">amd64 Linux</a> also exists.
To install it, extract the archive somewhere and run <code>make install</code>
as root.  (To uninstall, run <code>make uninstall</code>.)
</p><p>
The same distribution is also available as a <a href="https://chawan.net/dl/chawan-0-2-0-amd64.deb">.deb
package</a>.
</p><h2 id="information-for-package-maintainers"><a href="#information-for-package-maintainers">##</a> Information for package maintainers</h2>
<p>
The current list of mandatory runtime dependencies is:
</p><ul>
<li>libssh2.
</li><li>libbrotli (more precisely, libbrotlicommon and libbrotlidec).
</li><li>OpenSSL or LibreSSL.  For OpenSSL, you will want 3.0 or later.
For LibreSSL, the version in OpenBSD 7.7 has been tested.
</li></ul>
<p>
Previous development versions had other dependencies which no
longer apply, and can be dropped.  In particular, zlib, libseccomp,
termcap/ncurses and libcurl are no longer used.
</p><p>
If you run into an issue while packaging Chawan, please contact me
before trying to patch over it.  Chances are we can solve it upstream.
</p><h2 id="whats-next"><a href="#whats-next">##</a> What's next</h2>
<p>
It took a bit longer than expected, but I finally feel OK putting a
version on this.  It has all features I wanted from an MVP, and no known
fatal bugs.
</p><p>
The v0.2 branch in git will only receive bugfixes.  Further work on new
features will continue on the master branch.
</p><p>
For the next release, I hope to improve upon the layout module's
performance &amp; correctness, and to make the UI somewhat more user
friendly.  Stay tuned :)

These discussions, which can last for months, aim to improve a study’s clarity and the robustness of its conclusions. It is a hugely important process that should receive increased recognition, including acknowledgement of the reviewers involved, if they choose to be named. For early-career researchers, there is great value in seeing inside a process that is key to their career development. Making peer-reviewer reports public also enriches science communication: it’s a chance to add to the ‘story’ of how a result is arrived at, or a conclusion supported, even if it includes only the perspectives of authors and reviewers. The full story of a paper is, of course, more complex, involving many other contributors.</p><p>Many people think of science as something fixed and unchanging. But scientific knowledge evolves as new or more-nuanced evidence comes to light. Scientists constantly discuss their results, yet these debates are not contained in research papers and often remain unreported in wider science-communication efforts.</p><article data-label="Related"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01162-1" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"><img alt="" src="https://media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01880-9/d41586-025-01880-9_17620936.jpg"><p>Three-year trial shows support for recognizing peer reviewers</p></a></article><p>The COVID-19 pandemic provided a brief interlude during which much of the world got to see how research works, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01444-z" data-track-category="body text link">almost in real time</a>. It’s easy to forget that, right from the start, we were continuously learning something new about the nature and behaviour of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. On television screens, in newspapers and on social media worldwide, scientists were discussing among themselves and with public audiences the nature of the virus, how it infects people and how it spreads. They were debating treatments and prevention methods, constantly adjusting everyone’s knowledge <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01173-7" data-track-category="body text link">as fresh evidence came to light</a>. And then, it went mostly back to business as usual.</p><p>We hope that publishing the peer-reviewer reports of all newly submitted <i>Nature</i> papers shows, in a small way, that this doesn’t need to remain the case. <i>Nature</i> started mandating peer review for all published research articles only in 1973 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track="click" data-label="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2015.0029" data-track-category="body text link">M.

That has meant that the wider research community, and the world, has had few opportunities to learn what is discussed.</p><p>Peer review improves papers. The exchanges between authors and referees should be seen as a crucial part of the scientific record, just as they are a key part of doing and disseminating research.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<article>
   

  <div><p>Picture this, you’re a teenager in the middle of the ocean on a cruise ship. All is good, except you’re lacking your lifeblood: internet. You could pay $170 for seven days of throttled internet on a <em>single</em> device, and perhaps split it via a travel router or hotspot, but that still seems less than ideal.</p>
<p>I’ve been travelling Europe with family and am currently on REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises’ REDACTEDCRUISELINE cruise ship. For the past two days, the ship has mostly been in port, so I was able to use a cellular connection. This quickly became not feasible as we got further from land, where there was no coverage. At around the same time, I wanted to download the REDACTEDCRUISELINE Cruises app on my phone, and realized that it would give me a <em>one-time 15-minute</em> internet connection. I activated it, and quickly realized that it didn’t limit you to just the Play Store or App Store: all websites could be accessed. I soon realized that this “one-time” download was MAC-address dependent and thus, could be bypassed by switching MAC addresses. However, doing so logs you out of the REDACTEDSERVICE portal, which is required to get the 15-minutes of free internet.</p>
<p>This means that in order to get just 15 minutes of internet, the following is required:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change MAC address</li>
<li>Login to REDACTEDSERVICE with date-of-birth and room number, binding the MAC address to your identity</li>
<li>Send a request with your booking ID activating 15 minutes of free internet, intended to be used for downloading the REDACTEDCRUISELINE app
<ul>
<li>Not completely sure, but it did initially seem that to activate unrestricted access to the internet, you would need to send a simple HTTP to play.google.com, although I don’t think this is needed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process, on the surface, seems extremely arduous. But if this could be automated, it would suddenly become a much more viable proposition. After looking at the fetch requests the REDACTEDSERVICE portal was sending to log in and activate the free sessions, I realized that it shouldn’t be <em>too</em> hard to automate.</p>
<p>Conveniently, my family also brought a travel router running OpenWRT as we were planning on purchasing the throttled single-device plan (which is ~$170 for the entire cruise) and using the router as a hotspot so we could connect multiple devices to the internet. This router (a GL.iNet) allows you to change the MAC address via the admin portal, needing only a single POST request. This meant that if I could string together the API requests to change the MAC address (after getting a token from the router login endpoint), login to REDACTEDSERVICE, and request the free internet session, I would have free internet.</p>
<p>I first tried copying the requests as cURL commands via DevTools into Notepad and using a local LLM to vibe-code a simple bash file. Realizing this wasn’t going to work, I began work on a Python script instead. I converted the cURL commands to <code>requests</code> via Copilot (yes, I used LLMs to an extent when building this) and started chaining together the requests.</p>
<p>The only issues I faced that took some time to overcome were figuring out how to repeat the requests when needed and being resistant to unexpected HTTP errors. For the former, I initially tried repeating it on an interval (first through a <code>while True</code> loop and later via shell scripting in the container) but later realized it was much easier by checking if internet access expired by sending a request to example.com and checking if it fails. For the latter, I used <code>while True</code> loops to allow the requests to be retried and executed <code>break</code> when the requests succeeded. The only other issue, that still exists, is that occasionally, the connection will drop out while the session is refreshed, although this seems to happen less than every 15 minutes and only lasts for a minute or two.</p>
<p>After comparing speeds with another guy I met on the cruise (who also happens to be a high-school programmer), who had the highest-level REDACTEDSERVICE plan, there seems to be no additional throttling (7+ Mbps). Even better, after connecting my power bank’s integrated USB-C cable to the router, I’m able to move around the ship for hours. So far, I’ve been using the router for nearly ~7 hours and my 10,000 mAh power bank is still at 42% battery. In fact, I’m writing this very post while connected to the router.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>As part of <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/goodbye-dark-inc-welcome-darklang-inc/" rel="noreferrer"><u>shutting down Dark Inc.</u></a> and <a href="https://blog.darklang.com/first-steps-of-darklang-inc/" rel="noreferrer"><u>forming Darklang Inc.</u>,</a> we've finally open-sourced all of our repositories. <a href="https://github.com/darklang?ref=blog.darklang.com"><u>Our source code</u></a> is now under the Apache License 2.0.</p><p>For years, we wrestled with questions of sustainability and how to build something that truly empowers developers. We've long believed in open source philosophically, but felt that Darklang's unique architecture and business model required a different approach.</p><h2 id="why-we-initially-chose-source-available"><strong>Why We Initially Chose Source-Available</strong></h2><p>We originally designed Darklang as a hosted-only platform where you'd code at darklang.com and programs would instantly be live in production. We believed this centralized approach was necessary for features like safe code migration and unified deployment, and that offering self-hosting would undermine our sustainability model.</p><p>The core challenge was building something valuable while ensuring we could continue working on it long-term. Traditional open source funding models all had limitations, so Darklang was designed as "a language with a business model" - users with serious workloads would fund ecosystem development through our hosting platform.</p><h2 id="what-changed-our-thinking"><strong>What Changed Our Thinking</strong></h2><p>Three key shifts changed our perspective:</p><p><strong>Product maturity and user feedback</strong>: The real barrier to Darklang's adoption was never licensing - it was product maturity. As we've gotten closer to building something people love, staying source-available started feeling like an unnecessary risk.

</div>
<p>In 1825, Michael Faraday discovered one of the most fascinating compounds in chemistry: <a title="Benzene" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005709.article">benzene</a>.&nbsp;While isolating the components of oily residues of illuminating gas, Faraday identified a mysterious liquid, with a peculiar aromatic smell, which would go on to transform the landscape of chemistry.</p>
<p>Within the pages of the <em>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London</em>, Faraday <a title="On new compounds of carbon and hydrogen, and on certain other products obtained during the decomposition of oil by heat" href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rstl.1825.0022">described</a> this seemingly simple yet profoundly unique molecule. What set benzene apart, even in its earliest discovery, was its resistance to easy chemical classification. Its peculiar behaviour, such as its surprising stability despite being highly unsaturated, hinted at a deeper mystery that would not be fully resolved until the mid-19th century with the proposal of its cyclic structure.</p>
<p>Benzene’s physical properties only added to its mystique. This colourless liquid emitted a faintly sweet, intoxicating aroma – a hallmark of aromatic compounds. With a boiling point of 80.1°C, it was volatile and highly flammable, making it both a chemical curiosity and a potential industrial tool. Early chemists were captivated by its ability to dissolve fats, oils and other nonpolar substances, which made it a valuable solvent for experimentation and industrial processes. Yet, it was benzene’s chemical properties – its reactivity and stability – that would become the cornerstone of an entire branch of organic chemistry: aromatic compounds.</p>
<p>Today, benzene is everywhere, interwoven into the structures of more complex molecules that enhance our daily lives in fields as diverse as health, energy, advanced materials, electronics, food, dyes and biotechnology. This humble molecule opened the doors to a vast universe of aromatic compounds and an endless array of applications that have redefined our world.</p>
<h3 id="Stability_and_tunability">Stability and tunability</h3>
<p>Following benzene’s legacy came polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), a fascinating class of organic molecules composed of fused benzene rings. These structures not only preserve benzene’s aromatic stability, thanks to their electron delocalisation, but also exhibit unique electronic and optical properties determined by their size and arrangement. While smaller PAHs, like <a title="Naphthalene" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/7362.article">naphthalene</a> and anthracene, had been characterised in the 19th century, the discovery of larger, more complex systems unveiled entirely new and surprising properties – from discrete energy levels in simpler molecules to semiconducting behaviours in larger systems like pentacene.</p>
<p>The synthesis and study of these compounds paved the way for nanographenes, opening new dimensions in chemistry and materials science. Through meticulous control over their molecular structures, researchers have learned to design advanced materials with tunable properties, such as electron conductivity, fluorescence, chirality and chemical reactivity. This painstaking precision highlights the intrinsic beauty of chemistry at its most fundamental level, an art of exactitude that continues to push the boundaries of possibility.</p>
<p>A landmark achievement in this journey was the discovery of hexabenzocoronene (HBC), in 1958. This molecule, composed of 42 carbon atoms forming 13 hexagonal rings in a perfectly flat structure, remained the largest fully characterised polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon for decades. Yet the creativity of organic chemistry knows no bounds. Klaus Müllen, a pioneer in the exploration of nanographenes, succeeded in 2002 in synthesising a remarkable structure formed by 222 carbon atoms with a diameter of 3nm, demonstrating the immense potential of organic synthesis to construct tailor-made graphene molecules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Graphene stands out as the ultimate expression of benzene’s versatility</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fusion of benzene rings has given rise to some of the most remarkable materials in modern science, including fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. Fullerenes, often referred to as <a title="Buckminsterfullerene" href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/3005718.article">buckyballs</a>, are spherical molecules composed entirely of carbon atoms arranged in a pattern of hexagons and pentagons, resembling a molecular soccer ball. These structures, discovered in 1985, owe their stability and symmetry to the aromaticity derived from benzene-like rings. Similarly, carbon nanotubes – long, cylindrical structures composed of fused aromatic rings – have captivated scientists with their extraordinary strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity. Both fullerenes and nanotubes exemplify the limitless potential of carbon chemistry, with benzene as the foundational building block.</p>
<p>Among these innovations, graphene stands out as the ultimate expression of benzene’s versatility. This two-dimensional material, consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, is essentially a sheet of fused benzene rings. Graphene’s remarkable properties – its transparency, strength, flexibility and electrical conductivity – have earned it the title of a ‘gift of gods’. Graphene, like benzene before it, has the power to revolutionise multiple fields, from electronics and energy storage to medicine and materials science.</p>
<p>Beyond its scientific impact, benzene holds a special place in education. Generations of high school and university students have been introduced to the elegance of its structure and the profound mystery surrounding its stability. The study of benzene serves as an accessible entry point for understanding broader concepts like aromaticity, resonance and molecular orbitals. By celebrating the bicentennial of its discovery, we honour not only the legacy of Faraday but also the enduring role of benzene in inspiring curiosity, innovation and the next generation of chemists.</p>
<div>
<p>To celebrate the 200th anniversary of benzene’s discovery and its extraordinary legacy, the Royal Society of Chemistry will release a thematic special issue, uniting several RSC journals in a collaborative tribute to benzene’s unparalleled influence.</p>
<p>This special issue, edited by Ben Feringa and Nazario Martín, will illuminate the enduring relevance of benzene by exploring its far-reaching legacy in carbon-based systems, from the fundamental concepts of aromaticity and antiaromaticity to groundbreaking research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), molecular nanographenes (via both top-down and bottom-up approaches), graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. It will also delve into cutting-edge developments from (anti)aromatic compounds synthesised through on-surface methodologies to benzene-based molecular machines.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44289554">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A new benchmark developed by academics shows that LLM-based AI agents perform below par on standard CRM tests and fail to understand the need for customer confidentiality.</p>
<p>A team led by Kung-Hsiang Huang, a Salesforce AI researcher, showed that using a new benchmark relying on synthetic data, LLM agents achieve around a 58 percent success rate on tasks that can be completed in a single step without needing follow-up actions or more information.</p>
<p>Using the benchmark tool CRMArena-Pro, the team also showed performance of LLM agents drops to 35 percent when a task requires multiple steps.</p>

    

<p>Another cause for concern is highlighted in the LLM agents' handling of confidential information. "Agents demonstrate low confidentiality awareness, which, while improvable through targeted prompting, often negatively impacts task performance," a <a target="_blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18878">paper published at the end of last month said</a>.</p>

        


        

<p>The Salesforce AI Research team argued that existing benchmarks failed to rigorously measure the capabilities or limitations of AI agents, and largely ignored an assessment of their ability to recognize sensitive information and adhere to appropriate data handling protocols.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/bt_chief_says_ai_could_cut_more_staff/">BT chief says AI could deliver more job cuts, hints at Openreach sell-off</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/13/cloud_costs_ai_inferencing/">Enterprise AI adoption stalls as inferencing costs confound cloud customers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The research unit's CRMArena-Pro tool is fed a data pipeline of realistic synthetic data to populate a Salesforce organization, which serves as the sandbox environment. The agent takes user queries and decides between an API call or a response to the users to get more clarification or provide answers.</p>
<p>"These findings suggest a significant gap between current LLM capabilities and the multifaceted demands of real-world enterprise scenarios," the paper said.</p>
<p>The findings might worry both developers and users of LLM-powered AI agents. Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff told investors last year that AI agents represented "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/29/salesforce_pricing_per_ai_conversation/">a very high margin opportunity</a>" for the SaaS CRM vendor as it takes a share in efficiency savings accrued by customers using AI agents to help get more work out of each employee.</p>

        

<p>Elsewhere, the UK government has said it would <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/12/nhs_tech_spending_review/">target savings of £13.8 billion ($18.7 billion) by 2029</a> with a digitization and efficiency drive that relies, in part, on the adoption of AI agents.</p>
<p>AI agents might well be useful, however, organizations should be wary of banking on any benefits before they are proven. ®</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm very excited to announce that I have recently joined Turso as a software engineer. For many in the field, including myself, getting to work on databases and solve unique challenges with such a talented team would be a dream job, but it is that much more special to me because of my unusual and unlikely circumstances. As difficult as it might be to believe, I am currently incarcerated and I landed this job from my cell in state prison. If you don’t know me, let me tell you more about how I got here.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-got-here"><a href="#how-i-got-here">#</a>How I got here</h2>
<p>Nearly two years have passed since I published <a href="https://pthorpe92.dev/intro/my-story">How I got here</a> to my blog. That post was my first real contact with the outside world in years, as I'd been off all social media and the internet since 2017. The response and support I would receive from the tech community caught me completely off guard.</p>
<p>A brief summary is that I'm currently serving prison time for poor decisions and lifestyle choices I made in my twenties, all related to drugs. Three years ago, I enrolled in a prison college program that came with the unique opportunity to access a computer with limited internet access. This immediately reignited a teenage love for programming and a lightbulb immediately lit up: that this would be my way out of the mess I had gotten myself into over the past 15 years. I quickly outgrew the curriculum, preferring instead to spend ~15+ hours a day on projects and open source contributions.</p>
<p>Through fortunate timing and lots of hard work, I was selected to be one of the first participants in the Maine Dept of Correction’s remote work program, where residents who meet certain requirements are allowed to seek out remote employment opportunities. I landed a software engineering job at a startup called <a href="https://unlockedlabs.org/">Unlocked Labs</a> building education solutions for incarcerated learners, while contributing to open source on the side. After just a year, I was leading their development team.</p>
<h3 id="finding-turso--hacking-on-project-limbo"><a href="#finding-turso--hacking-on-project-limbo">#</a>Finding Turso: hacking on project Limbo</h3>
<p>Last December I was between side-projects and browsing Hacker News when I discovered Project Limbo, an effort by Turso to rewrite SQLite from scratch. I'd never worked on relational databases, but some experience with a cache had recently sparked an interest in storage engines. Luckily for me I saw that the project was fairly young with plenty of low hanging fruit to cut my teeth on.</p>
<p>To put this entirely into perspective for some of you may be difficult, but in prison there isn’t exactly a whole lot to do and programming <em>absolutely</em> consumes my life. I either write code or manage Kubernetes clusters or other infrastructure for about 90 hours a week, and my only entertainment is a daily hour of tech/programming YouTube; mostly consisting of The Primeagen, whose story was a huge inspiration to me early on.</p>
<p>Through Prime, I had known about Turso since the beginning and had watched several interviews with Glauber and Pekka discussing their Linux kernel backgrounds and talking about the concept of distributed, multi-tenant SQLite. These were folks I'd looked up to for years and definitely could not have imagined that I would eventually be in any position to be contributing meaningfully to such an ambitious project of theirs. So needless to say, for those first PR's, just the thought of a kernel maintainer reviewing my code had made me quite nervous.</p>
<p>Helping build Limbo quickly became my new obsession. I split my time between my job and diving deep into SQLite source code, academic papers on database internals, and Andy Pavlo's CMU lectures. I was active on the <a href="https://discord.gg/turso">Turso Discord</a> but I don't think I considered whether anyone was aware that one of the top contributors was doing so from a prison cell. My story and information are linked on my GitHub, but it's subtle enough where you could miss it if you didn't read the whole profile. A couple months later, I got a Discord message from Glauber introducing himself and asking if we could meet.</p>
<p>In January, Glauber's <a href="https://x.com/glcst/status/1879553564177055855">tweet</a> about our interaction caught the attention of The Primeagen, and he ended up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPyKbPLGzFI">reading my blog post</a> on his stream, bringing a whole lot of new attention to it.</p>
<p>To this day I receive semi-regular emails either from developers, college kids or others who maybe have either gone through addiction or similar circumstances, or just want to reach out for advice on how to best start contributing to open source or optimize their learning path.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">#</a>What's Next</h3>
<p>I'm incredibly proud to be an example to others of how far hard work, determination and discipline will get you, and will be forever grateful for the opportunities given to me by the Maine Dept of Corrections to even be able to work hard in the first place, and to Unlocked Labs for giving me a chance and hiring me at a time when most assuredly no-one else would.</p>
<p>I'm also incredibly proud to announce that I am now working for Turso full time, something I would never have dreamed would be possible just a few years ago, I'm very excited to be a part of the team and to get to help build the modern evolution of SQLite.</p>
<p>Although some recent bad news from the court means that I won't be coming home as early as my family and I had hoped, my only choice is to view this as a blessing and for the next 10 months, will instead just be able to continue to dedicate time and focus to advancing my career at such a level that just wouldn't be possible otherwise.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to reach out over the past couple years, to my team at Unlocked Labs, and especially my parents. Thanks to Turso for the opportunity and to all the other companies with fair chance hiring policies who believe that people deserve a second chance. This journey has been totally surreal and every day I am still in awe of how far my life has come from the life I lived even just a few years ago.</p></div></div>]]></description>

        <p>Thanks to war, geopolitics, and climate change, Europe will have more
frequent and more severe <a href="https://nltimes.nl/2025/05/09/russia-preparing-war-europe-dutch-pm-activities-finnish-border">internet
disruptions</a>
in the very near future. Governments and businesses need to prepare
for catastrophic loss of communications. Unfortunately, the necessary
changes are risky and expensive, which means they won’t do it until a
<a href="https://layeraleph.com/">crisis</a> is already here. However, small
groups of volunteers with a little bit of time and money can provide
crucial initial leadership to bootstrap recovery.</p>
<p>An Internet Resiliency Club is a group of internet experts who can
communicate with each other across a few kilometers without any
centralized infrastructure using cheap, low-power, unlicensed
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> radios and open source
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> text messaging software. These
volunteer groups can use their radios, technical skills, and personal
connections with other experts to restore internet connectivity.</p>
<p>This page is a quick-start guide to forming your own Internet
Resiliency Club. You can also join a <a href="https://lists.bowshock.nl/mailman/listinfo/irc">mailing
list</a> for general
questions and discussion about internet resiliency clubs:</p>

<p>I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/valerieaurora/">Valerie Aurora</a>, a
systems software engineer with 25 years of experience in open source
software, operating systems, networking, file systems, and volunteer
organizing. When I moved from San Francisco to Amsterdam in 2023, I
started looking for ways to give back to my new home. In addition to
systems consulting, I am a special rapporteur for the EU’s Cyber
Resilience Act, serve as a RIPE Meeting program committee member, and
speak at European technical conferences.</p>
<h2 id="why-internet-resiliency-club">Why Internet Resiliency Club?</h2>
<p>One of my nightmares is waking up one morning and discovering that the
power is out, the internet is down, my cell phone doesn’t work, and
when I turn on the emergency radio (if you have one), all you hear is
“Swan Lake” on repeat.</p>
<p>As a recent immigrant to Amsterdam, I began to realize that this
nightmare was increasingly likely. Russia regularly knocks out
communications and power in Ukraine, using both bombs and hackers. In
2022, German windmills were disabled by malware aimed at Ukraine.
Dubious tankers continue to “accidentally” drag their anchors and cut
undersea cables in the Baltic. The head of NATO advised everyone to
keep three days of supplies at home.</p>
<h2 id="ukraines-advice-on-network-resilience">Ukraine’s advice on network resilience</h2>
<p>What made me finally take action is watching a video created by
<a href="https://1-ix.net/en/poslugy-en-translation/ua-exchange/">Ukrainian IXP
1-IX</a> to
teach other European countries what Ukrainian internet operators have
learned about hardening and repairing internet infrastructure leading
up to and following the 2022 Russian invasion. The practical realities
of keeping networks operating during war were sobering: building
camoflouged router rooms with 3 days of generator power, replacing
active fiber optic cable with passive, getting military service
exemptions for their personnel, etc.. You can watch the most recent
version, <a href="https://ripe90.ripe.net/archives/video/1582/">“Network Resilience: Experiences of survival and development
during the war in
Ukraine”</a>, a 30 minute
presentation at RIPE 90.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-dutch-government-doing-to-prepare">What is the Dutch government doing to prepare?</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the government of the Netherlands is not following
Ukraine’s lead. <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">Bert Hubert’s blog post</a>
describes the Netherlands’ cloud-based “emergency communications”
system, which will definitely not work in any emergency that affects
power or internet connectivity.</p>
<p>I have asked many Dutch network operators if there is any official
plan for the communications equivalent of a “black start” of the
electrical grid. If there is one, it isn’t being shared with the
people who will have to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="crisis-engineering-to-the-rescue">Crisis engineering to the rescue</h2>
<p>The final piece of the idea came from a class I took on <a href="https://layeraleph.com/event/">Crisis
Engineering</a> from Layer Aleph, on how
organizations facing an existential crisis either swiftly transform
themselves into a more functional form, or they fail and become even
more dysfunctional. Our class’s first question was, “How do you
convince an organization that a crisis is coming and they need to
prepare for it?”</p>
<p>Their answer was both depressing and freeing: “You can’t. All you can
do is be prepared with tools and a plan for when the crisis arrives.
That’s when the organization will listen.”</p>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-personally">What can I do personally?</h2>
<p>I started thinking about what I could personally do without any help
from government or businesses. What if I could organize a group of
volunteer networking experts who could communicate without any
centralized infrastructure? We could effectively bootstrap
communications recovery with just a few volunteers and some cheap
hardware.</p>
<h2 id="ham-radio-is-too-expensive-difficult-and-power-hungry">Ham radio is too expensive, difficult, and power-hungry</h2>
<p>Initially I looked into ham radio, but it is just too expensive,
difficult, and power-hungry to be practical. Then Alexander Yurtchenko
told me about LoRa (Long Range) radio and Meshtastic, a cheap,
low-power method of sending text messages across a few kilometers.</p>
<p>After a few months of part-time research and organizing, the Amsterdam
Internet Resiliency Club was born. This page exists to make it easier
for other people to start Internet Resiliency Clubs in their area.</p>
<h2 id="we-need-volunteer-internet-resiliency-organizations">We need volunteer internet resiliency organizations</h2>
<p>The evidence that Internet Resiliency Clubs are necessary keeps
growing. Since I started this project, the city of Amsterdam announced
that it is planning for three weeks without electricity. Spain and
Portugal lost power for most of a day. The U.S. re-elected Donald
Trump, who may at some point realize that he can hold Europe hostage
by threatening to cut off access to U.S.-owned internet services like
AWS and Microsoft Exchange. Simultaneously, large parts of Dutch
government are migrating to email hosted by Microsoft, and major Dutch
technology firms continue to migrate to AWS and Microsoft Azure.</p>
<p>If you and I don’t do this, dear reader, no one will.</p>
<h2 id="short-version">Short version</h2>
<p>How to form an Internet Resiliency Club:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collect a group of internet-y people within ~10 km of each other</li>
<li>Decide how to communicate normally (Signal, Matrix, email, etc.)</li>
<li>Buy everyone LoRa (Long Range) radios and a powerbank with trickle charge</li>
<li>Install Meshtastic on the LoRa radios</li>
<li>Choose a LoRa channel to communicate on</li>
<li>Organize meetups, send messages over Meshtastic, have fun</li>
</ul>
<p>If you work for a internet infrastructure company, you can suggest
giving interested employees a LoRa radio, a mobile phone powerbank,
and maybe even a small solar panel for their personal use (perhaps as
part of an annual gift or bonus).</p>
<h2 id="lora">LoRa</h2>
<p>LoRa radios have several advantages for use in emergency
communications:</p>
<ul>
<li>no centralized infrastructure needed</li>
<li>no license needed</li>
<li>cheap (starting at ~€20)</li>
<li>low-power (&lt; 1W, can power with an ordinary mobile phone powerbank)</li>
<li>runs open source Meshtastic firmware</li>
<li>can send text messages across several line-of-sight hops (several kms)</li>
<li>can connect via Bluetooth or WiFi to phones/computers</li>
<li>many urban areas have a good Meshtastic network already</li>
</ul>
<p>Amateur ham radio can transmit at higher bandwidth for longer
distances, but requires extensive training, licensing, larger
antennas, and more power. Ideally, both would be available in an
emergency.</p>
<h2 id="lorameshtastic-basics">LoRa/Meshtastic basics</h2>
<p>With a LoRa radio running the Meshtastic firmware, anyone can send
text messages to anyone else with a Meshtastic node as long as it
takes three or fewer forwards from other Meshtastic nodes to get from
source to destination (usually around ~10 km but highly dependent on
local terrain and weather).</p>
<p>Specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa">LoRa</a> is a
proprietary technique for sending low bit-rate radio messages (~1 - 25
kbps) using very low power (&lt; 1W), derived from chirp spread spectrum
techniques. <a href="https://meshtastic.org/">Meshtastic</a> is open source
firmware for LoRa radios that uses a flood-forward mesh protocol to
send message across up to three line-of-sight hops between LoRa nodes
running Meshtastic.</p>
<p>LoRa radios are for sale online. The cheapest versions are development
boards, intended for companies to use while building a product, often
without batteries, cases, or good antennas. To use them, you must
connect to them from a phone or computer, either over Bluetooth via
the Meshtastic app or over WiFi using a web browser. The more
expensive systems may include an enclosure, battery, solar panel,
larger screen, keyboard, etc. Some can be used without an additional
phone or computer.</p>
<h2 id="battery-power">Battery power</h2>
<p>LoRa radios use relatively little power, often in the range of 100 -
200 mA. A normal mobile phone power bank with a capacity of 10000 -
20000 mAh can power a LoRa radio approximately 2 - 8 days, depending
on chipset, time spent transmitting, whether WiFi or Bluetooth are in
use, etc. The powerbank should support “trickle charging”; without
this, many powerbanks will stop supplying power because the power draw
of many LoRa radios is so low that the powerbank thinks nothing is
connected and stops supplying power.</p>
<h2 id="solar-power">Solar power</h2>
<p>LoRa radios can be powered by directly plugging them into a small
solar panel with USB output, or by charging a battery used by the LoRa
radio. A small folding 800 cm^2 solar panel generating 15w with a
5W/500 mA max output is sufficient to power many LoRa radios. With
this small of a setup, you don’t need fuses, charge controllers,
buck/boost converters, or anything other than the solar panel and an
optional mobile phone power bank.</p>
<h2 id="which-lora-radio-to-buy">Which LoRa radio to buy</h2>
<p>LoRa radios are available in a huge range of capabilities and
features. For an Internet Resiliency Club, we recommend one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heltec V3: no case, no battery, WiFi/Bluetooth, OLED display, USB-C</li>
<li>LILYGO T-Echo: case, built-in battery, Bluetooth, e-ink display, USB-C</li>
</ul>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: Never turn on a LoRa device without an antenna attached!
The power sent to the antenna can destroy the device if there is no
antenna attached to radiate it.</em></p>
<p>Note: While many LoRa devices have USB-C ports, they often don’t
implement USB-C PD (Power Delivery) and won’t charge their battery
correctly on USB-C to USB-C cables. Use a USB-A to USB-C cable (often
supplied with the device).</p>
<h2 id="heltec-v3-series">Heltec V3 series</h2>
<p>If you have more time than money, try the latest Heltec V3, currently
one of the cheapest boards available at around €20. It has a
postage stamp-sized OLED screen, a couple of tiny buttons,
WiFi/Bluetooth, and USB-C input/power (but use a USB-A to USB-C
cable). Received messages are displayed on the OLED and can be cycled
through with tiny buttons. Sending messages requires connecting to it
via WiFi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>It has no case, but the little plastic box it comes in can easily be
turned into one with a sharp pen knife. It also has no battery, but it
is a good idea to have a separate power bank anyway since you need a
working phone or computer to send messages. It has no GPS.</p>

<h2 id="lilygo-t-echo">LILYGO T-Echo</h2>
<p>If you have more money than time, I recommend the LILYGO T-Echo, a
simple small low-power ready-to-use handheld device for about
€80. It has ~3cm square e-ink display, a case with a few buttons,
Bluetooth, GPS, and about a day’s worth of battery.
Input/output/charging is via USB-C (but use a USB-A to USB-C cable).
Received messages are displayed on the e-ink screen and can be cycled
through with the buttons. Sending messages requires connecting with
another device via Bluetooth.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/hardware/devices/lilygo/techo/">Meshtastic
page on this
board</a>
includes links to purchase from in Europe. I bought mine from
<a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/en/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/with-gps/lilygo-ttgo-t-echo-nrf52840-lora-868mhz-bme280-gnss-black">TinyTronics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lilygo-t-deck">LILYGO T-Deck</h2>
<p>If you want a standalone device that doesn’t require a separate phone
or computer to send messages, the <a href="https://www.tinytronics.nl/nl/development-boards/microcontroller-boards/met-lora/lilygo-t-deck-esp32-s3-toetsenbord-met-2.8-inch-ips-display-en-touchscreen-lora-868mhz-zwart">LILYGO
T-Deck</a>
includes a keyboard, trackball, and touch screen for about €70 -
80, depending on whether it includes a case and whether the antenna is
internal or external. It has about 8 hours of battery. I’m not a fan
because the screen and keyboard aren’t as good as the one on your
phone and take extra battery to run. It is often out of stock,
especially if you’re looking for a case and external antenna.</p>

board</a>

<h2 id="upgrading-the-antenna">Upgrading the antenna</h2>
<p>Most of the antennas that ship with evaluation boards are not very
good. One option for an upgrade if you’re using the recommended 868
MHz network is the <a href="https://eleshop.eu/868-mhz-antenne-met-sma-connector.html">Taoglas
TI.08.A</a>.</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: Never turn on a LoRa device without an antenna attached!
The power sent to the antenna can destroy the device if there is no
antenna attached to radiate it.</em></p>
<h2 id="flashing-installing-the-meshtastic-firmware">Flashing (installing) the Meshtastic firmware</h2>
<p>Some boards ship with Meshtastic already installed, but it’s
undoubtedly several months out of date. Flashing LoRa boards is
relatively easy; it can be as simple as using the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/getting-started/flashing-firmware/esp32/">Meshtastic web
browser
flasher</a>
(requires Chrome or Edge) or dragging and dropping a file into a
mounted USB drive presented by the device. A command line tool using a
serial interface is also an option, but may require some fiddling with
a Python env.</p>

<p>In Europe, two frequencies are available for use by LoRa: <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/region-by-country/">868 MHz and
433
MHz</a>.
868 MHz is the <a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/overview/radio-settings/">most popular for Meshtastic users in
Europe</a>. Several
modem presets are available; use the default mode <code>LONG_FAST</code> unless you
have a specific reason not to.</p>
<p>LoRa has
<a href="https://meshtastic.org/docs/configuration/radio/channels/">channels</a>,
a stream of messages using the same encryption key and channel name.
Each device is configured with a default primary channel shared by all
Meshtastic nodes. You can also configure secondary channels that can
only be accessed by nodes with the same key and channel name. Choose
an encryption key and channel name for a shared secondary channel. You
can share a QR code to configure a device with the appropriate
channels and settings.</p>
<h2 id="meetups-and-practice">Meetups and practice</h2>
<p>The best time to learn how to work together with a group of people is
before a crisis, not during it. Crisis engineering tells us that a
team is more likely to be successful if everyone has already worked
together.</p>
<p>Since this is a volunteer group, “working” together has to be fun.
Invite your group to do fun things together, changing up what activity
you are doing, where it is located, and what time it is held so that
a wide variety of people can participate.</p>

	<!-- HTML_TAG_START --><p>Nanonets-OCR-s is a powerful, state-of-the-art image-to-markdown OCR model that goes far beyond traditional text extraction. It transforms documents into structured markdown with intelligent content recognition and semantic tagging, making it ideal for downstream processing by Large Language Models (LLMs).</p>
<p>Nanonets-OCR-s is packed with features designed to handle complex documents with ease:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>LaTeX Equation Recognition:</strong> Automatically converts mathematical equations and formulas into properly formatted LaTeX syntax. It distinguishes between inline (<code>$...$</code>) and display (<code>$$...$$</code>) equations.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent Image Description:</strong> Describes images within documents using structured <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tags, making them digestible for LLM processing. It can describe various image types, including logos, charts, graphs and so on, detailing their content, style, and context.</li>
<li><strong>Signature Detection &amp; Isolation:</strong> Identifies and isolates signatures from other text, outputting them within a <code>&lt;signature&gt;</code> tag. This is crucial for processing legal and business documents.</li>
<li><strong>Watermark Extraction:</strong> Detects and extracts watermark text from documents, placing it within a <code>&lt;watermark&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Checkbox Handling:</strong> Converts form checkboxes and radio buttons into standardized Unicode symbols (<code>☐</code>, <code>☑</code>, <code>☒</code>) for consistent and reliable processing.</li>
<li><strong>Complex Table Extraction:</strong> Accurately extracts complex tables from documents and converts them into both markdown and HTML table formats.</li>

            <span>Abstract:</span>This study explores the neural and behavioral consequences of LLM-assisted essay writing. Participants were divided into three groups: LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only (no tools). Each completed three sessions under the same condition. In a fourth session, LLM users were reassigned to Brain-only group (LLM-to-Brain), and Brain-only users were reassigned to LLM condition (Brain-to-LLM). A total of 54 participants took part in Sessions 1-3, with 18 completing session 4. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cognitive load during essay writing, and analyzed essays using NLP, as well as scoring essays with the help from human teachers and an AI judge. Across groups, NERs, n-gram patterns, and topic ontology showed within-group homogeneity. EEG revealed significant differences in brain connectivity: Brain-only participants exhibited the strongest, most distributed networks; Search Engine users showed moderate engagement; and LLM users displayed the weakest connectivity. Cognitive activity scaled down in relation to external tool use. In session 4, LLM-to-Brain participants showed reduced alpha and beta connectivity, indicating under-engagement. Brain-to-LLM users exhibited higher memory recall and activation of occipito-parietal and prefrontal areas, similar to Search Engine users. Self-reported ownership of essays was the lowest in the LLM group and the highest in the Brain-only group. LLM users also struggled to accurately quote their own work. While LLMs offer immediate convenience, our findings highlight potential cognitive costs. Over four months, LLM users consistently underperformed at neural, linguistic, and behavioral levels. These results raise concerns about the long-term educational implications of LLM reliance and underscore the need for deeper inquiry into AI's role in learning.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Isaac Newton was never entirely happy with his law of universal gravitation. For decades after publishing it in 1687, he sought to understand how, exactly, two objects were able to pull on each other from afar. He and others came up with several mechanical models, in which gravity was not a pull, but a push. For example, space might be filled with unseen particles that bombard the objects on all sides. The object on the left absorbs the particles coming from the left, the one on the right absorbs those coming from the right, and the net effect is to push them together.</p>
<p>Those theories never quite worked, and Albert Einstein eventually provided a deeper explanation of gravity as a distortion of space and time. But Einstein’s account, called general relativity, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-thought-experiments-that-fray-the-fabric-of-space-time-20240925/">created its own puzzles</a>, and he himself recognized that it could not be the final word. So the idea that gravity is a collective effect — not a fundamental force, but the outcome of swarm behavior on a finer scale — still compels physicists.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a team of theoretical physicists <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17575">put forward</a> what might be considered a modern version of those 17th-century mechanical models. “There’s some kind of gas or some thermal system out there that we can’t see directly,” said <a href="https://qquest.lbl.gov/~carney/">Daniel Carney</a> of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who led the effort. “But it’s randomly interacting with masses in some way, such that on average you see all the normal gravity things that you know about: The Earth orbits the sun, and so forth.”</p>
<p>This project is one of the many ways that physicists have sought to understand gravity, and perhaps the bendy space-time continuum itself, as emergent from deeper, more microscopic physics. Carney’s line of thinking, known as entropic gravity, pegs that deeper physics as essentially just the physics of heat. It says gravity results from the same random jiggling and mixing up of particles — and the attendant rise of entropy, loosely defined as disorder — that governs steam boilers, car engines and refrigerators.</p>

<p>Attempts at modeling gravity as a consequence of rising entropy have cropped up now and again for several decades. Entropic gravity is very much a minority view. But it’s one that won’t die, and even detractors are loath to dismiss it altogether. The new model has the virtue of being experimentally testable — a rarity when it comes to theories about the mysterious underpinnings of the universal attraction.</p>
<h2><strong>A Force Emerges</strong></h2>
<p>What makes Einstein’s theory of gravity so remarkable is not just that it works (and does so with sublime mathematical beauty), but that it betrays its own incompleteness. General relativity predicts that stars can collapse to form black holes, and that, at the centers of these objects, gravity becomes infinitely strong. There, the space-time continuum tears open like an overloaded grocery bag, and the theory is unable to say what comes next. Furthermore, general relativity has uncanny parallels to heat physics, even though not a single thermal concept went into its development. It predicts that black holes only grow, never shrink, and only swallow, never disgorge. Such irreversibility is characteristic of the flow of heat. When heat flows, energy takes a more randomized or disordered form; once it does, it is unlikely to reorder itself spontaneously. Entropy quantifies this growth of disorder.</p>
<p>Indeed, when physicists used quantum mechanics to study what happens in the distorted space-time around a black hole, they find that black holes give off energy like any hot body. Because heat is the random motion of particles, these thermal effects suggest to many researchers that black holes, and the space-time continuum in general, actually consist of some kind of particles or other microscopic components.</p>

<p>Following the <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-1-clue-to-quantum-gravity-sits-on-the-surfaces-of-black-holes-20240925/">clues from black holes</a>, physicists have pursued multiple approaches to understanding how space-time emerges from more microscopic components. The leading approach takes off from what’s known as the holographic principle. It says the emergence of space-time works a bit like an ordinary hologram. Just as a hologram evokes a sense of depth from a wavy pattern etched onto a flat surface, patterns in the microscopic components of the universe may give rise to another spatial dimension. This new dimension is curved, so that gravity arises organically.</p>
<p>Entropic gravity, introduced in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004">a famous 1995 paper</a> by the theoretical physicist <a href="https://umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/current/item/246-jacobson.html">Ted Jacobson</a> of the University of Maryland, takes a related but distinct tack. Previously, physicists had started with Einstein’s theory and derived its heatlike consequences. But Jacobson went the other way. He started from the assumption that space-time has thermal properties and used these to derive the equations of general relativity. His work confirmed that there’s something significant about the parallels between gravity and heat.</p>
<p>“He turned black hole thermodynamics on its head,” Carney said. “I’ve been mystified by this result for my entire adult life.”</p>
<h2><strong>Apparent Attraction</strong></h2>
<p>How might gravitational attraction arise out of more microscopic components? Inspired by Jacobson’s approach, Carney and his co-authors — <a href="https://profiles.lbl.gov/474580-manthos-karydas">Manthos Karydas</a>, Thilo Scharnhorst, Roshni Singh and <a href="https://www.umdphysics.umd.edu/people/faculty/adjunct-faculty/item/529-jmtaylor.html">Jacob Taylor</a> — put forward two models.</p>
<p>In the first, space is filled with a crystalline grid of quantum particles, or qubits. Each has an orientation, like a compass needle. These qubits will align themselves with a nearby object that possesses mass and exert a force on that object. “If you put a mass somewhere in the lattice, it causes all of the qubits nearby to get polarized — they all try to go in the same direction,” Carney said.</p>

<p>By reorienting the nearby qubits, a massive object creates a pocket of high order in the grid of otherwise randomly oriented qubits. If you place two masses into the lattice, you create two such pockets of order. High order means low entropy. But the system’s natural tendency is to maximize entropy. So, as the masses realign the qubits and the qubits in turn buffet the masses, the net effect will be to squash the masses closer together to contain the orderliness to a smaller region. It will appear that the two masses are attracting each other gravitationally when in fact the qubits are doing all the work. And just as Newton’s law dictates, the apparent attraction diminishes with the square of the distance between the masses.</p>
<p>The second model does away with the grid. Massive objects still reside within space and are acted upon by qubits, but now those qubits do not occupy any particular location and could in fact be far away. Carney said this feature is intended to capture the nonlocality of Newtonian gravity: Every object in the universe acts on every other object to some degree.</p>
<p>Each qubit in the model is able to store some energy; the amount depends on the distance between the masses. When they are far apart, a qubit’s energy capacity is high, so the total energy of the system can fit in just a few qubits. But if the masses are closer together, the energy capacity of each qubit drops, so the total energy has to be spread over more qubits. The latter situation corresponds to a higher entropy, so the natural tendency of the system is to push the masses together, again in keeping with Newtonian gravity.</p>
<h2><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses</strong></h2>
<p>Carney cautioned that both models are ad hoc. There’s no independent evidence for these qubits, and he and his colleagues had to fine-tune the strength and direction of the force exerted by them. One might ask whether this is any improvement over taking gravity to be fundamental. “It actually seems to require a peculiar engineered-looking interaction to get this to work,” Carney said.</p>
<p>And what works is just Newton’s law of gravity, not the full apparatus of Einstein’s theory, where gravity is equivalent to the curvature of space-time. For Carney, the models are just a proof of principle — a demonstration that it is at least possible for swarm behavior to explain gravitational attraction — rather than a realistic model for how the universe works. “The ontology of all of this is nebulous,” he said.</p>
<p><a href="https://phas.ubc.ca/~mav/vanraamsdonk.html">Mark Van Raamsdonk</a>, a physicist at the University of British Columbia, is doubtful that the models really represent a proof of principle. A practitioner of holography, the leading approach to emergent space-time, Van Raamsdonk notes that the new entropic models don’t have any of the qualities that make gravity special, such as the fact that you feel no gravitational force when you’re freely falling through space-time. “Their construction doesn’t really have anything to do with gravity,” he said.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the models dwell on the one aspect of gravity that physicists think they already understand. Newton’s law arises naturally out of Einstein’s theory when gravity is comparatively feeble, as it is on Earth. It’s where gravity gets strong, as in black holes, that it gets weird, and the entropic model has nothing to say about that. “The real challenge in gravitational physics is understanding its strong-coupling, strong-field regime,” said <a href="https://sites.physics.bgu.ac.il/ramyb/">Ramy Brustein</a>, a theorist at Ben-Gurion University who said he used to be sympathetic to entropic gravity but has cooled on the idea.</p>
<p>Proponents of entropic gravity respond that physicists shouldn’t be so sure about how gravity behaves when it is weak. If gravity is indeed a collective effect of qubits, the Newtonian force law represents a statistical average, and the moment-by-moment effect will bounce around that average. “You have to go to very weak fields, because then these fluctuations might become observable,” said <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/v/e/e.p.verlinde/e.p.verlinde.html?cb">Erik Verlinde</a> of the University of Amsterdam, who argued for entropic gravity in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0785">much-discussed 2010 paper</a> and has continued to develop the idea.</p>
<h2><strong>Testing Entropic Gravity</strong></h2>
<p>Carney thinks the main benefit of the new models is that they prompt conceptual questions about gravity and open up new experimental directions.</p>
<p>Suppose a massive body is in a quantum combination, or “superposition,” of being in two different locations. Will its gravitational field likewise be in a superposition, pulling on falling bodies in two different directions? The new entropic-gravity models predict that the qubits will act on the massive body to snap it out of its Schrödinger’s cat–like predicament.</p>
        
        
<p>This scenario connects to the much-fretted-over question of wave function collapse — which asks how it is that measuring a quantum system in superposition causes its multiple possible states to become a single definite state. Some physicists have suggested that this collapse is caused by some intrinsic randomness in the universe. These proposals differ in detail from Carney’s but have similar testable consequences. They predict that an isolated quantum system will eventually collapse of its own accord, even if it’s never measured or otherwise affected from without. “The same experimental setups could, in principle, be used to test both,” said <a href="https://www.qmts.it/team/angelo-bassi/">Angelo Bassi</a> of the University of Trieste, who has led the effort to perform such experiments, already <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physics-experiments-spell-doom-for-quantum-collapse-theory-20221020/">ruling out some collapse models</a>.</p>
<p>For all his doubts, Van Raamsdonk agrees that the entropic-gravity approach is worth a try. “Since it hasn’t been established that actual gravity in our universe arises holographically, it’s certainly valuable to explore other mechanisms by which gravity might arise,” he said. And if this long-shot theory does work out, physicists will need to update the artist Gerry Mooney’s famous gravity poster, which reads: “Gravity. It isn’t just a good idea. It’s the law.” Perhaps gravity is not, in fact, a law, just a statistical tendency.</p>

<p>Previously I have covered a relatively obscure now-removed placeholder string in Android that doubles as an easter egg, the fictitious carrier by the name of <a href="https://voxelmanip.se/2024/10/14/el-telco-loco/">El Telco Loco</a>. But this time it is about methods and other parts of the publicly facing Android API that may generally be more humourous than they are useful. Easter eggs, jokes, whatever you want to call them, that are visible to Android app developers rather than regular users.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="activitymanagerisuseramonkey">ActivityManager.isUserAMonkey()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ActivityManager#isUserAMonkey()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>While it may initially look like a joke when it’s described as returning true if the UI is “currently being messed with by a monkey” without any further elaboration in the documentation, this is probably the one in the list with the most usefulness attached to it.</p>

<p>It is referring to the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/test/other-testing-tools/monkey">UI Exerciser Monkey</a>, which is a developer tool for Android that simulates random sequences of user input in order to stress-test apps. So this method will return a boolean of whether the Monkey is currently running or not.</p>

<p>The introduction of such a method to detect the usage of the Monkey appears to have an origin in something that happened during Android’s development, as per a quote from the book <em><a href="https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Chet_Haase_Androids">Androids: The Team that Built the Android Operating System</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day I walked into the monkey lab to hear a voice say, ‘911 -What’s your emergency?” That situation resulted in Dianne adding a new function to the API, <code>isUserAMonkey()</code> which is used to gate actions that monkeys shouldn’t take during tests (including dialing the phone and resetting the device).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, when feeding random and inherently unpredictable input into an app, you would want to have some way of locking away portions of an app that may have unintended real-world consequences such as calling emergency services. As such, <code>isUserAMonkey</code> was implemented and later made its way into the public API in Android 2.2 Froyo (API 8).</p>

<h2 id="usermanagerisuseragoat">UserManager.isUserAGoat()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html#isUserAGoat()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This one is more of a joke. The developer documentation says it is “used to determine whether the user making this call is subject to teleportations”, which in itself is likely a reference to a hidden column in the Chrome task manager that shows how many goats a browser process has teleported.</p>

<p>It was first introduced in Android 4.2 (API 17), and originally just returned false. However in Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) it was changed to “automatically identify goats using advanced goat recognition technology”. The game Goat Simulator had released earlier that year and was made available for Android in September during Lollipop’s development, so this method was changed to instead detect the presence of the Android version of Goat Simulator being installed on the device:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>isUserAGoat</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>mContext</span><span>.</span><span>getPackageManager</span><span>()</span>
		<span>.</span><span>isPackageAvailable</span><span>(</span><span>"com.coffeestainstudios.goatsimulator"</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Later in Android 11 (API 30), it was changed such that apps targetting API 30 and above will once again always return false when the method is called. According to the developer documentation this was made to “protect goat privacy”.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>mContext</span><span>.</span><span>getApplicationInfo</span><span>().</span><span>targetSdkVersion</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>Build</span><span>.</span><span>VERSION_CODES</span><span>.</span><span>R</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Android 11 is also the version where the <code>QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES</code> permission was introduced, meaning that apps targetting Android 11 would not be able to query for information of other apps through the <code>PackageManager</code> without this permission. So it makes sense to also wall off this method in order to not leak any information about other apps installed on an user’s device, even as a joke.</p>

<h2 id="usermanagerdisallow_fun">UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/UserManager.html#DISALLOW_FUN">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This constant refers to a device policy added in Android 6 Marshmallow (API 23) which restricts the user from having “fun”. The description given in the developer documentation is, ironically, amusing and reminds me of something GLaDOS would probably say:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Specifies if the user is not allowed to have fun. In some cases, the device owner may wish to prevent the user from experiencing amusement or joy while using the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is in fact a real device policy that a device owner may change to restrict what users of the device is able to do with it. And third-parties can then hook into this to disable features of their app that are deemed “too fun”. I don’t know if any third-party apps actually make use of it, but in the Android system it is used to disable the Android version easter egg that shows up when pressing the version label in the settings.</p>

<p>Considering that “fun” easter eggs like the Google Chrome “No internet” Dinosaur minigame end up being distractions that e.g. schools want to disable for enrolled devices (<a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41159706">see Chromium issue #41159706</a>), maybe the Android version easter egg could very much be a distraction depending on the version.</p>

<h2 id="chronometeristhefinalcountdown">Chronometer.isTheFinalCountdown()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Chronometer#isTheFinalCountDown()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>The <code>Chronometer</code> class had a new method by the name of <code>isTheFinalCountdown</code> added to it in Android 8 Oreo (API 26). When called, it will send an Intent to open the YouTube video for <em>The Final Countdown</em> by Europe.</p>

<p>No really. That’s what it does:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>getContext</span><span>().</span><span>startActivity</span><span>(</span>
		<span>new</span> <span>Intent</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>ACTION_VIEW</span><span>,</span> <span>Uri</span><span>.</span><span>parse</span><span>(</span><span>"https://youtu.be/9jK-NcRmVcw"</span><span>))</span>
			<span>.</span><span>addCategory</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>CATEGORY_BROWSABLE</span><span>)</span>
			<span>.</span><span>addFlags</span><span>(</span><span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_DOCUMENT</span>
				<span>|</span> <span>Intent</span><span>.</span><span>FLAG_ACTIVITY_LAUNCH_ADJACENT</span><span>));</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>true</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span><span>Exception</span> <span>e</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>false</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Marvelous.</p>

<h2 id="packagemanagerfeature_touchscreen_multitouch_jazzhand">PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/PackageManager.html#FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This constant was added in Android 2.3 Gingerbread (API 8) and is used to describe a device that supports tracking 5 simultaneous touch inputs, with the name being a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_hands">Jazz hands</a>.</p>

<h2 id="logwtf">Log.wtf()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/util/Log.html#wtf(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Throwable)">(reference)</a></p>

<p>According to the developer documentation, WTF stands for “What a Terrible Failure” (sure…), and is intended to log things that should <em>never</em> happen. It logs the message at the assertion level.</p>

<h2 id="adapterviewflipperfyiwillbeadvancedbyhostkthx">AdapterViewFlipper.fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/AdapterViewFlipper.html#fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()">(reference)</a></p>

<p>This is a method with an oddly humourous informal name, which was likely caused by some developer coming up blank on naming it and has now ended up in the public Android API, being added in Android 3.0 Honeycomb (API 11). It gets called by an <code>AppWidgetHost</code> when advancing the views inside of the <code>AdapterViewFlipper</code> object.</p>

<p>Indeed, naming things is one of the two hard problems in computer science, the other being off-by-one errors and cache invalidation.</p>

<h2 id="ibindertweet_transaction">IBinder.TWEET_TRANSACTION</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/IBinder.html#TWEET_TRANSACTION">(reference)</a></p>

<p>The Android Binder system is used for performing IPC and transactions are distinguished using different types, one of them being… <code>TWEET_TRANSACTION</code>. It was added in Android 3.2 Honeycomb (API 13) and claims to be used to send a tweet to a target object.</p>

<p>It does not actually do anything, let alone send a tweet. The document mentions that messages have a limit of 130 characters, referencing Twitter’s old message character limit.</p>

<h2 id="ibinderlike_transaction">IBinder.LIKE_TRANSACTION</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/IBinder.html#LIKE_TRANSACTION">(reference)</a></p>

<p>In a similar fashion, a new transaction type by the name of <code>LIKE_TRANSACTION</code> was added in Android 4.0.3 ICS (API 15). It’s used to tell an app that the caller likes it, there is no counter to keep track of the amount of likes but it is claimed that sending such transactions will improve the app’s self-esteem.</p>

<h2 id="sensormanagersensor_tricorder">SensorManager.SENSOR_TRICORDER</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#SENSOR_TRICORDER">(reference)</a></p>

<p>I do have to admit I didn’t know what a Tricorder is, but it appears to be a fictional device from Star Trek and the constant was “added” in Android 1.0 (meaning it likely was present since before Android’s first official release).</p>

<p>The SENSOR_* constants in <code>SensorManager</code> have since then been deprecated in API level 15 in favour of the <code>Sensor</code> class, which does not include any equivalent reference to the Tricorder. Unfortunate.</p>

<h2 id="sensormanagergravity_">SensorManager.GRAVITY_*</h2>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorManager.html#GRAVITY_DEATH_STAR_I">(reference)</a></p>

<p>The <code>SensorManager</code> class has a lot of constants which store the gravitational velocity of various bodies in our solar system ranging from <code>GRAVITY_SUN</code> to <code>GRAVITY_PLUTO</code>. While whether any of these outside of <code>GRAVITY_EARTH</code> is useful in any real-world scenarios is debatable, there are some that are actually just jokes.</p>

<p><code>GRAVITY_DEATH_STAR_I</code> stores the gravity of the first Death Star in SI units (referred to as Empire units). This appears to be a Star Wars reference.</p>

<p><code>GRAVITY_THE_ISLAND</code> stores the gravity of “the island”. Apparently this is a reference to The Island in the 2004 TV show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)">Lost</a>.</p>

<h2 id="blink">&lt;blink&gt;</h2>
<p>Last one, and this one is particularly crazy. Did you know there is a hidden tag inside the Android view layout system by the name of <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>? Because that is a thing:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>// [TAG_1995 = "blink"]</span>
<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>name</span><span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>TAG_1995</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
	<span>// Let's party like it's 1995!</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>new</span> <span>BlinkLayout</span><span>(</span><span>context</span><span>,</span> <span>attrs</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It makes any children that is wrapped inside of it blink, like the old <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> HTML tag. This one appears to be completely undocumented in the Android Developer reference, but was added <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/9c1223a71397b565f38015c07cae57a5015a6500%5E%21">in a commit in 2011</a> with the title “Improve LayoutInflater’s compliance” (right…) and is still present in the AOSP master branch.</p>

<p>Whether you should actually use it is debatable however.</p>
