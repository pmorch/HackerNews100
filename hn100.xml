<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-element="story-body" data-subscriber-content=""> <p>Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffett .</p><p>Many regard Buffett as the world’s greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett’s personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving away more than $60 billion over the last 20 years.</p><p>Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&amp;P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation’s biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.</p><p>Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall’s $9.7-billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn’t big enough to make a difference in Berkshire’s profits.</p><p>Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire’s trajectory, but don’t expect any seismic shifts. </p><p>Buffett isn’t going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire’s noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for. </p><h2 id="some-changes-are-likely">Some changes are likely</h2><p>CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said. </p><p>But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that. </p><p>The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett’s longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company’s culture.</p><p>Part of Buffett’s sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.</p><p>“I think the investment community would likely applaud Greg’s management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,” Seifert said. “And if it helps performance, that can’t really be faulted.”</p><h2 id="abel-plays-an-active-role-managing-companies">Abel plays an active role managing companies</h2><p>Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance. </p><p>Abel did announce some leadership changes in December after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he’s appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire’s consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel’s plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses. </p><p>Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than make quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders. </p><p>But if Abel can’t find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn’t done that since early 2024.</p><p>Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed. </p><h2 id="berkshire-has-a-solid-foundation">Berkshire has a solid foundation</h2><p>Many of Berkshire’s subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire’s utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due. </p><p>Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire’s businesses “can almost take care of themselves.” He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel. </p><p>One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs’ departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74. Many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett. </p><p>“As a long-term shareholder, we aren’t too concerned with Todd’s departure and don’t think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,” said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. “Todd’s situation is unique. It’s just a reminder that Warren’s pending departure is imminent and they’re preparing for a new phase — one that we’re still excited to see unfold.” </p><p><i>Funk writes for the Associated Press. </i></p><div data-impression-sr="25.0" data-list-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-module-id="00000192-be42-da32-a3db-ff76fc3b0000" data-impression-threshold="1000" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center="">  <p data-element="element-header" data-click="liZZListTitleCTA">  <h3 data-element="element-header-title" data-counter="3">More to Read </h3>  </p>      </div> </div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-12-25-privacy-and-control/">https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-12-25-privacy-and-control/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46446938">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>"I don't need to care about privacy because I have nothing to hide." is an
argument that I have heard countless times. I found this argument difficult to
counter in the past, yet deep-down I knew the reasoning was flawed.</p>
<p>The problem is that the word "privacy" is dialuted and mean different things to
different people. Instead of "privacy" we really should be talking about
"control". Framed in this context, we can more concretely talk about why it's
important to protect your digital identity.</p>
<p>For me privacy is not the primary driver, because like you mentioned, it doesn't
make sense for the common folk and doesn't actually fall into people's threat
model (journalists on the other hand should care). I am personally motivated by
the notion of "control". Can someone else meditate how I experience the world
and what information I consume? Whether that is censoring, influencing how much
time I have to spend watching ads or which ads I am allowed to watch. Can they
influence how I vote? Watch the talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oCDLbCyalM">In Defense of
Privacy</a> for a more on this.</p>
<p>Many of the convenient tools we use today (email, messaging, social media,
password manager) are essential for daily life but they also yield control over
to organizations (Google, Facebook, Amazon) that don't necessarily have our best
interst in mind [1][2].</p>
<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Questioning how "incentives align" is a really good litmus test for most
things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most of the following recommendations are based on my own threat model and
comfort level. There will always be a compromise between effort and easy. It's
best to pick what fits your lifestyle.</p>
<h3 id="password-manager">Password manager</h3>
<p>Use a password manager! I use <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/">GNU pass</a> because
I don't want to hand over my passwords to a 3rd party. I typically only use the
password manager from my laptop and don't access passwords from my phone (I
consider this a better security practice). I have been meaning to try out
<a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/passage">passage</a>. I would also recommend
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> for those who want a better UI experience.</p>
<h3 id="messanging">Messanging</h3>
<p>(Whatsapp is an unfortunate exception and I hate that I need it to stay
connected to friends and family). Signal for messaging is preferable [3]. Venmo
is disabled.</p>
<h3 id="phone">Phone</h3>
<p>I run <a href="https://grapheneos.org/features">GrapheneOS</a> on my Android. This allows
me to sandbox, disable or uninstall apps rather than allowing super-privileged
Google/ISP apps from doing whatever they wany on my personal device. By default,
<a href="https://grapheneos.org/features#sandboxed-google-play">Google Play apps are
unpriviledged</a> and have
to work within the sandbox model. GrapheneOS also allows you to restrict
permissions at a granular level, including network access. You can also disable
apps that you only use occasionally (Venmo, ride-sharing, Google play store).</p>
<p>I try to use opensource alternatives for apps on F-Droid. Did you know disabling
Google play store (also location services) increases your battery life by a lot!
Not running bloated stock OS also means your 5 year old phone is still fast and
usable (wtf do I need to but a new phone every 2 years?). I barely use social
media and don't install it on my phone (I use social media in Browser containers
to limit 3rd party cookies).</p>
<h3 id="email">Email</h3>
<p>I have a personal domain, which I use for email i.e. <a href="https://toidiu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="1d75787171725d697274797468337e7270">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>. This
allows me to switch providers whenever I want (e.g. lack of trust in Google,
ProtonMail can raise their prices). These days I am using <a href="https://toidiu.com/blog/2025-12-25-privacy-and-control/tuta.com">Tuta</a> as my
email provider because they are fast, offer a better price and have a strong
focus on secure email. Also I can't be bothered to host my own email server.</p>
<h3 id="browsing">Browsing</h3>
<p>I use firefox with privacy badger and uOrigin because I do not opt into
companies personally targeting me (can be contentious since some sites use this
to make money).</p>
<h3 id="calendar-contacts">Calendar/Contacts</h3>
<p>I host my calendar and contacts on a raspberrypi, which you can only access on
localhost. The Caldav server is https://sabre.io/baikal, gets the job done.
I use <a href="https://www.davx5.com/">DAVx⁵</a> to sync the contacts on my phone.</p>
<h3 id="domain">Domain</h3>
<p>Disclaimer: Cloudflare is my current employer. I switched to Cloudflare
Registrar recently because they offered a lower price when my previous Registrar
raised the price at renewal. I don't think Cloudflare really cares to make money
on domain registration.</p>
<h3 id="dns-resolution">DNS resolution</h3>
<p>I use Cloudflare's  DNS because I trust them more than other companies; purely
based on their business and how their incentives align
(https://one.one.one.one/). There are other secure/anaonymous ones out there.</p>

<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/challengingprojectsbook.png" alt="An AI-generated book cover for the book I was working on, 'Challenging Programming Projects'."></p><p>Back in 2020-2022, my blog was getting a lot of attention. Some of the big tech book publishers reached out about whether I was interested in writing a book. I had a few conversations but decided against it. I did want to write a book but self-publishing seemed like the better option.</p>

<p>Then an acquisitions editor for another big publisher asked to chat. He had a similar background to me, an academic who enjoys coding and writing. He had written a few books for multiple publishers so he knew the process and wasn't shy to share the good and bad. He even made decent money from his books.</p>

<p>I was intrigued. Writing a book was one of those goals that I liked the idea of but never made any progress on. I went and talked to a few other people that had published technical books and they gave me their reviews of the process and of each of the big publishers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pros of a publisher: They are a forcing function to make progress, they handle a lot of logistics for you around the book, they provide <i>some</i> feedback on the content, they have large distribution channels, and it looks more "real" when a publisher's name is on your book.</li>
<li>Cons of a publisher: They nag you constantly, they may try to steer your book in other directions, the money is peanuts, they can stop printing the book whenever they want, they have control over future editions, and they actually do little to no marketing of your book.</li>
</ul>

<p>I decided to write a book and sign with the publisher!</p>


<h3>The topic</h3>

<p>Before the actual deal, we had to agree on the book. Each publisher has their own template for pitching an idea. I did that and we went back and forth on some of the details. This part felt collaborative, they were trying to help me flesh out the concept based on their data and experience.</p>

<p>A lot of my blog posts involve classic programming projects that were relevant 30 years ago and will be just as fun 30 years from now. What if the book is a collection of tutorials on building these projects, each self-contained and teach fundamental computing concepts along the way?</p>

<p>To motivate that there is a market for this, I showed them that several of my blog posts in this space collectively had millions of views. Most notably, <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/challengingprojects.html">Challenging programming projects every programmer should try</a> (and the two sequels). My readers seem to resonate with <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/makinguselessstuff.html">making useless stuff</a> and <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/programmingasplay.html">programming for fun</a>. Who doesn't love hacking on a ray tracer or compiler or game or operating system just for fun?!</p>

<figure>
<img src="https://austinhenley.com/blog/images/websiteviewschart.png" alt="Screenshot of my page view analytics showing 20+ large spikes when many thousands of people came to my website on individual days.">
<figcaption><small>Page view spikes from my blog hitting up to 80,000 unique viewers a day.</small></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>They liked it! It was quite different than many of their other books. I wrote a high-level outline of the entire book. The projects were going to be:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Web crawler</li>
    <li>2d game</li>
    <li>Compiler</li>
    <li>HTTP server</li>
    <li>Drawing app</li>
    <li>CHIP-8 emulator</li>
    <li>TBD</li>
    <li>A list of mini projects</li>
</ul>

<p>The compiler chapter would be a revised version of my <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html">Let's make a Teeny Tiny compiler</a> blog series. The last project chapter would list a bunch of smaller scale projects that are less of a commitment but still worthwhile for learning (e.g., an image file format converter). Also, each chapter would end with a bunch of suggestions on how to continue with the project. If I got to the end and the book was a bit short, I was planning to squeeze in one more project chapter too.</p>

<h3>The contract</h3>

<p>There was some negotiation of the contract terms. We had to agree specifically on what the book was going to be. This included the pitch for the book, who the intended audience is, and a very detailed Table of Contents (down to the subsubsection headings). I had to give a tentative schedule of when I'd deliver drafts for major milestones.</p>

<p>The weirdest thing in the contract was the number of illustrations that the book must contain. I asked to bump that up. In the end we agreed to 115,500 to 132,000 words in length, approximately 350 to 400 printed pages, with 10 to 30 illustrations. </p>

<p>They offered a $5000 advance with the first half paid out when they approve of the first third of the book and the second half when they accept the final manuscript for publication.</p>

<p>I didn't even bother negotiating this because it is essentially nothing. I have a day job so I don't need the money sooner to pay rent (it is just an advance after all!) and if I don't sell way, way more than that then this was a bad use of my time financially anyway.</p>

<p>The royalties offered were surprisingly low. I did negotiate these and got them bumped up a tiny bit. They agreed to 12% of total sales for print and e-book on the first 7000 copies and then 15% on sales after that. 50% royalty on foreign translation sales.</p>

<p>I was later told that some people negotiated up to 18%. Meh. The finances don't look great regardless unless you have one of their top books.</p> 

<p>They refused to share statistics. I was able to get out of them that their median book sells in the range of single thousands of copies. Their top sellers are in the range of hundreds of thousands of copies but they only shared one example of a book that did that. Most are on the shelf for only a few years.</p>

<p>Oh, and I get 25 copies for myself and I can buy copies at a 50% discount.</p>

<p>We kicked the project off in early 2023.</p>


<h3>Get to writing!</h3>

<p>They assigned me an editor that I met with regularly. This was my main contact with the publisher.</p>

<p>He walked me through the process and got me set up. I was required to use AsciiDoc or Microsoft Word for my drafts. Nope, I can't use LaTeX. He gave me a very detailed style guide that I had to follow.</p>

<p>He emailed me, a lot. We had initially agreed to a chapter draft every 3 or 4 weeks (I was overly optimistic, and felt pressured...). Once that first soft deadline passed, the constant emails asking to see drafts began.</p>

<p>When I delivered a draft, I quickly got a marked-up version back. The feedback was mostly formatting and styling. The helpful feedback was pointing out rough transitions or assumptions I made about prior knowledge.</p>

<p>The unhelpful feedback was a consistent push to dumb down the book (which I don't think is particularly complex but I do like to leave things for the reader to try) to appease a broader audience and to mellow out my personal voice. He also wanted me to add a chapter that acts as an intro to programming with Python... 😵</p>

<blockquote>"There needs to be an initial chapter for teaching Python in case the reader doesn't have the background. What if they don't know how to use pip to install packages?"</blockquote>

<p>It became clear that they were following a formula for technical books. Don't show too much personality, don't be too technical, and hand hold the reader through a linear task. Just crank out the book so they get the book on the shelf. What you say on page 120 doesn't matter because the reader has already bought the book.</p>

<p>This rubbed me the wrong way but I pushed through. They are just following their incentives and I should push back.</p>


<h3>AI, AI, AI</h3>

<p>The book was started only a few months after the release of ChatGPT. The entire world was talking about AI!</p>

<p>So it wasn't long before the publisher asked to chat. <i>"Hey, is there any way you can incorporate AI into the book?"</i>, I politely declined.</p>

<p>A bit later they come back basically saying <i>The Powers That Be</i> are requiring AI to be part of every book. I offered a few compromises (i.e., a chapter about implementing an ML algorithm or a note at the end of each chapter about leveraging AI in the creation of the projects). I got a mixed response.</p>

<blockquote>"All of our future books will involve AI."</blockquote>

<p>In the end, I firmly told them no. It is antithetical to the premise of the book (<b>classic</b> programming projects!) that they agreed to publish. They went away.</p>


<h3>Getting closer?</h3>

<p>I kept missing deadlines. I was busy with work (AI!) and life. Apparently every book's timeline gets pushed at least once, so they were flexible. I eventually sent the editor the first third of the book and we made a few back-and-forths revising it.</p>

<p>This triggered the next stage: getting feedback on the technical content. We would do a round or two of this with a technical editor, then the draft would go off to strangers for review. If they hated it, the publisher had the right to cancel the project. If they don't hate it, then the draft would go live for early readers to buy (and they'd receive future chapters as they are completed).</p>

<p>The first notes I got back from the technical editor didn't seem like a good fit. Everything he said was correct, but indicated a mismatch in expectations. He was critiquing the project in the chapter as if it was supposed to be production quality software. But my projects are a balancing act of what can any programmer with very little knowledge on the subject make in a weekend that gives them a broad understanding of the concepts.</p>

<p>The second chapter of feedback from the technical editor was far more helpful to me. I think he "got" what I was going for and pointed out many flaws and suggested many improvements I could make. It was nice. Iterating on existing content is a very different workflow than writing new content so I slowed down even more. For example, it can be quite tedious to make sure that code snippets are consistent with snippets from 20 pages prior.</p>


<h3>Life</h3>

<p>I continued to get further behind on delivering my revised draft of the first 1/3. This is a big milestone in the publisher's process (soliciting external reviewers, determining whether the project should continue, putting the early adopters e-book up for sale, and paying out the first half of the advance).</p>

<p>The publisher was getting grumpy. I was getting grumpy. They were bringing up pivoting the book to be about AI again. They were "reevaluating" their portfolio. My editor left the company and I was assigned a new one. Things were piling on.</p>

<p>There was also a daunting voice in the back of my head that LLMs have eliminated the need for books like this. Why buy this book when ChatGPT can generate the same style of tutorial for <b>ANY</b> project that is customized to you?</p>

<p>The process with the publisher wasn't enjoyable. I had hoped for it to be a positive motivator to keep me focused but it felt like a chore. And I was worried that the finished product would be void of personality and would be yet another boring programming book.</p>

<p>Around this time, there was a possibility of me <a href="https://austinhenley.com/blog/leavingmicrosoft.html">changing jobs</a>. Oh, and my wedding was coming up. That was the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<h3>The end</h3>

<p>There were too many things going on and I didn't enjoy working on the book anymore, so what is the point? I made up my mind to ask to freeze the project.</p>

<p>They agreed.</p>

<p>I think they thought of this as a temporary cooldown where I could sporadically work on the book without the stress of the deadlines. The new editor still pinged me regularly asking if I made progress. Repeatedly. (I suppose they are following the incentives again—they only get paid if people ship books.) Eventually I asked him to stop until I reached out first.</p>

<p>And then... life went on. I never got un-busy.</p>

<p>Fast forward, I just got notification from the publisher that the <b>contract has been officially terminated</b> and all rights of the work were transferred back to me.</p>

<p>I still love my book idea. Maybe I'll just publish the chapters as blog posts or self-publish it. Or maybe I'll work on something entirely unrelated!</p>

                            <p>Stewart Douglas Cheifet, age 87, of Philadelphia, PA, passed away on December 28, 2025.</p><p id="isPasted">Stewart was born on September 24, 1938, to Paul and Anne Cheifet in Philadelphia, where he spent his childhood and attended Central High School. He later moved to California to attend college, graduating from the University of Southern California in 1960 with degrees in Mathematics and Psychology. He went on to earn his law degree from Harvard Law School.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1967, Stewart met his future wife, Peta Kennedy, while the two were working at CBS News in Paris. They returned to the United States and married later that year. Stewart’s career in television production took them around the world, and they lived together in the Samoan Islands, Hawaii, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, before eventually settling back in Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p><p>Stewart and Peta had two children, Stephanie and Jonathan.&nbsp;</p><p>Stewart is best known for producing and hosting the nationally broadcast PBS television programs Computer Chronicles and Net Cafe. Computer Chronicles aired from 1984 to 2002, producing more than 400 episodes that documented the rise of the personal computer from its earliest days. Net Cafe, which aired from 1996 to 2002, explored the emergence of the internet. Both programs were widely regarded as visionary, capturing the evolution of personal computing and the early development of the digital age.&nbsp;</p><p>Stewart’s professional interests and talents were wide-ranging. After leaving television production, he worked as a consultant for the Internet Archive, helping to preserve and provide public access to cultural and technological media, including Computer Chronicles and other technology programs. He also shared his knowledge as an educator, teaching broadcast journalism at the Donald W. Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno. After retirement, he spent his remaining years enjoying time with Peta, his children, his grandchildren, and his brothers.&nbsp;</p><p>Stewart is survived by his brothers Lanny and Bruce, his children Stephanie and Jonathan, and his grandchildren Gussy, Josephine, Benjamin, Freya, and Penny.</p><p>Services will be held for immediate family only.</p>

</picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>Every big Windows announcement this year was tied to some kind of AI feature or event. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="27796049-a0b7-418f-9377-c8f9f2078f90">Of course, the issue that made headlines the most this year is AI, as Microsoft falls over itself trying to make Windows 11 a frontier platform for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-redirect="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/artificial-intelligence" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. Unfortunately, this effort feels like it has been prioritized above everything else, including quality of life and overall platform stability.</p><p>Copilot has forced its way into almost every surface and intention on the platform. Heck, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-notepad-will-soon-let-you-generate-text-using-on-device-ai-models-no-subscription-required" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-notepad-will-soon-let-you-generate-text-using-on-device-ai-models-no-subscription-required">Notepad now has a Copilot button</a>, which is something literally nobody has ever asked for. Microsoft's AI intentions feel obsessive and forced, almost as if the company is just throwing everything at the wall to see what sticks.</p><p>Under the hood, Microsoft has been moving to make Windows 11 agentic. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-just-revealed-how-windows-11-is-evolving-into-an-agentic-os-finally-the-explanation-weve-all-been-waiting-for" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-just-revealed-how-windows-11-is-evolving-into-an-agentic-os-finally-the-explanation-weve-all-been-waiting-for">It unveiled the agentic workspace</a>, along with a set of APIs that will allow AI developers to build tools that can automate workflows on your behalf. Sounds great on paper, until you read the fine print and discover that it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-warns-security-risks-agentic-os-windows-11-xpia-malware">serious security implications and warnings. </a></p><div data-hydrate="true" id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-DjgB8CDooXtXtjAxRbocvW"><section><p>All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.</p></section></div><p>You'd like to think that a feature with such serious security concerns wouldn't make it out of the lab, but because this is AI, Microsoft doesn't seem to mind. The feature even ships off by default, which tells you everything you need to know about how the company views this feature.</p><p>A large chunk of the AI features that were announced this year also aren't Copilot+ PC exclusive, which means most of them require an internet connection and your data sent to the cloud to be useful, which is another privacy concern to add to all the other privacy concerns on Windows 11.</p><p>In November, Windows president Pavan Davuluri mentioned that Windows would evolve into an agentic OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-confirms-os-will-become-ai-agentic-generates-push-back-online" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-confirms-os-will-become-ai-agentic-generates-push-back-online">sparking one of the biggest amounts of backlash</a> I've seen around Windows this year. His post was so negatively received, he had to disable replies and issue a follow up statement reassuring customers that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-addresses-current-state-of-windows-11-after-ai-backlash-we-know-we-have-a-lot-of-work-to-do" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-president-addresses-current-state-of-windows-11-after-ai-backlash-we-know-we-have-a-lot-of-work-to-do">Windows would continue to innovate outside of AI too.</a></p><p>I want to stress that AI <em>can </em>be beneficial. I've always said that AI is best when it's invisible, which is why I'm so confused about Microsoft's approach to AI on Windows 11. It seems like Microsoft wants AI to be <em>the </em>selling point, but that's totally backwards. AI should be a helpful extra, not an all-encompassing, sole reason for the platform's existence.</p><h2 id="continuous-innovation-more-like-continuous-irritation-3">Continuous Innovation?

</picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>Your Windows 11 install is at risk of being "improved" on a monthly cadence these days. </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p id="944c1d64-9c9c-49fe-a761-8df1a750617a">I think the biggest issue users are dealing with right now is Microsoft's "Continuous Innovation" strategy for Windows 11, which is designed to allow the company to build new features and get them out the door faster than ever before.</p><p>In the past, new Windows features were often timed with a significant OS update. Once a year, Windows would receive a big upgrade, which would introduce new features and improvements from the core up. This allowed Microsoft plenty of time to bake and fine-tune new features and changes, ironing out bugs before general availability.</p><p>Today, thanks to Continuous Innovation, Microsoft is able to ship new features whenever the company <em>deems </em>them ready. Every. Single. Month. This means there's now a constant churn of new features, with no breaks or respite. Users never get a chance to breathe.</p><p>On top of this is Microsoft's Controlled Feature Rollout (CFR) system, which makes it so some users don't see the new features even after installing the update that supposedly includes them, making it literally impossible to predict and prepare for when a new feature might actually arrive on your PC.</p><p>The new Windows 11 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/start-menu" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/start-menu">Start menu</a> is a perfect example of this. It only began rolling out in October, but thanks to Controlled Feature Rollout, many users didn't get it right away after installing the October update. For those people, it randomly appeared a few days or weeks later, without any warning or prompt, letting the user know what happened and why.</p><p>In this scenario, going into your update history to see what changed is going to confuse you, because the update that includes the new Start menu was installed on your system weeks ago. You're only seeing the new features now because Microsoft allowed you to see it, which is insane and frustrating beyond belief.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="ba911589-a255-4e16-8ba6-ffb740115e5e"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Two identical systems, running the same build and update of Windows 11, might appear completely different feature-wise, which is confusing to your average user, and more than likely one of the reasons why Windows feels so much buggier these days. There are too many moving parts.</p><p>Continuous Innovation essentially boils down to allowing Microsoft to force new features onto you whenever it wants, because the company ties these new features to monthly security updates, which are essentially required if you want to use your computer safely on the internet.</p><p>But it's beyond frustrating when said features or changes randomly appear on your system without any warning, and even more frustrating when you can't disable or undo them. Users have to make do with Microsoft constantly moving the deck chairs, and people are getting tired.</p><p>I mean, Microsoft has even built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-publishes-windows-roadmap-as-it-promises-transparency-around-feature-availability" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-publishes-windows-roadmap-as-it-promises-transparency-around-feature-availability">Windows Roadmap website</a> designed to try and make it easier to see where new features are in their rollout. Except, the website is so confusing and frustrating to navigate, and digest, it's actually not very useful at all. That's how complicated the Windows update situation is right now.</p><p>Above all else, it renders the annual version update essentially irrelevant. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-version-25h2-no-new-features" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-confirms-windows-11-version-25h2-no-new-features">Version 25H2</a>, which shipped a couple of months back, includes no new features or changes over version 24H2, because Microsoft ships new features to both at the same time. They are the same version. Why even do this? Surely it makes more sense just to extend support for version 24H2?</p><h2 id="a-noticeable-decline-in-quality-3">A noticeable decline in quality </h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="9280ebf5-22dd-4cdc-80d3-918dc3b08519"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Rarely, if ever, does Microsoft pull an update that is causing bugs, though it has happened a couple of times.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if CFR is playing a part in this decline in quality. With the same version of Windows being able to present itself differently depending on what I can only describe as random factors, it may be just becoming harder to keep Windows stable when there are so many moving parts and variables at play.</p><p>Windows 11 today is a much more complex beast than previous versions of Windows have been. Microsoft has been obsessed with A/B testing for a long while, but CFR takes it to a whole other level, to the point where you literally can't guarantee the version of Windows 11 you're installing will be "feature complete" when you want it to be.</p><p>Some users have reported never getting the chance to test a particular feature before it's made generally available because of CFR. That's how detrimental the system is to the development and availability of new Windows features. As a real-life example of this, my main Windows 11 Insider PC is still stuck with the old Start menu, even though the new Start menu is now rolling out and generally available.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="6866115a-f499-4ed1-990e-83aafab5b9c6"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

Windows 11 is just too big, bloated, and unoptimized to run well on low-end hardware, to the point where many schools and enterprises are switching to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/chrome-os" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/tag/chrome-os">Chrome OS</a> or even the iPad because Windows just sucks on these devices.</p><p>I'm still blown away by how quick Chrome OS is at both updating the system and factory resetting the system. Installing a system update on Chrome OS is as quick as restarting an app, taking less than a few seconds in most cases. On Windows 11, installing an update can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours, depending on how big the update is.</p><p>With Android PCs, Windows might finally have a real challenger in this low-end space. If Lenovo, Dell, HP, and the other top-name OEMs are on board to build Android PCs, I really don't see how Windows 11 in its current state will be able to compete. The Android system is just better optimized for these low-end devices, and Windows needs a real architectural slim down even to stand a chance.</p><p>It's not just Google coming for Microsoft's lunch either;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/valve-already-gambled-on-steam-machine-which-brands-would-return" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/valve-already-gambled-on-steam-machine-which-brands-would-return"> Valve is interested in taking some of that sweet gamer market share</a> from Windows.

Gamers are all but ready to abandon ship, and Valve is offering up a viable alternative on a plate. The Steam Machine is going to light a fire under Windows PC gaming.</p><p>Then you've got Apple, which is always slowly pecking away at Windows market share with the Mac. Since Apple Silicon, Mac has only gained market share, and its latest laptops are some of the best out there. These days, the only reason not to buy a Mac is if you need a laptop with a touch screen or 5G, or just don't like MacOS.</p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/its-more-bad-news-for-microsoft-and-windows-11-apples-cheap-macbook-actually-sounds-good" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/its-more-bad-news-for-microsoft-and-windows-11-apples-cheap-macbook-actually-sounds-good">Apple is rumored to be building a cheap MacBook</a> that will ship sometime next year. This could be potentially devastating for Windows, because for a lot of people, the only reason they don't own a Mac is that they're too expensive. If Apple can ship a new MacBook for $600, that's going to be hard to say no to over any Windows laptop in the same price range.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-all-bad-3">It's not all bad</h2><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="9bc8896a-5850-4808-8103-74b6676281da"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

The public has decided that Windows 11 is a bad operating system, and Microsoft does need to address this.</p><p>If I were in charge, the very first thing I would do is throw out the Continuous Innovation strategy. There's simply no need to ship new features on a monthly cadence, users don't want it, and Microsoft would have an easier time developing and testing new features thoroughly without it.</p><p>Instead, I would introduce quarterly feature drops, with big new features coming once a year timed with the annual version update. Microsoft can ship smaller quality of life improvements, features, and updates every three months, and any big user experience changes or improvements once a year. Security updates can remain monthly.</p><p>This would allow Microsoft more time to test features as they are developed before shipping them, which would ideally improve the overall stability of the system. I'd also scrap the CFR system and ship new features to everyone as the updates are released.</p><p>I'd also love to see Microsoft tone things down when it comes to AI. Windows 11 should be AI capable, of course, but I really don't think it needs to be shoved into every UI surface possible. Notepad doesn't need an AI button, for goodness sake. AI is best when it's invisible, not when it's shoved in your face at every turn.</p><p>Given the current reputation of Windows 11, if I were in charge of Windows, I'd certainly be thinking about pivoting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-12-ai-new-ui-features-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/windows-12-ai-new-ui-features-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far">Windows 12</a> in an attempt to give Windows a clean slate and a fresh start. As long as the company doesn't market it as an AI-first OS, pivoting to Windows 12 would be nothing but a good thing for Microsoft, especially if it's a free update for everyone that doesn't bump system requirements.</p><p>That doesn't mean Windows 12 should have no AI features. The fact of the matter is, AI is here to stay, and I'd be very interested to see what a desktop UX can be like if it's built from scratch with AI in mind. But it needs to be optional, and it cannot be the sole reason for Windows 12 to exist. AI should complement the platform, not become the platform.</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check="" id="6ebd8b73-b66c-4f5b-8042-ca7fdd364961"><div><p> <picture data-new-v2-image="true">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Training gaming agents is an addictive game. A game of sleepless nights, grinds, explorations, sweeps, and prayers. <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib"><strong>PufferLib</strong></a> allows anyone with a gaming computer to play the RL game, but getting from “pretty good” to “superhuman” requires tweaking every lever, repeatedly.</p>

<p>This is the story of how I trained agents that beat massive (few-TB) search-based solutions on <strong>2048</strong> using a 15MB policy trained for 75 minutes and discovered that bugs can be features in <strong>Tetris</strong>. TLDR? PufferLib, Pareto sweeps, and curriculum learning.</p>

<h2 id="speed-and-iteration">Speed and Iteration</h2>

<p>PufferLib’s C-based environments run at 1M+ steps per second per CPU core. Fast enough to solve Breakout in under one minute. It also comes with advanced RL upgrades like optimized vectorized environments, LSTM, Muon, and <a href="https://x.com/jsuarez5341/status/1938287195305005500"><strong>Protein</strong></a>: a cost-aware hyperparameter sweep framework. Since 1B-step training takes minutes, RL transforms from “YOLO and pray” into systematic search, enabling hundreds of hyperparameter sweeps in hours rather than days.</p>

<p>All training ran on two high-end gaming desktops with single RTX 4090s. Compute was sponsored by <a href="https://puffer.ai/">Puffer.ai</a>, thanks!</p>

<h3 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Augment observations: Give the policy the information it needs.</li>
  <li>Tweak rewards: Shape the learning signal and adjust weights.</li>
  <li>Design curriculum: Control what the agent experiences and when.</li>
</ol>

<p>Network scaling comes last. Only after exhausting observations, rewards, and curriculum should you scale up. Larger networks make training slower; nail the obs and reward first. Once you do scale, the increased capacity may (or may not) reach new heights and reveal new insights, kicking off a fresh iteration cycle.</p>

<p>Sweep methodology: I ran 200 sweeps, starting broad and narrowing to fine-tune. Protein samples from the cost-outcome Pareto front, using small experiments to find optimal hyperparameters before committing to longer runs.</p>

<h2 id="2048-beating-the-few-tb-endgame-table">2048: Beating the Few-TB Endgame Table</h2>

<p>2048 strikes a unique balance between simplicity and complexity. The rules are trivial: merge the same tiles to reach 2048, or 131,072. But the game is NP-hard with a massive state space. Random tile spawns (2s or 4s in random positions) force agents to develop probabilistic strategies rather than memorizing solutions.</p>

<p>The previous state-of-the-art search solution uses a few terabytes of endgame tables to reach the 32,768 tile reliably and the 65,536 tile at an 8.4% rate (<a href="https://github.com/game-difficulty/2048EndgameTablebase">repo</a>).</p>

<p>My 15MB policy achieved a 14.75% 65k tile rate and a 71.22% 32k tile rate (115k episodes). Here is the <a href="https://wandb.ai/kywch/pufferlib/runs/5thsjr61?nw=nwuserkywch">training log</a>. You can play it in your browser <a href="https://kywch.github.io/games/2048.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://kywch.github.io/images/posts/2048_65k.png" alt="2048 Agent reaching 65k tile"></p>

<h3 id="what-made-it-work">What Made It Work</h3>

<p>Details are in <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/g2048/g2048.h">g2048.h</a>. Obviously, these didn’t come from one shot. Guess how many?</p>

<p><strong>Observation design</strong> (18 features per 4×4 cell): These were fixed early and did not change.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Normalized tile value (raised to power 1.5 via lookup table for speed).</li>
  <li>Empty cell flag (one-hot).</li>
  <li>Tile value one-hots (16 features for 2^1 through 2^16).</li>
  <li>One “snake state” flag (indicating if the board matches the ideal “snake pattern”).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reward structure</strong>: Details were tweaked frequently.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Merge rewards: Proportional to tile value (weight: 0.0625).</li>
  <li>Penalties: Invalid moves (-0.05) and Game Over (-1.0).</li>
  <li>State rewards: Bonuses for filled top rows and max tiles in corners.</li>
  <li>Monotonicity rewards: Encourage specific directional patterns (weight: 0.00003).</li>
  <li>Snake rewards: Large bonus for the pre-defined snake configuration. I experimented with the length of the snake, and settled with the sorted top row + the max_tile_in_row234 in the second row right. For example, top row: 14-13-12-11, second row: ()-()-()-10.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Curriculum was the key</strong>. To learn, agents must experience high-value states, which are hard (or impossible) for untrained agents to reach. The endgame-only envs were the final piece to crack 65k. The endgame requires tens of thousands of correct moves where a single mistake ends the game, but to practice, agents must first get there. Curriculum was manually curated and tweaked repeatedly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scaffolding curriculum (episode-level): Spawns pre-placed high tiles (8k-65k) at the start. Early training gets single high tiles. Later training gets specific configurations (e.g., 16k+8k, or 32k+16k+8k). Saves thousands of moves, letting agents experience endgame scenarios faster.</li>
  <li>Endgame-only environments (env-level): Dedicated training that only practices endgame because a single mistake ends the game. Always starts with high-value tiles pre-placed (e.g., 32k, 16k, 8k, 4k).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Policy architecture</strong>: 3.7M parameters with LSTM memory. It changed rarely.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Encoder: Three FC layers with GELU (1024 -&gt; 512 -&gt; 512).</li>
  <li>Memory: LSTM layer (512x512) for long-horizon planning.</li>
  <li>The LSTM is critical for 2048’s 45k+ move games (when reaching the 65k tile).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-road-ahead-shooting-for-132k">The Road Ahead: Shooting for 132k</h3>

<p>Reaching the 65,536 tile requires 40k+ moves with precise sequencing. The strategy you start at move 20k affects whether you succeed at move 25k.</p>

<p>So how can we shoot for 132k? On top of more training steps, these two directions seem promising:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Deeper networks</strong>: The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14858">1000 Layer Networks</a> research shows that extreme depth can unlock new goal-reaching capabilities in RL.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated curriculum</strong>: The <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10995">Go-Explore algorithm</a> could automatically discover the “stepping stones” to higher tiles more efficiently than manual scaffolding.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="tetris-when-bugs-become-features">Tetris: When Bugs Become Features</h2>

<p>Tetris is forgiving early on but becomes impossible as speed increases. My journey here led to an unexpected insight about curriculum learning.</p>

<p>I started with hyperparameter sweeps and increased network width from 128 to 256. Better hyperparameters alone made the agent much better. The agent kept playing endlessly, which was boring to watch. So I made the game harder:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Garbage lines: Random filled rows at the bottom.</li>
  <li>Progression: Quicker ramps in drop speed and garbage frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p>The breakthrough came from a bug.</p>

<p>A bug caused the one-hot encoding for the next two pieces to persist between steps. Over time, the observation array would fill with 1s, essentially becoming noise.</p>

<p>When I fixed this bug, the agents did well in the beginning but couldn’t handle when gaps started to appear. With the bug, the agents performed much better overall, though early-stage play was somewhat off. Why? Early exposure to chaos made the agents robust. When they encountered genuinely difficult late-game situations (fast drops, lots of garbage), they’d already learned to handle messy, unpredictable states. The bug had accidentally implemented curriculum learning through randomization.</p>

<p>So I implemented two curriculum approaches:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>External</strong>: Injecting random garbage lines during early training.</li>
  <li><strong>Internal</strong>: Mimicking the bug by adding observation noise that decays over time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both create early-game “hard states” that teach robustness. I don’t know which is better; sometimes external works, other times internal. So I left both versions in the <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib/blob/3.0/pufferlib/ocean/tetris/tetris.h">code</a>.</p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://wandb.ai/kywch/pufferlib/runs/era6a8p6?nw=nwuserkywch">training log</a>. You can play it in your browser <a href="https://kywch.github.io/games/tetris.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, Tetris is easier because you’re mostly reacting to the current piece and next few pieces, not planning 40k+ moves ahead like 2048.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="lessons-what-actually-mattered">Lessons: What Actually Mattered</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Speed giveth</strong>: Training on a single RTX 4090 worked because the environment was fast enough to run hundreds of hyperparameter sweeps. Fast simulation transforms RL from “YOLO and pray” into systematic search.</li>
  <li><strong>Hyperparameters matter</strong>: They can easily double performance without other changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Nail obs and reward first</strong>: A bigger network won’t fix poor observation or reward design. Scale the network last.</li>
  <li><strong>Curriculum makes superhuman</strong>: Agents cannot learn what they haven’t experienced. Curriculum learning lets agents experience critical states that would take too long (or be impossible) to reach naturally.</li>
  <li><strong>Systematic grind &gt; Clever one-shot</strong>: Progress came from disciplined grind, sleepless nights, with little inspiration sprinkled in between.</li>
  <li><strong>Bug luck</strong>: Don’t let a lucky bug slip by; it might teach you something good.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="try-it-yourself">Try It Yourself</h2>

<p>Watch the agents play: <a href="https://kywch.github.io/games/2048.html">2048</a>, <a href="https://kywch.github.io/games/tetris.html">Tetris</a></p>

<p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/PufferAI/PufferLib">PufferLib</a></p>

<p>Training commands: After installing PufferLib, run <code>puffer train puffer_g2048</code> or <code>puffer train puffer_tetris</code></p>

<p>These results show that a single person with a gaming desktop can achieve much more than you’d think. Also, if you’re considering scaling up, think again. Having many CPUs and GPUs to throw at a problem is nice, but it’s much more fun squeezing the last drop of perf out (but yeah, I also saw Sutton’s <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">The Bitter Lesson</a>).</p>

<p>Imagine you wake up one night to find out that production is crashing. It takes you a while to unearth the root cause. It turns out to be a null pointer exception deep inside a service. It crashed the whole system. How did it get there? Where did it come from?</p>
<p>Now imagine a different story. One day a developer had to struggle for a whole of 20 minutes fixing some informative compilation errors. And that's it, that's the whole story. Nobody had to wake up at night, production never crashed.</p>
<p>One of these stories is a story of lies and deceit, the other a story of dialogue and cooperation. Today we will learn how to stop lying to the compiler, and how to get a good night's sleep.</p>

<p>(If you're familiar at high-level with how compilers work, feel free to skip to the next <a href="#part-ii-lying-to-the-compiler">part</a>)</p>
<p>But first things first. What is a compiler?</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, a compiler is a function, that takes an input in one format and produces an output in another format. This definition is so broad as to be useless... Although, if you take this definition seriously, it has some interesting implications on how we approach solving problems in everyday code. But I digress.</p>
<p>Let's try again, more concretely this time. A typical compiler takes source code in some programming language and produces an output in some other language. For example, a C compiler takes files written in C, and produces assembly code.</p>
<p>A typical compiler pipeline might have the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Parsing the source code into an intermediate representation, an abstract syntax tree (AST)</li>
<li>Typechecking the code, make sure that all the types line up</li>
<li>Optimization, going over the AST and finding opportunities to make the code more efficient</li>
<li>Code generation, converting the AST into the output format, like machine code.</li>
</ol>
<p>As we will soon see, the typechecking step is probably the most relevant for most developers.</p>
<p>Like most things, nothing is that simple. Different languages have differently flavored compilers, doing a wide range of things. This is not a thorough review on all things compilers, so instead, let's take a sample of languages and see what kind of compilers they have.</p>
<h3 id="rust">Rust<a href="#rust"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Rust is similar to C, in that it compiles directly to machine code. To distinguish this "classic" compiler from the rest, we call this style an "ahead of time" compiler. This means that everything that the compiler does starts and ends before runtime. Once we created the binary output, the work of the compiler is done.</p>
<p>But, this doesn't mean that the job of the compiler is easy. Rust is quite sophisticated, apart from parsing the source code the compiler needs to do things like macro expansion, type checking, borrow checking, and lots, and lots of optimizations.</p>
<p>Optimization, and generally performance is a common benefit of using compiled languages. Compiled languages tend to be faster than languages that don't use a classic compiler, but are instead dynamically interpreted on the fly (like Python). And Rust is famous for its optimizations in the style of "zero cost abstractions".</p>
<p>Zero cost abstraction means that despite Rust being a low-level language, in many cases one can write pretty high-level code and still get the performance of handwritten low-level code. This is possible because the compiler analyzes the code, and manages to translate a high-level construct like <code>map</code> on an iterator into a low-level, fast loop. This includes optimizations like inlining and loop fusion.</p>
<p>As a developer writing in Rust though, the thing that you would notice the most during development is all the memory safety checks the compiler does for you at every step.</p>
<p>Rust makes it possible to safely manage memory without using a garbage collector, probably one of the biggest pain points of using low-level languages like C and C++. It boils down to the fact that many of the common memory issues that we can experience, things like dangling pointers, double freeing memory, and data races, all stem from the same thing: uncontrolled sharing of mutable state. For example, if two different variables share a pointer to the same data, if one of them frees the pointer, the other will end up with an invalid pointer without knowing it. Likely breaking something upon pointer dereference.</p>
<p>So Rust forbids us from freely sharing pointers. Each pointer has exactly one owner at every moment of time. Once the owner goes out of scope, memory is freed automatically. Since there are no other owners, this is safe and cannot lead to dangling pointers and the like.</p>
<p>What makes Rust special is that all of this happens at compile-time. The compiler tracks pointer ownership, using something called a borrow checker, forbidding us from doing anything that violates the single ownership of pointers. Memory unsafe code will simply fail to compile.</p>
<p>Rust's powerful type system is one very compelling (and painful) reason to use it. A broken elevator and walking 21 floors up the stairs can really motivate you to invent such a safe language.</p>
<p>Then we have Java.</p>
<h3 id="java">Java<a href="#java"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>People often think of Java as a static, compiled language. But actually, the Java compiler doesn't produce machine code. Instead, it produces bytecode. An intermediate (stack-based) language that is then <em>dynamically</em> interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when the bytecode is executed.</p>
<p>The reason for going through all this trouble is portability. By using intermediate bytecode, Java can be compiled once on any platform, but then executed on any other platform that has an implementation of the JVM. That's cool and all, but didn't we just say that interpreted languages are slow?</p>
<p>True, in the early days of Java, people were worried that running such a "dynamic" language will be too slow to be useful, and surely will never be able to compete with something like C++. And that's why we have "just in time" compilation. Or JIT for short.</p>
<p>The Java compiler does a lot less than Rust's. The translation from Java to bytecode is comparatively simple. The compiler doesn't make optimizations as far reaching as the Rust compiler. And if we left things that way Java would indeed be quite slow.</p>
<p>The real fun begins at runtime. The Java runtime has a JIT compiler enabled. The JIT compiler monitors the execution of the bytecode, as it gets slowly interpreted step by step. After a while, the JIT starts recognizing various hotspots in the code, like long loops, or common branching points. It then takes the bytecode for the hotspot and compiles it down to an efficient machine code representation. From that point onwards, that segment of code should run much more quickly.</p>
<p>Like a sophisticated ahead of time (AOT) compiler, the JIT compiler can apply nontrivial optimizations to the code. But unlike an AOT compiler, the JIT compiler has access to the actual usage patterns at runtime. Meaning that it can be more aggressive in optimizing the real bottlenecks in code. Things like dynamic dispatch in an object-oriented class hierarchy can be converted to static dispatch at runtime.</p>
<p>If you ever wondered why your JVM app takes time to "warm up" before it's actually fast, the JIT compiler is your answer. It takes time for the JIT compiler to recognize and compile the actual hotspots in code.</p>
<p>These days, Java has an AOT compiler as well, called Graal. As a result we can use the very same Java code and produce two completely different artifacts, either in bytecode or machine code (with some limitations).</p>
<p>More generally compilers can have more than one compilation target, or "backends". For example, both Scala and Kotlin can be compiled to either JVM bytecode, JavaScript, and native machine code. To support such use cases, and to avoid repetition between different backends, the compiler will have some intermediate representation of the language that is being compiled, the AST. This way, most of the compiler's work like parsing, typechecking, and various optimizations can produce one AST, but then that one AST can be converted into different outputs.</p>
<p>Despite all that complex work being done by the various compilers, most of the interaction that Java programmers have with the compiler is with the type checker. Java's type-system is not nearly as strict as Rust's, often being more annoying than helpful. So it's not uncommon for us the developers to "know better" than the compiler and use a cast every now and then. These are the first signs of trouble...</p>
<p>Seeing that a compiler can be quite the complex beast, you would be quite correct in asking:</p>
<h3 id="aside-who-compiles-the-compilers">Aside: Who Compiles the Compilers?<a href="#aside-who-compiles-the-compilers"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Or more specifically, in what language is the compiler written? It would seem natural for the developers of a new language X to write the compiler in X. Surely it's their favorite language. At the very least, it's a good idea for them to dogfood their own creation.</p>
<p>Among people who write compilers, writing the compiler in the very same language it's supposed to compile is considered an important milestone. It shows that the language is mature enough to be able to implement such a complex piece of code. When a language does it, it is said to be "self-hosting".</p>
<p>Here we have a paradox. If I have a compiler written in X, to be able to use it I first need to compile it, and for that I need a compiler for language X. But I don't have one compiled, I need to compile it first... And so we find ourselves with a chicken and egg problem.</p>
<p>The way to get out of this conundrum is by a procedure called "bootstrapping". Here things are going to get a bit meta.</p>
<p>It goes like this. First write a compiler in language X, the "bootstrapp<strong>ed</strong> compiler". Ideally you do that using as few features of X as possible. Then choose another existing language Y (can be assembly or some high-level language), and write a compiler for X in Y, the "bootstrapp<strong>ing</strong> compiler". It doesn't have to handle all of the features of X, only the ones that were used in the code for the bootstrapp<strong>ed</strong> compiler. Once you run the bootstrapp<strong>ing</strong> compiler on the code for the bootstrapp<strong>ed</strong> compiler, congratulations, you now have a brand new self-hosting compiler for X. From this point onwards, you can improve the compiler and add features to it all without leaving the comfort of your favorite language X.</p>
<p>We can follow this process with the Rust compiler. Originally, it was written in the OCaml language. But the current Rust compiler was rewritten in Rust, which makes it a proper self-hosting compiler.</p>
<p>This is all good and well, but most of the time us simple developers don't really care about the language the compiler uses, we just need it to compile code. The reason I'm telling you all this is that it gives us an interesting insight into the development of programming languages.</p>
<p>The people who write compilers are usually the same people that design the language itself. And most of what they do all day long is writing compiler code. This might skew their incentives. They really enjoy using languages that are a good fit for writing compilers. Even more so, since in the early stages of a new language the compiler is probably the biggest piece of code written in it. That's the chance for the new language to really shine.</p>
<p>We shouldn't be surprised then, to find that many new languages tend to accumulate features that are very convenient for compiler writers. Things like pattern matching, and implicit parameters.</p>
<p>But seeing how compilers are not very representative of the code most of us write daily, this might not be the best way to spend the complexity budget when designing a new language. Lucky for us, some of those features are useful for plain-old, boring business code as well. Especially code written in the functional style.</p>
<p>Let's wrap up this exploration of compilers with one more language.</p>
<h3 id="typescript">TypeScript<a href="#typescript"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>The TypeScript compiler is special in that the target is not a low-level format like assembly and bytecode, but instead another high-level language, JavaScript. Although definitions are a bit fluid, but in this case we say that the TypeScript compiler is actually a "transpiler". Even more curiously, since JavaScript is a strict subset of TypeScript, we can say that TypeScript is compiling into itself.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons to want to do that: nicer syntax for various features of JavaScript (like classes and enums), and the type-system that TypeScript adds on top of JavaScript.</p>
<p>Microsoft, who developed TypeScript, was motivated by the pain they experienced when scaling large JavaScript codebases. Adding a robust type-system to a language makes it much easier to tame large codebases over time (things like refactoring become safer). We can see the same trend with Dropbox investing in Mypy, an optional type checker for Python, to help scaling their Python codebase.</p>
<p>Adding a type-system to an existing programming language is very different from designing a language with types from the ground up. With an existing language you must be able to add types to as much existing code as possible. And codebases in dynamic language sure do tend to be... Dynamic.</p>
<p>To mitigate this, TypeScript uses gradual typing. With gradual typing you don't have to add types to the whole codebase all at once, like you would in, say, Java. Instead, you can do it gradually, and the compiler verifies that whatever is annotated is consistent with itself, and ignores the rest. This smoothes migration from an untyped code and mindset to a typed one.</p>
<p>There is also the question of which type system is most appropriate for an ex-dynamic language. Did you know that type-systems come in different flavors? Most mainstream languages use "nominal" type-systems. This means that each type gets a unique name, and types that have different names are treated as distinct types by the compiler. In contrast, TypeScript uses a "structural" type-system. Two types are considered the same if they have the same structure, e.g., the same fields and methods. The name of the type doesn't matter.</p>
<p>Structural typing seems to be better suited when gradually typing a dynamic language. "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck" is a common viewpoint in dynamic languages, and structural typing is the way to capture this mindset with types.</p>
<p>In a curious turn of events, TypeScript and Mypy went the other way around with bootstrapping and self-hosting. The current TypeScript compiler is self-hosting, but a rewrite in Go is in the works. In Mypy, the compiler was rewritten from plain Python into a special almost-Python dialect that compiles directly to C. The motivation for both rewrites is performance. Turns out that it's difficult to get a sufficiently fast compiler that can quickly process large codebases in dynamic runtimes like JavaScript and Python.</p>
<p>Like before, we can't help but notice that the type-system is the main interface between the developer and the compiler. In the case of TypeScript I would say that it's also the main reason to even want to use the language.</p>
<p>And yet, so many developers hate the compiler. It seems that all it does is yell at us about trivialities like "string is not int" and such. Is it worth bothering with a compiled language just for that?</p>
<h2 id="part-ii-lying-to-the-compiler">Part II: Lying to the Compiler<a href="#part-ii-lying-to-the-compiler"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>The compiler is always angry. It's always yelling at us for no good reason. It's only happy when we surrender to it and do what it tells us to do. Why do we agree to such an abusive relationship?</p>
<p>And for someone who yells that much, it's not even that smart. Remember all the times when the compiler yelled at you something about a type mismatch, but turns out that you were right and the compiler was wrong? In the end you had to use a cast (or mark something as <code>any</code>) just to shut the compiler up.</p>
<p>We can solve these issues by quitting the relationship, and jumping ship to a dynamic language. I suspect that compiler abuse is why in the past Python grew in popularity compared to Java (that, and Java's verbosity). But we just saw that even in historically dynamic languages, like JavaScript and Python, there's a trend towards a more static, more compiler-centric way of writing code. These days Python has not just one, but <em>multiple</em> competing tools for typechecking (mypy, pyright, pyrefly, ty). Why do people lean that way?</p>
<p>Maybe it's performance. We talked before about how compiled languages tend to be faster than dynamic languages. But that doesn't seem quite right. In many contexts, where the language's performance is not the bottleneck, people will still use types. And TypeScript, for example, doesn't give us a runtime performance benefit, all the type information is discarded after compilation. Are people really just that masochistic?</p>
<p>Maybe Rust is the answer. Rust's compiler brings significant improvements in code safety where memory management is involved. True, its compiler is even more difficult to satisfy than average, but it solves a very tangible problem that would be very difficult to safely solve otherwise. Still, most of us don't write low-level code, and we mostly use garbage-collected, memory-safe languages. Not many mainstream languages have a type-system that is as powerful as Rust's, so we don't usually get that much extra safety.</p>
<p>We can imagine that in very large codebases, like the ones managed by Microsoft and Dropbox, there's some magical advantage to having types checked by the compiler (we mentioned safer refactoring before), despite the obvious pains. But most of us don't maintain code that large, why bother with types then?</p>
<p>It seems that all the compiler can do for us is act as simple, and not very reliable, guard rails. Sure it would sometimes notice that this or that int is actually a string. But if that's all it can do for us, then we might as well write a couple of unit tests, and remove this nuisance from our lives.</p>
<h3 id="the-lies">The Lies<a href="#the-lies"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>I think that this is a false premise. The compiler is actually much more useful and powerful than it might appear. So useful in fact, that relying on it is beneficial in any codebase, large and small. The problem is that we are used to lie to the compiler all the time, in return all it can do for us is yell about strings not being ints and do little else.</p>
<p>What do I mean by lying to the compiler?</p>
<p>The compiler, or rather the type-system, is only aware of things that are known at compile-time. A "lie" would be to write code that communicates one thing at compile-time while doing something else at runtime. On the other hand, the more facts that we can truthfully state to the compiler at compile-time, the more useful the compiler can be. But first, let's see some concrete examples of lies.</p>
<h3 id="null">Null<a href="#null"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>When we say that some variable <code>x</code> is a string. What do we mean by that? It means that the runtime values that <code>x</code> can take are things "a", "ab", "abc", and many other reasonable strings. This also means that we can apply various methods to <code>x</code> like <code>substring</code> or <code>endsWith</code>. Unfortunately, in most modern languages this also means that at runtime it can be <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike the other non-null values, you cannot call <code>substring</code> or any other method on <code>null</code>. Calling a method on <code>null</code> will trigger an <code>NullPointerException</code>, possibly far away in code and time from where that <code>null</code> was created. We could adopt a policy of "defensive programming" checking for <code>null</code> every step of the way. But in practice nobody does that. Instead, in many places in our code we implicitly <em>assume</em> that values are non-null unless stated otherwise (in a comment that nobody actually reads).</p>
<p>This is one of the most common lies we tell the compiler. We state that something is a valid string, but at runtime it can just as well be <code>null</code>. In most mainstream languages the compiler cannot distinguish between nullable and non-nullable values. And so it cannot help us out when our nullability assumptions turn out to be wrong. That's when things crash.</p>
<p>How many times did you find yourself setting something to <code>null</code> because you couldn't come up with something better, only to discover that some other place starts crashing?</p>
<h3 id="exceptions">Exceptions<a href="#exceptions"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Speaking of crashing, another source of lies we tell the compiler are exceptions. More specifically, unchecked exceptions.</p>
<p>If we write that some method returns string, what do we mean by this? Ideally, we mean that every time we call the method a string value will be returned. But in reality, there's another, sneaky way of returning from a method: we can throw an exception.</p>
<p>Similar to <code>null</code>, unchecked exceptions might be discovered away from the origin (although not as bad as <code>null</code>, they have to walk up the stack, and are not stored as data). And similar to <code>null</code> the compiler won't track them for us. If we don't go into a full defensive mode, we're assuming that the code is exception-free, and assumptions tend to break over time. But we lied to the compiler, so it won't be there to help when they finally break.</p>
<p>How many times did you leave a comment on some branch of code stating "this CANNOT happen" and thrown an exception? Did you ever find yourself surprised when eventually it <em>did</em> happen? I know I did, since then I at least add some logs even if I think I'm sure that it really cannot happen.</p>
<h3 id="casts">Casts<a href="#casts"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>So far things happened by accident, due to implicit assumptions being broken. But sometimes we are smarter than the compiler. Sometimes we know better and we can force the compiler to obey. We can use type casting.</p>
<p>Suppose that there's some interface, let's call it <code>Animal</code>. And it has two different implementations: <code>Cat</code> and <code>Dog</code>. Sorry for the cliche example, it's difficult to be original without written code.</p>
<p>Now we are working on some code that got an <code>Animal</code> argument, call it <code>x</code>. In this particular flow we know for certain that <code>x</code> must be a <code>Dog</code>. We can follow the code ourselves and show that <code>x</code> is unquestionably a <code>Dog</code>. So we want to use <code>Dog</code>-specific methods. But the silly compiler won't let us. It only knows about <code>Animal</code> methods.</p>
<p>The compiler won't budge, and we won't budge. So we take out our hammer, and use a cast. Now <code>x</code> is a <code>Dog</code>, and the compiler doesn't argue anymore. All is well, until some new feature request that requires supporting <code>Cat</code>s in our flow. When we make the change, we forget about that cast we did a while ago to make things work, and the code explodes.</p>
<p>The compiler didn't help us because we silenced it by lying to it. There are two lies going on here, why wasn't the initial type precise enough? If we can see that it must be <code>Dog</code>, why weren't we able to show that to the compiler? Then there's the cast itself, which blatantly tells one thing to the compiler (<code>x</code> is a <code>Dog</code>), when the reality might be something else (<code>x</code> is a <code>Cat</code>).</p>
<p>How often do you think you know better than the compiler?</p>
<h3 id="side-effects">Side-Effects<a href="#side-effects"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Up until now the examples are quite obvious lies. We all feel a bit dirty when doing a cast, or throwing a runtime exception with the comment "this should NEVER happen". But here's a more subtle example.</p>
<p>Let's say there's a function called <code>foo</code>. When we see that <code>foo</code> takes no arguments and returns <code>void</code>, what can we say about what <code>foo</code> does without looking at its implementation? Nothing really. It's clearly doing something, and that something is not reflected in its inputs or outputs. We can only conclude that the function is doing some kind of side-effect, like changing a variable or writing to a file.</p>
<p>Just like us, the compiler doesn't know anything useful about <code>foo</code> either. So we have a function that is clearly doing something important, otherwise it won't be there. But all we tell the compiler is that "nope, move along, nothing interesting to see here". But that's a blatant lie, something interesting is going on here, but the type of <code>foo</code> doesn't reflect that.</p>
<p>The compiler gets so confused that even if we comment out a call to <code>foo</code> it won't complain, it's as if it doesn't even know it exists.</p>
<p>If you look at a typical codebase, many, many functions return void. Every time we do that we prevent the compiler from knowing something useful about the flow of the code.</p>
<p>With all these lies all over the place, it's no wonder that the compiler is not particularly useful. What happens if we stop lying to it?</p>
<h2 id="part-iii-no-more-lies">Part III: No More Lies<a href="#part-iii-no-more-lies"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>If we want develop a serious, constructive relationship with the compiler, we must first stop lying to it. Only then can we open channels for serious dialogue.</p>
<p>We are so used to using <code>null</code>, exceptions, casting, and side-effects, that at first sight it might seem impossible to give those up.</p>
<p>But that's just an illusion.</p>
<h3 id="null-1">Null<a href="#null-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Some languages like Rust and Haskell have no <code>null</code> at all. Can you imagine what it's like to work that way?</p>
<p>Liberating, that's how it feels. You no longer have to keep worrying about an accidental <code>null</code> slipping through, because there aren't any. But, you might ask, what if something <em>really is</em> missing, how do I represent that without <code>null</code>?</p>
<p>In a world without <code>null</code> there are a number of ways to represent a thing that might be missing. The most common one is to use something like an <code>Option</code> type, that can be in one of two states, present with a value, or missing. When you want say that a <code>String</code> might not exist you use the type "option-of-<code>String</code>". And that makes all the difference to the compiler.</p>
<p>Now the compiler knows what's going on, since option-of-<code>String</code> is a distinct type from just <code>String</code>, it's no longer possible to call <code>String</code> methods, like <code>substring</code>, on it. Every time you deal with an option-of-<code>String</code> value the compiler will helpfully remind you to deal with the possibility that the value is missing.</p>
<p>On the flip side of that, now every time you have a <code>String</code> value you no longer have to worry that it might be missing. You can just use it without any defensive programming involved. And if you mistakenly break the rules and try to assign an option value to a non-option value the compiler will point that out and force you to think whether that's what you really want and what the consequences across the codebase will be.</p>
<p>Some languages, like Typescript and Kotlin have builtin support for nullable values. If you mark a <code>String</code> as nullable, it will become a distinct type from a plain <code>String</code>, giving us similar benefits to <code>Option</code>. In Java we can emulate something similar with <code>Nullable</code> and <code>Nonnull</code> annotation. But that requires some additional tooling to make it work.</p>
<p>What all those approaches have in common is that all of them involve the compiler. Instead of hiding our assumptions from the compiler we make them explicit in a way that the type-system can track.</p>
<p>We can do the same with exceptions.</p>
<h3 id="exceptions-1">Exceptions<a href="#exceptions-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>I'm personally not aware of languages that completely remove exceptions from the language. But working mostly without exceptions, at least as a convention, is definitely possible.</p>
<p>Inspired by the <code>null</code> case, we can take a similar approach with exceptions and make them explicit in our types.</p>
<p>The most common way to do that is to use another container type like <code>Result</code> or <code>Try</code>. A return type like "result-of-<code>String</code>" means that we can have one of two cases, either a success with a <code>String</code> value, or a failure with some exception.</p>
<p>This approach makes it explicit to both us and the compiler what's going in a function. Now the compiler can track possible errors for us, and force us to deal with them as appropriate. And if we change some piece of code from <code>String</code> to "result-of-<code>String</code>", the compiler will helpfully shows where this needs to be handled.</p>
<p>In Java we can take an alternative approach and use checked exceptions. But industry experience over the years seems to indicate that people don't enjoy using them. It's probably a matter of ergonomics. Using a wrapper type instead might be a more ergonomic alternative.</p>
<p>While avoiding nulls and exceptions is fairly straightforward, casts can be trickier.</p>
<h3 id="casts-1">Casts<a href="#casts-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Unless forced to by some external library, I think that the presence of casts in our code should be considered a design smell. My first (possibly controversial) suggestion would be to configure your tooling to just forbid them by default.</p>
<p>When feeling the need to use a cast, we should consider whether the current design is doing a good job of reflecting our intentions. Recall that when doing a cast we can ask one of two questions, why was the type not precise enough to begin with? And why do we need to cast here?</p>
<p>There's no generic answer to these questions, but finding a good answer to either of them will make the compiler's life easier.</p>
<p>Some times the solution would be to add more methods on a parent interface (like <code>Animal</code>). Some times you might discover that you could've started out with the more specific type (<code>Dog</code>, for example) from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Another class of solutions is to remodel the problem from using open interfaces to using sealed/union types. Many modern languages support them. Using sealed types retains some of the flexibility of using open interfaces, but still allows the compiler to be in the loop. Instead of blindly assuming that some case is true, we can safely match on the sealed type and the compiler will gladly inform us about all the cases we must handle at this point. Some languages can even magically auto-complete all the relevant cases.</p>
<p>As code evolves, the compiler will keep track of the cases over time. And if something changed in the sealed type, the compiler will tell us about all the locations where the new case should be handled. Giving us a chance to handle whatever new logic that was added, before it crashes at runtime. Something that it was powerless to do when you used a plain cast.</p>
<p>Now for the thorniest issue of them all.</p>
<h3 id="side-effects-1">Side-Effects<a href="#side-effects-1"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Software exists to make side-effects, otherwise we would just have overheating boxes without any useful output. So side-effects cannot be completely eliminated from code. But they can be better managed.</p>
<p>This is even a deeper design issue than casting, and there isn't a one size fits all solution. My suggestion would be to separate as much pure computation from side-effects as possible.</p>
<p>In practical terms that would mean that every time you see a void return, or something that performs some side-effects mixed with other useful computation, you try to extract a pure function, with well-defined inputs and outputs, that only does computation, and another function that does the side-effects (similar to the Command Query Separation principle).</p>
<p>A common pattern would be to separate pure business logic from data fetching/writing. So instead of intertwining database calls with computation, you split into three separate phases: fetch, compute, store (a tiny ETL). First fetch all the data you need from a database, then you pass it to a (pure) function that produces some output, then pass the output of the pure function to a store procedure.</p>
<p>Now instead of having one big flow that takes no inputs and produces no outputs, you have three building blocks, and one of them has well-defined inputs and outputs. Not only is having this separation makes it easier to focus on your business logic, especially when writing tests. But now that we have inputs and outputs the compiler can follow along as well and help out.</p>
<p>Taking these ideas seriously leads us toward architectures that are known as "functional core, imperative shell". Within the functional core the compiler is much more useful, because it has actual types for inputs and outputs that it can follow and enforce. More "interesting stuff" is happening within the knowledge of the compiler.</p>
<p>Let's see what happens when we maximize that knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="part-iv-the-compiler-as-our-friend">Part IV: The Compiler as Our Friend<a href="#part-iv-the-compiler-as-our-friend"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2>
<p>Okay, so we stopped lying to the compiler as much as we can, and we are already seeing some gains in safety. No more null pointers, surprising exceptions, or fragile code. We can stop here and pat ourselves on our backs.</p>
<p>But we can do even better. Not lying is just the first step in a productive relationship. The next step would be to start sharing knowledge. The simplest way to start doing that is to sprinkle our code with more types.</p>
<h3 id="typed-wrappers">Typed wrappers<a href="#typed-wrappers"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>When we use a string or an int in our code, what do they actually mean? Rarely is it just an arbitrary number or some raw text. Usually they represent some concept like a user ID or a file name. The thing is that this special meaning of the int or string are not reflected anywhere outside our head, or maybe a comment.</p>
<p>As time goes by we have more and more different meanings that an int can take in our system. Maybe it's an app ID, or a post ID, or a feed ID? Who knows. And so confusion arises, you start mixing up your ints, weird bugs creep up.</p>
<p>While this is happening, the compiler remains silent, "an int is an int, what can you do...". We didn't share our knowledge with the compiler, we have no one to blame.</p>
<p>The fix is simple: use small, typed wrappers, sometimes called "tiny types". Each concept you have in your system deserves to have a unique type, something for the compiler to hold on to. So you would have a <code>UserID</code> type, an <code>AppID</code> type, and so on. Underneath they might all be simple ints, but now both you and, more importantly, the compiler can distinguish the different concepts in code.</p>
<p>The difference might seem small, but the consequences are far reaching. Extra safety, the compiler will no longer let us confuse the different ints, is just the beginning.</p>
<p>Once the compiler gained knowledge of a concept you can use it for various tasks. For example, suppose you want to find out where are all the usages of user IDs in code. If we were still using ints, asking the compiler for all usages of the type int is meaningless, there are too many of those and they mean different things. Searching variable names is easy, but the results might not be complete. But if we have a dedicated type for <code>UserID</code>, that's easy, just ask your editor to find usages of the type and you get the precise results you need. The compiler keeps track.</p>
<p>For the same reasons, refactoring becomes easy. You want to change the representation of the <code>UserID</code>? Add some extra salt for security? No need to search for all the relevant ints and pray for the best. Modify the type and follow the compilation errors. Done.</p>
<p>Need some special validation for user IDs? Hide the constructor of <code>UserID</code>, add an alternative "smart" constructor, follow compilation errors. Done. No need to chase different ints across the system.</p>
<p>And for us humans, descriptive, domain-specific types make function signatures more readable, both for developers and for the occasional stakeholder. What's not to like about it?</p>
<p>Simple typed wrappers are, well, simple. But sometimes we need more sophisticated types to express ourselves to the compiler.</p>
<h3 id="union-types">Union Types<a href="#union-types"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>Did you ever stumble on a class <code>Foo</code> that has too many fields with a long comment that explains something along the lines of "if field <code>a</code> is <code>true</code> then fields <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> must not be <code>null</code>". And so on and so forth for a few more different conditions?</p>
<p>Then when you actually start trusting <code>Foo</code>'s comment and check that <code>a</code> is <code>true</code>, you discover, with a production null pointer exception, that <code>b</code> was actually <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>To describe this more formally, <code>Foo</code> had some invariants, and those invariants were violated. Not every combination of field values makes sense for our application.</p>
<p>How much nicer it would if the compiler could tell us "hey, look here, this invariant breaks if you use this set of field values"? Unfortunately, most compilers are incapable of expressing invariants that depend in such a way on runtime values.</p>
<p>The solution to many such problems is to remodel the type to better reflect the invariants that we want to encode, in such a way that the compiler will be able to follow along and only allow for legal combinations.</p>
<p>One of the most versatile tools for this is to use union, or sealed types (enums in some languages). With a union type we create one variant per case. And each case can only have a legal combination of values. So the case where <code>a</code> is true will become one variant with two non-nullable fields <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>. And that's it.</p>
<p>The advantage of taking this approach is that the union type doesn't even allow us to write down an invalid combination. You can only choose from valid ones, anything else is a compilation error.</p>
<p>The way you work with union types is that every time you need to access some data you need to match on the value. And then you act according to the case you're on. If you're in case <code>a</code>, you're <em>guaranteed</em> to have the <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> values. The compiler makes sure they are consistently there no matter how you got to this point of code.</p>
<p>This can make union types more powerful than tests that check invariants. Unlike a unit test, which can only test for a specific code paths you currently know about, the compiler can track <em>all</em> code paths, now and forever.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, in some languages the compiler can auto-complete the different cases relevant for the point in code you're at. Sometimes it feels like the code is writing itself, you just have to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>When the code evolves over time and more cases are added, the compiler will notify you about all the relevant places where you need to update the logic to handle new cases. This is a great way to assess the consequences of changes you're about to make and help you with decisions at the design phase.</p>
<p>Using union types this way is a great way to model alternative states in code, and it's part of a more general approach to programming where you strive to "make illegal states unrepresentable". That is, encode your invariants as facts that the compiler can enforce and makes it impossible to even <em>write</em> code that will break those invariants.</p>
<p>This opens up a whole new way of approaching types.</p>
<h3 id="typed-guarantees">Typed Guarantees<a href="#typed-guarantees"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3>
<p>We are used to think about types as just a way to distinguish different values. This one's a string, that one an int. But as we rely more on the compiler to help us we can start thinking about types as guarantees that we want from the type-system. Or facts that we expect to hold, and that the compiler should verify <em>for</em> us.</p>
<p>A common scenario is that we want to make sure that the list we got as an argument contains at least one item. A classic example is when we need to compute some average, it's undefined for empty lists. Or choose a payment method in a payments system, you must have at least one to be able to proceed.</p>
<p>What we could do is revert to defensive programming, check the list before proceeding, and throw an exception if it's empty. But being defensive all the time is tedious (and eventually you forget about it), and we are back to lying to the compiler. Instead, we can signal our intentions with a type: <code>NonEmptyList</code>, a list type that cannot be even constructed without at least one element (some languages have it builtin, but it's also easy to implement in a library).</p>
<p>Not only does this communicate our intent to our callers better than any comment can do, but it also forces the compiler to make sure that nobody can call us with an illegal value. Once we encoded a guarantee as a type, we don't have to worry about it anymore. No defensive programming, no need to write extra tests for it. No more fear that some future refactor will break our invariants.</p>
<p>Once we start thinking about guarantees the compiler can make for us, the opportunities are endless. You can come up with a type for pretty much anything (within reason):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>PositiveNumber</code>, how much code that we write would be invalid if it got a negative number?</li>
<li><code>AgeOver18</code>, maybe it's mission critical to limit certain flows based on user data</li>
<li><code>SortedByPriority</code>, because it might be expensive to re-sort stuff just to be defensive</li>
</ul>
<p>And the list goes on, for almost any kind of custom validation logic you might want. Some can be encoded with union types, some might require techniques like smart constructors. You don't have to get too fancy for this to become a valuable tool.</p>
<p>Once you start sprinkling these types around, not only is the intent of the code becomes clearer, but the compiler can help verify that everything is consistent, and that any new code knows what it's required to do.</p>
<p>With enough types in place you might get the feeling that "if it compiles, ship it".</p>

<p>In the prologue we saw what I think is a fairly common story, <code>null</code> unexpectedly crashing a production system. But we can make this story very concrete. I'm sure that many of us felt the Google Cloud outage in June 2025. So many services around the world were affected that it was very hard to miss.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/ow5i3PPK96RduMcb1SsW" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">incident report</a> we learn that the root cause of it all was a <code>null</code> value where it was unexpected (along with some other operational compounding issues, like a lack of randomized backoff). And it's not really surprising. We saw that <code>null</code>s are lies that we tell the compiler, values that it cannot track for us. In a large enough system, you are bound to lose track of them.</p>
<p>With the lessons that we learned, can we imagine another outcome? An outcome that doesn't involve a big chunk of the internet crashing?</p>
<p>So we already know that using <code>null</code> is lying to the compiler. If we are motivated enough we will never use a <code>null</code> in our code, opting instead for something that the compiler can track, an option-like type. The first step of not lying to the compiler might be the most difficult one, but once we take it a whole new world opens up for us.</p>
<p>The incident report mentions some "unintended blank fields" in <code>Policy</code> datatype that triggered the whole thing. Although I don't know the actual details, let's imagine that those fields used to be non-empty and now we want to open the possibility for making them empty. But we no longer have <code>null</code> at our disposal, what do we do? We change the type of the fields to be "option-of-X", and run the compiler. This is where the magic of dialogue starts to shine.</p>
<p>In a large codebase and a central entity like <code>Policy</code> you can imagine that you'll have many compilation errors the moment you set some fields to be optional. That sounds scary, but that's way better than <code>null</code> silently propagating all over the code and not knowing the consequences. With the compilation errors you now have a full report of all the code sites you need to reconsider.</p>
<p>You start going over them, one by one, fixing the errors. But the more errors you fix the more you feel that something's not right. Adapting the code feels like too much effort, too hacky, "a maze of twisty little ifs, all alike". That's the compiler trying to tell you something:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you need to reconsider the design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's what you do, with all those changes that you had to make it becomes more obvious that these are not just fields that you made optional, what you really did is uncover a new flow in the system, with new rules. In the old flow the fields really are mandatory, in the new flow they are no longer needed. So you combined the two flows and made the fields optional. But by just setting the fields to be options the new flow becomes implicit in a combination of empty values and flags, something that the compiler can't track, and is not apparent when reading the code.</p>
<p>Instead of riding on the existing flow and tweaking it, you can make things explicit and turn <code>Policy</code> into a union type. If it already was a union, you add another case to describe the new flow, and you compile again. There are still many compilation errors, matches that are incomplete, but now they are telling you something different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you want to support this new flow, here are all the things you need to consider</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's what you do reviewing the compilation errors and figuring out what the new flow implies at each site. Maybe along the way you discover that the new <code>Policy</code> type requires different validations that you didn't think of before. As a result in the new <code>Policy</code> you start using a <code>NonEmptyList</code> of <code>AvailabilityZone</code>s which guarantees that you can't run the new flow without at least one applicable <code>AvailabilityZone</code>. (Of course <code>AvailabilityZone</code> is not some plain string, you have a dedicated type that tells you exactly what it means and gets validates accordingly.)</p>
<p>You compile again and somewhere along the edges of the system where you process user input the compiler tells you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Listen, I don't have any way to prove that you actually have at least on availability zone provided by the user</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the compiler is right, if you were just using a regular list to represent the availability zones you would've missed this. Input processing happens far away from where we actually require the availability zones to not be empty and your unit tests missed this. So you add the appropriate user input validation. And lo and behold, it compiles. Ship it!</p>
<p>Yes, you struggled with the compiler, and yes it took some time. But guess who's getting good night's sleep tonight?</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>France intends to follow Australia and ban social media platforms for children from the start of the 2026 academic year.</p><p>A draft bill preventing under-15s from using social media will be submitted for legal checks and is expected to be debated in parliament early in the new year.</p><p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has made it clear in recent weeks that he wants France to swiftly follow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/12/australia-teen-social-media-ban-launch-test-to-come" data-link-name="in body link">Australia’s world-first ban on social media platforms for under-16s</a>, which came into force in December. It includes Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube.</p><p><a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/pixels/article/2025/12/31/le-gouvernement-veut-interdire-les-reseaux-sociaux-aux-moins-de-15-ans-des-la-rentree-2026_6660160_4408996.html" data-link-name="in body link">Le Monde</a> and <a href="https://www.franceinfo.fr/internet/reseaux-sociaux/info-franceinfo-le-projet-de-loi-pour-interdire-les-reseaux-sociaux-aux-moins-de-15-ans-est-pret-et-sera-examine-debut-janvier_7712140.html" data-link-name="in body link">France Info</a> reported on Wednesday that a draft bill was now complete and contained two measures: a ban on social media for under-15s and a ban on mobile phones in high schools, where 15- to 18-year-olds study. Phones have already been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/22/mobile-phones-french-school-ban" data-link-name="in body link">banned in primary and middle schools</a>.</p><p>The bill will be submitted to France’s Conseil d’État for legal review in the coming days. Education unions will also look at the proposed high-school ban on phones.</p><p>The government wants the social media ban to come into force from September 2026.</p><p>Le Monde reported the text of the draft bill cited “the risks of excessive screen use by teenagers”, including the dangers of being exposed to inappropriate social media content, online bullying, and altered sleep patterns. The bill states the need to “protect future generations” from dangers that threaten their ability to thrive and live together in a society with shared values.</p><figure id="f426a266-c8a3-4874-88c6-e61f34ba626d" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:7,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Will other countries follow Australia’s social media ban for under-16s?&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;f426a266-c8a3-4874-88c6-e61f34ba626d&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/dec/13/will-other-countries-follow-australia-social-media-ban-under-16s&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:0,&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0}}"></gu-island></figure><p>Earlier this month, Macron confirmed at a public debate in Saint Malo that he wanted a social media ban for young teenagers. He said there was “consensus being shaped” on the issue after Australia introduced its ban. “The more screen time there is, the more school achievement drops … the more screen time there is, the more mental health problems go up,” he said.</p><p>He used the analogy of a teenager getting into a Formula One racing car before they had learned to drive. “If a child is in a Formula One car and they turn on the engine, I don’t want them to win the race, I just want them to get out of the car. I want them to learn the highway code first, and to ensure the car works, and to teach them to drive in a different car.”</p><p>Several other countries are considering social media bans for under-15s after Australia’s ban including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/07/danish-pm-plans-to-ban-social-media-for-under-15s-warning-it-is-stealing-childhood" data-link-name="in body link">Denmark</a>, whose government hopes to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/07/danish-pm-plans-to-ban-social-media-for-under-15s-warning-it-is-stealing-childhood" data-link-name="in body link">introduce a ban in 2026</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/23/norway-to-increase-minimum-age-limit-on-social-media-to-15-to-protect-children" data-link-name="in body link">Norway</a>. Malaysia is also planning a social media ban for under-16s from 2026. In the UK, the Labour government has not ruled out a ban, saying “nothing is off the table” but any ban must be “based on robust evidence”.</p><p>Anne Le Hénanff, the French minister in charge of digital development and artificial intelligence, told <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/politique/on-veut-aller-vite-anne-le-henanff-ministre-du-numerique-annonce-un-projet-de-loi-pour-interdire-les-reseaux-sociaux-avant-15-ans-19-12-2025-WZH4KUCI7RDZBKNVVBC3H4AVWU.php" data-link-name="in body link">Le Parisien</a> this month that the social media ban for under-15s was a government priority, and that the bill would be “short and compatible with European law”, namely the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) – regulation intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation.</p><p>The social media ban is part of Macron’s attempt to shape his legacy as he enters his difficult final year as president with a divided parliament.</p><p>On 23 December, last-minute legislation was passed to keep the government in business into January after parliament failed to agree a full budget for 2026. Attempts to agree a budget will resume next month.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/sep/11/lawmaker-calls-for-french-criminal-investigation-into-tiktok" data-link-name="in body link">French parliamentary inquiry</a> into TikTok’s psychological effects concluded in September that the platform was like a “slow poison” to children. The co-head of the inquiry, the centrist lawmaker Laure Miller, told France Info that TikTok was an “ocean of harmful content” that was very visible to children through algorithms that kept them in a bubble. TikTok responded that it was being unfairly scapegoated for “industry-wide and societal challenges”.</p><p>The French parliament report recommended more broadly that children under 15 in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france" data-link-name="in body link">France</a> should be banned entirely from using social media, and those between 15 and 18 should face a night-time “digital curfew”, meaning social media would be made unavailable to them between 10pm and 8am.</p><p>The inquiry was set up after a 2024 French lawsuit against TikTok by seven families who accused it of exposing their children to content that was pushing them towards ending their lives.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
      <hy-paragraph-text variant="news" placement="external">
        
                    <p>A new method to capture carbon dioxide from the air has been developed at the University of Helsinki's chemistry department.</p>
<p>The method developed by Postdoctoral Researcher <ds-link ds-href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/fi/persons/zahra-eshaghi-gorji/" ds-text="Zahra Eshaghi Gorji" ds-weight="bold"></ds-link><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is based on a compound of superbase and alcohol. Tests done in professor <ds-link ds-href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/fi/persons/timo-repo/" ds-text="Timo Repo’s" ds-weight="bold"></ds-link> group show that the compound appears promising: one gram of the compound can absorb 156 milligrams of carbon dioxide directly from untreated ambient air. However, the compound does not react with nitrogen, oxygen or other atmospheric gases. Capasity clearly outperforms the CO<sub>2</sub> capture methods currently in use.</p>
<p>The CO<sub>2</sub> captured by the compound can be released by heating the compound at 70 °C in 30 minutes. Clean CO<sub>2</sub> is recovered and can be recycled.</p>
<p>The ease of releasing CO<sub>2</sub> is the key advantage of the new compound. In current compounds, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> typically requires heat above 900 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;</p>
<p>– In addition, the compound can be used multiple times: the compound retained 75 percent of its original capacity after 50 cycles, and 50 percent after 100 cycles.</p>
<p>Non-toxic and cost-effective</p>
<p>The new compound was discovered by experimenting with a number of bases in different compounds, says Eshagi Gorji. The experiments lasted more than a year in total.</p>
<p>The most promising base proved to be <em>1,5,7-triazabicyclo [4.3.0] non-6-ene&nbsp;</em>(TBN), developed at in the professor <ds-link ds-href="https://www.helsinki.fi/fi/tutustu-meihin/ihmiset/henkilohaku/ilkka-kilpelainen-9027543" ds-text="Ilkka Kilpeläinen’s" ds-weight="bold"></ds-link> group, which was combined with benzyl alcohol to produce the final compound.</p>
<p>– None of the components is expensive to produce, Eshaghi Gorji points out. In addition, the fluid is non-toxic.</p>
<p>The compound will now be tested in pilot plants at a near-industrial scale, rather than in grams. A solid version of the liquid compound must be made for this purpose.</p>
<p>– The idea is to bind the compound to compounds such as silica and graphene oxide, which promotes the interaction with carbon dioxide.</p>

I am in love with the mysterious transcendental numbers.
Did you know that there
are "more" transcendental numbers than the more familiar 
algebraic ones?  Even so, only a few classes of transcendental numbers are widley known 
to humans, and it's very difficult to prove that a particular
number is transcendental.  
In 1844, math genius Joseph Liouville (1809-1882) 
 was the first to prove the existence of transcendental
 numbers. 
 (More precisely, he was the first to prove that a specific number was 
transcendental.)
 
Hermite proved that the number <i>e</i>
was transcendental in 1873. Lindeman proved that pi was transcendental in 1882.
For more information, see my book
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/noodlead.html">Wonders
of Numbers</a>
from
which this is excerpted.

<p><img width="150" height="100" src="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/ant.jpg">          The mathematical constant pi represents
the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its
diameter. It is the most famous ratio in mathematics both on Earth and
probably for any advanced civilization in the universe.  The number pi,
like other fundamental constants of mathematics such as e = 2.718...,
is a transcendental number. The digits of pi and e never end, nor has
anyone detected an orderly pattern in their arrangement.  Humans know
the value of pi to over a trillion digits.
</p><p>
    Transcendental numbers cannot be expressed as the root of any
algebraic equation with rational coefficients.  This means that pi
could not exactly satisfy equations of the type: pi<sup>2</sup> = 10, or
9pi<sup>4</sup> -
240pi<sup>2</sup>  + 1492 = 0. These are equations involving simple integers with
powers of pi. The numbers pi and e can be expressed as an endless
continued fraction or as the limit of an infinite series. The
remarkable fraction 355/113 expresses pi accurately to six decimal
places.
</p><p>
In 1882, German mathematician F. Lindemann proved that
pi
is transcendental, finally putting an end to 2,500 years
of speculation.
In effect, he proved that
pi
transcends the power of algebra to display it in its totality.
It can't be expressed in any finite series of arithmetical or
algebraic operations.  Using a fixed-size font, it can't be written on a piece of paper
as big as the universe.
</p><p>
I also talk about all the mysteries of pi in my
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/bookscp.html">book</a> <i>Keys to Infinity</i>.

</p><p>
     Many of you have probably heard of pi and e.  But are there other
famous transcendental numbers?  After conducting a brief survey of
readers, I made a list of the fifteen most famous
transcendental numbers.   Can you list these in order of relative fame
and/or usage?

</p></div><ol>
<li>
pi = 3.1415 ...
</li><li>
e = 2.718 ...
</li><li>Euler's constant,
gamma = 0.577215 ...
= lim n -&gt; infinity &gt; (1 + 1/2 + 1/3
+ 1/4 + ... + 1/n - ln(n))
(Not proven to be transcendental, but generally believed to be
by mathematicians.)

</li><li>Catalan's constant,
G = sum  (-1)^k / (2k + 1 )^2 =
1 - 1/9 + 1/25 - 1/49 + ...

(Not proven to be transcendental, but generally believed to be
by mathematicians.)

</li><li>Liouville's number
0.110001000000000000000001000 ...
which has a one in the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 24th, etc. places and zeros
elsewhere.

</li><li>Chaitin's "constant", the probability that a random
algorithm halts.  (Noam Elkies of Harvard notes that not only is this
number
transcendental but it is also incomputable.)

</li><li>Chapernowne's
number, 0.12345678910111213141516171819202122232425...
This is constructed by concatenating the digits of the positive
integers.
(Can you see the pattern?)

</li><li>Special values of the zeta function, such as
zeta (3).
(Transcendental functions can usually be expected to give
transcendental results at rational points.)

</li><li>
ln(2).

</li><li>Hilbert's number,
2<sup>(sqrt 2 )</sup>.
(This is called Hilbert's number because the proof of whether or
not it is transcendental was one of Hilbert's
famous problems.
In fact, according to the Gelfond-Schneider theorem, any number
of the form
a<sup>b</sup>
is transcendental where
a
and
b
are algebraic
(a ne 0, a ne 1 )
and
b
is not a rational number.
Many
trigonometric or hyperbolic functions of non-zero algebraic numbers
are transcendental.)

</li><li>
e<sup>pi</sup>

</li><li>
pi<sup>e</sup>
(Not proven to be transcendental, but generally believed to be
by mathematicians.)

</li><li>Morse-Thue's number, 0.01101001 ...

</li><li>
i<sup>i</sup> = 0.207879576... 
(Here
i
is the imaginary number
sqrt(-1).  Isn't this a real beauty?  How many people have actually
considered rasing i to the i power?
If
a
is algebraic and
b
is algebraic but irrational
then
a<sup>b</sup>
is transcendental.  Since
i
is algebraic but irrational, the theorem applies.
Note also:
i<sup>i</sup>
is equal to
e<sup>(- pi / 2 )</sup>
and several other values.
Consider
i<sup>i</sup> = e<sup>(i log i )</sup> =
e<sup>( i times i pi / 2 )</sup> .
Since log is multivalued, there are other possible values for
i<sup>i</sup>.
<br>Here is how you can compute the value of i<sup>i</sup> = 0.207879576... 
<blockquote>
1. Since e^(ix) = Cos x + i Sin x, then let x = Pi/2.
<br>
2. Then e^(iPi/2) = i = Cos Pi/2 + i Sin Pi/2; since Cos Pi/2 = Cos 
90 deg. = 0. But Sin 90 = 1 and i Sin 90 deg. = (i)*(1) = i.
<br>
3. Therefore e^(iPi/2) = i.
<br>
4. Take the ith power of both sides, the right side being i^i and 
the 
left side = [e^(iPi/2)]^i = e^(-Pi/2).
<br>
5. Therefore i^i = e^(-Pi/2) = .207879576... 
</blockquote>



</li><li>Feigenbaum numbers, e.g.
4.669 ... .
(These are related to properties of dynamical systems with
period-doubling.  The ratio of successive differences between
period-doubling bifurcation parameters approaches the number
4.669 ... ,
and it has been discovered in many physical systems before
they enter the chaotic regime.  It has not been proven
to be transcendental, but is generally believed to be.)
</li></ol>
Long ago, Keith Briggs from the Mathematics Department of the
University of Melbourne in Australia
computed what he believed to be the world-record
for the number of digits for the Feigenbaum number:
<blockquote>
4.
669201609102990671853203820466201617258185577475768632745651

</blockquote>
Briggs carried out the computation using special-purpose
software designed by David Bailey of NASA Ames running
on an IBM RISC System/6000.  The computation required a few
hours of computation time.
<p>
Today, we know far more digits for the Feigenbaum constant.  See <a href="http://converge.to/feigenbaum/">this page</a>
for more than 10,000 digits.

</p><h3>Ants and Transcendental Numbers</h3>
<img width="150" height="100" src="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/ant.jpg"> Imagine  a race of talking ants.
    The ants can compress
the infinite digits of
pi
in an interesting way.  For example, let us
imagine that the ants can speak by manipulating their crude jaws.
The first ant in the long parade of ants screams out the first
digit,
"3".  The next yells the number on its back, a
"1". The
next yells a "4", and so on.  Further imagine that each ant
speaks its digit in
only half the time of the preceding ant.  Each ant has a turn to
speak.  Only the most recent digit is spoken at any instant.  If
the first digit of
pi
requires 30
seconds to speak (due to the ant's cumbersome jaws and little
brain), might the entire ant colony will speak <i>all</i> the
digits of
pi
in
a minute?
(Again, this
is because
the infinite
sum
1/2 minute + 1/4 minute + 1/8 minute + ...
is equal to 1 minute.)

    Astoundingly, at the end of the minute, might there be a
quick-talking ant that will actually say the "last" digit of
pi?
The geometer God, upon
hearing this last digit, may cry, "That's impossible,
because
pi
has no last digit!" <br>(See below for an email from Brian B. on the talking ants.)
<p> Here are some nice web pages on transcendental numbers:

</p><p>

 
Here is a
<a href="https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pickover/noodlead.html">book</a> on transcendental numbers.

</p><h3>Dottie Number</h3>

Dottie number is the unique real root of cosx = x (namely, the unique real fixed point of the cosine function), which is 0.739085...
<br>
<img src="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/images/eps-gif/CosineFixedPoint_800.gif">
<br>
Dottie noticed that whenever she typed a number into her calculator and pressed the cosine button repeatedly, the result always converged to this value.
Wow. The number is well-known, having appeared in numerous elementary works on algebra already by the late 1880s.
The Dottie number is transcendental as a consequence of the the Lindemann-Weierstrass theorem. 
This text about Dottie is adpoted from <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DottieNumber.html">MathWorld</a>.

<h3>Comments from Colleagues on <br>
Their Passion for Transcendental Numbers</h3>

RM Mentock comments:
<blockquote>
Although they are not often recognized as such even by mathematicians,
there are a lot of commonly-used numbers that are also transcendental,
which can easily be shown by the Gelfond-Schneider theorem mentioned
in the tenth item on the list.  If a is algebraic, and c is algebraic,
and b = logarithm (base a) of c is not rational, then b must be
transcendental or else the theorem would imply that c must be
transcendental--a contradiction.  Then, with a=10 and c=2, the log of
two, base ten, is transcendental, and so is any base ten logarithm of
any rational number other than rational powers of ten.  The same holds
for any other rational logarithm base--so there are a lot of transcendental
numbers that are in common use.  Or they were forty years ago, before
handheld calculators!
    <p>
I'd also like to point out that any number can be used to produce a
transcendental by using Liouville's algorithm (see item number five).  If
the number is terminating, convert it to non-terminating by subtracting one
from the last digit, and adding an infinite string of 9's to the end.  Then
just put each of its digits where Liouville puts a one, even if the digit is
zero.  The result will be a transcendental number.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Brian B. comments on the talking ants above:</p><blockquote>
On your transcendental number page (https://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/Pickover/trans.html), you say: "Astoundingly, at the end of the minute, there will be a quick-talking ant that will actually say the 'last' digit of pi!"

 

This is not correct. There is no last ant in an infinite line of ants, just as there's no last digit of pi. 
This can be seen easily by having all the ants announce their digit at exactly the same time.
It takes zero seconds to say all the digits, but there is still no last digit, or last ant. 
Or forget about the ants entirely and just have each digit announce itself at the same moment.
 Still no last digit, though, just like there's no end to the natural numbers.

 

I hope you'll fix this on your page. I think it would probably be best just to remove the entire "ant" section. Thanks.

<p><em><strong>Industrial</strong></em></p>
<p><em>adj. (sense 3a)</em></p>
<p>Of or relating to productive work, trade, or manufacture, esp. mechanical industry or large-scale manufacturing; (
also) resulting from such industry.</p>
<p>—<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For most of its history, software has been closer to craft than manufacture: costly, slow, and dominated by the need for
skills and experience. AI coding is changing that, by making available paths of production which are cheaper, faster,
and increasingly disconnected from the expertise of humans.</p>
<p>I have written previously about how <a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/09/28/the-ai-coding-trap">AI coding can be a trap</a>
for today’s practitioners, offering shortcuts to incomplete solutions at the expense of the understanding needed for
sustainable development practices. But as we collectively address the shortcomings of our current toolset, it is clear
that we are heading into a world in which the production of software is becoming increasingly automated.</p>
<p>What happens to software when its production undergoes an <em>industrial revolution</em>?</p>
<h2>Software as a disposable commodity</h2>
<p>Traditionally, software has been expensive to produce, with expense driven largely by the labour costs of a highly
skilled and specialised workforce. This workforce has also constituted a bottleneck for the possible scale of
production, making software a valuable commodity to produce effectively.</p>
<p>Industrialisation of production, in any field, seeks to address both of these limitations at once, by using automation
of processes to reduce the reliance on human labour, both lowering costs and also allowing greater scale and elasticity
of production. Such changes relegate the human role to oversight, quality control, and optimisation of the industrial
process.</p>
<p>The first order effect of this change is a disruption in the supply chain of high quality, working products. Labour is
disintermediated, barriers to entry are lowered, competition rises, and rate of change accelerates. All of these effects
are starting to be in evidence today, with the traditional software industry grappling with the ramifications.</p>
<p>A second order effect of such industrialisation is to enable additional ways to produce low quality, low cost products
at high scale. Examples from other fields include:</p>
<ul>
<li>industrialisation of printing processes led to paperback genre fiction</li>
<li>industrialisation of agriculture led to ultraprocessed junk food</li>
<li>industrialisation of digital image sensors led to user-generated video</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of software, the industrialisation of production is giving rise to a new class of software artefact, which
we might term <em>disposable software</em>: software created with no durable expectation of ownership, maintenance, or
long-term understanding.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-1.svg" alt="Where traditional software is high cost and high value, disposable software is low cost and low value." title="Where traditional software is high cost and high value, AI disposable software is low cost and low value."></p>
<p>Advocates might refer to this as <em>vibe-coded software</em>, and sceptics will invariably talk about <em>AI slop</em>. Regardless of
its merits, it is clear that the economics of this class of software are quite different, as each software output has
less economic value, due to its easy reproducibility. This lack of perceived value might tempt you to dismiss the trend as
a passing fad, but this would be unwise. To understand why, we need to consider the historical precedents for
commoditisation of previously scarce goods.</p>
<h2>Jevons paradox and the addictive nature of slop</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox">Jevons paradox</a>
is an old bit of economic theory that has been much quoted recently. The observation dates to the
nineteenth century, noting that improved efficiency in coal consumption would lead to lower costs, fueling higher
demand, and ultimately resulting in higher overall coal consumption.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-2.svg" alt="Jevons paradox describes how increased efficiency can result in higher overall consumption." title="Jevons paradox describes how increased efficiency can result in higher overall consumption."></p>
<p>This is relevant today, because we are seeing the same surge in demand for AI compute: as models become more efficient
at token prediction, demand is surging and results in ever greater consumption. Will the same effect ripple through
software development itself, with lower cost of effort driving higher consumption and output? History suggests it will.</p>
<p>Consider the industrialisation of agriculture. In the early twentieth century, scientific advances were expected to
eradicate hunger and usher in an era of abundant, nourishing food. Instead, hunger and famine persist. In 2025, there
are <a href="https://www.wfp.org/ending-hunger">318 million people experiencing acute hunger</a>, even in countries with an
agricultural surplus. Meanwhile, in the wealthiest nations, industrial food systems have produced abundance of a
different kind: the United States has an adult obesity rate of 40% and a growing diabetes crisis. Ultraprocessed foods
are widely recognised as harmful,
yet <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8408879/">the overwhelming majority of Americans consume them each day</a>.</p>
<p>Industrial systems reliably create economic pressure toward excess, low quality goods. This is not because producers are
careless, but because
once production is cheap enough, junk is what maximises volume, margin, and reach. The result is not abundance of the
best things, but overproduction of the most consumable ones. And consume them we do.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-3.svg" alt="The economic pressure of industrialisation will drive adoption of disposable software." title="The economic pressure of industrialisation will drive adoption of disposable software."></p>
<p>Our appetite for AI slop is likely to be similarly insatiable. The adoption curve we’ve seen so far may pale beside what
happens when disposable software production becomes truly mainstream. If the democratisation of software mirrors the
impact of ubiquitous photo, video, and audio capture enabled by the smartphone, we may see user-generated software
created, shared, and discarded at social-media scale. Should that happen, the feedback loops of novelty and reward will
drive an explosion of software output that makes the past half-century of development look quaint by comparison.</p>
<h2>Will traditional software survive?</h2>
<p>Ultraprocessed foods are, of course, not the only game in town. There is a thriving and growing demand for healthy,
sustainable production of foodstuffs, largely in response to the harmful effects of industrialisation. Is it possible
that software might also resist mechanisation through the growth of an “organic software” movement? If we look at other
sectors, we see that even those with the highest levels of industrialisation also still benefit from small-scale,
human-led production as part of the spectrum of output.</p>
<p>For example, prior to industrialisation, clothing was largely produced by specialised artisans, often coordinated
through guilds and manual labour, with resources gathered locally, and the expertise for creating durable fabrics
accumulated over years, and frequently passed down in family lines. Industrialisation changed that completely, with raw
materials being shipped intercontinentally, fabrics mass produced in factories, clothes assembled by machinery, all
leading to today’s world of fast, disposable, exploitative fashion. And yet handcrafted clothes still exist: from
tailored suits to knitted scarves, a place still exists for small-scale, slow production of textile goods, for reasons
ranging from customisation of fit, signalling of wealth, durability of product, up to enjoyment of the craft as a
pastime.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-4.svg" alt="Might human written software become little more than a boutique industry?" title="Might human written software become little more than a boutique industry?"></p>
<p>So, might human-written software be confined to niches mirroring high fashion or homemade knitwear? That might have been
the case were software a physical product, in which industrialisation could lead to mass production of reusable
components. But software is an intangible good, and unlike other industrialised fields, it has a long history of
component reuse that is intrinsic to the nature of the good itself. Innovation is not limited to better or cheaper
versions of existing products, as with clothing, but also encompasses growth of the solution space, more akin to how the
steam engine enabled reusable machine parts, enabled the production line, enabled the motor car, etc.</p>
<p>As such, the mechanism for technological progress in the history of software development has been not only
industrialisation, but also innovation. Research and development is expensive, but offers the only path to greater value
over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/industry-5.svg" alt="Innovation is the historical and future driver of increased value from software." title="Innovation is the historical and future driver of increased value from software."></p>
<p>Innovation is fundamentally different to industrialisation, because it is not focused on more efficiently replicating
what already exists today. It instead advances through finding and solving new problems, building on what came before,
and delivering capabilities that could not previously have existed. Industrialisation <em>then</em> steps in and provides scale
and commoditisation, providing a foundation upon which the next round of innovation can build. The interplay of these
two forces is what we term <em>progress</em>.</p>
<h2>The endless cycle of progress</h2>
<p><a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/08/03/context-engineering">Large language models</a> are a steam engine moment for
software. They collapse the cost of a class of work previously fully dependent on scarce human labour, and in doing so
unlock an extraordinary acceleration in output.</p>
<p>But remember that the steam engine did not appear in a vacuum. Windmills and watermills preceded turbines by centuries.
Mechanisation did not begin with coal and steel; it merely reached an inflection point at which automation, scale, and
capital aligned to power economic transformation. Similarly, software has been industrialising for a long time: through
reusable components (open source code), portability (containerisation, the cloud), democratisation (low-code / no-code
tools), interoperability (API standards, package managers) and many other ways.</p>
<p>We are entering an industrial revolution for software, then, not as a moment of rupture, but one of huge acceleration.
Industrialisation does not replace technological progress, but it will greatly accelerate both the absorption of new
ideas and the commoditisation of new capabilities. In turn, innovation is more quickly unlocked, as the cost of building
on top of novel technology drops more quickly. The cycle of progress continues, but in an era of mass automation, the
wheel spins faster than ever before.</p>

<p>The open question, then, is not whether industrial software will dominate, but what that dominance does to the
surrounding ecosystem. Previous industrial revolutions externalised their costs onto environments that seemed infinite
until they weren't. Software ecosystems are no different: dependency chains, maintenance burdens, security surfaces that
compound as output scales. Technical debt is the pollution of the digital world, invisible until it chokes the systems
that depend on it. In an era of mass automation, we may find that the hardest problem is not production, but
stewardship. Who maintains the software that no one owns?</p></article></div>]]></description>

You have **public** access to the ExoPriors alignment research corpus.

## API Key (Public - No Signup Required)
```
exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025
```
(This key is intentionally embedded for ergonomics.)

## Capabilities
- **Query**: SQL over 60M documents (posts, papers, tweets, comments)
- **Embed**: Store named embeddings for semantic search
- **Timeout**: adaptive, roughly 20–120s per query depending on load

## Strategy (public access)
Start with quick exploratory queries (LIMIT 10–50) to confirm schema and search semantics, then build a small candidate set and join/aggregate. Keep result sets small to avoid flooding context. Let Postgres choose join order when possible; if public timeouts bite, intersect small candidate sets client-side as a fallback. Use `alignment.search()` + LIMIT as your candidate generator.

## Public @handles
Public handle names must match `p_&lt;8 hex&gt;_&lt;name&gt;` (e.g., `p_8f3a1c2d_myhandle`).
Handles are write-once. Create an account for a private namespace with overwrites.

---

## Quick Reference

### SQL Query
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/query \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{{"sql": "SELECT * FROM alignment.search('\''mesa optimization'\'') LIMIT 10"}}'
```

### Query Estimate (No Execution)
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/estimate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{{"sql": "SELECT id FROM alignment.entities WHERE source = '\''hackernews'\'' AND kind = '\''comment'\'' LIMIT 1000"}}'
```

### Schema Discovery
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/schema \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025"
```

**All `source` values (external_system enum):**
`manual`, `lesswrong`, `eaforum`, `twitter`, `bluesky`, `arxiv`, `chinarxiv`,
`community_archive`, `hackernews`, `datasecretslox`, `ethresearch`, `ethereum_magicians`,
`openzeppelin_forum`, `devcon_forum`, `eips`, `ercs`, `sep`, `exo_user`,
`coefficientgiving`, `slatestarcodex`, `marginalrevolution`, `rethinkpriorities`,
`crawled_url`, `wikipedia`, `other`

### Store Embedding
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.exopriors.com/v1/alignment/embed \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer exopriors_public_readonly_v1_2025" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{{"text": "concept description", "name": "p_8f3a1c2d_shared_concept"}}'
```

### Semantic Search with @handle
```sql
SELECT e.id, e.original_author, e.metadata-&gt;&gt;'title'
FROM alignment.embeddings emb
JOIN alignment.entities e ON e.id = emb.entity_id
WHERE emb.chunk_index = 0
  AND emb.embedding IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY emb.embedding &lt;=&gt; @p_8f3a1c2d_shared_concept
LIMIT 20;
```

### Good Starting Views (Materialized)
Prefer materialized views for fast, filtered semantic search:
- `mv_lesswrong_posts`, `mv_eaforum_posts`, `mv_hackernews_posts`
- `mv_af_posts` (Alignment Forum posts)
- `mv_high_karma_comments` (high-score comments; filter by `source`)
- `mv_lesswrong_comments`, `mv_eaforum_comments` (all comments; embedding may be NULL)
- `mv_hackernews_comments` (HN comments)
- `mv_arxiv_papers` (papers; filter `WHERE embedding IS NOT NULL`)
Note: `mv_*` are exposed under the **alignment** schema. If you qualify with a schema, use `alignment.mv_*`.
Canonical MV columns include: `entity_id`, `uri`, `source`, `kind`, `original_author`, `original_timestamp`, `title`, `score`, `comment_count`, `vote_count`, `word_count`, `is_af`, `preview`, `embedding` (nullable).

### Lexical Search (BM25)
```sql
SELECT * FROM alignment.search('mesa optimization');
SELECT * FROM alignment.search('"inner alignment"');  -- phrase search
SELECT * FROM alignment.search('corrigibility', kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post', 'paper']);
```

**Completeness warning**: `alignment.search()` hard-caps `limit_n` at 100. It returns top BM25 results, not all matches. Use `alignment.search_exhaustive()` with pagination if missing results is worse than waiting:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM alignment.search_exhaustive(
  'left brain',
  kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'],
  limit_n =&gt; 500,
  offset_n =&gt; 0
);
```

**Search semantics (important):**
- Default `mode =&gt; 'auto'`: quoted phrases → phrase search, otherwise AND semantics.
- Use `mode =&gt; 'or'` for any-term matching.
- Use `mode =&gt; 'phrase'` for exact sequences; `mode =&gt; 'fuzzy'` for typos.
- Common `kinds`: `post`, `comment`, `paper`, `tweet`, `twitter_thread`, `text` (others exist but are rare).

**Return schema**: `alignment.search()` returns `(id, score, snippet, uri, kind, original_author, title, original_timestamp)`.
`original_author` may be NULL (especially tweets). It does **not** return `metadata` or `payload`. Join to `alignment.entities` if you need them:
```sql
SELECT s.title, s.score, e.metadata-&gt;&gt;'baseScore' AS base_score
FROM alignment.search('rust programming', kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'], limit_n =&gt; 50) s
JOIN alignment.entities e ON e.id = s.id
ORDER BY s.score DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

**Performance pattern (avoid timeouts):**
Keep CTEs small by limiting inside the candidate set, then join:
```sql
WITH candidates AS (
  SELECT id FROM alignment.search('alignment', kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'], limit_n =&gt; 200)
)
SELECT e.original_author, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM candidates c
JOIN alignment.entities e ON e.id = c.id
GROUP BY e.original_author
ORDER BY n DESC
LIMIT 25;
```
Prefer the `kinds =&gt; ARRAY[...]` parameter over `WHERE kind IN (...)` to keep the BM25 scan focused.

**Completeness vs performance (explicit)**:
- `alignment.search()` returns only the top 100 BM25 matches. Treat it as a sample.
- For completeness-sensitive tasks, use `alignment.search_exhaustive()` + pagination, start with the rarest term, and intersect author sets.

**Author topic intersection helper:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM alignment.author_topics(
  NULL,
  ARRAY['alignment', 'rationality', 'governance'],
  kinds =&gt; ARRAY['post'],
  limit_n =&gt; 200
);
```

**Performance tips (ballpark, load-dependent):**
- Simple searches: ~1–5s
- Embedding joins (&lt;500K rows): ~5–20s
- Complex aggregations (&lt;2M rows): ~20–60s
- Large scans (&gt;5M rows): may timeout under load
- `alignment.search()` is capped at 100 rows; use `alignment.search_exhaustive()` + pagination if completeness matters
- If a query times out: reduce sample size, use fewer embeddings, or pre-filter with `alignment.search()`. For public keys, intersect small candidate lists client-side as a fallback.

              <p>Hey folks, I got a lot of feedback from various meetings on the proposed LLVM AI contribution policy, and I made some significant changes based on that feedback. The current draft proposal focuses on the idea of requiring a <strong>human in the loop</strong> who understands their contribution well enough to <strong>answer questions about it during review</strong>. The idea here is that contributors are not allowed to offload the work of validating LLM tool output to maintainers. I’ve mostly removed the Fedora policy in an effort to move from the vague notion of “owning the contribution” to a more explicit “contributors have to review their contributions and be prepared to answer questions about them”. Contributors should never find themselves in the position of saying “I don’t know, an LLM did it”. I felt the change here was significant, and deserved a new thread.</p>
<p>From an informal show of hands at the round table at the US LLVM developer meeting, most contributors (or at least the subset with the resources and interest in attending this round table in person) are interested in using LLM assistance to increase their productivity, and I really do want to enable them to do so, while also making sure we give maintainers a useful policy tool for pushing back against unwanted contributions.</p>
<p>I’ve updated <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154441">the PR</a>, and I’ve pasted the markdown below as well, but you can also <a href="https://github.com/rnk/llvm-project/blob/tool-policy/llvm/docs/AIToolPolicy.md">view it on GitHub</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="p-355841-llvm-ai-tool-use-policy-1" href="#p-355841-llvm-ai-tool-use-policy-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>LLVM AI Tool Use Policy</h2>
<h2><a name="p-355841-policy-2" href="#p-355841-policy-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Policy</h2>
<p>LLVM’s policy is that contributors can use whatever tools they would like to<br>
craft their contributions, but there must be a <strong>human in the loop</strong>.<br>
<strong>Contributors must read and review all LLM-generated code or text before they<br>
ask other project members to review it.</strong> The contributor is always the author<br>
and is fully accountable for their contributions. Contributors should be<br>
sufficiently confident that the contribution is high enough quality that asking<br>
for a review is a good use of scarce maintainer time, and they should be <strong>able<br>
to answer questions about their work</strong> during review.</p>
<p>We expect that new contributors will be less confident in their contributions,<br>
and our guidance to them is to <strong>start with small contributions</strong> that they can<br>
fully understand to build confidence. We aspire to be a welcoming community<br>
that helps new contributors grow their expertise, but learning involves taking<br>
small steps, getting feedback, and iterating. Passing maintainer feedback to an<br>
LLM doesn’t help anyone grow, and does not sustain our community.</p>
<p>Contributors are expected to <strong>be transparent and label contributions that<br>
contain substantial amounts of tool-generated content</strong>. Our policy on<br>
labelling is intended to facilitate reviews, and not to track which parts of<br>
LLVM are generated. Contributors should note tool usage in their pull request<br>
description, commit message, or wherever authorship is normally indicated for<br>
the work. For instance, use a commit message trailer like Assisted-by: . This transparency helps the community develop best practices<br>
and understand the role of these new tools.</p>
<p>An important implication of this policy is that it bans agents that take action<br>
in our digital spaces without human approval, such as the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/claude/"><code>@claude</code><br>
agent</a>. Similarly, automated review tools that<br>
publish comments without human review are not allowed. However, an opt-in<br>
review tool that <strong>keeps a human in the loop</strong> is acceptable under this policy.<br>
As another example, using an LLM to generate documentation, which a contributor<br>
manually reviews for correctness, edits, and then posts as a PR, is an approved<br>
use of tools under this policy.</p>
<p>This policy includes, but is not limited to, the following kinds of<br>
contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code, usually in the form of a pull request</li>
<li>RFCs or design proposals</li>
<li>Issues or security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>Comments and feedback on pull requests</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-355841-extractive-contributions-3" href="#p-355841-extractive-contributions-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Extractive Contributions</h2>
<p>The reason for our “human-in-the-loop” contribution policy is that processing<br>
patches, PRs, RFCs, and comments to LLVM is not free – it takes a lot of<br>
maintainer time and energy to review those contributions! Sending the<br>
unreviewed output of an LLM to open source project maintainers <em>extracts</em> work<br>
from them in the form of design and code review, so we call this kind of<br>
contribution an “extractive contribution”.</p>
<p>Our <strong>golden rule</strong> is that a contribution should be worth more to the project<br>
than the time it takes to review it. These ideas are captured by this quote<br>
from the book <a href="https://press.stripe.com/working-in-public">Working in Public</a> by Nadia Eghbal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When attention is being appropriated, producers need to weigh the costs and<br>
benefits of the transaction. To assess whether the appropriation of attention<br>
is net-positive, it’s useful to distinguish between <em>extractive</em> and<br>
<em>non-extractive</em> contributions. Extractive contributions are those where the<br>
marginal cost of reviewing and merging that contribution is greater than the<br>
marginal benefit to the project’s producers. In the case of a code<br>
contribution, it might be a pull request that’s too complex or unwieldy to<br>
review, given the potential upside." -- Nadia Eghbal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prior to the advent of LLMs, open source project maintainers would often review<br>
any and all changes sent to the project simply because posting a change for<br>
review was a sign of interest from a potential long-term contributor. While new<br>
tools enable more development, it shifts effort from the implementor to the<br>
reviewer, and our policy exists to ensure that we value and do not squander<br>
maintainer time.</p>
<p>Reviewing changes from new contributors is part of growing the next generation<br>
of contributors and sustaining the project. We want the LLVM project to be<br>
welcoming and open to aspiring compiler engineers who are willing to invest<br>
time and effort to learn and grow, because growing our contributor base and<br>
recruiting new maintainers helps sustain the project over the long term. Being<br>
open to contributions and <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/DeveloperPolicy.html#obtaining-commit-access">liberally granting commit access</a><br>
is a big part of how LLVM has grown and successfully been adopted all across<br>
the industry.  We therefore automatically post a greeting comment to pull<br>
requests from new contributors and encourage maintainers to spend their time to<br>
help new contributors learn.</p>
<h2><a name="p-355841-handling-violations-4" href="#p-355841-handling-violations-4" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Handling Violations</h2>
<p>If a maintainer judges that a contribution is <em>extractive</em> (i.e. it doesn’t<br>
comply with this policy), they should copy-paste the following response to<br>
request changes, add the <code>extractive</code> label if applicable, and refrain from<br>
further engagement:</p>
<pre><code>This PR appears to be extractive, and requires additional justification for
why it is valuable enough to the project for us to review it. Please see
our developer policy on AI-generated contributions:
http://llvm.org/docs/AIToolPolicy.html
</code></pre>
<p>Other reviewers should use the label to prioritize their review time.</p>
<p>The best ways to make a change less extractive and more valuable are to reduce<br>
its size or complexity or to increase its usefulness to the community. These<br>
factors are impossible to weigh objectively, and our project policy leaves this<br>
determination up to the maintainers of the project, i.e. those who are doing<br>
the work of sustaining the project.</p>
<p>If a contributor responds but doesn’t make their change meaningfully less<br>
extractive, maintainers should escalate to the relevant moderation or admin<br>
team for the space (GitHub, Discourse, Discord, etc) to lock the conversation.</p>
<h2><a name="p-355841-copyright-5" href="#p-355841-copyright-5" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Copyright</h2>
<p>Artificial intelligence systems raise many questions around copyright that have<br>
yet to be answered. Our policy on AI tools is similar to our copyright policy:<br>
Contributors are responsible for ensuring that they have the right to<br>
contribute code under the terms of our license, typically meaning that either<br>
they, their employer, or their collaborators hold the copyright. Using AI tools<br>
to regenerate copyrighted material does not remove the copyright, and<br>
contributors are responsible for ensuring that such material does not appear in<br>
their contributions. Contributions found to violate this policy will be removed<br>
just like any other offending contribution.</p>
<h2><a name="p-355841-examples-6" href="#p-355841-examples-6" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Examples</h2>
<p>Here are some examples of contributions that demonstrate how to apply<br>
the principles of this policy:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/142869">This PR</a> contains a proof from Alive2, which is a strong signal of<br>
value and correctness.</li>
<li>This <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/searching-for-gsym-documentation/85185/2">generated documentation</a> was reviewed for correctness by a<br>

              <p>Hi Reid,</p>
<p>I understand and generally agree with the sentiment that prompted this proposal, but I think maybe your current policy is <strong>too</strong> restrictive and you are throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  In particular I can imagine cases where we might want to make exceptions to the general policy, e.g. for AI tools that are designed to handle a small, restricted, and easily automatable set of maintenance-type changes.  I think this policy should include a well-defined path for obtaining exceptions to the general rule (that a human must be in the loop before a PR can be posted).</p>
<p>An example of such a path might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Post an RFC detailing what problem the proposed AI agent will solve and how it will solve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get approval for the RFC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have a short testing period, where humans must check their proposed changes before allowing them to be posted upstream, and must comment in the PR both that the original content came from AI, and whether or not the human needed to update the original content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Final review by small committee (possibly one of the area leads teams) on whether or not the AI is generating acceptable quality PRs; grants the exception (or not).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that’s just a rough outline, and would probably need refinement.  Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Thank you, this feels like it take a lot of the feedback into account. one aspect that I don’t see covered here but I have had trouble with is that results from LLMs tend to be very very verbose. Often they feel like giant walls of text. There is important and useful information there but I have to put a lot more work into getting it. It is not that anything is necessarily incorrect or wrong but a human would have said in a few sentences and still conveyed the important information.</p>
<p>It feels very hard to push back on this because it feels to some degree subjective (but I know it when I see it) but if a serious amounts of reviews became that much more verbose it would be a large cost in reviewer time. I will feel highly unmotivated to review PRs/issues that are walls of text. Especially if (as I often am) making hard trade-offs on my time.</p>
<p>There is some degree on irony here, in that I am often pushing folks on PRs to provide more and more detailed information but as the meme’s often say “not like that”.</p>

            <p>Not sure if it’s explicit from the current wording but I assume the intention for “human in the loop” is that the human won’t just forward questions to LLM and post its answers as if they are their own instead of just going “I don’t know, an LLM did it” either (because it’s essentially the same as the latter but wastes way more reviewer time).</p>

<p>I don’t agree with this characterization. The problem we have today is not that we have a lot of LLM-based tools we desperately need to integrate into our automation. Instead, I think the problem is that reviewers struggle with a wave of LLM output coming as contributions, where contributors don’t have enough understanding of their PRs. Policy that Reid drafted in this thread is a great step towards addressing that later problem.</p>
<p>We’ve been months into AI policy discussions, and I don’t think that hypothetical future LLM automation is worth delaying much needed changes any longer.</p>

            <p>I don’t see why this is incompatible with that. A policy introduced by this RFC can be overridden by a future RFC, including one for a specific case that would like an exception.</p>

            <p>While I am fully convinced that we will end up needing well-defined path for exceptions to this policy, which I why I brought it up, if everyone else would prefer to skip that for now, I can live with the policy going in as is.

              <p>I thought some more about why crafting an AI policy for an open source project is so hard, and why so many projects are struggling with it. For a large open source project like LLVM or Linux, a large share of the contributors are working at corporations – and a large majority of corporations have adopted AI coding-assistants org-wide, many of them seeing material benefits from the adoption. It would be natural to question whether the same productivity gain can be replicated in an open source project like ours. The interest in drafting a policy may also come from the perspective of being welcoming to new contributors – a lot of young people today are playing with coding-assistants prior to joining industry. My earlier position was that it wouldn’t be useful in LLVM, from personal experience, but I’m probably old-fashioned and biased.</p>
<p>The core issue is that the people writing code in corporations are very different from the general public – rouge entities misusing AI in corporations can be let go, but the general public is the wild west. Several open source projects are burdened with a flood of AI-generated bug reports, and huge AI-generated PRs. I think that, due to the inherent nature of this technology, it will always be a corporate thing, and is perhaps a poor fit for an open source project – I know this is somewhat defeatist, but I really don’t know what kind of safeguards will protect us and our valuable time.</p>

            <p>True, but there is a higher argumentative and social effort needed to deviate from a once established policy.</p>

<p>Without any empirical evidence this remains a unsubstantiated claim. I’d argue that such a LLM-assisted review could be part of the learning curve. It also does not reflect the rapid improvements in AI quality which might mitigate the issues related to bad output quality over time.</p>
<p>Instead of shutting the door for non-programmers with such language, I propose hard objective criteria to act as the AI quality filter, e.g. measurable and reproducable improvements (performance numbers, crash fixes etc.) that need to be explicitly mentioned within the MR/issue.</p>

              <p>I can share a few practices from ASF communities.</p>
<p>Some ASF projects (e.g., Apache DataFusion and Apache Kvrocks) have already published AI-assisted contribution policies, and they converge with the LLVM proposal: if you use an LLM, you’re still expected to understand the change and be able to explain and iterate on it.</p>
<p>When the author can’t really explain what the LLM produced, a high-quality issue is often a better outcome than a PR. It can avoid wasted review cycles - especially for smaller communities where maintainer bandwidth and review burnout are real constraints. In projects I maintain, I’ve seen more LLM-generated PRs recently, and many stall because the author can’t effectively respond to review feedback beyond acting as an LLM “proxy”, which increases communication cost and slows everything down.</p>
<p>Overall, “human in the loop” feels like the most practical policy today. If LLM capability improves significantly, we can revisit the policy, but based on what I’m seeing, I think we’re not there yet.</p>

              <p>No, it makes total sense: As I read it, this new AI policy introduces restrictions and additional burden on contributors, effectively excluding non-programmers that want to contribute AI-assisted code changes. The burden of proof is on the proponents of such restrictions to show that there is a neccessity for introducing such a change. It’s not the other way around as there is currently no AI policy with such restrictions (e.g. everything that is not specifically forbidden is allowed).</p>
<p>Again, I argue that some “AI slop filter” needs to be based on objective criteria. It is not about the status of the people contributing code or their lack of programming experience but about the (minimum) quality of the code contribution to warrent further reviewer time and effort. In my view, it makes more sense to define such a set of objective criteria for the expected (minimum) code quality which need to be met than to exclude people due to the lack of programming experience.</p>

              <p>It’s worth noting that the current permissiveness is quite new in the overall history of the project. The reality is that the LLVM community has discouraged automated and/or bulk changes of any form for a very long time, including changes generated by tooling as straightforward as a <code>sed</code> script. When such changes have been allowed in the past, it has been after receiving prior approval from the community. I view AI-generated changes as falling into precisely the same bucket.</p>
<p>I will restate my outlook from the earlier thread: while being inclusive and welcoming is <em>a</em> goal of the LLVM project, it does not supersede <em>the</em> goal of building a suite of compiler &amp; toolchain components that benefit our users. Most of the time these goals are not in conflict, but (again IMO) an overly permissive AI contribution policy betrays the duty of care we have to our users.</p>

<p>At first glance, this sounds reasonable, but I don’t think it works in practice. In theory you can define “objective” standards, but determining whether a PR actually meets those standards still costs maintainer time and attention. And I strongly suspect that cost is often close to what it would take to just do a full review anyway.</p>
<p>Let’s also acknowledge something: in open source we generally <em>don’t</em> judge contributions by a contributor’s résumé or claimed experience. But interpersonal trust and publicly earned merit (see <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works/#meritocracy" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ASF’s explanation of Meritocracy</a> and <a href="https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/#what-makes-the-apache-way-so-hard-to-define" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the Apache Way</a>, for example) are genuinely important in open-source communities. That’s not because people are biased; it’s because, as imperfect as it may be, it’s the lowest-cost way to make decisions at scale. If we discard that dynamic entirely, I’m not sure open source would function as effectively as it does today.</p>

<p>I fully understand the implications of being swamped with AI contributions on the reviewer side (AI only accelerates the problem, a ton of new novice contributors would expose essentially the same scaling problem). But this is an area were open source communities need to evolve and find new ways to 1) stay as open as possible to harness new discoveries and 2) remain functioning effectively at scale.</p>
<p>I’ve lobbied for an more open alternative approach <a href="https://seylaw.blogspot.com/2025/10/the-shepherd-and-flux-capacitor.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">publicly</a> that aims to serve both goals (admittedly without much acceptance from the LLVM community so far):</p>
<p><em>”[…] this entire defensive model is value-destructive. It is a system designed with only one success state (accepting a perfect contribution) and one failure state (rejecting an imperfect one). It has no mechanism for a third, more productive outcome: refinement. When a contribution with a verifiable, valuable payload is rejected because its packaging is flawed, the value is not put on hold; it is permanently lost. The performance gain I found is not sitting in a queue waiting for me to learn C++; it is simply gone from the project. The fortress, in its zeal to keep out the “slop,” has also barred the door to the raw ore from which treasure might have been forged.</em></p>
<p><em>This is not a sustainable model in an era where the tools of discovery are becoming democratized at an explosive rate. The fundamental misunderstanding is that ownership is not a ticket that one must purchase before entering the park. Ownership is the outcome of a successful collaborative journey. By demanding it at the very beginning, we are ensuring that for a growing class of potential innovators, that journey never even begins. The fortress may remain pure, but it will also become stagnant, isolated from the very world it is meant to serve. [</em>…]</p>
<p><em>To critique the fortress is not enough. We must offer a blueprint for a better structure: a harbor. A harbor, unlike a fortress, does not have a simple binary function of letting things in or keeping them out. It is an active, intelligent system with channels, docks, workshops, and expert pilots, all designed to guide valuable cargo safely to shore, no matter the state of the vessel that carries it. This is the model we must adopt for open source in a post-AI world. The anxiety over “extractive” contributions is real, but the solution is not a higher wall; it is a smarter intake process. <a href="https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-llvm-ai-tool-policy-start-small-no-slop/88476/28">I propose a concrete, actionable framework for this harbor</a>: the Contribution Triage Pipeline.”</em></p>

<p>This is categorically false. LLVM’s review policy is directly and wholeheartedly based on refinement, and the new AI policy does not goes against it.</p>
<p>LLVM’s policy also focus on code quality, which requires the author being able to explain the changes, and defend their choices to the wider community. Here the fail-safe is a human author being able to explain the changes without offloading that role to maintainers and the wider community.</p>
<p>LLMs are, by construction, unable to defend their own choices (without hallucination) with the technical rigour that we need for tools like compilers, kernels and other key infrastructure components of modern societies.</p>

<p>Tools of discovery should be used to find solutions in a large sea of choices, not to accept the output without validation, nor to offload the validation to the wider community.</p>
<p>The <em>“value”</em> created by some automatic tool, as well as humans, may be acceptable to some people, but not all. It may be relevant to a set of problems, but not all. It may be correct with certain assumptions, but not all. Without understanding of those limitations, contributions provide <em>negative</em> value, as they waste the time of more people than their contributions would provide.</p>
<p>Anyone willing to provide justifications and explanations for decisions made in a PR, be it created by humans or machines, are absolutely encouraged to contribute. But if their justifications are not at the level of rigour we require to merge a PR, the code should not be merged, and upon insistence without further merit, maintainers are encouraged to ignore and/or close the PRs. This is true regardless of how the code was produced.</p>

<p>I believe the policy offers exactly that. The “wall” is the same size as it has always been: technical rigour, honest justification, willingness to adapt.</p>
<p>Extractive contributions are not just dangerous due to their net-negative costs on merge, but also their accumulated extraction of whole-system knowledge and reuse of bad practices that just <em>“happen to work”</em>. This is a human action as well, but code review exposes refactory opportunities, which are much more costly than normal code review.</p>
<p>Accepting generated code without human review, and without human justification, increases the difficulty of refactory over time. This is not exclusive to machines, but it is unrestricted on machines contributions.</p>
<p>Until such a day when code generators can have the same technical rigour as humans (for example generate proofs of quality or trigger reasonable refactory actions), we should not allow auto-generated code to merge without human review and justification.</p>

<p>I really don’t agree with this. LLVM is, at its core, a compiler framework that’s responsible for the running code on the majority of the world’s computing systems. From embedded devices to servers and everything in between. Like the Linux kernel, quality and stability are IMO the highest priorities here. We don’t need <em>more</em> contributors who aren’t programmers to contribute code. That may suck for those people who want to feel good by having some code accepted into a prestigious project like LLVM for their resumé without learning compilers, but I couldn’t care less about those people. Those people can take their contributions to one of the other million OSS projects, LLVM will be just fine without them.</p>
<p>What we need more of are contributors who’ve built experience, can review code, learn and teach others through discussions. We need people with good <em>taste</em> that comes with years of interaction with LLVM. We need people who can look at a PR that seems to do a correct thing on a local level, but explain that it’s not the right place to be making those changes in the long term.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, I strongly agree with this RFC and we can evolve it as needed in future.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-2026-airline-water-study-released-today-by-the-center-for-food-as-medicine-and-longevity-reveals-that-the-quality-of-drinking-water-varies-significantly-by-airline-and-many-airlines-continue-to-provide-passengers-with-potentially-unhealthy-water">A 2026 Airline Water Study released today by the Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity reveals that the quality of drinking water varies significantly by airline, and many airlines continue to provide passengers with potentially unhealthy water.</h2>



<p>Unhealthy water violates the federal government’s Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR), which was implemented in 2011 and requires airlines to provide passengers and flight crew with safe drinking water.</p>



<p>The 2026 Airline Water Study ranks 10 major and 11 regional airlines by the quality of water they provided onboard flights during a three-year study period (October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2025). Each airline was given a “Water Safety Score” (5.00 = highest rating, 0.00 = lowest) based on five weighted criteria, including violations per aircraft, Maximum Contaminant Level violations for E. coli, indicator-positive rates, public notices, and disinfecting and flushing frequency. A score of 3.5 or better indicates that the airline has relatively safe, clean water and earns a Grade A or B.</p>



<p>“Delta Air Lines and Frontier Airlines win the top spots with the safest water in the sky, and Alaska Airlines finishes No. 3,” says Charles Platkin, PhD, JD, MPH, director of the Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity.</p>



<p>The airlines with the worst score are American Airlines and JetBlue, the study shows. “Nearly all regional airlines need to improve their onboard water safety, with the exception of GoJet Airlines,” Platkin says.</p>



<p>The ADWR requires airlines to take samples from their water tanks to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli. Airlines are also required to disinfect and flush each aircraft’s water tank four times per year. Alternatively, an airline may choose to disinfect and flush once a year, but then it must test monthly.</p>



<p>The 2026 Airline Water Study also finds that the Environmental Protection Agency – one of the federal agencies responsible for ensuring safe aircraft drinking water – rarely levies civil penalties to airlines in violation of the ADWR.</p>



<p><strong>Here are the study’s findings:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>The major airlines receiving the highest Water Safety Scores are Delta Air Lines (5.00, Grade A) and Frontier Airlines (4.80, Grade A). Alaska Airlines is a close third at 3.85 (Grade B).</li>



<li>GoJet Airlines is the highest-rated regional carrier with a score of 3.85 (Grade B).</li>



<li>Among major airlines, American Airlines has the lowest score of 1.75 (Grade D).</li>



<li>Nearly all regional airlines have poor Water Safety Scores. Mesa Airlines has the lowest score among rated regional carriers at 1.35 (Grade F), and CommuteAir is second-lowest at 1.60 (Grade D). CommuteAir shows an alarming 33.33% total coliform positive rate.</li>



<li>The study window analyzed 35,674 total sample locations tested for total coliform bacteria across all airlines. Of these, 949 locations (2.66%) tested positive for total coliform.</li>



<li>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for E. coli were identified as the strongest downward driver of airline scores. There were 32 such violations across the 21-airline universe during the study window.</li>



<li>The “Shame on You” Award goes to the EPA for weak enforcement. The study shows that civil penalties for ADWR violations remain extremely rare if at all (we are not able to get an answer).</li>



<li>Testing for coliform bacteria is important, because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system.</li>



<li>When an aircraft’s water sample tests positive for coliform, it must be tested again to determine if E. coli is present. If E. coli is not present, the airline must take repeat samples within 24 hours, disinfect and flush the water system within 72 hours, or shut down the water system within 72 hours and then disinfect and flush. If the sample is E. coli positive, the airline must shut off public access to the water system within 24 hours and disinfect and flush.</li>



<li>The ADWR does not require the same testing as the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which includes other microorganisms in addition to total coliform.</li>



<li>An aircraft flies to numerous destinations and may pump drinking water into its tanks from various sources at domestic and international locations. The water quality onboard also depends on the safety of the equipment used to transfer the water, such as water cabinets, trucks, carts and hoses.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Here’s the bottom-line advice from the Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity. To be extra safe:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>NEVER drink any water onboard that isn’t in a sealed bottle.</li>



<li>Do not drink coffee or tea onboard.</li>



<li>Do not wash your hands in the bathroom; use alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol instead.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background and Public Health Significance</h3>



<p>Commercial aviation serves as an essential mode of transportation for hundreds of millions of passengers annually in the United States. While considerable attention has been devoted to aviation safety in terms of mechanical reliability and operational procedures, the quality and safety of drinking water available to passengers and crew during flight remains a less visible but important public health consideration. Aircraft drinking water systems present unique challenges that distinguish them from terrestrial water systems. Water is loaded onto aircraft at varying airports, stored in onboard tanks under fluctuating temperature and pressure conditions, distributed through complex plumbing networks to galleys and lavatories, and consumed by passengers and flight attendants who have limited alternatives during flight.</p>



<p>Unlike municipal water systems with continuous flow and regular monitoring, aircraft water systems experience periods of stagnation between flights, temperature variations during ascent and descent, and mechanical stress from aircraft operations. These conditions can create environments conducive to biofilm formation and microbial proliferation. Furthermore, the water loaded onto aircraft originates from airport facilities with varying infrastructure quality, and contamination introduced during the servicing process—whether from hoses, truck tanks, or improper handling—can persist in aircraft systems if adequate disinfection and flushing protocols are not rigorously maintained.</p>



<p>The potential health consequences of consuming contaminated aircraft drinking water range from acute gastrointestinal illness to exposure to opportunistic pathogens. Vulnerable populations, including young children, elderly passengers, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals, may face elevated risks from waterborne pathogens. For flight attendants who consume onboard water regularly as part of their occupational routine, chronic low-level exposure represents an additional concern. Despite these risks, airline drinking water has historically received less regulatory scrutiny and public attention than other aspects of aviation safety and food service.</p>



<h3>Previous Research and the Need for Ongoing Monitoring</h3>



<p>In September 2019, dietdetective.com released the first comprehensive comparative analysis of airline drinking water safety. That landmark study examined Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR) compliance data from 2012 through 2019, revealing that the quality of drinking water varies substantially by airline and that many airlines had provided passengers with unhealthy water in violation of federal safety requirements. The study ranked 10 major and 13 regional airlines using a Water Health Score (5 = highest rating, 0 = lowest) based on 10 criteria, including fleet size, ADWR violations, positive <em>E. coli</em> and coliform water sample reports, and airline cooperation in providing answers to water-quality questions. A score of 3.0 or better was designated as indicating relatively safe, clean water.</p>



<p>The 2019 study’s key findings painted a troubling picture of airline water safety:</p>



<p><strong>Major airline rankings:</strong> Alaska Airlines and Allegiant tied for the top spot with scores of 3.3 out of 5.0, followed closely by Hawaiian Airlines at 3.1. At the bottom, Spirit Airlines and JetBlue both scored just 1.0 out of 5.0. Delta Air Lines scored 1.6, American Airlines scored 1.5, and United Airlines scored 1.2.</p>



<p><strong>Regional airline challenges:</strong> Nearly all regional airlines, except Piedmont Airlines (which scored an impressive 4.33), showed poor Water Health Scores and a large number of ADWR violations. Republic Airways, which flies for United Express, Delta Connection, and American Eagle, had the lowest score at 0.44. ExpressJet was second-lowest at 0.56 and averaged 3.36 ADWR violations per aircraft.</p>



<p><strong>Violation trends:</strong> The number of ADWR violations by all airlines in 2018 was significantly less than in 2012, the first year after the ADWR was enacted. For major airlines, violations had decreased 69% (from 262 to 81), while violations among regional airlines had decreased 71% (from 351 to 103). However, the study noted this decrease might reflect a lack of enforcement by the EPA, which had issued few penalties in recent years.</p>



<p><strong>Enforcement concerns:</strong> The study found that the Environmental Protection Agency—one of the federal agencies responsible for ensuring safe aircraft drinking water—rarely levied civil penalties to airlines in violation of the ADWR.</p>



<p><strong>Industry cooperation:</strong> The study awarded a “Shame on You” designation to the EPA and nearly all major airlines for their very poor response time and lack of cooperation in answering detailed questions. The EPA didn’t answer most penalty-related questions, and Spirit, Allegiant, and Frontier did not respond to any questions. Very weak responses that didn’t adequately address questions were provided by American, United, and JetBlue, which had large numbers of violations during the study period.</p>



<p>The 2019 study’s bottom-line advice to passengers was unequivocal: Never drink any water onboard that isn’t in a sealed bottle, do not drink coffee or tea made with onboard water, and do not wash hands in aircraft bathrooms—instead, bring hand sanitizer.</p>



<p>The findings from the 2019 study generated significant public attention and media coverage, bringing airline water safety into broader public discourse. However, the passage of six years since that analysis creates an urgent need for updated information. Airlines have had time to respond to public scrutiny, EPA enforcement patterns may have evolved, and fleet compositions and operational practices have changed. Most importantly, passengers and public health stakeholders require current data to assess whether the industry has improved its performance in response to the 2019 findings or whether systemic problems persist.</p>



<p>Some of the most dramatic questions raised by comparing the 2019 baseline to current conditions include: Has Delta Air Lines, which scored just 1.6 in 2019, improved its water safety practices? Have JetBlue and Spirit, tied for last place in 2019, addressed their significant compliance challenges? Has the regional airline sector, which showed pervasive problems in 2019, made meaningful progress? And critically, has the EPA increased enforcement efforts, or does the regulatory gap identified in 2019 persist?</p>



<p>This 2026 study represents a continuation of systematic airline water safety monitoring using a refined methodology specifically designed to provide actionable, comparative information based on the most recent three years of compliance data.</p>



<p>The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The rule, which became effective in 2011, applies to aircraft operated by U.S. carriers that have onboard drinking water systems and serve passengers or crew on flights with at least one U.S. point of service.</p>



<p>The Aircraft Drinking Water Rule establishes several key requirements for covered carriers:</p>



<p><strong>Routine monitoring and testing:</strong> Airlines must collect and analyze water samples from aircraft for the presence of total coliform bacteria and, when total coliform is detected, for <em>Escherichia coli</em> (<em>E. coli</em>). Total coliform bacteria serve as indicator organisms; their presence suggests potential fecal contamination or inadequate disinfection, even if the organisms themselves are not necessarily pathogenic. The detection of <em>E. coli</em>, a fecal coliform bacterium, constitutes a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) violation and signals more serious contamination requiring immediate corrective action. Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system.</p>



<p><strong>Disinfection and flushing:</strong> When monitoring reveals coliform contamination, airlines must disinfect and flush the affected aircraft water system according to EPA-approved procedures. Airlines are required to disinfect and flush each aircraft’s water tank four times per year, or alternatively, an airline may choose to disinfect and flush once a year if it tests monthly. Disinfection typically involves super-chlorination of the water system followed by thorough flushing to remove both the disinfectant residue and biofilm. When an aircraft’s water sample tests positive for coliform, it must be tested again to determine if <em>E. coli</em> is present. If <em>E. coli</em> is not present, the airline must take repeat samples within 24 hours and either disinfect and flush the water system within 72 hours or shut down the water system within 72 hours and then disinfect and flush. If the sample is <em>E. coli</em> positive, the airline must shut off public access to the water system within 24 hours and disinfect and flush.</p>



<p><strong>Corrective action and public notification:</strong> When <em>E. coli</em> is detected (a Maximum Contaminant Level violation), airlines must immediately take the aircraft water system out of service, provide alternative drinking water sources to passengers and crew, notify passengers through posted notices, disinfect and flush the system, and conduct follow-up testing to confirm the contamination has been eliminated. Public notices must inform passengers that the water system is unavailable and that alternative drinking water is being provided.</p>



<p><strong>Record-keeping and reporting:</strong> Airlines must maintain detailed records of all monitoring, testing, disinfection, flushing, violations, and corrective actions, and submit these records to EPA through a centralized electronic reporting portal.</p>



<p>It is important to note that the ADWR does not require the same comprehensive testing as the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations, which includes testing for other microorganisms in addition to total coliform. Additionally, aircraft fly to numerous destinations and may pump drinking water into their tanks from various sources at domestic and international locations. The water quality onboard also depends on the safety of the equipment used to transfer the water, such as water cabinets, trucks, carts, and hoses—factors that can introduce contamination even when source water meets safety standards.</p>



<p>The Aircraft Drinking Water Rule represents a significant regulatory framework for ensuring aircraft water safety. However, compliance data alone does not automatically translate into public awareness or competitive pressure for improved performance. Systematic analysis and transparent public reporting of airline-specific performance metrics remain essential for translating regulatory data into actionable public health information.</p>



<h3>Knowledge Gaps and Study Rationale</h3>



<p>Despite the 2019 baseline study and ongoing EPA data collection, several important questions remain unanswered:</p>



<p><strong>How have airline drinking water safety practices evolved?</strong> The 2019 study provided a snapshot of the industry during the first seven years of ADWR implementation. Whether airlines have improved their performance in response to public scrutiny, maintained similar patterns, or experienced deterioration requires fresh analysis of recent compliance records.</p>



<p><strong>Which airlines currently demonstrate the strongest and weakest water safety performance?</strong> Rankings from 2019 may not reflect current conditions. Some carriers that performed poorly may have implemented significant improvements, while previously high-performing airlines may have experienced setbacks. Updated comparative rankings using current data are essential for informed passenger decision-making.</p>



<p><strong>What is the current magnitude of contamination risk?</strong> Total coliform detection rates, <em>E. coli</em> Maximum Contaminant Level violations, and compliance patterns may have shifted substantially since the 2019 analysis. Quantifying current risk levels across the industry provides an updated baseline for assessing future trends.</p>



<p><strong>Are there systematic differences between major airlines and regional carriers?</strong> The 2019 study demonstrated that regional airlines faced particular challenges, but whether these patterns persist or have changed requires examination of current data.</p>



<p><strong>How effective are public notification and response practices?</strong> Beyond detecting contamination, the adequacy of airline responses when violations occur—specifically whether airlines consistently provide alternative water sources and remove contaminated systems from service—remains a critical but understudied dimension of passenger protection. The 2019 study noted significant gaps in airline cooperation and transparency; whether these have improved is unknown.</p>



<p><strong>Has EPA enforcement evolved?</strong> The 2019 study identified limited EPA enforcement and civil penalties as a systemic concern. Whether regulatory oversight has strengthened since 2019 requires examination of current violation and penalty patterns.</p>



<p>This study addresses these knowledge gaps through comprehensive analysis of the most recent three-year period of Aircraft Drinking Water Rule compliance data, using enhanced methodological rigor and transparency compared to the 2019 study.</p>



<h3>Study Objectives</h3>



<p>The primary objective of this study is to generate an evidence-based, transparent scorecard that ranks airlines according to multiple indicators of drinking water safety derived from Aircraft Drinking Water Rule compliance data for the period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2025. Specific aims include:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Quantify total coliform and <em>E. coli</em> detection rates</strong> across airlines, normalized by fleet size to enable fair comparisons between carriers of different scales.</li>



<li><strong>Identify Maximum Contaminant Level violations for <em>E. coli</em></strong> and assess how these serious contamination events are distributed across the airline industry.</li>



<li><strong>Evaluate compliance with public notification requirements</strong>, including whether airlines consistently provide alternative drinking water and remove contaminated systems from service when violations occur.</li>



<li><strong>Assess preventive maintenance practices</strong> by measuring the frequency of disinfection and flushing events relative to fleet size.</li>



<li><strong>Develop a composite Water Safety Score</strong> that integrates multiple performance dimensions into a single metric, allowing passengers and stakeholders to compare airlines and identify both leaders and laggards in drinking water safety.</li>



<li><strong>Provide actionable guidance for passengers</strong> on risk-reduction strategies when traveling by air, informed by current patterns in compliance data.</li>



<li><strong>Document changes in airline performance</strong> since the 2019 baseline study, identifying carriers that have improved dramatically, those that have maintained consistent performance, and those where challenges persist or have worsened.</li>
</ol>



<h3>Study Approach and Report Structure</h3>



<p>This study employs a retrospective, observational design using Aircraft Drinking Water Rule records submitted to EPA by airlines and exported from the EPA reporting portal. The analysis covers a three-year study window from October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2025 (inclusive), and includes 21 airlines: 10 major carriers and 11 regional carriers.</p>



<p>Data sources include five comma-separated value exports containing violation records, operational events (disinfection, flushing, sampling, and water system restrictions), laboratory sample results, and public notices. Fleet size for each airline was determined by counting unique aircraft tail numbers appearing in any of the data files during the study window, providing a consistent denominator for calculating per-aircraft rates.</p>



<p>The Water Safety Score, ranging from 0.00 to 5.00, combines five weighted sub-scores reflecting violations per aircraft, Maximum Contaminant Level violations for <em>E. coli</em>, indicator-positive rates (total coliform present with <em>E. coli</em> absent), public notices per 100 aircraft, and disinfecting and flushing frequency. Penalties are applied for inadequate responses to public notice requirements, specifically when airlines fail to clearly turn off contaminated water systems or provide alternative drinking water.</p>



<p>Compared to the 2019 study methodology, this analysis incorporates several enhancements: (1) use of direct EPA data exports rather than manual data compilation, (2) explicit handling of violation date overlap calculations with transparency about missing data, (3) extraction of sample-location level total coliform results from operational event details, (4) formal weighting of score components based on public health significance, and (5) explicit penalty structures for inadequate public notification responses.</p>



<p>This report presents validated study-wide totals for key contamination metrics, comparative rankings of airlines by Water Safety Score with assigned letter grades, detailed airline-specific profiles showing the underlying data driving each score, passenger risk-reduction guidance, methodological transparency including quintile thresholds and calculation procedures, and discussion of study limitations. By making these findings accessible to the public, this study aims to empower passengers with information to make informed travel choices, encourage airlines to prioritize drinking water safety through competitive transparency, and contribute to the evidence base for public health policy in aviation.</p>

<h2 id="h-executive-summary"><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>



<p>Airplane drinking water is stored in onboard tanks and distributed through plumbing to galleys and lavatories. These systems can face stagnation, temperature fluctuation, and maintenance complexity, all of which can contribute to microbial contamination risk or persistent hygiene challenges.</p>



<p>This study presents a comparative scorecard for 21 airlines using Aircraft Drinking Water Rule compliance, operational, sampling, and public notice records. Each airline is assigned a Water Safety Score on a 0.00 to 5.00 scale. Higher scores indicate stronger performance across the indicators used in this study.</p>

<h2 id="h-methods"><strong>Methods</strong></h2>



<h3 id="h-study-design-and-objective"><strong>Study design and objective</strong></h3>



<p>The Center for Food as Medicine and Longevity conducted a retrospective, observational analysis of Aircraft Drinking Water Rule records to generate a comparative airline drinking water scorecard for a fixed three-year period.</p>



<h3 id="h-data-sources"><strong>Data sources</strong></h3>



<p>Five comma separated value files exported from the United States Environmental Protection Agency Aircraft Drinking Water Rule reporting portal were analyzed:</p>



<ol>
<li>Violations Report (one row per Aircraft Drinking Water Rule violation record).<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations (one row per operational event; includes disinfecting and flushing events, sampling events, and restriction of public access events).<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Sampling Operations (one row per laboratory sample result; includes a field for Escherichia coli present or absent, but this export does not include an explicit total coliform result field).<br></li>



<li>Public Notices Report (one row per public notice; includes whether the water system was turned off and whether an alternative was provided).<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Disinfecting and Flushing Operations (used as a cross-check subset of disinfecting and flushing events).<br></li>
</ol>



<h3 id="h-study-window-and-file-specific-filters"><strong>Study window and file-specific filters</strong></h3>



<p>All files were filtered to October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2025 (inclusive).</p>



<p>Violations Report: Violations were counted using an overlap method that requires a begin date and an end date. A violation record was included if Date Violation Began was on or before September 30, 2025 and Date Violation Ended was on or after October 1, 2022. Violation rows with missing Date Violation Ended values cannot be evaluated for overlap and are excluded from overlap-based counting.</p>



<p>Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations: Events were included if the event date fell within the study window.</p>



<p>Aircraft Sampling Operations: Laboratory results were included if Results Received On fell within the study window.</p>



<p>Public Notices Report: Notices were included if the notice date fell within the study window.</p>



<h3 id="h-airline-universe"><strong>Airline universe</strong></h3>



<p>The analysis was restricted to a fixed universe of 1 airlines (10 major airlines and 11 regional airlines). Airlines not on this list were excluded from scoring. If an airline had no records in the provided files during the study window, it is listed with fleet size equal to 0 and marked not rated.</p>



<h3 id="h-fleet-size-definition"><strong>Fleet size definition</strong></h3>



<p>Fleet size for each airline was defined as the number of unique aircraft tail numbers appearing for that airline in any of the following within the study window:</p>



<ul>
<li>Violations Report<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations<br></li>



<li>Aircraft Sampling Operations<br></li>



<li>Public Notices Report<br></li>
</ul>



<p>This yields a consistent per-aircraft denominator for rate calculations.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-total-coliform-present-is-identified-in-these-files"><strong>How total coliform present is identified in these files</strong></h3>



<p>In this export set, total coliform present or absent is available at the sample-location level inside the Aircraft Drinking Water System Operations file for rows where Event equals Sample. These rows contain a Details field that includes two sampling locations per row, each introduced by the literal string Location:.</p>



<p>Within each location block, the total coliform result appears as text in forms including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total Coliform:&lt;b&gt;Present&lt;/b&gt;<br></li>



<li>Total Coliform:&lt;b&gt;Absent&lt;/b&gt;<br>and sometimes without bold tags (for example, Total Coliform: Present).<br></li>
</ul>



<p>For this study, the Details field was parsed by splitting each Sample row into its two Location blocks, removing markup tags such as &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; (and other HTML tags when present), and extracting the total coliform result from each block. Each Location block counted as one sample location tested. A location was counted as total coliform positive if the extracted value was present.</p>



<p>The same location block also includes Escherichia coli as present, absent, or did not speciate. This allowed the study to report both total coliform positives and indicator positives (total coliform present with Escherichia coli absent).</p>



<h3 id="h-how-maximum-contaminant-level-violations-for-escherichia-coli-are-identified"><strong>How Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli are identified</strong></h3>



<p>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli were counted when Violation Type equals Maximum Contaminant Level (Escherichia coli) in the violations export. Violations of type Monitoring (Escherichia coli speciate) are not counted as Maximum Contaminant Level violations.</p>



<h3 id="h-public-notices-and-response-penalties"><strong>Public notices and response penalties</strong></h3>



<p>Public notices were taken from the Public Notices Report. Two response fields were used for penalty logic:</p>



<ul>
<li>Was Water System Turned Off?<br></li>



<li>Alternative Provided?<br></li>
</ul>



<p>A response was treated as affirmative only when the field value was clearly Yes (or equivalent affirmative forms). Any non-affirmative or blank value was treated as not affirmative.</p>



<h3 id="h-water-safety-score-0-00-to-5-00"><strong>Water Safety Score (0.00 to 5.00)</strong></h3>



<p>Each airline received five sub-scores on a 1 to 5 scale, combined using fixed weights:</p>



<ul>
<li>Violations per aircraft: 20 percent (lower is scored better, using quintiles; 0 is always scored as 5).<br></li>



<li>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli: 35 percent (hard step penalty; 0 is scored as 5, 1 is scored as 2, 2 or more is scored as 1).<br></li>



<li>Indicator-positive rate (total coliform present with Escherichia coli absent, percent): 20 percent (lower is scored better, using quintiles; 0 is always scored as 5).<br></li>



<li>Public notices per 100 aircraft: 15 percent (lower is scored better, using quintiles; 0 is always scored as 5).<br></li>



<li>Disinfecting and flushing events per aircraft: 10 percent (higher is scored better, using quintiles).<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Public notice response penalties were then applied:</p>



<ul>
<li>Subtract 0.5 if the airline had at least one public notice where an alternative was not clearly provided.<br></li>



<li>Subtract 1.0 if the airline had at least one public notice where the water system was not clearly turned off.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Quintile threshold handling for reproducibility: for quintile-based sub-scores, values equal to a percentile threshold are assigned to the higher-performing bin (for example, greater than or equal to the 20th percentile threshold is scored in the 20th-to-40th percentile bin, and greater than or equal to the 80th percentile threshold is scored in the top bin).</p>



<p>Final score is bounded at a minimum of 0.00 and reported to two decimal places.</p>



<p>Grades were assigned as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>4.50 or higher: Grade A<br></li>



<li>3.50 to 4.49: Grade B<br></li>



<li>2.50 to 3.49: Grade C<br></li>



<li>1.50 to 2.49: Grade D<br></li>



<li>Below 1.50: Grade F<br></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-drove-the-scores"><strong>What drove the scores</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli were the strongest downward driver. Because this component carries the largest weight and uses a hard step penalty, airlines with multiple Maximum Contaminant Level violations for Escherichia coli are structurally pushed toward lower scores.<br></li>



<li>The indicator-positive rate (total coliform present with Escherichia coli absent) varied widely across airlines. Across all airlines, the indicator-positive rate was 2.51 percent. The indicator-positive rate was higher among regional airlines (4.52 percent) than among major airlines (1.77 percent) in this study window.<br></li>



<li>Violations per aircraft ranged from very low to very high. Some airlines showed very low violations per aircraft (for example, Delta Air Lines Incorporated and Frontier Airlines Incorporated). Others showed high violations per aircraft (for example, Sun Country Airlines, Republic Airways Incorporated, and JetBlue Airways Corporation), which materially reduced their scores.<br></li>



<li>Public notice response behavior is explicitly penalized when required fields are not clearly affirmative. In this study window, the score includes response penalties for:<br></li>

<h2 id="h-passenger-risk-reduction-guidance"><strong>Passenger Risk-Reduction Guidance</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>Do not drink unbottled aircraft tap water.<br></li>



<li>Avoid coffee and tea made with onboard tap water when feasible.<br></li>



<li>Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60 percent alcohol when soap-and-water options are limited.<br></li>



<li>Bring sealed beverages. Purchase sealed bottled water after airport security screening or fill a reusable bottle at airport bottle-filling stations before boarding.<br></li>



<li>Use extra caution on international routes because refilling practices and standards can vary and contamination introduced during servicing can persist when hygiene problems exist.<br></li>



<li>If you must use aircraft tap water, let it run for about 30 seconds before use to flush stagnant water from the lines. This is only a partial measure and does not address conditions in the main storage tanks.<br></li>
</ol>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-limitations"><strong>Limitations</strong></h2>



<ol>
<li>This is a compliance and monitoring signal scorecard, not a guarantee of water quality on any specific flight.<br></li>



<li>Total coliform results were extracted from the sample-location text embedded in the system operations Details field for Sample events. This approach is reproducible and validated in this report, but it depends on consistent formatting of those Details strings.<br></li>



<li>The Aircraft Sampling Operations export includes Escherichia coli present or absent, but does not include an explicit total coliform result field in this export. For that reason, the total coliform analyses in this report use the sample-location results embedded in the system operations file.<br></li>



<li>Fleet-normalized metrics improve comparability, but airlines differ in utilization patterns and operational footprint. Utilization differences are not fully captured in these files.<br></li>



<li>Violation records with missing Date Violation Ended values cannot be evaluated for overlap and are excluded from overlap-based totals.<br></li>
