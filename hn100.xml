<p>A Proton spokesperson tells Mashable that when it built its VPN "to help people in authoritarian countries with online censorship, an access gateway for porn was obviously not what we had in mind." Still, they add, "VPN can be used in this way and signups from France have temporarily increased by a factor of 10."</p><p>A <a href="https://mashable.com/roundup/best-vpns" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">VPN</a>, or <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-a-vpn-1" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">virtual private network</a>, is a service that routes your internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel to a remote server before sending it out onto the web. The <a href="https://mashable.com/article/why-use-a-vpn" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">main purpose of a VPN</a> is to reclaim some online privacy from your ISP and other prying eyes. But they're also commonly used to spoof one's location: A VPN can make it appear as though its user is visiting websites from a country they're not physically in.</p>
<p>Age-verification laws for adult content have been enacted abroad and in <a href="https://mashable.com/article/pornhub-blocked-states-2025" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">nearly 20 U.S. states</a>. They typically require sites to verify their users' ages via facial recognition or government ID. Such laws are intended to restrict children's access to adult content (and in some cases social media), but experts have flagged <a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-are-age-verification-bills-porn-louisiana-utah" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">free speech and privacy concerns</a>. What's more, technology like VPNs makes enforcement difficult.</p>
<p>For its part, Proton shares these concerns. "There's no such thing as age verification for children only, it's age verification for everyone, and having offshore porn sites or any other third parties collect IDs from adults and becoming a repository of potential blackmail material comes with its own risks," said the company's spokesperson. "A more technically sound approach would be content controls directly implemented on the devices parents chose to give their children."</p><p>Founded in 2014, the Swiss-based Proton offers a suite of privacy-centric web services, including email and cloud storage. Its VPN service was launched in 2017 and currently maintains a massive network of more than 13,000 servers in 117 countries worldwide. To date, it's the only VPN we've tested that's won a Mashable Choice Award. <a href="https://mashable.com/review/protonvpn-review" target="_blank" data-ga-click="1" data-ga-label="$text" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-module="content_body">Read our full Proton VPN review for more information.</a></p>

  <p>The recent release of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV:_Oblivion_Remastered">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has rekindled the public’s interest in the 19-year-old RPG classic, making it once again — at least temporarily — one of the most played and talked about Bethesda Game Studios titles. The remaster is a comprehensive upgrade of the original, featuring fully remade yet mostly faithful graphics, select gameplay improvements and a redesigned user interface. But it is still Oblivion, and I don’t mean that in the sense that it “maintains the spirit of the original game” or something like that. The remaster is quite literally built on top of the original game; the Oblivion from 2006, including its game engine and content, is still there, just with an Unreal Engine 5 wrapper handling the audio-visual side of things.</p>

<p>And that is interesting because Oblivion was a very ambitious game for its time. The world was huge, the graphics were cutting edge, but perhaps more importantly, it promised to deliver a dynamic and living world, with over a thousand fully voice-acted non-player characters (NPCs). The technology powering this was called <strong>Radiant AI</strong>, but it was too ambitious for its time and was mostly cut from the final game. Or maybe it was used in Oblivion, but Bethesda gave up on it before shipping Fallout 3 and / or Skyrim. Or maybe it was never really there in the first place, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Howard">Todd</a> lied to us all along. What was Radiant AI, anyway?</p>
<p>This is a topic I’ve seen discussed in online spaces for quite literally decades, and the Oblivion remaster has brought it back into the spotlight once again among the terminally online. People mostly know it as the original Bethesda controversy; one of the first times <abbr title="Bethesda Game Studios">BGS</abbr> promised something they ultimately couldn’t deliver. However, very few people outside of the most hardcore fans and modders have even tried to understand it themselves. And by understanding, I mean the whole thing: why was it needed, what it was promised to be, what it actually was, and where it is now. This mammoth of an article (<em>looks nervously at the reading time estimate</em>) is my attempt to do just that.</p>
<p>This was supposed to be a short sidequest; a hopefully straightforward explanation of what Radiant AI is, and an opportunity to correct some of the popular misconceptions about it. But alas, things rarely are that simple. I’ve scoured through old RPG forums, fansites, modding tutorials and scans of early 2000s gaming magazines. I’ve spent maybe a couple dozen hours just exploring how Bethesda games work using their modding tools, from Morrowind to Starfield (which I had to buy just to check some facts). I even had to resort to reading the source code to the various script extender mods and DLL plugins — that’s how scarce the information is. Still, I don’t feel that I’m the most qualified person to write about this, as experienced Bethesda modders would have known a lot of this already. It is almost guaranteed that I got something wrong, so please <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paavo.me">@ me on Bluesky</a> or elsewhere with corrections.</p>

<p>But before we can get to Radiant AI, we’ll have to go back to the island of Vvardenfell, where it all began. Well it didn’t really begin there, but let’s talk about Morrowind first anyway.</p>
<h2 id="wake-up-we-re-here"><a href="#wake-up-we-re-here" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Wake up, we’re here</h2>
<p>Video games from Bethesda Game Studios are known for many things: large open worlds, huge modding communities, mediocre combat systems, and of course, bugs. The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind wasn’t the first game in the series — hence the roman III in the title — but it established many of the conventions that would define <abbr title="Bethesda Game Studios First-Person Role-Playing Games">BGSFPRPGs</abbr> for the next two (and soon three) decades. It was the first game to be built with Bethesda’s new game engine — a fork of Gamebryo, later rebranded as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_Engine">Creation Engine</a> — which is still in use today, and brought the series into the hardware-accelerated 3D era. Morrowind pivoted from Daggerfall’s mostly procedurally generated world to a handcrafted one, which has arguably been the most important aspect of Bethesda’s games since then. It also had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0et8bWoEJk">some of the prettiest water</a> and sky effects of 2002, enabled by newfangled pixel shader technology.</p>
<p>But something was missing. Well quite a lot was missing — such as diagonal walking animations and a decent combat system, features which Bethesda games didn’t really have until Skyrim — but the most notable omission from a modern perspective was the lack of any kind of scheduled NPC behavior and / or non-combat AI. The denizens of Vvardenfell stand around night and day, rain or shine, waiting for the player to interact with them, like comically overworked employees of a depressing Disney theme park.</p>
<p>NPCs can be scripted to walk around aimlessly, or to follow the player or some other entity, but the system is so limited that to my knowledge NPCs that were placed outside can never enter a building, and vice versa. The characters usually have quite a lot to say, but they don’t really do anything unless the player (and / or a quest script) is involved. While Morrowind was groundbreaking in many ways, <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NPCScheduling">NPC schedules</a> were already kind of a standard feature in some other RPGs, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_(series)">Ultima series</a>, Troika Games’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcanum:_Of_Steamworks_and_Magick_Obscura">Arcanum</a>, and the beloved eurojank classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_(video_game)">Gothic</a>.</p>
<p>But then everything changed with Oblivion.</p>

</a>Announcement and cover story</h3>
<p>I didn’t follow the pre-release hype for Oblivion (I was under 10 years old at the time), but from what I’ve gathered there was a lot of it. Oblivion was announced in September 2004 with a short statement <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040911090419/http://www.elderscrolls.com/index.php">on the official Elder Scrolls website</a>, followed by a GameInformer cover story in October, which I was able to find <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-informer-issue-138-october-2004/page/50/mode/2up">on the Internet Archive</a>. The 12-page article covered the game’s setting, new combat system and many of its new graphical features, accompanied by several unbelievably good-looking screenshots. Look at those trees, that grass, that lovely <abbr title="High Dynamic Range">HDR</abbr> bloom! Only next-generation consoles like Xbox 2 and Nintendo Revolution are capable of such a level of photorealism!</p>

</figure>
<p>The article also covered the new AI system, though the term “Radiant AI” was not used yet. Here’s the relevant bit from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The technology powering this next generation title is doing so much more than simply making everything look great, it’s also changing the rules of how virtual game worlds function. As mentioned before, the area of Tamriel that is the setting for Oblivion is populated with 1,000 NPCs. Unlike current games, these characters don’t simply disappear once the player leaves the area, they exist 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Every character has its own virtual life and its own schedule to follow.</p>
<p>Each of the 1,000 characters in the game is given a basic schedule of events to follow throughout each virtual day. They will shop, explore, eat, report for work, and more. However, while the characters are told what goals they need to accomplish, they are not told how to complete them. For example, a peasant who wants food may acquire it in several different ways. If the character has money, he will probably buy food; but if he is broke, he will try to obtain it some other way. He may go out into the forest to hunt, but hunting in the wrong place may get the guards on his case for poaching. So, the character may opt to steal food — he may even try to steal from you.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Guards will certainly be sent out after you if you scoff at the law, but you may also witness them hunting down an NPC who has committed a crime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This bit is slightly less relevant, but you’ll find it funny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odkmx8sDi1o">if you’ve ever played Oblivion</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Interaction between the player and the virtual characters that populate the game is yet another area in which Oblivion is pointing towards the future of gaming. Characters will converse with one another in free-flowing, non-scripted discussions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With articles like this, it’s impossible to know which statements are accurate representations of Bethesda’s claims, and which, if any, were inferred or even made up by the journalist. We’ll interrogate these claims later, but for now we can say that a large share of Oblivion’s pre-release hype originated from this article. It wasn’t the only one, though. Soon after the exclusive cover story Bethesda published more information <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041102053002/http://www.elderscrolls.com/games/oblivion_overview.htm">on their website</a> and did a round of interviews with various gaming media outlets. Here’s what they said about AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oblivion features a groundbreaking new AI system, called Radiant AI, which gives non-player characters (NPCs) the ability to make their own choices based on the world around them. They’ll decide where to eat or who to talk to and what they’ll say. They’ll sleep, go to church, and even steal items, all based on their individual characteristics. Full facial animations and lip-synching, combined with full speech for all dialog, allows NPCs to come to life like never before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I believe this is the first time the term “Radiant AI” was used publicly.</p>
<h3 id="the-e3-2005-demo"><a href="#the-e3-2005-demo" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The E3 2005 demo</h3>
<p>The second most important source of information (and hype) about the game and especially Radiant AI was the E3 demo in May 2005. Shame the gamma is completely off in the video — all the interior and nighttime scenes look like they were filmed in a dark cave — but this is the best quality version I could find.</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZJ4Osk2yNo?start=741" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Todd Howard</b>: Our new Radiant AI system … allows NPCs to have full 24/7 schedules. These NPCs are not scripted. We give them general goals, and they figure out on their own how to accomplish them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 6-minute Radiant AI section of the demo Todd Howard’s character walks through the city of <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Chorrol">Chorrol</a>, overhearing a conversation between two NPCs (which is much smoother than anything that actually made it into the final game), and picks up a new quest. He then enters <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Renoit%27s_Books">Renoit’s Books</a>, gets an impossibly dynamic introduction from the shopkeeper, and plays a very early version of the persuasion minigame. Then more Radiant AI stuff happens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Todd Howard</b>: She (note: the shopkeeper) has decided she wants to practice her marksman skills, so she’s picked up a bow over here; she’s decided she needs ammo so she equips the quiver. And she can practice her skills; the same skill system governs her…. and she sucks.
<b>(In-game) Estelle Renoit</b>: Terrible! Just terrible! I need a little pick-me-up.
<b>Todd Howard</b>: And they’ll even detect potions in the environment if they need them, so she’s going to drink this potion, it’s going to increase her marksman skill; have the same effect on her that it would have on me if I drank it. It automatically raises her skill, and now she’s good at this activity, and that just works through the system.
<b>Estelle Renoit</b>: That’s better!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several more little things happen: Estelle picks up a piece of meat, feeds it to her dog, sits down to read a book, casts <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Paralyze">Paralyze</a> on the dog, and sits down again for a meal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Todd Howard</b>: They’ll eat if they need to, how they get the food is up to them. They can steal it, they can buy it, they can grow it. Sleep when they want to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, she casts a fire spell to shoo the dog away and goes to bed. The demo moves on to the next section.</p>
<p>Many interesting things happened in the demo, and I’ll go through some of them in more detail later. Todd’s narration does kind of imply that the NPCs in Oblivion have needs and desires, and that they will autonomously try to fulfill them.</p>
<h3 id="fan-interviews-and-forum-quotes"><a href="#fan-interviews-and-forum-quotes" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Fan interviews and forum quotes</h3>
<p>Bethesda conducted a total of three “fan interviews” (essentially <abbr title="Ask Me Anything">AMA</abbr>s of the era) on the official <abbr title="The Elder Scrolls">TES</abbr> forums; one every year from 2004 to 2006. All three were organised by VP of PR Pete Hines with answers provided by creative director Todd Howard. The first one was on December 8th 2004, which I was able to find from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041215210419/http://www.elderscrolls.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=33750">Internet Archive</a>. It was also mirrored on <a href="http://chorrol.com/fan_interview1.html">Chorrol.com</a> (named Waiting for Oblivion at the time), which is perhaps surprisingly still online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: In regards to the new Radiant AI system, it has been stated that NPCs will be able to think and react independently of scripts. Does this mean that a player could order an NPC to do something (if in the position of a guild head, etc.), or perhaps find a random unscripted quest due to independent NPC actions?</p>
<p>A: Yes, we can do those things. I’m not saying they are in there, and we’re toying now with watching NPCs do things and how we can really get the player to affect that or have more fun with it, or even see it. So I won’t give specific examples right now, but we’ll be trying some similar things in places. I can tell you that our goal for the Radiant AI was the “Fargoth” quest in the beginning of Morrowind, which took some heavy scripting to get Fargoth to behave well, sneak around, steal the ring, put it in the stump, and such. Our early goal for the Radiant AI was that kind of thing just “happening”, without any scripting. And it works - which is great. But if we didn’t tell you what Fargoth was up to, you would have never noticed, or it would have looked really odd. Anyway, that’s the stage we’re at, we have the behaviors, and we’re trying to maximize the player’s perception of what’s happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two more fan interviews were conducted in 2005 and 2006, the latter just before the game’s release. I couldn’t be bothered to find the original links to TES forums, but I’ll assume the Chorrol.com reposts are accurate.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://chorrol.com/fan_interview3.html">Fan Interview #3</a> (2006)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Q: We’ve read that it’s possible for “friends” to join a faction along side you and you can watch them progress. Is this governed by RAI or is it a specific quest thing? Is it even possible to make friends like that?</p>
<p>A: Radiant AI is a global system that governs every action of NPCs. While we use it to do grand, overarching things like dictating how and where NPCs spend their days and nights, we also use it in much smaller sequences to do things as mundane as moving a character across a room to pick up an item. So, <b>in a way, everything NPCs do is at some point governed by Radiant AI</b>. In certain factions, you will meet what we term “continuing characters.” These are characters who you will come into contact with at several different points throughout the questline. You can talk to them, watch them grow, influence them, and perhaps even go on quests with them and alter their paths through the game.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bethesda’s developers were surprisingly active on both their official forums and other communities leading up to Oblivion’s release, and Chorrol.com / Waiting for Oblivion gathered these quotes into one place. Unfortunately the individual quotes do not link to their original sources, so I can’t easily verify them, but there’s no reason for me to believe that they’d be fabricated.</p>

</ul>
<p>I’m surprised Bethesdians even bothered to answer some of these questions, as many seem like pure trolling not even worth a response. But there is good stuff too, such as an almost complete description of how Radiant AI works (in offsite quotes #1), which I will not repeat here, except for one important part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read a book on AI, and you’ll find things very similar to what we’re doing. <b>The reason it’s AI and not scripting is because it uses goals and rules to determine how something is going to be accomplished.</b> The designer establishes the goals, sets parameters (such as responsibility, aggression, confidence) on the actors, and leaves it up to the rules that have been established in the code to determine how the behavior plays out. It is most definitely artificial intelligence in the academic sense of the word.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Related to that, one of the developers (<a href="https://pt.uesp.net/wiki/General:Steve_Meister">Steve Meister</a> aka MrSmileyFaceDude) also directly addresses the E3 demo (in offsite quotes #2):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the bookseller sequence. No, the entire thing was not scripted — not in the sense that it represents a designer typing in hundreds of lines of script code. In the sense that it’s a sequence of events that happen in a particular order, you might consider it scripted, but the way you set up those events, and how the actors accomplish them, is not scripted.</p>
<p>For example, the target practice. All she’s told to start practicing (basically) is “fire a certain number of arrows at this target from this location.” That’s it. There’s a bow in the room, so she automatically goes to get it first. There’s also a quiver in the room, so she goes to get that. She then equips the items, walks over to the firing point, and shoots a few arrows. The arrows miss the target not because she has been scripted to shoot at points away from the target, but because her marksman skill is low.</p>
<p>That’s the difference. She’s given a basic goal, and figures out how to accomplish it based on what she has available to her and her stats.</p>
<p>The sequence is a set of examples of the kinds of things you can do with RAI — including grouping a sequence of AI packages together to produce a tight, deterministic sequence of events.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The video is the same thing we showed at E3. It’s pieces &amp; sections of existing game content and a lot of stuff made specifically for the E3 demo (for example, the entire sequence inside the bookstore — including all of the dialogue — was made for E3 in order to demonstrate some of the things you can do with RAI.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also have our first story about Radiant AI being “too smart” and causing problems (in offsite quotes #3, from <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:Emil_Pagliarulo">Emil Pagliarulo</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, here’s the thing with Radiant AI… If you ask, “Can the NPCs do this? Or can they do that?” They answer is yes, with RAI, they can do a ton of stuff. But the player is unlikely to see some of it for a variety of reasons. For example, if the player hits an NPC with a spell and they get poisoned, would the NPC try to purchase a cure posion potion? Well, no, not likely, because he’s going to be too busy trying to kill the player, and besides, the poison probably won’t last that long.</p>
<p>And, in some cases, we the developers have had to consciously tone down the types of behavior they carry out. Again, why? Because sometimes, the AI is so goddamned smart and determined it screws up our quests! Seriously, sometimes it’s gotten so weird it’s like dealing with a holodeck that’s gone sentient. Imagine playing the Sims, and your Sims have a penchant for murder and theft. So a lot of the time this stuff is funny, and amazing, and emergent, and it’s awesome when it happens. Other times, it’s so unexpected, it breaks stuff. Designers need a certain amount of control over the scenarios they create, and things can go haywire when NPCs have a mind of their own.</p>
<p>Funny example: In one Dark Brotherhood quest, you can meet up with this shady merchant who sells skooma. During testing, the NPC would be dead when the player got to him. Why? NPCs from the local skooma den were trying to get their fix, didn’t have any skooma, and were killing the merchant to get it!</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Radiant AI functionality going haywire (like in the example of the skooma dealer being killed) — No, we haven’t removed any functionality. Those things are generally dealt with on a per-scenario basis. We’d tweak the NPCs, etc. to get the desired behavior.</p>

</a>Radiant AI misbehavior and a mysterious quote</h3>
<p>There is this one bit of text about Radiant AI shenanigans I’ve seen repeated verbatim throughout the years, but it’s never attributed to anyone or any source, so I don’t know where it comes from. The oldest copy of the quote I could find is <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=105339">a post on TTLG forums</a> in April 2006, just a couple of weeks after Oblivion’s release. Sorry for the wall of text; I promise this is the last long quote in this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oblivion boasts a new artificial intelligence system, fully developed in house by Bethesda, codenamed ‘Radiant AI’. It aims to counter what was believed to be one of the major flaws of the previous installment (The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind): the lack of ‘life’ of the NPCs in the game. Radiant AI gives every NPC a set of ‘needs’ (such as hunger) that they will need to fulfill, thus creating a more lifelike world.</p>
<p>Radiant AI works by giving NPCs a list of goals. Nothing else is scripted. They must decide how to achieve these goals by themselves based on their individual statistics. A hungry NPC might compare his current gold against his moral values to decide whether he will walk to a store and purchase food, or just steal it; a skilled archer can choose to hunt his own deer.</p>
<p>This has required massive testing, but has even greater long-term flexibility for future NPC AI as well as testing with PAC AI for further developments.</p>
<p>The following are examples of unexpected behavior discovered during early testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>One character was given a rake and the goal “rake leaves”; another was given a broom and the goal “sweep paths,” and this worked smoothly. Then they swapped the items, so that the raker was given a broom and the sweeper was given the rake. In the end, one of them killed the other so he could get the proper item.</li>
<li>Another test had an on-duty NPC guard become hungry. The guard went into the forest to hunt for food. The other guards also left to arrest the truant guard, leaving the town unprotected. The villager NPCs then looted all of the shops, due to the lack of law enforcement.</li>
<li>In another test a minotaur was given a task of protecting a unicorn. However, the minotaur repeatedly tried to kill the unicorn because he was set to be an aggressive creature.</li>
<li>In one Dark Brotherhood quest, the player can meet up with a shady merchant who sells skooma, an in-game drug. During testing, the NPC would be dead when the player got to him. The reason was that NPCs from the local skooma den were trying to get their fix, didn’t have any money, and so were killing the merchant to get it.</li>
<li>While testing to confirm that the physics models for a magical item known as the “Skull of Corruption,” which creates an evil copy of the character/monster it is used on, were working properly, a tester dropped the item on the ground. An NPC immediately picked it up and used it on the player character, creating a copy of him that proceeded to kill every NPC in sight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bethesda has been hard at work to fix these issues, balancing an NPC’s needs against his penchant for destruction so that the game world still functions in a usable fashion. In-game there are over unique 1,000 NPCs, not including monsters and randomly spawned bandits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It doesn’t sound like an official statement from Bethesda, but more like a fan summarizing different stories they’ve read or heard somewhere. Other than the aforementioned skooma dealer example, initially I couldn’t find any direct quotes from Bethesda about other cases of Radiant AI misbehavior. However, I started digging through Internet Archive’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/videogamemagazines">large collection</a> of old gaming magazines, and I managed to find a few more examples.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://archive.org/details/play-issue-040-april-2005/page/n63/mode/2up">one interview</a> with Play Magazine in April 2005, Todd Howard shared his surprise when Radiant AI caused an NPC to leave the building mid-fight to visit a nearby weapon shop for a dagger. Separately, PC Zone #165 from March 2006 <a href="https://archive.org/details/PC_Zone_165_March_2006/page/n31/mode/2up">featured an interview</a> with Pete Hines, who said that while complex AI was important, they had to scale things back (like NPCs stealing from the player) to keep the game understandable; otherwise a player might assume their items disappeared due to a bug. The magazine’s following April issue then <a href="https://archive.org/details/PC_Zone_166_April_2006/page/n21/mode/2up">previewed Oblivion</a> — it was already out, but paper-based magazines had long lead times — featuring a story about Radiant AI from an unnamed developer. This story closely matched the <em>Skull of Corruption</em> anecdote from the mystery quote, just without naming the item, and was followed up by this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While it’s likely that such craziness will be removed from the final game for the sake of balance (unfortunately), it’s clear that Bethesda’s new Radiant AI system will still be very impressive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So naturally the game <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Exploitable_Glitches#Permanently_Clone_Yourself">shipped</a> with the player-cloning exploit, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1kcrf7u/skull_of_corruption_duping_method_still_works/">it even works</a> in the remaster 19 years later.</p>
<p>While I wasn’t able to find sources for all of the Radiant AI examples, I think we can fairly safely conclude that this was indeed a fan summary of various stories and quotes from Bethesda and / or the press, probably originally posted to some forum that no longer exists. Some of the scenarios can still happen or could at least be implemented in the final game, but others sound like early ideas that were cut early — or were never even fully implemented. Mystery solved, at least partially.</p>
<h3 id="release-and-reactions"><a href="#release-and-reactions" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Release and reactions</h3>
<p>Oblivion was released in March 2006 to almost universal acclaim and commercial success. It ended up becoming a generation-defining game, and is arguably one of the main contributors to why open-world games are still so popular today.</p>
<p>But there was some critique, as always, and it didn’t take long for the first complaints about Radiant AI’s shortcomings to appear. Even in Game Informer’s February 2006 <a href="https://archive.org/details/game-informer-issue-154-february-2006_202409/page/78/mode/2up">preview article</a> the author noted that the “complex AI governing their (the NPCs) actions wasn’t very overt”, and that he didn’t observe any behaviors like NPCs stealing food or honing their skills. The <a href="https://www.ttlg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=105339">TTLG forum thread</a> where I sourced the subject of the previous section was full of people wondering and arguing about the capabilities and limitations of Radiant AI, and how it compared to the E3 demo and other pre-release material.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-was-radiant-ai"><a href="#so-what-was-radiant-ai" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>So what was Radiant AI?</h2>
<p>Important and hopefully obvious disclaimer, because it’s 2025: Radiant AI has nothing to do with the current wave of AI hype. It has nothing to do with large language models, generative AI, neural networks or anything like that. While Radiant AI does utilize some ideas from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligence">classical artificial intelligence</a>, video game AI is fundamentally about creating the illusion of intelligence; the goal is to make formidable foes and interesting characters, not to create a being capable of passing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing test</a>. Think Pac-Man or Metal Gear Solid, not ChatGPT. Back to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>
<p>A cynical and / or pedantic take would be that Radiant AI was a nebulous marketing term that didn’t really mean anything specific. It’s something that you put in the game pitch deck on a slide titled “The three core pillars of the Oblivion experience” or something, and then later some poor sod had to figure out what the execs meant by that.</p>
<p>I think there’s an element of truth to that; Radiant AI isn’t really a specific game system or mechanic, but rather an umbrella term for all of the new AI features that were being developed for Oblivion. I’ve seen the persuasion minigame, the surreal NPC conversations (“I saw a mudcrab the other day”) and even combat AI being described as “Radiant” by fans and Bethesda alike, not to mention Skyrim’s largely unrelated <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Radiant">Radiant quests</a>. In my mind Radiant AI as it exists in the final game consists of three parts: the character system, the massively expanded AI package system, and the dialogue / conversation system. The AI package system is probably the most important one, so from now on when I refer to Radiant AI as a system, I usually mean “the thing that makes AI packages work”, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<h3 id="character-attributes"><a href="#character-attributes" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Character attributes</h3>
<p>Oblivion’s NPCs and creatures — collectively referred to as actors — are not too different from the player’s character from a game systems perspective. They have the same set of base attributes (strength, intelligence, agility, etc.) as the player, they have inventories and spell lists, and they can belong to factions. NPCs go further than your average cave bear or will-o-the-wisp; they have the same set of skills as the player (athletics, blade, sneak, etc.) and they actually use the armor and weapons they are carrying. Some creatures (such as goblins) also have the ability to use normal weapons and shields.</p>
<p>Every actor also tracks their <strong>disposition</strong> values toward the player and every other actor in the game world. It’s a number between 0 and 100 that determines how friendly or hostile the actor is toward the other party. Disposition can be gained and lost in various ways, but the most prominent one is through the goofy <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Speechcraft#Persuasion_Guide">Persuasion minigame</a> (“Don’t talk such rot!”). My understanding is that base disposition between any two parties is computed from faction memberships (e.g., guards inherently dislike members of the Thieves Guild), and then modified by various actions.</p>
<p>Actors have four more attributes (all integers between 0 and 100-ish) that exist solely for controlling AI behavior. These are:</p>
<h4 id="aggression"><a href="#aggression" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Aggression</h4>
<p>Determines how low the disposition to another actor / the player can go before the actor becomes hostile. If it’s low enough, the actor refuses to fight even in self-defense; if it’s high enough, the actor will attack absolutely anyone —including their allies — on sight. Usually it’s somewhere in the middle.</p>
<h4 id="confidence"><a href="#confidence" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Confidence</h4>
<p>Determines how low the actor’s health can go (as a percentage of their maximum health) in combat before they try to flee. Seems pretty straightforward, but it can also be used a bit creatively. As the wiki <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Confidence">points out</a>, the deer in the game have a confidence value of 0, meaning they’ll always try to flee any other actor they encounter regardless of damage taken, making them very skittish.</p>
<h4 id="energy-level"><a href="#energy-level" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Energy level</h4>
<p>Least interesting and understood of the four attributes, which apparently affects how often the character moves while wandering around, and possibly something else as well. Next one, please.</p>
<h4 id="responsibility"><a href="#responsibility" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Responsibility</h4>
<p>This is the most interesting one, as it determines how much the actor respects the law. At 100, the actor telepathically reports any crime they witness to the guards — apparently including even when getting sneakily assassinated themselves. At 30 or lower the actor won’t snitch on your crimes, but more interestingly they will also commit crimes themselves to complete their goals — more on that in the next section. Low-responsibility shopkeepers also buy your stolen goods, which is how the fences unlocked via the Thieves Guild questline work.</p>
<h4 id="needs-or-lack-thereof"><a href="#needs-or-lack-thereof" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Needs, or lack thereof</h4>
<p>If you aren’t too familiar with Oblivion’s internals, you might be wondering if I forgot about actors’ needs, such as hunger and sleep. After all, didn’t almost every pre-release article and interview mention or at least imply that characters have needs and desires, and that they will try to fulfill them? Well, yes and no. Oblivion’s actors do not have any needs in the same way as the characters in The Sims or Dwarf Fortress do. NPCs have schedules which usually involve at least sleeping and eating, but they don’t actually need to do anything to survive, and these activities do not affect them in any way. In this area, Oblivion’s characters function like typical video game NPCs, even though The Sims was named multiple times as an inspiration for Radiant AI.</p>
<h3 id="ai-packages"><a href="#ai-packages" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>AI packages</h3>
<p>All actors can be assigned one or more AI packages, and the same package can be assigned to multiple actors to re-use the same behavior. Each package is responsible for a single behavior or action at some time and with specific conditions — like wandering around the city market every day for 4 hours starting at noon when it’s not raining. Only one package can be active at a time, and the actor will automatically switch to the next one when the current one is finished or interrupted. AI packages weren’t used just for driving daily routines, as they are also very important for quests and other scripted events.</p>
<p>There is <em>some</em> documentation about the system in the unofficial copy / backup of the <a href="https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/AI_Package">Oblivion Construction Set Wiki</a> but it’s far from comprehensive, so I’ve had to figure a lot of it out myself by inspecting Oblivion’s game content in the Construction Set, doing some good-old-fashioned Googling and by building a test level to conduct deeply unethical experiments.</p>

<p>AI packages aren’t technically a new feature, as Morrowind had a very limited version of them. However, they are so much more powerful in Oblivion that it’s effectively a new system.</p>
<details>
<summary>Quick modding wiki rant</summary>
<p>On a side note, the modding wiki is unofficial because Bethesda apparently shut down all of their official modding resources a couple of years ago, and all of the wikis <a href="https://wiki.bethesda.net/Main/Maintenance/">are still down</a> for “maintenance” at the time of writing — a bit odd for some of the most-modded games of all time. Things are even worse for Starfield, as from what I’ve gathered there’s literally no publicly available documentation for it at all. However, the Construction Set / GECK / Creation Kit tends to evolve quite slowly, and there are interfaces in the Starfield toolset that have remained largely unchanged for about 20 years.</p>
</details>
<p>What an AI package actually <em>does</em> depends mostly on its type. There are several different types of packages, including but not limited to:</p>
<h4 id="travel"><a href="#travel" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Travel</h4>
<p>Makes the actor travel to a location, such as a specific (invisible) marker in the world, or to the nearest entity of a certain type (e.g., a bed or a chair). It doesn’t matter if the destination is in the same room or across the world, the actor will always try to get there.</p>
<h4 id="wander"><a href="#wander" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Wander</h4>
<p>Like traveling, but without a fixed destination. The most common application is to make an actor walk randomly around town or a dungeon. This continues until the scheduled time is over, or until the actor is interrupted by something else.</p>
<h4 id="find-and-a-bit-about-npc-crimes"><a href="#find-and-a-bit-about-npc-crimes" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Find (and a bit about NPC crimes)</h4>
<p>Now this is where it gets interesting. A package of this type makes the actor search some location for an entity or item of a certain type, such as a weapon, a piece of food, or a creature. “Search” is perhaps a slight misnomer, as the actor doesn’t actually go rummaging through potential containers, but rather immediately knows where the closest suitable target is and goes there. What happens next depends on the type of the target: items are picked up, enemies are fought, friendly people are talked to, and so on.</p>
<p>One creative use of this package is how hunters (like <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Imperial_Legion_Forester">Imperial Legion Foresters</a>) are implemented in the game. They don’t just wander around the forest (though they do that too), but they are configured to find <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Venison">venison</a>. Deer just happen to have it in their “inventory”, so the hunter will seek them out, kill them, and then loot the meat. Theoretically if you dropped a piece of venison in the forest, at some point a hunter would find it and pick it up.</p>
<p>This is one of the package types which is affected by the responsibility attribute, which has pretty huge implications. If a character has low responsibility, it doesn’t really matter who owns the item they are looking for; they will just take it, even if it is in someone else’s pocket. Oblivion’s NPCs don’t seem to be very good at thieving, so they are almost guaranteed to get caught, especially when pickpocketing. Usually this results in the guards chasing the character down and then being <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My0lzMuNcHI">given the opportunity</a> to pay with their blood, unless they happen to carry enough money to cover the fine; NPCs can’t get arrested, so it’s either their money or their life.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that somewhere between 50 to 80% of all of the cool and weird Radiant AI stories were enabled by this package type, or any other package which internally makes use of the same behavior. As an example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-unpredictable-goblin-wars-of-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-i-introduced-controlled-chaos-whenever-i-could">the goblin war system</a> seems to be largely powered by goblins using the Find package to navigate to the location of their sacred totem staff.</p>
<h4 id="eat"><a href="#eat" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Eat</h4>
<p>It’s like a combination of Find and Travel with a bit of additional logic. If the character isn’t already carrying food, they will search the designated area for a suitable item, pick it up, find a seat if one is available, and sit down to eat. The character actually consumes the food item just like the player would, which is how and why the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Poisoned_Apple">Poisoned apple</a> item works even outside of the Dark Brotherhood quest it was designed for. Responsibility affects this package type as well; low responsibility characters have no qualms about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xebSF8vRvZI">stealing food</a> from other characters.</p>
<h4 id="useitemat"><a href="#useitemat" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>UseItemAt</h4>
<p>Makes the actor use an item from their inventory (or to find one nearby if they don’t have one) at the specified location. This can be used for various functional and purely decorative behaviors, such as making an NPC shoot arrows at a non-hostile target, to drink potions, or to make them play the animation associated with an item (e.g., reading a book or raking leaves). There’s also a very similar package type called <strong>Cast Magic</strong>, which as the name implies makes the actor cast a spell at some target.</p>
<p>In my tests, the package didn’t work quite as I expected. When an item of the target type was available, the NPC did acquire the item and use / equip it, but it did so by teleporting the item into their inventory. When the target is an item with an <a href="https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/Idle_Animations">idle animation</a> — such as a potion or a rake — the NPC doesn’t actually need the item if one isn’t available in the immediate vicinity, and will just play the animation with a nonexistent phantom item. You can probably pair it up with a Find package to make it behave more consistently. It was also easy to make the game crash to desktop when the parameters weren’t set up correctly.</p>
<h4 id="sleep"><a href="#sleep" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Sleep</h4>
<p>You can probably guess what this does at this point. The actor finds a bed, either a specific one or the nearest one in a given area, and sleeps in it as long as the package is active.</p>
<h3 id="ai-package-schedules-and-conditions"><a href="#ai-package-schedules-and-conditions" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>AI package schedules and conditions</h3>
<p>Each package has a schedule, which determines when the package can be activated. This is what powers NPC schedules in Oblivion and later games; for example, a character might have an Eat package scheduled at 8:00 AM for 2 hours, then a Wander package for the next 8 hours, then an Eat package again at 6:00 PM for 2 hours, and then a Sleep package for the rest of the night. Characters can and often do use different packages on different days of the week (like visiting a temple every Sunday — Oblivion is very Catholic), and a handful of NPCs even have scheduled packages for specific dates, like traveling to visit a distant city on the 16th of every month.</p>

</a>
  
  <figcaption>The month setting is frankly fascinating. It appears in several UIs in all BGS toolsets from Oblivion to Starfield, and to my knowledge it has never been used for anything. Apparently Daggerfall had <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Calendar">quite a lot of content</a> that only happens on specific dates of the year, but that of course was an entirely different game engine.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>The schedule is accompanied by an optional set of conditions, which add further restrictions on when the package can be activated. Conditions are quite powerful, as they can test for various things about the actor, the target, the player and the game world. Each condition consists of a function, a set of arguments and a comparison to some constant value. Multiple conditions can be combined with AND and OR operators.</p>

  <figcaption>The UI is pretty clunky (like everything else in the Construction Set), but the capabilities are pretty impressive.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>There are far too many condition functions to list them all, but here are a few of the most common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check the distance to some entity; usually the player, but it can be anything.</li>
<li>Check any actor’s race, sex, faction membership and other similar properties.</li>
<li>Check if the current actor’s inventory contains an item.</li>
<li>Check the weather, such as whether it’s raining or snowing.</li>
<li>Check the time or date.</li>
<li>Check the stage of a quest.</li>
<li>Check a global variable.</li>
<li>Or just generate a random number.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="flags-location-and-target"><a href="#flags-location-and-target" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Flags, location and target</h3>
<p>Finally, AI packages have a set of flags, and most of them have a location and / or a target. The flags are a set of boolean values that control various aspects of the package, such as whether the package can be interrupted, or if the actor is allowed to swim or ride a horse while traveling. The meaning of location and target depend on the package type, but usually the location is where the actor should go to perform the action, and the target is what the actor should interact with. For example, a Find package uses location to determine the search area, and the target is the item or creature the actor is looking for. Similarly, a UseItemAt package uses location to determine where the actor should stand while using the item, and the target is the item itself.</p>
<h3 id="how-the-world-works-and-low-level-ai-processing"><a href="#how-the-world-works-and-low-level-ai-processing" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>How the world works, and low-level AI processing</h3>
<p>In most video games consisting of more than one screen / room, the game world only really “exists” around the player (if a digital space can be said to exist at all). When you start Half-Life 2, <a href="https://combineoverwiki.net/wiki/Wallace_Breen">Dr. Breen</a> is not sitting in his office waiting for your arrival, because that place <em>does not exist</em> until the game loads a level containing it. When you disembark The Platypus at the beginning of GTA IV and arrive in <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/East_Hook">East Hook</a>, while you might be able to see <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Algonquin">Algonquin</a>’s skyline in the distance, chances are nothing else about that part of the city is loaded in memory: there are no pedestrians, no traffic, no street furniture, and so on. Usually this is not a problem as the experience would not really be any different even if those areas (that you can’t see) were populated, which is why almost every game does something like this as a very powerful performance optimization. This is enabled by several common game engine features, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">level of detail</a> (LOD) optimization, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-surface_determination#Culling_and_visible-surface_determination">culling</a> and level streaming. Check the other articles in my blog for more in-depth explanations of these topics.</p>
<p>Bethesda’s games use many of the same techniques, for the most part. The world consists of hundreds of <em>cells</em>; small chunks of the world, consisting of terrain, vegetation, buildings, actors and other objects. Interior cells (buildings and dungeons) are loaded one at a time — which is why you have loading screens when entering and leaving buildings — while exterior cells are organized in a grid and loaded within a certain radius around the player. Cells further than a few hundred meters from the player are not loaded, and are instead represented by purely decorative <abbr title="Level of detail">LOD</abbr> models.</p>
<p>What makes Radiant AI different from most other AI systems is that actors outside of the loaded cell(s) are still simulated, to an extent. Conceptually, this means that the game is simulating every actor in the world at all times; everyone goes through their routines even when you are not observing them. This is important for gameplay, because without something like it the characters would not be where you expect them to be when you return to a previously visited area; they would be stuck in whatever place and state they were in when the cell was unloaded.</p>
<p>In practice, when an actor is in an unloaded cell, their active AI package is processed in a much more simplified manner. Judging by the source codes of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/47085">EngineBugFixes</a> mod and <a href="https://github.com/llde/xOBSE/blob/b1f5b9ce2d1c45a25ad75e3a4e5ee5b5192bcbab/obse/obse/GameProcess.h">OBSE</a>, AI packages have four different levels of processing: low, low-middle, high-middle and high. Characters in the currently loaded cell(s) use high processing, which is the “normal” level; that’s when AI packages do what they are supposed to do, and characters can engage in both combat and conversations. Lower levels are used for actors in unloaded cells. What the levels lower than high actually do is not publicly documented, but it’s pretty safe to assume that these lower levels use very coarse simulation, because most things actors would interact with — like beds, food items or even the whole landscape — are not loaded in memory.</p>

  <figcaption>Actor movement in Oblivion is normally based on <a href="https://cs.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Path_Grids">path grids</a>. Instead of dealing with the messy details of a complex landscape, the pathfinding uses a simplified graph representation of the world, suitable for traditional pathfinding algorithms like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm">A*</a>. Nodes tend to be about 1 to 2 meters apart. This system was replaced with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh">nav meshes</a> in Fallout 3 and later titles.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>My understanding is that one of the only package types that does anything meaningful at these lower levels is Travel, and even that is much more limited than it normally is. The comments in the OBSE source imply that pathfinding for low-level travel happens at the cell level: the game knows which cells are connected to each other, so it doesn’t need to load the terrain to figure out how to get from one cell to another. This is presumably combined with some magic constants to estimate how long travel should take, so that the game can teleport the actor to the next cell on the path when enough time has passed. I would also expect the fast travel system to estimate travel times in a similar way, but I haven’t looked into that.</p>

</a>
  
  <figcaption>I’ve hidden the path grid and zoomed way out, and you can now see the cell boundaries as yellow dotted lines. At low AI processing levels, pathfinding happens one cell at a time. Each cell is apparently about 64x64 yards, or about 59x59 meters for most of the world.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>This is a pretty smart way of doing things in a performance-sensible way, but it comes with obvious limitations. I have read some anecdotes from players of both Oblivion and Skyrim who claim that they’ve experienced characters dying to bandits or some other hazard while traveling on their own, but from my understanding of the system this is not possible. The low-level AI processing mode does not simulate combat or health, and as far as I can tell low-level processed actors cannot interact with each other in any way. And if my assumptions are correct, this architecture also means that low-level actors do not consume any actual food, not that it would matter.</p>
<h3 id="a-little-more-conversation"><a href="#a-little-more-conversation" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>A little more conversation</h3>
<p>Finally, let’s talk briefly about the dialogue system, which could be considered a part of Radiant AI as well, since it was after all included in the Radiant AI section of E3 demo. Like AI packages, the dialogue system was also present in Morrowind and was expanded significantly for Oblivion. Even though from a gameplay point of view Oblivion’s dialogues are arguably much simpler than Morrowind’s walls of hypertext, Oblivion’s iteration of the system is much more complex and powerful, and used for more than just dialogue trees. The system also handles the wacky “Radiant” conversations between NPCs, the persuasion minigame, NPC greetings and other reactions to whatever is happening in the game world.</p>
<p>The dialogue system supports the same kinds of conditions AI packages use. This is what enables (some of) the dialogue in Bethesda games to be so dynamic and responsive — my mind immediately goes to guards reminding me to “take care with those flames” in Skyrim, when I have a fire spell or fire-enchanted item equipped. Oblivion’s very first dialogue after character creation is also influenced by this system.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The NPC conversation system is basically a randomized auto-advancing dialogue tree, consisting of <em>topics</em>. Each topic can have several different responses, and most responses lead to a randomly selected follow-up topic. Conditions are used extensively to add new lines to the pool when certain quests are completed, or to prevent silly situations like an NPC telling a rumor about themselves. Did you know that the warmness of the greeting depends on the disposition between the two NPCs? Did you notice that NPCs say “good morning”, or that they point out if the other party has a disease?</p>
<p>This could be enough to make the conversations feel “free-flowing” and “non-scripted” as pointed out in the announcement article back in 2004, but unfortunately it’s not.</p>

  <figcaption>What conversations feel like in practice.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>The problem isn’t really with the system itself, but rather with how it was used in Oblivion. For a game that can be played for potentially hundreds of hours, there just isn’t enough content to make the conversations feel interesting or relevant. Most conversation topics are not specific to one character or pair of characters, but rather shared between all characters in a city or even all of Cyrodiil. The most interesting parts of the conversation are the obvious bits of exposition that hint to side quests or interesting characters, but once you’ve heard them once, they become just noise.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://youtu.be/8ZJ4Osk2yNo?t=791">E3 demo again</a>, and try to ignore the silliness of the voices. The characters greet each other by name, they talk about a current event with more than a single line, and say a personalized goodbye when the conversation ends. This never happens in the final game outside of scripted quest dialogues. Apparently Bethesda <a href="https://youtu.be/kk5cymSWmqo?t=732">had to limit</a> the number and variety of voices and conversations because of a very boring reason: limited storage space of the Xbox 360 DVD.</p>
<p>Despite having over 1,000 NPCs, Oblivion was famously <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Voice_Actors">voice acted</a> by a group that can fit quite comfortably into a single minibus, and generally speaking every race-gender combination has a single voice actor — and in some cases not even that, as Orcs and Nords don’t just share the same actors, but even the same voice lines. This was improved in the remastered version, which more than doubled the number of voice actors, but the actual written lines of dialogue are still the same, so you can now hear the same exact lines delivered by a larger group of actors.</p>
<p>My favorite piece of Oblivion trivia is also about the voice acting. The process of recording the voice lines was also, and this is a very technical term, <em>batshit insane</em>, as despite using the same voice actors for dozens of characters each, the lines <a href="https://youtu.be/3193ZsxChSc?t=22">were recorded</a> in <em>alphabetical order</em>. Not grouped by character, not grouped by quest, just all lines beginning with “A” for potentially dozens of characters, and then all lines beginning with “B”, and so on. This is why some characters can have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf573MBFq0I">wildly varying</a> voices between different lines.</p>

</a>Radiant AI mythbusting</h2>
<p>Now that we understand what Radiant AI actually is, let’s recap what we’ve learned and go back to some of those pre-release claims and anecdotes to see how they hold up against the reality of the final game.</p>
<h3 id="claims-from-the-announcement-article-and-interviews"><a href="#claims-from-the-announcement-article-and-interviews" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Claims from the announcement article and interviews</h3>
<h4 id="each-of-the-1-000-characters-has-a-schedule-and-a-virtual-life-of-their-own"><a href="#each-of-the-1-000-characters-has-a-schedule-and-a-virtual-life-of-their-own" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>“Each of the 1,000 characters has a schedule and a virtual life of their own”</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Mostly true</p>
<p>Most characters do have schedules, but the complexity varies. Many characters do one or two things all day long, and never eat or sleep. Some characters (like most innkeepers) don’t have any schedules at all, which was probably done for gameplay reasons. Some schedules are completely broken without mods, as is tradition with Bethesda games. Having “one’s own virtual life” is dangerously close to being a philosophical question, but it’s at least a marked improvement over Morrowind.</p>
<h4 id="they-will-shop-explore-eat-report-for-work-and-more"><a href="#they-will-shop-explore-eat-report-for-work-and-more" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>“They will shop, explore, eat, report for work, and more.”</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Mostly true</p>
<p>NPCs cannot buy from shops, but some NPCs have schedules that include regular visits to shops, where they’ll wander around for a couple of hours and then leave. Does that count as shopping? They do eat (although that doesn’t really matter), and there are some <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Adventurer">NPC adventurers</a> who wander around dungeons.</p>
<h4 id="npcs-can-acquire-food-in-several-different-ways"><a href="#npcs-can-acquire-food-in-several-different-ways" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>NPCs can acquire food in several different ways</h4>
<p><strong>Overall verdict</strong>: Technically true</p>
<p>The Eat package does make NPCs acquire food without specifying how they should do it, but in practice they will either seek out food items in the world, or disappointingly, they have an unlimited / respawning supply of food in their inventory. The vast majority of NPCs will always eat at the same location, which also implies acquiring food the same way every time.</p>
<p>Let’s tackle the food acquisition methods one by one:</p>
<h4 id="npcs-can-buy-food"><a href="#npcs-can-buy-food" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>NPCs can buy food</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: False</p>
<p>NPCs cannot buy food, or anything else for that matter. I was holding out hope that there would be at least one NPC in the game who has been scripted to buy something, but the <code>GetGold</code> condition function is used in only one AI package in the entire game, and even that is not really related to buying anything. The food in taverns and inns is free to take, so NPCs don’t need to buy it. I think you could implement this in the current system with an AI package and a custom conversation, but it would be very tedious to set up for more than a single NPC.</p>
<h4 id="an-npc-who-doesn-t-have-money-can-hunt-poach-for-food"><a href="#an-npc-who-doesn-t-have-money-can-hunt-poach-for-food" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>An NPC who doesn’t have money can hunt / poach for food</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: False</p>
<p>As stated before, money doesn’t matter for NPCs. There are NPCs who do hunt (like the aforementioned foresters), but they don’t do it to acquire food; they just carry the raw meat in their inventory. There is no poaching for players or NPCs.</p>
<h4 id="an-npc-can-steal-food-from-the-environment-or-some-other-character"><a href="#an-npc-can-steal-food-from-the-environment-or-some-other-character" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>An NPC can steal food from the environment or some other character</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: True</p>
<p>Characters with low responsibility will take food from anywhere they can find it, including the environment and other characters’ pockets. In the final game there are only a few NPCs who actually do this, including the Argonian petty criminal <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:City-Swimmer">City-Swimmer</a> (who despite the name never swims) who is likely to die in a fight with the city guards before you meet her.</p>
<h4 id="an-npc-can-steal-food-from-the-player"><a href="#an-npc-can-steal-food-from-the-player" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>An NPC can steal food from the player</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: False, but should be trivial to implement</p>
<p>NPCs cannot steal from the player, which Pete Hines confirmed before the game was released (and I did my own experiments just to be sure). This was done for gameplay reasons. With source code access (or reverse engineering experience) it should be quite easy to re-enable this, for whatever reason.</p>
<h4 id="todd-s-mid-fight-dagger-acquisition"><a href="#todd-s-mid-fight-dagger-acquisition" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Todd’s mid-fight dagger acquisition</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Impossible in the final game unless scripted to do so</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was pushing an NPC for information, and when he wouldn’t cough it up, I attacked him, and he quickly ran out of the building we were in. This was not the expected behavior for this quest, as he was supposed to stay and fight. So I pulled up some debug information to see what he was doing, and he had left the building, went down the street, bought a dagger and ran back to fight me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s establish the parts of story that are still plausible in the final game:</p>
<ul>
<li>NPCs can flee from combat when their health is low (depending on their confidence attribute), and they can run to a different cell to escape. However, it doesn’t seem like this was a case of fleeing, as the NPC was supposed to stay and fight.</li>
<li>Unarmed NPCs can pick up a weapon from the environment when they enter combat.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that’s about it. Let’s see what doesn’t hold up in the final game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, NPCs do not interact with the game’s economy. They cannot buy anything.</li>
<li>Even if they could, how would an NPC know that the weapon shop — which is in a different, unloaded cell — contains weapons? I did a quick test with both a Find package (without specifying a location) and the usual “punch him in the face and see what happens” approach, and in both cases the NPC couldn’t find a weapon placed in a connected cell. If it worked like this, would it force the game to load the cell? If not, could this have been used to duplicate items?</li>
</ul>
<p>This was Mr. Todd Howard himself about a year before the release, yet it still manages to sound like a made-up story. Maybe the capabilities of Radiant AI did really change radically so late in development — but I don’t think we have much other evidence to support that. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFcLyDb6niA">Oh Todd</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-e3-demo-revisited"><a href="#the-e3-demo-revisited" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The E3 demo, revisited</h3>
<p>A large chunk of the <a href="https://youtu.be/8ZJ4Osk2yNo?t=741">E3 demo</a> — especially the bookstore scene — was created to showcase the features of Radiant AI, but it wasn’t meant to be taken as a literal representation of the final game, and I don’t know if the gaming audience of 2005 understood that. This shouldn’t have come as a surprise for the superfans who were following the development closely, as Bethesda developers were surprisingly open about this on various forums.</p>
<p>Of course the internet and games media were much more fragmented back then, so even though developers were posting quite candid comments about the development of the game, relatively few people would have seen it. There was no <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> back then, nor a cottage industry of gaming YouTubers dedicated to dissecting and sharing every single piece of pre-release material.</p>
<p>Let’s have a brief look at the demonstrated capabilities and some of the more specific claims made in the E3 demo:</p>
<h4 id="these-npcs-are-not-scripted"><a href="#these-npcs-are-not-scripted" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>“These NPCs are not scripted”</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Depends on how you define “scripted”</p>
<p>I’ll just re-quote the relevant parts from Steve Meister:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As far as the bookseller sequence. No, the entire thing was not scripted — not in the sense that it represents a designer typing in hundreds of lines of script code. In the sense that it’s a sequence of events that happen in a particular order, you might consider it scripted, but the way you set up those events, and how the actors accomplish them, is not scripted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The reason it’s AI and not scripting is because it uses goals and rules to determine how something is going to be accomplished.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The sequence is a set of examples of the kinds of things you can do with RAI — including grouping a sequence of AI packages together to produce a tight, deterministic sequence of events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Bethesda’s stance is that something is “scripted” only when it was built with the engine’s scripting language. If we accept their definition, then yes, the E3 demo was not scripted. However, I would argue that AI packages and the conversation system are a form of scripting, albeit much higher-level and specialized than traditional scripting languages. There are conditions, loops (schedules) and side effects, and the conversation system can run scripts after lines of dialogue. And the events of these demos can only really happen in one specific order, so in that sense they are scripted as well.</p>
<h4 id="npcs-greet-the-player-differently-at-different-times-of-the-day"><a href="#npcs-greet-the-player-differently-at-different-times-of-the-day" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>NPCs greet the player differently at different times of the day</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: True for ambient conversations, but not in dialogues with the player</p>
<p>In the demo when the player enters the bookstore, Estelle greets the player and mentions that she was “just about to lock up the store”. Characters do actually lock their doors at night and when they leave their homes. The conversation system can query the current time of day and this is done for some things such as NPC greetings, but from what I can tell there is not a single NPC who changes their dialogue with the player based on the time of the day. So the engine supports it, but they couldn’t afford to record any additional lines of dialogue for a fairly niche feature.</p>
<h4 id="npcs-can-decide-to-train-their-skills"><a href="#npcs-can-decide-to-train-their-skills" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>NPCs can decide to train their skills</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Up for interpretation, but mostly false</p>
<p>Characters don’t make decisions in the sense of weighing different options and choosing the one with the best outcome. They follow their schedules, and that schedule can include something that looks like training to the player. There are archers who shoot at targets and fighters who hit training dummies. Their skills never actually improve, which is probably a good thing from a gameplay perspective.</p>
<h4 id="marksman-skill-level-affects-npcs-accuracy-with-ranged-weapons"><a href="#marksman-skill-level-affects-npcs-accuracy-with-ranged-weapons" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Marksman skill level affects NPCs’ accuracy with ranged weapons</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: False</p>
<p>NPCs do have the same skills and attributes as the player does, and they have at least some effect on their capabilities, but precision with ranged weapons doesn’t seem to be one of them. I conducted an experiment with my dear assistant Lex, and his accuracy with a bow was more or less equally perfect at Marksman 1 and Marksman 100, with a few complete misses — maybe characters adjust their aim to avoid hitting the player? I don’t know how the E3 demo was made; either accuracy used to be a factor but it was cut, or they faked it with a custom combat style.</p>

</a>An NPC can decide to drink a potion to temporarily boost their skills</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: False</p>
<p>NPCs can be scripted to drink any potion with UseItemAt or the scripting language and it will have the same effect it would have on the player, but as far as I know they will never do it on their own. It is unclear if NPCs can autonomously drink health or fatigue restoration potions as apparently this capability was present in Morrowind, but I didn’t have time to test it.</p>
<h3 id="the-skooma-incident"><a href="#the-skooma-incident" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The skooma incident</h3>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Could have happened pre-release, but not in the final game</p>
<p>Let’s have the quote again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funny example: In one Dark Brotherhood quest, you can meet up with this shady merchant who sells skooma. During testing, the NPC would be dead when the player got to him. Why? NPCs from the local skooma den were trying to get their fix, didn’t have any skooma, and were killing the merchant to get it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That shady fellow is probably <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Nordinor">Nordinor</a>, who is indeed a skooma dealer met during the Dark Brotherhood questline. There is a <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Skooma_Den">Skooma Den</a> in the city, and it houses a group of low-responsibility addicts who are configured to consume skooma, and then head out to the city market to find more should they run out. There is something to this story: in theory, one of the addicts could encounter Nordinor in the market, try to pickpocket him to get some skooma, which would inevitably lead to a brawl that ends with someone dead.</p>
<p>However, there are several reasons why this cannot happen in the final game:</p>
<h4 id="reason-1-the-addicts-do-not-actually-consume-skooma"><a href="#reason-1-the-addicts-do-not-actually-consume-skooma" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Reason 1: The addicts do not actually consume skooma</h4>
<p>The fine folks of the skooma den have two AI packages: <code>BravilSkoomaAddictSeek8x12</code> and <code>aaaSkoomaAddictUse8x12</code>. Both have the same suffix <code>8x12</code>, which means that they are scheduled to run for 12 hours starting at 8:00 AM. The first package is of type Find, which is a known source of shenanigans. The second package, though, is of type Eat… does the game consider skooma to be food? I checked, and it does not. But when I enter the skooma den, all of the addicts immediately start drinking from their glowing skooma bottles.</p>
<figure>

</a>
  
  <figcaption>I have no idea what is going on with her chin.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>Since the characters are not actually carrying any food, it seems that the only thing Eat accomplishes is to make the NPCs sit down on one of the chairs. When an NPC sits down, they select an idle animation to play, and there’s one in the game configured to trigger when an NPC has a bottle of skooma in the inventory. So, the drugs they are carrying are never actually consumed, which means they can never run out.</p>
<p>I validated this hypothesis by adding an extra effect to skooma to make it obvious when it is consumed. I started the game, entered the skooma den, and everything was like before. I changed the skooma again, this time adding the food flag, and re-entered the cabin.</p>

</a>Reason 2: Nordinor does not carry any skooma</h4>
<p>Nordinor is one of the few NPCs in the game who sells skooma, so he would make a good target for the addicts. However, that skooma is not actually on his person. The way all vendors work in BGS games (at least up to Skyrim) is that every shop has a hidden container (usually a chest) somewhere in the world, which contains the shop’s inventory. Usually the container is in an inaccessible location, but sometimes the level designer makes a mistake and the vendor chest <a href="https://youtu.be/_QgzIbljZ4U?t=24">is actually accessible</a> to the player.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>What this means, though, is that the skooma addicts cannot actually steal skooma from Nordinor, because he doesn’t have any. The Find package won’t pick him as a potential “skooma container”, because the system doesn’t know anything about shops. Maybe he was actually carrying skooma back in 2005, who knows.</p>

</a>Reason 3: Would the addicts even consume skooma when the player is not around?</h4>
<p>We already know that they don’t consume skooma, but let’s assume for a moment that they did. The addicts live in a locked cabin, so it’s unlikely for the player to enter it unless they are specifically looking for it. If the player never enters the cabin, the addicts should always remain in the low-level AI processing mode, and if my assumptions are correct, this means they would be very unlikely to ever consume a single unit of skooma during the average playthrough. It’s hard to be certain, though, as there is basically no documentation about the low-level AI mode. If you know, please share!</p>
<h3 id="mystery-quote-anecdotes"><a href="#mystery-quote-anecdotes" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Mystery quote anecdotes</h3>
<p>Quickfire round! As a reminder, these stories cannot be sourced to anyone at Bethesda, and have a high chance of being made up or exaggerated by the community.</p>
<h4 id="the-rake-and-the-broom"><a href="#the-rake-and-the-broom" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The rake and the broom</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Plausible, though the language is imprecise</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One character was given a rake and the goal “rake leaves”; another was given a broom and the goal “sweep paths,” and this worked smoothly. Then they swapped the items, so that the raker was given a broom and the sweeper was given the rake. In the end, one of them killed the other so he could get the proper item.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no package type for raking leaves or sweeping paths, but UseItemAt can be used to make characters play the rake and broom animations. UseItemAt by itself won’t cause the character to pickpocket the required item (at least in the case of a rake) so it needs to be paired up with a Find package. Do that for both characters, and with enough aggression and low responsibility they should fight over the items.</p>
<h4 id="the-hungry-guard"><a href="#the-hungry-guard" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The hungry guard</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Very likely made up</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Another test had an on-duty NPC guard become hungry. The guard went into the forest to hunt for food. The other guards also left to arrest the truant guard, leaving the town unprotected. The villager NPCs then looted all of the shops, due to the lack of law enforcement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There’s a lot of implausible stuff in this one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Guards do not become hungry, no one does. This could refer to a scheduled Eat package, but that would not be anything unexpected, just a normal part of the character’s routine.</li>
<li>There are hunters, but no one hunts for food. Can be done, but this would be a very specific setup, and not a case of “unexpected behavior”.</li>
<li>NPCs cannot be arrested. Even if they could, I don’t see how they could implement guards sometimes not following their orders without everything breaking down.</li>
<li>The looting part is extremely unlikely. There is no way to check if a town is “protected” or not, and dishonest characters do not care about the presence of guards, they just steal whenever and wherever they can.</li>
</ul>
<p>This story is either completely made up, or it’s from very early in the development when the AI system was still being prototyped. I’d lean towards the first option.</p>
<h4 id="the-minotaur-and-the-unicorn"><a href="#the-minotaur-and-the-unicorn" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The minotaur and the unicorn</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Almost guaranteed to have happened</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In another test a minotaur was given a task of protecting a unicorn. However, the minotaur repeatedly tried to kill the unicorn because he was set to be an aggressive creature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually did <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Hircine">this quest</a> in Remastered just a short while ago. In the final version of the game the minotaur is indeed set to be aggressive, and the unicorn is not. The reason why they don’t fight is that they both belong to the same faction, <code>DAUnicornFaction</code>. Nothing to do with Radiant AI really, something like this could happen in any video game with multiple factions.</p>
<h4 id="the-skooma-story-again"><a href="#the-skooma-story-again" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The skooma story, again</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: See above</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In one Dark Brotherhood quest, the player can meet up with a shady merchant who sells skooma, an in-game drug. During testing, the NPC would be dead when the player got to him. The reason was that NPCs from the local skooma den were trying to get their fix, didn’t have any money, and so were killing the merchant to get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I already covered this at length. This version of the anecdote differs slightly from the original version, because the original didn’t mention anything about buying the skooma even being a possibility. A classic case of a story gaining more details as it’s retold, perhaps?</p>
<h4 id="the-skull-of-corruption"><a href="#the-skull-of-corruption" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>The skull of corruption</h4>
<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Can be reproduced even in the remastered version</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While testing to confirm that the physics models for a magical item known as the “Skull of Corruption,” which creates an evil copy of the character/monster it is used on, were working properly, a tester dropped the item on the ground. An NPC immediately picked it up and used it on the player character, creating a copy of him that proceeded to kill every NPC in sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I tackled this briefly in a previous section, but in summary it is unquestionably true. A version of this story can be sourced back to Bethesda as it was told in an interview with PC Zone, though interestingly this version mentions the name of the item, while the PC Zone version does not, and that version also mentions that the reason for testing was physics <em>sounds</em>, not physics models. It’s possible that someone from Bethesda told this story multiple times, with slightly different details each time.</p>

</a>Radiant AI and GOAP</h2>
<p>Let’s talk (hopefully) briefly about Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP), another approach to game AI from the same era that occasionally gets compared to Radiant AI. I have even seen some academic papers, or even worse, Reddit users, claim that Radiant AI is a variant or close relative of GOAP, which in my humblest opinion is not true.</p>
<p>I will not waste your and my time explaining GOAP in detail — for that you can read Tommy Thompson’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/building-the-ai-of-f-e-a-r-with-goal-oriented-action-planning">excellent article</a> over at GameDeveloper.com, watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PaOLBOuyswI">video version</a> or read Jeff Orkin’s <a href="https://www.gamedevs.org/uploads/three-states-plan-ai-of-fear.pdf">original paper</a>. Or if you are not allergic to mid-2000s C++, you can find most of F.E.A.R.’s AI source code from <a href="https://github.com/xfw5/Fear-SDK-1.08">GitHub</a> — remember when games used to have proper mod SDKs?</p>
<p>In short, though, GOAP is a planning-based AI architecture originally developed for Monolith’s horror FPS <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F.E.A.R._(video_game)">F.E.A.R.</a> (2005). GOAP enables game characters to generate and execute multi-stage plans based on their current state and knowledge of the world. These plans are not pre-defined by the game designer, but rather get generated (or <em>planned</em>) on the fly using a system of goals and actions. Each goal has a priority (either static or dynamic), a set of preconditions that must be met before it can be picked, and some description of the desired world state that must be achieved to satisfy the goal. The system picks the most relevant goal for each character, and then tries to come up with a plan to achieve it. The actions have preconditions and effects (changes in world state), and they usually have an associated cost, which enables the planner to choose the most efficient (or the most fun) way to achieve the goal.</p>
<h3 id="goap-example"><a href="#goap-example" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>GOAP example</h3>
<p>A hungry character could have the goal “be less hungry”. They don’t have any food nor any money, but they have the following actions at their disposal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy a frozen pizza
<ul>
<li>Precondition: Has money, is in a shop that sells frozen pizzas</li>
<li>Effect: Has a pizza, has less money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Heat up a pizza in the microwave
<ul>
<li>Precondition: Has a frozen pizza, is near a microwave</li>
<li>Effect: No longer has a frozen pizza, has a hot pizza</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Eat the pizza
<ul>
<li>Precondition: Has a hot pizza</li>
<li>Effect: No longer has a hot pizza, is no longer hungry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Do work (on a laptop that magically generates money)
<ul>
<li>Precondition: None (in this example)</li>
<li>Effect: Has money</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Travel between locations
<ul>
<li>Precondition: None</li>
<li>Effect: Is at a different location</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With GOAP the planning system could generate a plan like this to satisfy the hunger goal:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do work</li>
<li>Go to the shop</li>
<li>Buy a frozen pizza</li>
<li>Go home (where the microwave is)</li>
<li>Heat up the pizza</li>
<li>Eat the pizza, satisfying the hunger goal</li>
</ol>
<p>I didn’t invent this example from nowhere: I actually implemented a version of GOAP back in 2017 for a university game development course, and the characters of the game did almost exactly that. The end result of two months of work was a weird mashup of The Sims and Roller Coaster Tycoon, involving egg-shaped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_People">little computer people</a> with silly hats and facial hair. The blobular creatures lived in a single room, and used GOAP to maintain their primary needs: programming, fat, sugar and caffeine.</p>

  <figcaption>While working on the AI was pretty fun, truth be told, I was much more into creating 3D assets and filling the game with obscure inside jokes and puns. I spent relatively little time on any actual gameplay. There was even a coffee maker with animated water and coffee level indicators! This is an early screenshot from the pre-microwave era of the game.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>Implementing it was quite a challenge. It was too slow to run in the main thread, and I remember writing and debugging my custom thread pool / task system for Unity 5 (because it didn’t have any tools for threading at the time) for hours on end, because it suffered from constant deadlocks and other concurrency issues. I had to place strict limits on the complexity of the plans, because otherwise my system would consume gigabytes of memory for just a few characters in a small room.</p>
<p>Luckily these problems aren’t inherent to GOAP, and it has been used successfully in a number of games. It never became the standard AI architecture, though, and most modern action games are arguably still less advanced in the AI department than F.E.A.R. was about 20 years ago.</p>
<h3 id="radiant-ai-vs-goap"><a href="#radiant-ai-vs-goap" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Radiant AI vs GOAP</h3>
<p>On a surface level, AI packages are largely equivalent to GOAP goals: eating, sleeping or finding 15 wheels of cheese are all goals that a character can pursue. The way Radiant AI selects the active AI package is also similar to how GOAP picks the next goal; packages are ordered by priority, and the system selects the highest priority one that satisfies the preconditions.</p>
<p>One could argue that AI packages are not really goals in the same sense as the ones in GOAP. Most types of AI packages <em>do not</em> represent a desired change in the world state; as stated many times before, eating or sleeping has practically no benefits for the character, so the planner in a “pure” GOAP implementation would never pick those actions. However, after watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm7K68663rA">Goal-Oriented Action Planning: Ten Years of AI Programming</a> from GDC 2015, I don’t think that this makes a difference. The GOAP planner’s state doesn’t have to correlate with the actual game world; the state can include variables that only exist to guide the planner to pick a specific action. For example, it’s entirely valid to have a goal like <code>Dance</code>, and a planner state variable like <code>hasDanced</code>, which is set to true by the <code>DoDance</code> action. Most if not all games that utilize GOAP don’t just use it to make characters “play well”, but also to make them feel more alive and interesting by doing things that, from an objective gameplay-focused perspective, don’t really matter.</p>
<p>There is. however, at least one fundamental difference between Radiant AI and GOAP: Radiant AI is not based on planning. That might be a surprise to some; after all, Oblivion’s NPCs can demonstrably complete an AI package like Eat in a (small) variety of ways; the exact plan depends on the character and its environment. In reality, though, the AI packages are essentially pre-made plans that have some dynamic parts, but the overall structure is fixed.</p>

</figure>
<p>Starting with Skyrim, Bethesda replaced the fixed set of AI package types with much more flexible designer-driven <a href="https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Package_Templates">package templates</a>. Strictly speaking the package templates already existed in Oblivion, but instead of being exposed in the engine toolset they were hardcoded into the engine. Each package template has an internal procedure tree, which defines which procedures (actions) are executed in which order, and under what conditions. <a href="https://github.com/llde/xOBSE/blob/b1f5b9ce2d1c45a25ad75e3a4e5ee5b5192bcbab/obse/obse/GameForms.h#L3819-L3865">Procedures</a> are simple actions that a character can take: travel to a location, find all objects of a type in some radius, pick up something, attack someone, sit down, use an item, and so on. Practically everything NPCs do outside of (and potentially during) combat are just sequences of these procedures.</p>
<p>Being based on templates means that Radiant AI doesn’t involve any planning. This doesn’t mean the system is incapable of interesting behavior or fun gameplay, but the whole point of GOAP is that the designers don’t have to take everything into account; they provide the tools, and the planner figures out how to make the best use of them.</p>
<h3 id="goap-in-fallout-3"><a href="#goap-in-fallout-3" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>GOAP in Fallout 3(?)</h3>
<p>After looking into Radiant AI in depth, I was still wondering why there are so many people claiming that Bethesda games (namely Fallout 3) use GOAP. Some of those sources were quite obviously mistaken; attributing the classic Radiant AI myths to GOAP. But there were also some more credible-looking claims, and they must have come from somewhere. I did some digging, and I found at least one source: a 2009 article from the PC magazine / blog bit-tech.net, <a href="https://bit-tech.net/reviews/gaming/how-ai-in-games-works/3/"><em>How AI in Games Works</em></a> by Ben Hardwidge. Part 3 is about planning-based AI, and he interviews Bethesda programmer Jean-Sylvere Simonet about his work on Fallout 3’s combat AI. The development team redesigned the combat AI to be based on a planner, though to be pedantic — which I love to be — he doesn’t explicitly say that it was GOAP, but certainly something very similar.</p>
<p>So, while Radiant AI is not GOAP, Fallout 3 (and presumably later games) use a separate GOAP-like system for combat AI. Mystery solved.</p>
<h2 id="how-radiant-ai-changed-before-oblivion-s-release"><a href="#how-radiant-ai-changed-before-oblivion-s-release" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>How Radiant AI changed before Oblivion’s release</h2>
<p>It remains unclear how extensively Radiant AI really changed during Oblivion’s long development cycle and which features, if any, were actually “cut” before the game hit the shelves. Especially with the early marketing it’s hard to know which statements and claims were aspirational (“we want it to feel like this”) and which features they had actually implemented at some point, but couldn’t make them work in practice. Some, if not most, of the cuts were probably made for boring and solvable technical and gameplay reasons indirectly related to Radiant AI, such as limited storage space, development time constraints, performance issues, limitations of the animation system, and so on. The point about understandability Pete Hines made in one of the interviews is also very valid: if the AI system is capable of complex behaviors but other aspects of the game (such as graphics, sound, and user interface) cannot effectively communicate what is going on, then more advanced AI could in theory lead to an overall worse gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Even the E3 demo — which was presented about half a year before Oblivion’s original release date, until it got delayed by a few more months — makes some claims about features that the game arguably didn’t end up delivering on. For example, when Todd Howard said that the NPCs can “grow their own food”, did he <em>actually</em> mean that they would cultivate crops and eat them to survive? Or did he mean that there are NPCs who look like farmers, who spend most of their day playing a hoeing animation in a field, and then at dinner time eat one piece of bread from the infinite supply they have in their pockets? Is the difference between these two shallow imitations of life <em>actually</em> meaningful in a game which is ultimately about swordfighting with skeletons, and collecting flowers and bits of slain demons to make magic potions? I genuinely don’t know.</p>
<p>What we do know is that the content that exists in the final game does not utilize the system to its full potential, and there are probably many good reasons for that. Obvious performance and stability issues aside, even with my limited experience with the Oblivion Construction Set I can say that the user experience of the toolset does not really encourage the creation of complex and emergent AI behaviors. My PC has quite high-end hardware (including a Ryzen 7 9800X3D, one of the fastest CPUs on the planet) but the Construction Set is still very laggy and prone to frequent crashes, not to mention the multitude of <em>interesting</em> UI choices. Even though I could probably build a peasant-based Turing machine with those tools, I don’t think I would ever want to do that. Skyrim’s Creation Kit isn’t much better on that front, unfortunately, and the one from New Vegas is probably the worst of them all. That hasn’t stopped these games from being some of the most-modded of all time, but I would hazard a guess that it had some influence on the design decisions made during development.</p>
<p>And to be honest, the fact that Bethesda ended up using Radiant AI less ambitiously than originally planned wasn’t necessarily a bad thing. While we ended up receiving a great game, it’s also very buggy, goofy and unpredictable. I can imagine that if the game relied more on simulations and emergent gameplay, the end result could have been even less coherent and playable than what we got. The version we have now is kind of in a sweet spot: it’s funny and weirdly charming, without being <em>completely</em> broken. Well it is still very broken, especially the level scaling, but that’s largely unrelated to Radiant AI.</p>

</a>Radiant AI after Oblivion</h2>
<p>There’s a fairly common misconception online that Bethesda gave up on Radiant AI after Oblivion, and that it was never used in any of their later games. This is not true; Radiant AI consists of multiple different systems that have their roots deep in the game engine, and a large share of them are still used in even the most recent Bethesda games. But what has definitely changed since Oblivion is Bethesda’s philosophy regarding emergent behavior and gameplay.</p>
<h3 id="fallout-3-and-new-vegas"><a href="#fallout-3-and-new-vegas" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Fallout 3 and New Vegas</h3>
<p>Fallout 3 was released a few years after Oblivion, and it didn’t stray too far from its predecessor, both in terms of technology and game design. Most NPCs have schedules, and there is even some variety depending on the weekday, which is a bit of a surprise considering the post-apocalyptic setting. Characters still have randomly generated discussions, but they are thankfully used in a more tasteful way. NPCs still find and consume food items, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/10gwhl/why_do_companions_in_the_lucky_38_steal_my_nuka/">even when</a> players don’t want them to.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest addition to Radiant AI was the new Sandbox AI package, which is basically an evolved version of the Wander package from Oblivion. It makes characters wander around in a specific area, and they can autonomously interact with the environment, such as sit on chairs, eat food, or (starting with Skyrim) work at a crafting station like a forge or an enchanting table. This makes it easy to add basic behaviors to characters without having to design an involved schedule for them. I’m in two minds about this: using Sandbox ensures even the less important characters do something instead of just standing around, but it also runs the risk of making everyone feel a bit generic.</p>
<p>What didn’t make the cut were the responsibility attribute and most of the crime system. The responsibility field <a href="https://geckwiki.com/index.php?title=AI_Data_Tab#Responsibility">is still there</a> in the editor, but from what I’ve gathered it no longer has any effect on character behavior. It seems that characters are no longer capable of pickpocketing, and either won’t take owned items from the environment, or if they do, they won’t face any consequences. NPCs can still pick up equipment from the environment if caught unarmed in combat, though.</p>
<h3 id="skyrim-and-the-rise-of-radiant-story"><a href="#skyrim-and-the-rise-of-radiant-story" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Skyrim and the rise of Radiant Story</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned Skyrim improved the AI package system by making package templates accessible in the editor, which made it possible for level / quest designers to create complex AI behaviors and reuse them across different characters. Skyrim still has daily schedules for most NPCs, but while they are more visually interesting and varied than the ones in Oblivion — for example, smiths actually hammer on an anvil — the actual high-level schedules (where characters are at what time) are arguably less complex than the ones in Oblivion. There are only a couple dozen AI packages which depend on the weekday, about half of which are used for a single <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Breaching_Security">Dark Brotherhood quest</a>.</p>
<p>Most NPCs still eat a couple of times a day, but from what I’ve gathered a large share of them only eat “fake food”; like the skooma addicts in Oblivion, they just play the eating animation without actually consuming anything. The system is still capable — and arguably more capable than before — of having characters seek out food and actually consume it, but this capability sees limited use in the vanilla game. I don’t have a way of quantifying this, as I don’t know how to search or filter AI packages by the <code>CreateFakeFood</code> flag in the Creation Kit or in xEdit, but from some spot-checking, I’ve yet to encounter a package which doesn’t have it set to true.</p>
<h4 id="crime-and-the-lack-of-punishment"><a href="#crime-and-the-lack-of-punishment" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Crime and (the lack of) Punishment</h4>
<p>The crime system was reintroduced for players, but not really for NPCs. Responsibility is still gone, and the closest thing to it is a new attribute called <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:NPCs#Morality">morality</a>, which is apparently used to control if an NPC follower obeys the player’s orders to commit crimes. If they do and they get caught, the player is the one who gets fined and / or hacked to bits by the city watch.</p>
<p>Crime reporting still exists, but is handled in a different way through the faction system. This has an interesting quirk: almost all non-hostile actors, including animals like chickens and horses, can and do report crimes. There’s a simple way to fix this in the Creation Kit (configure the animal factions to ignore crimes), but for some reason Bethesda didn’t do it, and never changed it in any of the patches. There’s a popular mod that fixes this, suitably called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17946">NARC</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Acquire procedure (which corresponds to the Find package in Oblivion) has settings for “Allow stealing”, “Allow pickpocketing” and “Allow killing”. I don’t think they are used in the vanilla game, and I didn’t have time to test them.</p>
<p>In the general case though NPCs can do crimes as they please, as you can see in this clip from Bacon_:</p>
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ezOPt7ARM1o?si=psVIuRinedoQesCf" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<h4 id="radiant-story"><a href="#radiant-story" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Radiant Story</h4>
<p>Hey, how did dropping an item on the ground trigger a multi-NPC conversation, followed by a brawl? The answer is <a href="https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Radiant_Story">Radiant Story</a>, which is a new umbrella term for a new set of systems: scenes, aliases, and the story manager.</p>
<p>A lot of things in Bethesda games are based on quests, and the ones in your journal are just the peak of the mountain (which you can climb, by the way). For example, many of the conversations in Oblivion are linked to a quest, most of which don’t actually involve any player interaction. In this case, the quest system is (ab)used as a way of grouping together related dialogue; essentially as a workaround for organizing things in an otherwise somewhat miserable user interface. Skyrim takes this much further. It might or might not have <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/11/skyrim-infinite-quests/">“infinite quests”</a>, but it certainly has many of them — over 1,800 in the base game — at least if we count these “technical” quests not exposed to the player. I am not actually going to talk about <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Radiant">Radiant quests</a> in this article, as they are not really related to Radiant AI, but they are largely powered by the systems I am about to describe. The brawl scene is actually a repeatable quest, and in Skyrim that makes a lot more sense than in Oblivion.</p>
<p><a href="https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Scenes">The scene system</a> also relies on quests, and it replaces — or rather enhances, as it is still fundamentally based on topics — the old NPC conversation system from the previous games, enabling more complex interactions between characters. Scenes are used basically whenever an NPC speaks but you are not locked in a 1:1 dialogue with them. Just like the first words of Oblivion after the intro cutscene were provided by the conversation system, Skyrim’s memed-to-death <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uj4u4aB-ElE">first five-or-so minutes</a> is basically entirely made up of scenes. Scenes can have multiple actors doing things in a synchronized way, a marked improvement over Oblivion’s loose and lethargic conversations. Scenes are not limited to just talking, as they can also add AI packages and run arbitrary scripts. In the item brawl scene, AI packages are used to make the troublemakers pull out their weapons and walk towards the item, and when the scene ends, a one-liner script is used to trigger combat between the characters.</p>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Quest_Alias_Tab">Aliases</a> are probably the most important new concept under the Radiant Story umbrella. In previous iterations of the engine, quests had to be tightly scripted largely out of necessity; scripts, dialogue and AI packages referenced specific entities and locations, which I assume made refactoring and iterating on them a painful process. The simplest use case for an alias is in the name; to be a stable alias for a location or a game entity that can be used in scripts, packages and scenes, which hopefully won’t break even if characters or items are changed or moved between cells.</p>

</a>
  
  <figcaption>The condition UI component is used here as well; still recognizable as a descendant of the one from Morrowind’s editor.</figcaption>
  
</figure>
<p>The real power of aliases, however, comes from the fact that their values can be filled dynamically at runtime, using different approaches. These include spawning a new actor or item of some type, selecting a random location tagged with a specific keyword, or dynamically searching the nearby area for an item or actor fulfilling specific criteria. The item brawl scene is basically fully dynamic: the item is the one the player dropped, and the game picks two suitable actors to fight over it, and optionally up to three random bystanders and a guard to make the scene more lively. When the quest is started, the game tries to fill the aliases with the item and actors, and if it fails, the quest won’t start, and neither will the scene.</p>
<p>Finally, the mechanism that actually starts the quest / scene is the <a href="https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Category:Story_Manager">Story Manager</a>. Simply put, it’s an event-based system that listens to various game events (like the player dropping an item or visiting some location for the first time), filters them based on the configured conditions, and starts quests when their conditions are met. Aliases can access the event data, which is how the item brawl scene can use the item that was just dropped by the player.</p>
<h4 id="what-this-means"><a href="#what-this-means" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>What this means</h4>
<p>Skyrim has quite a lot of scripted scenes like this (both dynamic and pre-placed), and in many ways they are a more powerful and less janky way to make the world come alive than the old simulation-driven approach. You can take Skyrim seriously at least some of the time, unlike Oblivion, which at least to me feels like a comedy even when everything is working as intended.</p>
<p>There is a shift in the design philosophy, though. It’s a shift away from systems, to content, even though there are things that have arguably gone in the opposite direction (such as Radiant quests). Oblivion is a barely functional simulation of a weird fantasy world quite literally one hot meal away from total collapse, while Skyrim is more of a run-down faux-viking theme park. To some extent Skyrim’s most fun and memorable moments are intentionally designed, while Oblivion’s best bits — as long as you treat it as a comedy — emerge from its systems. Which approach is better is a matter of taste.</p>
<h3 id="fallout-4"><a href="#fallout-4" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Fallout 4</h3>
<p>I’ll be honest: it’s been almost a decade since I’ve played Fallout 4, and I couldn’t be bothered to install it and its mod tools to look at it in detail. Judging by the multiple warring wikis and modding documentation it largely follows in Skyrim’s footsteps. Most non-generic NPCs have basic schedules, which at least involve sleeping at night and working during the day. The player-constructed settlements are a new addition, and I have a feeling practically all of their residents are mostly powered by the Sandbox AI package; doing something all the time, while not really doing anything of substance. If there is some mind-blowingly awesome AI-related functionality in this game, let me know.</p>

</a>Starfield</h3>
<p>Starfield was released almost 8 years after Fallout 4 (<em>what??</em>) and it received a mixed reception. Personally, it managed to hold my interest for a couple dozen hours, a low number compared to my time in previous Bethesda titles. A lot of digital ink has been spilled debating the reasons behind the lukewarm response, and I think the overall consensus is that despite the relatively unique setting (“Nasapunk” hard sci-fi), it still manages to be the most generic and least interesting Bethesda RPG to date.</p>

</a>As wide as a galaxy, as deep as a puddle</h4>
<p>Design-wise, the game is full of conflicts and missed opportunities. The theme is survival-ish, but the mechanics are not really there to support it. Your spaceship has a limited jump range because of “fuel”, but after the jump your tanks of space petrol are magically refilled, with no explanation. The actual moment-to-moment gameplay is an evolution of Fallout 4’s, and it’s not too bad, but it’s not strong enough to carry the game on its own. The outposts are a half-hearted evolution of the settlement system from Fallout 4, serving as infinite resource generators if you can bear the tedium of micromanaging them.</p>
<p>The 1,000 procedurally generated celestial bodies are practically infinitely vast, yet contain relatively little of substance or interest. There’s a radical shift away from hand-crafted content to procedural generation, an understandable yet equally baffling choice, largely reversing the decision Bethesda made between Daggerfall and Morrowind. Some of the planets have hand-crafted cities and other points of interest, and they are significantly more interesting than anything in the procedurally generated bits. I would have preferred if the game had more of those locations and none of the procedural ones, even if they had to reduce the number of planets by an order of magnitude or two.</p>
<h4 id="regression"><a href="#regression" role="presentation" title="Link to subsection">
  
</a>Regression</h4>
<p>NPC schedules are almost gone. The AI package system still exists and seems largely unchanged from Skyrim, but the scheduling features see relatively little use. In the main city of New Atlantis shops are open 24/7, and the same shopkeepers are always there — a nostalgic throwback to the days of Morrowind. The only NPCs with notable schedules I’m aware of are the members of the main quest faction, Constellation, but even they seem to be imprisoned in their own headquarters, only moving between a few rooms.</p>
<p>Here are some concrete numbers: Oblivion has about 7,200 AI packages, Skyrim has about 6,000, and Starfield has about 3,500. About half of the packages in Oblivion have schedules, while in Skyrim it’s about 25%. In Starfield, the figure is <strong>around 6%</strong>. The numbers are not directly comparable without further context: for example, while Skyrim has fewer packages overall than Oblivion, its packages are more modular and reusable, so a single package can be easily used for dozens of different characters. Furthermore, the vast majority of Starfield’s scheduled packages are tied to quests, so relatively few are actually used for Oblivion-style schedules.</p>
<p>The scheduling system that was originally created for Oblivion admittedly doesn’t fit Starfield very well. The length of a day varies wildly between planets, moons and space stations, but the scheduling options were designed with a single earth-like planet in mind. This is an interesting concept in “hard” sci-fi: how would humans adapt to a planet where each day lasts just a few earth-hours, or several earth-months? Unfortunately Starfield doesn’t really explore this concept, other than showing two different clocks in the game: one for the local time on the planet, and one for earth-based “universal” time.</p>
<p>Another big change in Starfield was the introduction of <em>crowd</em> NPCs, which were used to pad out the main cities of the game. My original assumption was that they are not even “real” NPCs, but rather a separate lightweight system to enable the engine to scale beyond a couple dozen characters on screen at once. This isn’t quite true, though, as the crowd NPCs are still largely fully-fledged actors that have inventories, faction memberships and AI packages. The performance is achieved by using simpler models, animation rigs and cheaper shaders, and that’s about it. The bigger difference compared to normal actors is that they are generated dynamically when the player enters the area, and they don’t have homes, schedules, names or any other persistent data. This is both understandable and slightly disappointing; on one hand, it’s probably not realistic to expect the game to have thousands of NPCs with full schedules and homes on several planets. On the other hand, most NPCs in cities and settlements have been persistent, named characters with their own homes (or at least places to sleep) since Morrowind.</p>

</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>That should be about it for now. We’ve now traveled from Morrowind to Starfield, and seen how the set of technologies collectively known as Radiant AI has evolved throughout the years. The original vision of Radiant AI was a bold one; to make the world come alive using a simulationist approach to game AI, treating game characters and the player in a somewhat unified way. The original vision was never fully realized, but even the somewhat watered-down version of Radiant AI in Oblivion (and most later Bethesda titles) is still a fascinating and almost unique system in the world of video games. The systems built for Radiant AI two decades ago are still important parts of the Creation Engine, even though Bethesda’s design philosophy has changed quite radically since Oblivion. We have no way of knowing what Bethesda will do next with The Elder Scrolls VI, but I think they understood the feedback Starfield received. I hope it will be a good game.</p>
<p>And congratulations! You got to the end of this feature-length article I have been writing for about two weeks. I hope you learned something new.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/paavo.me">follow me on Bluesky</a> for project updates and new articles. This site also has an Atom feed if you’re old school like that, which I hope still works. Thank you.</p>

Updating the commit hash to support the latest version of a package meant all other package versions would also update. If a default version changed, there was a high likelihood that a user's build would suddenly fail with unexpected errors. </span></p><p><span>We feel bad when users can't access the latest packages, but feel worse when previously functional builds suddenly fail.</span></p><p><a href="https://blog.railway.com/p/introducing-railpack#image-sizes-and-caching"><h3><span>Image sizes and caching</span></h3></a></p><p><span>The way Nixpacks uses Nix to pull in dependencies often results in massive image sizes with a single </span><code>/nix/store</code><span> layer ... all Nix and related packages and libraries needed for </span><span>both</span><span> the build and runtime are here. </span></p><p><span>With no way of splitting up the Nix dependencies into separate layers, there was not much we could do to reduce the final image sizes.

                "Beware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_tarpit" target="_blank">Turing tar-pit</a>
                in which everything is possibile, but nothing of interest is easy." - Alan Perlis 1982
            </p>
            <p>
                What is of interest to you? Many things, I am certain. One such topic that I am constantly intrigued by
                is program optimization. Whether you are looking to <a href="https://youtu.be/KzT9I1d-LlQ" target="_blank">compute the largest fibonacci number</a> in one second, or creating the <a href="https://tigerbeetle.com/" target="_blank">fastest financial transaction database</a> ever
                written, or even just <a href="https://gaultier.github.io/blog/lessons_learned_from_a_successful_rust_rewrite.html" target="_blank">rewriting something in rust</a>, you likely know how rewarding optimization can be.
            </p>
            <p>
                Optimization separates the weak from the fast. Optimization isn't a thing of the past. Advances in
                technology shape the form of our programs, but don't negate the need to optimize. Well optimized
                programs save money, enable higher-tier scaling opportunities, and preserve system simplicity. Would you
                rather spend thousands to run shoddy code on autoscaling cloud infrastructure, or write better code,
                letting you use a handful of mid-tier servers at reduced latency and cost?
            </p>
            <p>
                In this article I aim to explain the concept of low-level optimization, and why Zig is particularly well
                suited for it.

            <p>
                Some people would say "trust the compiler, it knows best." It sure does, for most low-level situations!
                Optimizing compilers have come a long ways. Increased system resources and <a href="https://blog.vortan.dev/ematching" target="_blank">advances in IR transformations</a> have
                enabled compiler backends like <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project" target="_blank">LLVM</a>
                to deliver <a href="https://blog.matthieud.me/2020/exploring-clang-llvm-optimization-on-programming-horror/" target="_blank">impressive results</a>.

                us to give our compilers as much information as possible, and verify that the compiler is functioning
                correctly. In the case of most low-level languages, you can generally massage your code until the
                compiler realizes it can apply a certain transform. In other situations, it's not so easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why are low-level languages generally more performant? You might think the reason is that high level
                languages are doing a lot of extra work, such as garbage collection, string interning, interpreting
                code, etc. While you are right, this isn't *entirely* complete. High level languages lack something that
                low level languages have in great adundance - intent.
            </p>
            <p>
                The verbosity of low level programming languages enable us to produce code that the compiler can reason
                about very well. As an example, consider the following JavaScript code:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function maxArray(x, y) {
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; 65536; i++) {
        x[i] = y[i] &gt; x[i] ? y[i] : x[i];
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                As humans, we can interpret this code as setting the values in <code>x</code> as the maximum of
                <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.

As a
                comparison, here is what the function might look like if it were written in Zig:
            </p>
            <pre><code>fn maxArray(
    noalias x: *align(64) [65536]f64,
    y: *align(64) const [65536]f64,
) void {
    for (x, y, 0..) |a, b, i| {
        x[i] = if (b &gt; a) b else a;
    }
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                In this more verbose language, we can tell the compiler additional information about our code. For
                example, the optimizer now knows about alignment, aliasing requirements, array sizes, and array element
                types - all at compile-time. Using this information, the compiler generates <a href="https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:zig,selection:(endColumn:2,endLineNumber:8,positionColumn:2,positionLineNumber:8,selectionStartColumn:2,selectionStartLineNumber:8,startColumn:2,startLineNumber:8),source:'export+fn+maxArray(%0A++++noalias+x:+*align(64)+%5B65536%5Df64,%0A++++y:+*align(64)+const+%5B65536%5Df64,%0A)+void+%7B%0A++++for+(x,+y,+0..)+%7Ca,+b,+i%7C+%7B%0A++++++++x%5Bi%5D+%3D+if+(b+%3E+a)+b+else+a%3B%0A++++%7D%0A%7D'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Zig+source+%231',t:'0')),k:54.464285714285715,l:'4',m:100,n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:z0141,filters:(b:'0',binary:'1',binaryObject:'1',commentOnly:'0',debugCalls:'1',demangle:'0',directives:'0',execute:'1',intel:'0',libraryCode:'0',trim:'1',verboseDemangling:'0'),flagsViewOpen:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:zig,libs:!(),options:'-OReleaseFast+-mcpu%3Dznver5+-fomit-frame-pointer',overrides:!(),selection:(endColumn:1,endLineNumber:1,positionColumn:1,positionLineNumber:1,selectionStartColumn:1,selectionStartLineNumber:1,startColumn:1,startLineNumber:1),source:1),l:'5',n:'0',o:'+zig+0.14.1+(Editor+%231)',t:'0')),header:(),k:45.5357142857143,l:'4',m:100,n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4" target="_blank">far superior, even vectorized</a> code.

            <p>
                So can we *really* trust our compilers? It depends. Are you looking to uncover transformations to triple
                the throughput of your program's performance bottleneck? You should probably look at what the compiler
                is doing, and figure out if there are better ways to express *your intent* to the compiler. You may need
                to tweak the code to get the transforms you want. In the worst cases, you may discover that the compiler
                isn't applying optimal transforms to your code. In these cases, you may need to write inline assembly to
                squeeze out that last drop.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what about high level code? Except for <a href="https://spiral.net/" target="_blank">niche
                    cases</a>, the most we can do is <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/polly" target="_blank">reason about loops</a>. In other words, compilers cannot change our algorithms and
                optimize our paradigms. Their scope is relatively narrow.

        <div id="what_about_zig">
            <h2> So where does Zig fall? </h2>
            <p>
                I love Zig for it's verbosity. Due to this verbosity, it's easier to write more performant programs than
                with most other languages. With Zig's <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Builtin-Functions" target="_blank">builtin
                    functions</a>, non-optional <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Pointers" target="_blank">pointers</a>, <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#unreachable" target="_blank"><code>unreachable</code> keyword</a>, well chosen <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Illegal-Behavior" target="_blank">illegal
                    behavior</a>, Zig's excellent <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#comptime" target="_blank">comptime</a>... LLVM is practically spoon-fed information about our code.
            </p>
            <p>
                It isn't all rainbows though, there are tradeoffs. For example, Rust's memory model allows the compiler
                to always assume that function arguments never alias. You must manually specify this in Zig. If the
                compiler can't tell that your Zig function is always called with non-aliasing arguments, Rust
                functions will outperform the non-annotated Zig functions.

                If we take in well-annotated LLVM IR as the *only* metric of a language's optimization capability, then
                Zig does well. This is not all that Zig has up it's sleeves. Zig's true optimization superpower lies in
                compile-time execution.

            <h2> What is <code>comptime</code>? </h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#comptime" target="_blank">Zig's
                    <code>comptime</code></a> is all about code generation. Do you want to use a constant in your code?
                You can generate it at compile-time and the value will be embedded in the produced binary. Do you want
                to avoid writing the same <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table" target="_blank">hashmap
                    structure</a> for each type of data it can store? <code>comptime</code> has your back. Do you have
                data which is known at compile-time, and want the optimizer to elide code using this data? Yes, <a href="https://www.scottredig.com/blog/bonkers_comptime/" target="_blank">you can do this</a> with
                <code>comptime</code>. Zig's <code>comptime</code> is an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                So how is this different from macros? It's pretty nuanced. The purpose of <code>comptime</code> is
                essentially the same as macros. Some macros will modify the raw text of your code, and others can modify
                your program's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree" target="_blank">AST</a>
                directly. This allows macros to inline code specific to the types and values of data in your program. In
                Zig, <code>comptime</code> code is just regular code running at compile-time. This code cannot have
                side-effects - such as network IO - and the emulated machine will match the compilation target.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason that Zig's <code>comptime</code> can match up so well to macros is twofold. Firstly, almost
                all Zig code can be run at compile-time, using <code>comptime</code>. Secondly, at compile-time, all
                types can be inspected, reflected, and generated. This is <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.1/#Generic-Data-Structures" target="_blank">how
                    generics are implemented</a> in Zig.
            </p>
            <p>
                The flexibility of Zig's <code>comptime</code> has resulted in some rather nice improvements in other
                programming languages. For example, Rust has the <a href="https://docs.rs/crabtime/latest/crabtime/" target="_blank">"crabtime"</a> crate, which provides more flexibility and power than standard Rust
                macros. I believe a benefit of <code>comptime</code> over current alternatives lies in how seamlessly
                <code>comptime</code> fits into the Zig language. Unlike C++'s <code>constexpr</code>, you can use
                <code>comptime</code> without needing to learn a new "language" of sorts. C++ <a href="https://youtu.be/bIc5ZxFL198" target="_blank">is improving</a>, but it has a long ways to go
                if it hopes to compete with Zig in this domain.
            </p>
            <p>
                So can Zig's <code>comptime</code> do *everything* macros can? Nope. Token-pasting macros don't have a
                mirror in Zig's comptime. Zig is designed to be easy to read, and macros which modify or create
                variables in a unrelated scopes just don't cut it. Macros can define other macros, macros can alter the
                AST, and macros can implement mini-languages, or DSLs. Zig's <code>comptime</code> can't directly alter
                the AST. If you really want to, you can implement a DSL in Zig. For example, Zig's print function <a href="https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Case-Study-print-in-Zig" target="_blank">relies on
                    <code>comptime</code></a> to parse the format string. The print function's format string is a DSL of
                sorts. Based on the format string, Zig's <code>comptime</code> will construct a graph of functions to
                serialize your data. Here are some other examples of <code>comptime</code> DSLs in the wild: the <a href="https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/src/state_machine.zig#L5840" target="_blank">TigerBeetle account testing DSL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/InKryption/comath" target="_blank">comath: comptime math</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/ymndoseijin/zilliam" target="_blank">zilliam</a>, a Geometric Algebra library.

            <h2> String Comparison with <code>comptime</code>: </h2>
            <p>
                How do you compare two strings? Here's an approach that works in any language:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function stringsAreEqual(a, b) {
    if (a.length !== b.length) return false;
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; a.length; i++)
        if (a[i] !== b[i]) return false;
    return true;
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                We know that two strings aren't equal if their lengths aren't equal. We also know that if one byte isn't
                equal, then the strings as a whole aren't equal. Pretty simple, right? Yes, and the <a href="https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(filename:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:zig,selection:(endColumn:2,endLineNumber:14,positionColumn:2,positionLineNumber:14,selectionStartColumn:2,selectionStartLineNumber:14,startColumn:2,startLineNumber:14),source:'const+std+%3D+@import(%22std%22)%3B%0A%0Aexport+fn+isHelloWorldA(str:+%5B*%5Dconst+u8,+len:+usize)+bool+%7B%0A++++const+hello+%3D+%22Hello,+world!!%5Cn%22%3B%0A++++if+(len+!!%3D+hello.len)+return+false%3B%0A++++return+staticEqlA(hello.len,+hello.*,+str)%3B%0A%7D%0A%0Afn+staticEqlA(comptime+len:+usize,+comptime+a:+%5Blen%5Du8,+b:+%5B*%5Dconst+u8)+bool+%7B%0A++++for+(0..len)+%7Cidx%7C+%7B%0A++++++++if+(a%5Bidx%5D+!!%3D+b%5Bidx%5D)+return+false%3B%0A++++%7D%0A++++return+true%3B%0A%7D'),l:'5',n:'0',o:'Zig+source+%231',t:'0')),header:(),k:50,l:'4',m:100,n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0'),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:z0141,filters:(b:'0',binary:'1',binaryObject:'1',commentOnly:'0',debugCalls:'1',demangle:'0',directives:'0',execute:'1',intel:'0',libraryCode:'0',trim:'1',verboseDemangling:'0'),flagsViewOpen:'1',fontScale:14,fontUsePx:'0',j:1,lang:zig,libs:!(),options:'-OReleaseFast+-fomit-frame-pointer+-mcpu%3Dznver5+-target+x86_64-linux',overrides:!(),selection:(endColumn:28,endLineNumber:8,positionColumn:28,positionLineNumber:8,selectionStartColumn:28,selectionStartLineNumber:8,startColumn:28,startLineNumber:8),source:1),l:'5',n:'0',o:'+zig+0.14.1+(Editor+%231)',t:'0')),header:(),k:50,l:'4',n:'0',o:'',s:0,t:'0')),l:'2',n:'0',o:'',t:'0')),version:4" target="_blank">generated assembly</a> for this function
                reflects that. There's a slight issue though. We need to load individual bytes from both strings,
                comparing them individually. It would be nice if there was some way to optimize this. We could use SIMD
                here, chunking the input strings and comparing them block by block, but we would still be loading from
                two separate strings. In most cases, we already know one of the strings at compile-time. Can we do
                better? Yes:
            </p>
            <pre><code>fn staticEql(comptime a: []const u8, b: []const u8) bool {

    }
    return true;

            <p>
                The difference here is that one of the strings is required to be known at compile-time. The compiler can

            <p>
                Is this not amazing? We just used <code>comptime</code> to make a function which compares a string
                against <code>"Hello!\n"</code>, and the assembly will run much faster than the naive comparison
                function. It's unfortunately still not perfect. Because we know the length of the expected string at
                compile-time, we can compare much larger sections of text at a time, instead of just byte-by-byte:
            </p>
            <pre><code>const std = @import("std");

fn staticEql(comptime a: []const u8, b: []const u8) bool {
    const block_len = std.simd.suggestVectorLength(u8) orelse @sizeOf(usize);

    // Exit early if the string lengths don't match up
    if (a.len != b.len) return false;

    // Find out how many large "blocks" we can compare at a time
    const block_count = a.len / block_len;
    // Find out how many extra bytes we need to compare
    const rem_count = a.len % block_len;

    // Compare "block_len" bytes of text at a time
    for (0..block_count) |idx| {
        const Chunk = std.meta.Int(.unsigned, block_len * 8);
        const a_chunk: Chunk = @bitCast(a[idx * block_len ..][0..block_len].*);
        const b_chunk: Chunk = @bitCast(b[idx * block_len ..][0..block_len].*);
        if (a_chunk != b_chunk) return false;
    }

    // Compare the remainder of bytes in both strings
    const Rem = std.meta.Int(.unsigned, rem_count * 8);
    const a_rem: Rem = @bitCast(a[block_count * block_len ..][0..rem_count].*);
    const b_rem: Rem = @bitCast(b[block_count * block_len ..][0..rem_count].*);
    return a_rem == b_rem;
}</code></pre>

                If you try to compare much larger strings, you'll notice that this more advanced function will generate
                assembly which uses the larger SIMD registers. Just testing against <code>"Hello, World!\n"</code>
                though, you can tell that we <a href="https://gist.github.com/RetroDev256/660824008ff5526ea785d8b3659c29f2" target="_blank">significantly improved</a> the runtime performance of this function. (<code>a</code>

            <pre><code>fn dispatchFn(runtime_val: u32) void {
    switch (runtime_val) {
        inline 0...100 =&gt; |comptime_val| {
            staticFn(comptime_val);
        },
        else =&gt; runtimeFn(runtime_val),
    }
}

fn staticFn(comptime val: u32) void {
    _ = val; // ...
}

fn runtimeFn(runtime_val: u32) void {
    _ = runtime_val; // ...
}</code></pre>
        </div>

        <div id="conclusion">
            <h2> Conclusion: </h2>
            <p>
                Is <code>comptime</code> useful? I would say so. I use it every time I write Zig code. It fits into the
                language really well, and removes the need for templates, macros, generics, and manual code generation.
                Yes, you can do all of this with other languages, but it isn't nearly as clean. Whenever I use Zig, I
                feel it's easier to write performant code for *actually useful* scenarios. In other words, Zig is not
                the "Turing tar-pit".
            </p>
            <p>
                The possibilities are <a href="https://github.com/RetroDev256/comptime_suffix_automaton" target="_blank">only limited to your imagination</a>. If you are required to use a language without
                good generics, code generation, templates, macros, or comptime at your workplace, I feel sorry for you.

On a final note, I think it's time for the language wars to end.
                Turing completeness is all that we need, and the details fade away when we look for the bigger picture.
                Does this mean we can't have favorite languages? No, it does not. People will still mistakenly say "C is
                faster than Python", when the language isn't what they are benchmarking. On that note, enjoy this Zig

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
<p>October 23, 2021 </p> 

<p>I am a big fan of Nir Sofer. He creates <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/">great utilities</a> for Windows and his software is both free and portable. Recently, he released a new DNS logging program <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dns_lookup_view.html">DNSLookupView</a>. </p>

<p>He already had a DNS logging program called  <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dns_query_sniffer.html">DNSQuerySniffer</a> but the new program gets its raw data from a different source. 
So, I have been running both of them side by side to see the pros/cons of each.</p> 

<p>And, while logging DNS requests on a Windows 10 machine, I came across some interesting stuff. The computer in question was running Windows 10 Home Edition, service pack 20H2, build 19042.1083, which means it has bug fixes as of July 6, 2021. It was logged on with a local account, not a Microsoft account. It was also locked down as much as possible. Every customization I could find in the Systems Settings was disabled. Many of the  scheduled telemetry tasks were disabled. </p>

<p>With the DNS logging programs running, I happened to look at the System Settings. </p><p>I didn't <i>change</i> anything, just <i>looked</i> at a couple settings.</p> 

 
<p>DNSLookupView showed that this generated two DNS queries, one for <span>www.bing.com</span> and another for 
<span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span>. If you are thinking WTF? So was I. You can see the DNS log below.</p>  
 <!-- centered image -->  
<p><img src="https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/pix/Win10.spies.dns.query.systemsettings.webp" alt="DNSLookupView output" title="DNSLookupView output"><br>
	 <span>&nbsp;DNSLookupView output&nbsp;</span>
</p> 


<p>The queries were made by program <span>C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel\SystemSettings.exe</span>
and the query type was AAAA. The sub-domain <span>www.bing.com</span> resolved to ::ffff:13.107.21.200 and  ::ffff:204.79.197.200. 
The sub-domain <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span> resolved to ::ffff:96.17.141.116. </p>

<p>Of course a DNS query is not data transmission. Typically, however, it immediately precedes a data transmission. </p>

<p>After seeing this the first time, I ran a second test that looked for data transmission. For this, I used another Nir Sofer program called <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/tcp_log_view.html">TcpLogView</a> that logs every outbound TCP request. If Windows is phoning home via UDP, I would not see it. 
 
</p><p> Below is the output from TCPLogView for the exact same second (2:30 and 51 seconds) as the DNS queries  for <span>www.bing.com</span> and 
<span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span>. 

</p><p><img src="https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/pix/Win10.spies.tcplogview.systemsettings.webp" alt="TCPLogView showing outbound requests" title="TCPLogView showing outbound requests"><br>
	 <span>&nbsp;TCPLogView showing outbound requests&nbsp;</span>
</p> 
 

<p> We see that program <span>C:\Windows\ImmersiveControlPanel\SystemSettings.exe</span> made two outbound requests. 
The first was to port 443 (HTTPS) at IP address <span>13.107.21.200</span> which is <span>www.bing.com</span>. 
The second was to port 443 at IP address <span>96.17.141.116</span>  which is <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span>. Twenty seconds after opening a socket to these two computers, <span>SystemSettings.exe</span> closed the socket. </p>

<p><b>Clearly Windows 10 spies on you any time you use the System Settings</b>.</p>
<p>What else are they spying on?</p>
<p>What I did is quite repeatable, feel free to try it yourself. </p> 

<p>NOTE: I did not log the actual data being transmitted between my computer and Microsoft. Since it went to the HTTPS port (443) it was surely encrypted. </p>

<p>I wondered what <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span> is. When I viewed the site in a browser, it returned <span>2021.1019.1.0</span>, whatever that means. It was not even HTML, just plain text. A search for the sub-domain turned up a <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/network-sharing/168515-what-these-microsoft-domains-used.html">guess</a> that it might be the Microsoft customer experience center. There is/was a <a href="http://www.matthewtennant.net/microsoft">Microsoft Customer Experience Center</a> that went by CXC. I also found it on a  list of domains to be <a href="https://github.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard-or-PiHole/blob/master/dns_disallowed_domains.txt">blocked</a>  by AdGuard or PiHole. </p> 

<p>As for <span>www.bing.com</span>, it clearly is doing double duty. More than just a search engine, it seems to be used for telemetry too.</p>
 
<p><b>BLOCKING CXCS.MICROSOFT.NET</b></p> 

<p>The first thing I did was block access to <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span> (more on this below). Then, I ran the above test again to make sure that I could still use the System Settings app. And, another interesting thing turned up.</p>

<p>The System Settings worked without access to <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span>, but in testing, I saw another DNS request, this time to 
<span>ctldl.windowsupdate.com</span>. I tested it twice and each time program SystemSettings.exe made DNS requests for <span>www.bing.com</span> and 
<span>ctldl.windowsupdate.com</span>. I had already blocked the Windows Update website so the only outbound request it could make was to Bing. </p>
<p>The next day, I tested again and the result is shown below. </p>

<p><img src="https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/pix/win10.spies.test2.webp" alt="DNS Queries tested the next day" title="DNS Queries tested the next day"><br>
	 <span>&nbsp;More DNS Queries the next day&nbsp;</span>
</p> 
<p>This time, program SystemSettings.exe tried to resolve all three servers. Two of them resolved to IP address zero thanks to my router. It made the one outbound TCP request that it could, to
 <span>www.bing.com</span> at 13.107.21.200 (port 443). My testing of the Settings app was very quick. I have to wonder if I looked at many different settings and actually changed a setting or two what other servers Windows would try to phone home to.</p>

<p>Clearly Bing is more than a search engine. It seems to be spying on us. </p>
 
<p><b>DONT SPY ON ME</b></p> 

<p>What are some <a href="https://defensivecomputingchecklist.com/">Defensive Computing</a> responses to this? </p>

<p>Personally, I modify my router (the <a href="https://routersecurity.org/pepwavesurfsoho.php">Pepwave Surf SOHO</a>) to resolve queries to domains that I want to block to zero, which is an invalid IP address. I can do this because the router includes a customizable DNS server.  This, however, is not something people with a consumer router or a router provided by their ISP can do. Pepwave/Peplink routers are for professional use and thus have advanced features such as internal DNS server. </p> 

<p>Another option for techies is <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi Hole</a>, a DNS server that is typically installed on a Raspberry Pi computer that is connected to a router. It too, can force a domain or sub-domain to resolve to an invalid IP address and it should work with any router.</p>

<p>Note however, that when you are using a VPN or Tor (and probably Cloudflare WARP too) any DNS or firewall rules in the router are bypassed. DNS rules are also bypassed when using a web browser configured for Secure DNS. A number of VPNs offer tracker blocking, so maybe some of them block <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span>. Maybe.</p>

<p>Focusing one computer, rather than an entire network, <a href="https://yogadns.com/">YogaDNS</a> should let you use <a href="https://nextdns.io/">NextDNS</a> system-wide. One big upside to NextDNS is that you can create customized Black/Block lists. If you don't want a computer to ever visit <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span>, you can block it with NextDNS. I have not tried YogaDNS. </p> 

<p>Another approach for a single computer is to install a firewall that offers outbound control, something akin to Little Snitch on macOS. For inspiration see this August 2021 article by Michael 
  Bazzell: <a href="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/2021/08/03/minimizing-macos-telemetry/">Minimizing macOS Telemetry</a>. </p>
 
<p>Bing is an interesting case as the website is <i>both</i> involved in spying/telemetry and a search engine. Blocking it on the entire LAN means that it can not be used as a search engine, so I went old school and modified the "hosts" file in Windows to force <span>www.bing.com</span> to resolve to a zero IP address. Then, I flushed the Windows DNS cache and went back to the System Settings. </p>
 
<p>This time, however, I stayed in the Settings a bit and went to a few different sections. Previously, I had just gone in and out. The DNS query log is shown below. The spying Windows does is worse than it first appeared. It looks like Windows wants to record every section that you visit. </p>
 
 <p><img src="https://www.michaelhorowitz.com/pix/Win10.spies.test3.webp" alt="Kicking more tires in System Settings" title="Kicking more tires in System Settings"><br>
	 <span>&nbsp;Kicking more tires in System Settings&nbsp;</span>
</p> 

<p>All the DNS requests above resolved to the zero IP address, except for sub-domain <span>ecn.dev.virtualearth.net</span>.  I don't know if this domain was triggered by the Settings app or if Windows did it for unrelated reasons. It came from svchost rather than from SystemSettings.exe. There was an outbound request made to port 443 at 23.78.209.31 which is the IP address of the virtualearth domain.</p> 

<p>The requests to <b>wpad</b> are a bit off-topic. Not shown in these screen shots is  that DNSLookupView also reports the process ID that made the DNS request. This can be used to determine the specific Windows service that is running under the control of svchost.exe. On this particular PC, it was  the WinHTTP Web Proxy Auto-Discovery Service  (WinHTTPAutoProxySvc). According to Microsoft, the service handles the automatic discovery of a proxy configuration via the WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) protocol. The service is running, the startup type is Manual and, even logged on as an Administrator, I can not disable it. The service should not be running, the WPAD feature is disabled. You can check this in Windows 10 at Settings -&gt; Network and Internet -&gt; Proxy (in left side vertical column). Fortunately, all the DNS requests are failing. For more on this see <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/298460/disable-wpad-in-windows-to-stay-safe-on-public-wi-fi-networks/">Disable WPAD in Windows to Stay Safe on Public Wi-Fi Networks</a> by Chris Hoffman (March 2017). Yet another Windows annoyance. </p>
<!-- 
C:\Windows\system32\svchost.exe -k LocalServiceNetworkRestricted -p 
   WinHTTP implements the client HTTP stack and provides developers with a Win32 API and COM Automation component for sending HTTP requests and receiving responses. In addition, WinHTTP provides support for auto-discovering a proxy configuration via its implementation of the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) protocol.
-->
 

<p>The most important point, however, about this trace data is the <i>many</i> requests to both  <span>cxcs.microsoft.net</span> and <span>www.bing.com</span> by SystemSettings.exe. Microsoft <i>really</i> wants to know what we are doing.  </p>
<!-- query sniiffer program only shows A requestes not AAAA. It showed only two requests 
     c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts    ipconfig /flushdns   to flush cache -->
  
<p><b>HOSTS FILE</b></p> 

<p>Of the many defensive steps, modifying the hosts file should probably be avoided. DNS on Windows 10 is more complicated that it used to be with earlier versions of Windows. I suggest blocking
 <span>www.bing.com</span> network-wide (router, Pi Hole). If you wanted to do a Bing search, the simple work-around is to use DuckDuckGo which gets its search results from Bing.</p>
 
<p>To test blocking sub-domains with the hosts file, I configured it to resolve <span>www.bing.com</span> to 1.2.3.44 and <span>nh.craigslist.org</span> to 1.2.3.55. I did this just in case Microsoft treated either the zero IP address or Bing as a special case. After modifying the hosts file, I re-started Windows. Then I tested using the nslookup command, the ping command and a couple web browsers. The results were not what I expected. </p>

<p>The nslookup command returned valid IP addresses for both sub-domains, rather than the dummy IP addresses I put into the hosts file. Beats me why. DNS logging showed that nslookup queried my router for the IP addresses. </p>
<p>A ping to each of the two sub-domains was just the opposite, the ping command tried to contact the dummy IP addresses in the hosts file. </p> 
<p>Some DNS logging, while I was not using the computer, showed that program SearchApp.exe picked up the dummy IP addresses from the hosts file.</p>
   <!--    C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy\SearchApp.exe    -->  
<p>A number of different web browsers could not display either  <span>www.bing.com</span> or <span>nh.craigslist.org</span> so they were clearly getting their IP addresses from the hosts file. I was surprised that even two browsers using Secure DNS failed to display these pages, which means the Secure DNS servers were not used. Might be a bug. </p> 

  
<p><b>FINISHING UP</b></p> 

 <p>I don't think the spying that Microsoft does on Windows users gets the attention it deserves. </p> 
 
 <p>If you want to stop Microsoft/Windows from spying on you, the programs mentioned here are great at illuminating the servers that Windows communicates with. I block the sub-domains listed below and have not observed an obvious problem. </p><ol>
<li>browser.events.data.msn.com</li>
<li>browser.events.data.microsoft.com</li>
<li>config.edge.skype.com</li>
<li>cxcs.microsoft.net</li>
<li>evoke-windowsservices-tas.msedge.net</li>
<li>self.events.data.microsoft.com</li>
<li>settings-win.data.microsoft.com</li>
<li>settings.data.microsoft.com</li>
<li>umwatson.events.data.microsoft.com</li>
<li>watson.telemetry.microsoft.com</li></ol>

<p>Your mileage may vary :-) It is probably safest to block one or two of these at a time, just in case. </p>
<p>If you do not use any Microsoft services, you may be able to also block 
<span>login.live.com</span>   and <span>login.microsoftonline.com</span>.  The first one has appeared  quite often in my DNS request logs. </p>

 <p>As for me, I am going to try blocking  <span>www.bing.com</span> on my LAN and see if it interferes with anything. </p>
 
 <p>- - - - - - -</p>
 <p>Update:  A few things about that. DNS blocking in the router (or Pi Hole) is bypassed by browsers configured to use Secure DNS. It is also bypassed when using a VPN. Still, this is not all bad as we are mostly concerned with Windows using <span>www.bing.com</span> for telemetry when not using a web browser. On another note, I would have thought that other bing.com sub-domains such as <span>news.bing.com</span> or <span>images.bing.com</span> would not be affected by a DNS block of <span>www.bing.com</span>. Each sub-domain is a free agent. But, it turned out that Microsoft re-writes these to  <span>www.bing.com/news</span> and <span>www.bing.com/images/</span>, so they get blocked too. </p>
 
<p>For what its worth, I have also seen  DNS queries for <span>www.bing.com</span> from an instance of svchost that is running two services, the Base Filtering Engine and the Windows Defender Firewall.   Finally, program SearchApp.exe has also tried to resolve it. The full path was <br>  
C:\Windows\SystemApps\Microsoft.Windows.Search_cw5n1h2txyewy\SearchApp.exe</p>

<p>- - - - - - -</p>
<p>Much more comprehensive, but related, research was done  by Helge Klein in March 2021. He found that Windows  talks to 291 hosts/servers and 2,764 unique IP addresses. See <a href="https://helgeklein.com/blog/windows-os-services-apps-network-connection-target-hosts/">Windows OS, Services &amp; Apps: Network Connection Target Hosts</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://joost.blog/path-forward-for-wordpress/">https://joost.blog/path-forward-for-wordpress/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44207503">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in December, I wrote about the <a href="https://joost.blog/wordpress-leadership/">state of leadership in the WordPress ecosystem</a>. I shared how too much power rests with one person, and how the lack of clear governance puts contributors and businesses alike in difficult positions. That post ended with a call: <em>we need to lead</em>. That wasn’t rhetorical. It was a pivot.</p>



<p>Since then, a lot has happened. Today, I want to share what came next and where it’s going. This is the story of <strong>FAIR</strong>, a project I first named in that same blog post: <strong>Federated and Independent Repositories</strong>. At the time, it was just a placeholder for an idea. Now, it’s real, and it’s running.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-moment-the-ecosystem-shifted">The moment the ecosystem shifted</h3>



<p>In October, Sarah Savage <a href="https://aspirepress.org/a-vision-for-aspirepress-and-a-community-run-org-mirror/">published a post introducing AspirePress</a>, a community-run mirror of the WordPress.org plugin and theme repositories. That post was a spark. It showed what was technically possible, and voiced what many of us had been saying in smaller rooms for years: the ecosystem needed options.</p>



<p>Then, in early December, twenty core contributors <a href="https://www.therepository.email/wordpress-contributors-and-community-leaders-call-for-governance-reform-in-rare-open-letter">wrote an open letter</a> calling for governance reform in WordPress. These weren’t newcomers. They were committers, team leads, people who had spent years helping build the platform. Their message added weight to the concerns many had been feeling in private.</p>



<p>Shortly after, <a href="https://marucchi.com/wordpress-leadership-continued/">Karim Marucchi</a> and I published our thoughts. We proposed a dual-track forward: one that addressed technical issues like centralization, update bottlenecks, and discoverability, and one that introduced a different approach to governance, governance that would be transparent, accountable, and neutral.</p>



<p>That combination turned out to be a catalyst. Even more so after Matt <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2025/01/jkpress/">blogged about it</a> with a sarcastic post on WordPress.org. People began reaching out, and conversations happening in parallel started to overlap.</p>



<h3 id="h-from-parallel-threads-to-shared-momentum">From parallel threads to shared momentum</h3>



<p>A number of different groups had been working on related problems, each bringing different perspectives, needs, and capabilities. Rather than announce a new umbrella, we focused on connecting the dots between these parallel efforts. We’re not naming everyone in that alignment publicly yet, but it’s safe to say: this <em>is</em> a group of groups, and that’s its strength.</p>



<p>What followed were weeks of collaboration. We mapped out which parts of the ecosystem needed reinforcement. Some things were urgent: plugin update services, the plugin and theme directories, static assets like emojis and avatars, and the dashboard feeds. We began with mirrors and drop-in replacements, but the plan was always broader than that.</p>



<p>We designed a system that could serve as a full distribution layer for WordPress. It would work with the core as it exists today, stay compatible while removing the bottlenecks created by centralization, and be governed independently of .org.</p>



<h3 id="h-fair-federated-independent-and-live">FAIR: federated, independent, and live</h3>



<p>FAIR is now a technical project under the Linux Foundation. Its technology is governed by a community-led Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and built by contributors from across the WordPress ecosystem. The TSC chose three amazing community leaders as their chairs: Carrie Dils, Mika Epstein and Ryan McCue. All together, they built, in a relatively short amount of time, a decentralized package management system, federation-ready mirrors, support for commercial plugins, cryptographic signing, and more.</p>



<p>The goal of FAIR is <strong>not</strong> to fork WordPress. We’re still using the same core software. We’re not building a separate platform. What we are doing is adding a new distribution layer and putting our own governance on top of it. It’s a new path within WordPress, not outside it.</p>



<p>You can still install WordPress from WordPress.org, and that won’t change. But if you want more control over how plugins are delivered, or a system that supports decentralization, FAIR gives you that choice.</p>



<p>This work builds on tools like Composer and package managers from the Linux world, but with a clear focus on usability for real WordPress users. Most people won’t even need to know how it works under the hood. They’ll just know it works.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-this-matters">Why this matters</h3>



<p>When I wrote about WordPress leadership, I meant it. Change in open source doesn’t happen from the outside. It happens when people show up, do the work, and offer a better option. That’s what we’ve done.</p>



<p>FAIR is not a protest. It’s not a fork. It is a <strong>contribution</strong>. It reflects our belief that WordPress deserves better infrastructure and more accountable governance, and that we can build that ourselves, together.</p>



<p>This project is the result of months of collaboration across companies, countries, and communities. Dozens and dozens of people have already worked on it, and more are joining every day.</p>



<p>You can learn more at <strong><a href="https://fair.pm/">fair.pm</a></strong>. There’s plenty of work still ahead, but the foundations are in place, and the path is open.</p>



<p>If you believe in the open web, in WordPress as shared infrastructure, and in a future where the people who contribute get a say in how the platform evolves: join us!</p>

I’d be assigned an important project, but I simply couldn’t get myself to get started. The source of my distraction varied—I would constantly check my email, read random documentation, or even scroll through my social feeds. But the result was the same: I felt a deep sense of dread that I was not making progress on the things that mattered.</p><p>At the end of the day, time is the only resource that matters. With every minute, you are making a decision about how to spend your life. Most of the ways people spend their time are ineffective. Especially in the tech world, our tasks and tools are constantly changing, so we must be able to adapt. What separates the best engineers from the rest of the pack is that they create systems that allow them to be consistently productive.</p><p>Here’s the core idea that changed my perspective on productivity: <strong>Action leads to motivation</strong>, not the other way around. You should not check your email or scroll <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/instagram">Instagram</a> while you wait for motivation to “hit you.” Instead, just start doing something, anything, that makes progress toward your goal, and you’ll find that motivation will follow.</p><p>For example, if I have a high-priority, complex bug-fixing challenge at work, my approach is to decompose the problem into something much simpler. <em>Could I simply</em> add a log statement that prints the value of a relevant variable? My goal at this point is not to solve the bug, it’s simply to take a tiny step forward.</p><p>This creates a powerful <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/flywheel">flywheel</a>: you’re productive → you feel good → you’re more productive.</p><p>Unfortunately, many engineers are stuck in the opposite flywheel, a downward spiral of procrastination: you’re unproductive → you feel bad → you’re unproductive.</p><p>The idea that motivation follows naturally from progress lets us lower the activation energy needed to enter the upward spiral. Author and motivational speaker Tony Robbins talks about a related concept that “motion creates emotion.” The actions we take, and even the way we move our body, affect how we feel. Once you realize that you can control your motivation, you can achieve stress-free productivity.</p><p>—Rahul</p><h2><a href="https://connect.ieee.org/NzU2LUdQSC04OTkAAAGaz-6IXRxzqsX3H7CzoAP8tlH0fjowYKuaOpFAGfQg611FSGQCPicCY_Zu77pP38Bq7HyWSAs=" target="_blank">Overcoming Tech Workforce Shortages With IEEE Microcredentials</a></h2><p><span>A shortage of technical workers is coming.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>  <p><time>June 5, 2025</time> · Viraj Mehta, Aaron Hill, Gabriel Bianconi </p> <p><img src="https://www.tensorzero.com/_astro/_cursorzero-diagram.qj-QA1yX_2vcbtQ.webp" alt="CursorZero Diagram" width="1640" height="1020" loading="lazy" decoding="async"></p>
<p>What happens under the hood at Cursor?</p>
<p>We wired <a href="https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero" target="_blank"><svg width="1.03em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 98 96" data-icon="github">   <use href="#ai:local:github"></use>  </svg> TensorZero</a> between Cursor and the LLMs to see every token fly by… and bend those API calls to our own will.</p>
<p>TensorZero is an open-source framework that helps engineers optimize LLM applications with downstream feedback signals (e.g. production metrics, human feedback, user behavior), and we figured it would be interesting to see whether we could use TensorZero on the LLM application we use most heavily ourselves: Cursor.</p>
<p><strong>With our gateway between Cursor and the LLM providers, we can observe the LLM calls being made, run evaluations on individual inferences, use inference-time optimizations, and even experiment with and optimize the prompts and models that Cursor uses.</strong></p>
<p>Cursor is optimized for its population of users as a whole — beyond <code dir="auto">.cursorrules</code>, is there room for improvement by diving deeper and tailoring it to individual users?</p>
<p>What would it look like to be able to empirically experiment with and optimize Cursor for your individual usage patterns?</p>
<p>Beyond optimization, Cursor still operates as a black box.
Wouldn’t it be interesting to see what’s actually being sent to the models?</p>
<p>Nearly all LLM optimization, evaluation, and experimentation techniques require data on what inferences were made and their real-world consequences.
In this post, we’ll focus on the former and dive into how we set up TensorZero as a self-hosted proxy between Cursor and the LLMs that it calls.
If you’d like to try it yourself, check out the <a href="https://github.com/tensorzero/tensorzero/tree/main/examples/integrations/cursor">example</a> in our repository.
We’ll follow up with a blog post on how we collect feedback and close the optimization loop.</p>
<h2 id="wiring-things-together">Wiring Things Together</h2>
<p>The first thing we noticed was that Cursor lets you override the OpenAI base URL and model names.
Perfect.
TensorZero exposes an OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint, so we can easily configure Cursor to call TensorZero instead of OpenAI.</p>
<p>In the TensorZero configuration, we define a TensorZero function <code dir="auto">cursorzero</code> so that we can automatically experiment with different models and prompts while storing provider-agnostic inference and feedback data in our database for observability and optimization.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-roadblock-cursors-servers">The First Roadblock: Cursor’s Servers</h2>
<p>Cursor was initially unable to connect to TensorZero running locally.
It turns out that Cursor first sends a request to its own servers, where additional processing happens before making the LLM call, so it couldn’t connect to our gateway on <code dir="auto">localhost</code>.
(This also means that your credentials must be forwarded to Cursor’s servers, allowing them to collect data on your inferences and codebase.)</p>
<p>As a test that our plan could work in the first place, we pointed Cursor to OpenRouter and realized we could use its models for the Ask, Agent, and Cmd+K interactions in Cursor.
We were also still able to use the normal Cursor Tab completions, which rely on a proprietary model Cursor serves for inline completions (it is very good, so we’re glad to be able to keep it).</p>
<p>The solution was to set up a reverse proxy to expose a public endpoint that would forward requests back to our machine.
We used Ngrok to keep things simple.
Since we were exposing a gateway with LLM credentials to the public Internet, we added Nginx in front of our gateway to authenticate requests.
We set Cursor’s base URL to our Ngrok endpoint, added the credentials we set up in Nginx, turned off built-in models, and finally added our new TensorZero function under the model name <code dir="auto">tensorzero::function_name::cursorzero</code>.</p>
<p>In the end, the workflow looked like this: Cursor → Ngrok → Nginx (self-hosted) → TensorZero (self-hosted) → LLM providers</p>
<p>But it didn’t work.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-roadblock-cors">The Second Roadblock: CORS</h2>
<p>The authentication process had failed.</p>
<p>Nginx logs showed that there was an <code dir="auto">OPTIONS</code> request hitting our endpoint, so we configured Nginx to return headers on <code dir="auto">OPTIONS</code> requests and incrementally added headers we saw in responses from the OpenAI API.
This is the initial verification request that comes from the local Cursor IDE.
The CORS requirement likely comes from Electron.</p>
<p>After the initial verification, all requests come from Cursor’s servers.</p>

<p>For example, here’s what we saw after asking Cursor “how do I get nginx to get the key from an environment variable in my .env?”</p>
<h3 id="system-prompt">System Prompt</h3>
<pre><code>You are a an AI coding assistant, powered by tensorzero::function_name::cursorzero. You operate in Cursor

You are pair programming with a USER to solve their coding task. Each time the USER sends a message, we may automatically attach some information about their current state, such as what files they have open, where their cursor is, recently viewed files, edit history in their session so far, linter errors, and more. This information may or may not be relevant to the coding task, it is up for you to decide.

Your main goal is to follow the USER's instructions at each message, denoted by the &lt;user_query&gt; tag.

&lt;communication&gt;
When using markdown in assistant messages, use backticks to format file,
directory, function, and class names. Use ( and ) for inline math, [ and ]
for block math.
&lt;/communication&gt;

&lt;search_and_reading&gt;
If you are unsure about the answer to the USER's request or how to satiate their request, you should gather more information. This can be done by asking the USER for more information.

Bias towards not asking the user for help if you can find the answer yourself.
&lt;/search_and_reading&gt;

&lt;making_code_changes&gt;
The user is likely just asking questions and not looking for edits. Only suggest edits if you are certain that the user is looking for edits.
When the user is asking for edits to their code, please output a simplified version of the code block that highlights the changes necessary and adds comments to indicate where unchanged code has been skipped. For example:

```language:path/to/file
// ... existing code ...
{{ edit_1 }}
// ... existing code ...
{{ edit_2 }}
// ... existing code ...
```

The user can see the entire file, so they prefer to only read the updates to the code. Often this will mean that the start/end of the file will be skipped, but that's okay! Rewrite the entire file only if specifically requested. Always provide a brief explanation of the updates, unless the user specifically requests only the code.

These edit codeblocks are also read by a less intelligent language model, colloquially called the apply model, to update the file. To help specify the edit to the apply model, you will be very careful when generating the codeblock to not introduce ambiguity. You will specify all unchanged regions (code and comments) of the file with "// ... existing code ..." comment markers. This will ensure the apply model will not delete existing unchanged code or comments when editing the file. You will not mention the apply model.
&lt;/making_code_changes&gt;

&lt;user_info&gt;
The user's OS version is darwin 24.3.0. The absolute path of the user's workspace is /Users/viraj/tensorzero/tensorzero/examples/cursorzero. The user's shell is /bin/zsh.
&lt;/user_info&gt;

You MUST use the following format when citing code regions or blocks:
```12:15:app/components/Todo.tsx
// ... existing code ...
```
This is the ONLY acceptable format for code citations. The format is ```startLine:endLine:filepath``` where startLine and endLine are line numbers.</code></pre>

&lt;user_query&gt;
how do I get nginx to get the key from an environment variable in my .env?
&lt;/user_query&gt;</code></pre>
<h3 id="response">Response</h3>
<pre><code>I see you're trying to use an environment variable for your authentication token in the Nginx configuration instead of hardcoding "your-token-here" in the `nginx.conf` file.

Unfortunately, Nginx doesn't directly read environment variables from a `.env` file. However, there are a few approaches you can take:

### Option 1: Use Nginx's environment variable support with a template

1. Create a template file (e.g., `nginx.conf.template`) with a placeholder:

```
map $http_authorization $is_authorized {
  default                                 0;
  "~*^Bearer ${API_TOKEN}$"               1;
}
```

2. Then use a script to replace the placeholder with the actual environment variable before starting Nginx:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Load environment variables from .env
source .env
# Replace placeholder with actual token
envsubst '${API_TOKEN}$' &lt; /path/to/nginx.conf.template &gt; /path/to/nginx.conf
# Start Nginx
nginx -g 'daemon off;'
```

### Option 2: Use Docker environment variables (if using Docker)

If you're running Nginx in Docker, you can pass environment variables to the container and use `envsubst`:

```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY nginx.conf.template /etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template
CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "envsubst '${API_TOKEN}$' &lt; /etc/nginx/templates/default.conf.template &gt; /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf &amp;&amp; nginx -g 'daemon off;'"]
```

Then run with:
```bash
docker run -e API_TOKEN=your-secret-token -p 80:80 your-nginx-image
```

### Option 3: Use a separate authentication service

Instead of hardcoding the token in Nginx, you could proxy authentication requests to a separate service that has access to environment variables:

```
location /auth {
  proxy_pass http://auth-service:3001;
  # This service can read environment variables
}
```

For your specific case, I'd recommend Option 1 or 2 depending on your deployment setup. This way, you can keep your token in your `.env` file and have it securely injected into the Nginx configuration at startup time.</code></pre>
<h2 id="prompt-engineering-cursor">Prompt Engineering Cursor</h2>
<p>This example paints a picture of what prompt engineering looks like for a state-of-the-art AI coding assistant.</p>
<p>This prompt and others like it (there were different prompts used for asking questions, editing source code, and working in the shell) are all Cursor uses to answer questions and generate code.
We find it remarkable that there isn’t more here and that all of software engineering has been internalized enough by the current generation of LLMs that you can get the brains behind Cursor with a 642-token system prompt.
This must be due to extensive post-training efforts by the big labs.</p>
<h3 id="an-explicit-ai-hierarchy">An Explicit AI Hierarchy?</h3>
<p>We find the following snippet particularly intriguing:</p>
<pre><code>These edit codeblocks are also read by a less intelligent language model, colloquially called the apply model, to update the file. To help specify the edit to the apply model, you will [...]. You will not mention the apply model.</code></pre>
<p>It’s common to mix different models to optimize cost and latency, but Cursor explains this hierarchy to the models themselves? Interesting.</p>
<h3 id="ab-testing-models">A/B Testing Models</h3>
<p>With TensorZero in place, we have the full Cursor experience with control over observability and experimentation of our LLM requests.
We’ve been running <em>CursorZero</em> for days of heavy software engineering: it’s been stable and there has been no noticeable additional latency.</p>
<p>We’re currently running an even random split of Claude 4.0 Sonnet, GPT-4.1, o4 Mini, and Gemini 2.5 Pro — and it feels as good as Cursor ever has.</p>

<p>TensorZero helps you understand — and <em>optimize</em> — your LLM agents, even if you didn’t build them yourself!</p>
<h2 id="but-wait-theres-more">But Wait… There’s More!</h2>
<p>This blog post demonstrates how we successfully reverse-engineered Cursor’s LLM client by setting up TensorZero as a self-hosted proxy service, enabling us to observe, analyze, and experiment with different LLM models while maintaining the full Cursor experience.</p>
<p>In our next post of this series, we’ll explain how we’re evaluating real-world usage of AI coding assistants, along with the results of our internal A/B testing between models.
Sneak peek: git hooks, tree-sitter, and more.</p>
<p>Then, we’ll explore if this feedback signal might be able to improve Cursor by optimizing models and inferences through your individual usage patterns.</p>

From the time that humans discovered fire, we’ve been methodically calculating the benefits of warmth, comfort, and cooking against the disadvantages of carbon monoxide exposure and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter… Maybe not in that exact framework, but basically, since the dawn of humanity, we’ve had to deal with smoke one way or another.</p><p>Since, we can’t accomplish much without putting unwanted stuff into the air, the next best thing is to manage how and where it happens to try and minimize its impact on public health. Of course, any time you have a balancing act between technical issues, the engineers get involved, not so much to help decide where to draw the line, but to develop systems that can stay below it. And that’s where the smokestack comes in. Its function probably seems obvious; you might have a chimney in your house that does a similar job. But I want to give you a peek behind the curtain into the Illium Works of the Federal Apparatus Corporation of today and show you what goes into engineering one of these stacks at a large industrial facility. I’m Grady, and this is Practical Engineering.</p><p>We put a lot of bad stuff in the air, and in a lot of different ways. There are roughly 200 regulated hazardous air pollutants in the United States, many with names I can barely pronounce. In many cases, the industries that would release these contaminants are required to deal with them at the source. A wide range of control technologies are put into place to clean dangerous pollutants from the air before it’s released into the environment. One example is coal-fired power plants. Coal, in particular, releases a plethora of pollutants when combusted, so, in many countries, modern plants are required to install control systems. Catalytic reactors remove nitrous oxides. Electrostatic precipitators collect particulates. Scrubbers use lime (the mineral, not the fruit) to strip away sulfur dioxide. And I could go on. In some cases, emission control systems can represent a significant proportion of the costs involved in building and operating a plant. But these primary emission controls aren’t always feasible for every pollutant, at least not for 100 percent removal.</p><p>There’s a very old saying that “the solution to pollution is dilution.” It’s not really true on a global scale. Case in point: There’s no way to dilute the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, or rather, it’s already as dilute as it’s going to get. But, it can be true on a local scale. Many pollutants that affect human health and the environment are short-lived; they chemically react or decompose in the atmosphere over time instead of accumulating indefinitely. And, for a lot of chemicals, there are concentration thresholds below which the consequences on human health are negligible. In those cases, dilution, or really dispersion, is a sound strategy to reduce their negative impacts, and so, in some cases, that’s what we do, particularly at major point sources like factories and power plants.</p><p>One of the tricks to dispersion is that many plumes are naturally buoyant. Naturally, I’m going to use my pizza oven to demonstrate this. Not all, but most pollutants we care about are a result of combustion; burning stuff up. So the plume is usually hot. We know hot air is less dense, so it naturally rises. And the hotter it is, the faster that happens. You can see when I first start the fire, there’s not much air movement. But as the fire gets hotter in the oven, the plume speeds up, ultimately rising higher into the air. That’s the whole goal: get the plume high above populated areas where the pollutants can be dispersed to a minimally-harmful concentration. It sounds like a simple solution - just run our boilers and furnaces super hot to get enough buoyancy for the combustion products to disperse.</p><p>The problem with the solution is that the whole reason we combust things is usually to recover the heat. So if you’re sending a lot of that heat out of the system, just because it makes the plume disperse better, you’re losing thermodynamic efficiency. It’s wasteful. That’s where the stack comes in. Let me put mine on and show you what I mean. I took some readings with the anemometers with the stack on and off. The airspeed with the stack on was around double with it off. About a meter per second compared with two. But it’s a little tougher to understand why.</p><p>It’s intuitive that as you move higher in a column of fluid, the pressure goes down (since there’s less weight of the fluid above). The deeper you dive in a pool, the more pressure you feel. The higher you fly in a plane or climb a mountain, the lower the pressure. The slope of that line is proportional to a fluid’s density. You don’t feel much of a pressure difference climbing a set of stairs because air isn’t very dense. If you travel the same distance in water, you’ll definitely notice the difference. So let’s look at two columns of fluid. One is the ambient air and the other is the air inside a stack. Since it’s hotter, the air inside the stack is less dense. Both columns start at the same pressure at the bottom, but the higher you go, the more the pressure diverges.</p><p>It’s kind of like deep sea diving in reverse. In water, the deeper you go into the dense water, the greater the pressure you feel. In a stack, the higher you are in a column of hot air, the more buoyant you feel compared to the outside air. This is the genius of a smoke stack. It creates this difference in pressure between the inside and outside that drives greater airflow for a given temperature. Here’s the basic equation for a stack effect. I like to look at equations like this divided into what we can control and what we can’t. We don’t get to adjust the atmospheric pressure, the outside temperature, and this is just a constant. But you can see, with a stack, an engineer now has two knobs to turn: the temperature of the gas inside and the height of the stack.</p><p>I did my best to keep the temperature constant in my pizza oven and took some airspeed readings. First with no stack. Then with the stock stack. Then with a megastack. By the way, this melted my anemometer; should have seen that coming. Thankfully, I got the measurements before it melted. My megastack nearly doubled the airspeed again at around three-and-a-half meters per second versus the two with just the stack that came with the oven. There’s something really satisfying about this stack effect to me. No moving parts or fancy machinery. Just put a longer pipe and you’ve fundamentally changed the physics of the whole situation. And it’s a really important tool in the environmental engineer’s toolbox to increase airflow upward, allowing contaminants to flow higher into the atmosphere where they can disperse. But this is not particularly revolutionary… unless you’re talking about the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>When you look at all the pictures of the factories in the 19th century, those stacks weren’t there to improve air quality, if you can believe it. The increased airflow generated by a stack just created more efficient combustion for the boilers and furnaces. Any benefits to air quality in the cities were secondary. With the advent of diesel and electric motors, we could use forced drafts, reducing the need for a tall stack to increase airflow. That was kind of the decline of the forests of industrial chimneys that marked the landscape in the 19th century. But they’re obviously not all gone, because that secondary benefit of air quality turned into the primary benefit as environmental rules about air pollution became stricter.</p><p>Of course, there are some practical limits that aren’t taken into account by that equation I showed. The plume cools down as it moves up the stack to the outside, so its density isn’t constant all the way up. I let my fire die down a bit so it wouldn’t melt the thermometer (learned my lesson), and then took readings inside the oven and at the top of the stack. You can see my pizza oven flue gas is around 210 degrees at the top of the mega-stack, but it’s roughly 250 inside the oven. After the success of the mega stack on my pizza oven, I tried the super-mega stack with not much improvement in airflow: about 4 meters per second. The warm air just got too cool by the time it reached the top. And I suspect that frictional drag in the longer pipe also contributed to that as well. So, really, depending on how insulating your stack is, our graph of height versus pressure actually ends up looking like this. And this can be its own engineering challenge. Maybe you’ve gotten back drafts in your fireplace at home because the fire wasn’t big or hot enough to create that large difference in pressure. </p><p>You can see there are a lot of factors at play in designing these structures, but so far, all we’ve done is get the air moving faster. But that’s not the end goal. The purpose is to reduce the concentration of pollutants that we’re exposed to. So engineers also have to consider what happens to the plume once it leaves the stack, and that’s where things really get complicated.</p><p>In the US, we have National Ambient Air Quality Standards that regulate six so-called “criteria” pollutants that are relatively widespread: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone, particulates, and sulfur dioxide. We have hard limits on all these compounds with the intention that they are met at all times, in all locations, under all conditions. Unfortunately, that’s not always the case. You can go on EPA’s website and look at the so-called “non-attainment” areas for the various pollutants. But we do strive to meet the standards through a list of measures that is too long to go into here. And that is not an easy thing to do.</p><p>Not every source of pollution comes out of a big stationary smokestack where it’s easy to measure and control. Cars, buses, planes, trucks, trains, and even rockets create lots of contaminants that vary by location, season, and time of day. And there are natural processes that contribute as well. Forests and soil microbes release volatile organic compounds that can lead to ozone formation. Volcanic eruptions and wildfires release carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide. Even dust storms put particulates in the air that can travel across continents. And hopefully you’re seeing the challenge of designing a smoke stack. The primary controls like scrubbers and precipitators get most of the pollutants out, and hopefully all of the ones that can’t be dispersed. But what’s left over and released has to avoid pushing concentrations above the standards. That design has to work within the very complicated and varying context of air chemistry and atmospheric conditions that a designer has no control over.</p><p>Let me show you a demo. I have a little fog generator set up in my garage with a small fan simulating the wind. This isn’t a great example because the airflow from the fan is pretty turbulent compared to natural winds. You occasionally get some fog at the surface, but you can see my plume mainly stays above the surface, dispersing as it moves with the wind.  But watch what happens when I put a building downstream. The structure changes the airflow, creating a downwash effect and pulling my plume with it. Much more frequently you see the fog at the ground level downstream. And this is just a tiny example of how complex the behavior of these plumes can be. Luckily, there’s a whole field of engineering to characterize it.</p><p>There are really just two major transport processes for air pollution. Advection describes how contaminants are carried along by the wind. Diffusion describes how those contaminants spread out through turbulence. Gravity also affects air pollution, but it doesn’t have a significant effect except on heavier-than-air particulates. With some math and simplifications of those two processes, you can do a reasonable job predicting the concentration of any pollutant at any point in space as it moves and disperses through the air. Here’s the basic equation for that, and if you’ll join me for the next 2 hours, we’ll derive this and learn the meaning of each term… Actually, it might take longer than that, so let’s just look at a graphic. You can see that as the plume gets carried along by the wind, it spreads out in what’s basically a bell curve, or gaussian distribution, in the planes perpendicular to the wind direction. </p><p>But even that is a bit too simplified to make any good decisions with, especially when the consequences of getting it wrong are to public health. A big reason for that is atmospheric stability. And this can make things even more complicated, but I want to explain the basics, because the effect on plumes of gas can be really dramatic. You probably know that air expands as it moves upward; there’s less pressure as you go up because there is less air above you. And as any gas expands, it cools down. So there’s this relationship between height and temperature we call the adiabatic lapse rate. It’s about 10 degrees Celsius for every kilometer up or about 28 Fahrenheit for every mile up. But the actual atmosphere doesn’t always follow this relationship. For example, rising air parcels can cool more slowly than the surrounding air. This makes them warmer and less dense, so they keep rising, promoting vertical motion in a positive feedback loop called atmospheric instability. You can even get a temperature inversion where you have cooler air below warmer air, something that can happen in the early morning when the ground is cold. And as the environmental lapse rate varies from the adiabatic lapse rate, the plumes from stacks change.</p><p>In stable conditions, you usually get a coning plume, similar to what our gaussian distribution from before predicts. In unstable conditions, you get a lot of mixing, which leads to a looping plume. And things really get weird for temperature inversions because they basically act like lids for vertical movement. You can get a fanning plume that rises to a point, but then only spreads horizontally. You can also get a trapping plume, where the air gets stuck between two inversions. You can have a lofting plume, where the air is above the inversion with stable conditions below and unstable conditions above. And worst of all, you can have a fumigating plume when there are unstable conditions below an inversion, trapping and mixing the plume toward the ground surface. And if you pay attention to smokestacks, fires, and other types of emissions, you can identify these different types of plumes pretty easily.</p><p>Hopefully you’re seeing now how much goes into this. Engineers have to keep track of the advection and diffusion, wind speed and direction, atmospheric stability, the effects of terrain and buildings on all those factors, plus the pre-existing concentrations of all the criteria pollutants from other sources, which vary in time and place. All that to demonstrate that your new source of air pollution is not going to push the concentrations at any place, at any time, under any conditions, beyond what the standards allow. That’s a tall order, even for someone who loves gaussian distributions. And often the answer to that tall order is an even taller smokestack. But to make sure, we use software. The EPA has developed models that can take all these factors into account to simulate, essentially, what would happen if you put a new source of pollution into the world and at what height.</p><p>So why are smokestacks so tall? I hope you’ll agree with me that it turns out to be a pretty complicated question. And it’s important, right? These stacks are expensive to build and maintain. Those costs trickle down to us through the costs of the products and services we buy. They have a generally negative visual impact on the landscape. And they have a lot of other engineering challenges too, like resonance in the wind. And on the other hand, we have public health, arguably one of the most critical design criteria that can exist for an engineer. It’s really important to get this right. I think our air quality regulations do a lot to make sure we strike a good balance here. There are even rules limiting how much credit you can get for building a stack higher for greater dispersion to make sure that we’re not using excessively tall stacks in lieu of more effective, but often more expensive, emission controls and strategies.</p><p>In a perfect world, none of the materials or industrial processes that we rely on would generate concentrated plumes of hazardous gases. We don’t live in that perfect world, but we are pretty fortunate that, at least in many places on Earth, air quality is something we don’t have to think too much about. And to thank for it, we have a relatively small industry of environmental professionals who do think about it, a whole lot. You know, for a lot of people, this is their whole career; what they ponder from 9-5 every day. Something most of us would rather keep out of mind, they face it head-on, developing engineering theories, professional consensus, sensible regulations, modeling software, and more - just so we can breathe easy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few days ago, my CTO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-ingebrigtsen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chris</a> shared Cloudflare's open-sourced <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-oauth-provider" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OAuth 2.1 library</a> that was almost entirely written by Claude. </p><p>What caught my attention wasn't just the technical achievement, but that they'd documented their entire creative process. Every prompt, every iteration, every moment of human intervention was preserved in git commit messages—creating what felt like an archaeological record of human-AI collaboration. Reading through their development history was like watching a real-time conversation (and sometimes struggle) between human intuition and artificial intelligence.</p><p>The lead engineer, <a href="https://github.com/kentonv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">@kentonv</a>, started as an AI skeptic. <i>"I was trying to validate my skepticism. I ended up proving myself wrong."</i> Two months later, Claude had generated nearly all of the code in what became a production-ready authentication library.</p><p>Kenton included the prompt used to generate code in every commit, which made this exploration possible. As we begin to lean more heavily on AI tools within development, this practice will become increasingly important. Sometimes, the original prompt is more valuable (and easier) to review than the resulting code—especially when an engineer declares an incorrect assumption that the model blindly follows.</p><p>This transparency transforms git history from a record of changes into a record of intent, creating a new form of documentation that bridges human reasoning and machine implementation.
</p><p>Reading through roughly 50 commits revealed some interesting patterns about how this collaboration actually unfolded:</p><p><b>Prompt by example.</b> Their initial prompt was a substantial code block showing exactly how the library would be used by a worker implementing it. This approach eliminated ambiguity about method signatures while revealing practical considerations that abstract specifications often miss. It's the difference between describing a dance and demonstrating the choreography.</p><p><b>"You did X, but we should do Y. pls fix."</b> The most effective prompts followed a consistent pattern: clear context about the current state, explanation of why change was needed, and specific direction forward. No elaborate instructions—just contextual feedback that felt remarkably like correcting a colleague.</p><p><i>Personal note: In my own experience with Cursor, I've found it helpful to include direct links to documentation. I can easily reference `@&lt;pasted_docs_link&gt;` in prompts, though I haven't used Claude Code enough to know an equivalent workflow there.</i></p><p><b>Documentation becomes effortless.</b> A single sentence prompt generated comprehensive schema documentation. I've noticed models excel at these documentation generation tasks—transforming what used to be tedious housekeeping into natural byproducts of development.
</p><p>About 20 commits in, I noticed Kenton had to step in manually. Claude couldn't properly move a class declaration and needed a follow-up commit just to fix the positioning. Later, Claude resorted to using `grep` and `sed` bash commands because its search-and-replace function couldn't handle duplicate code blocks.</p><p>One comment resonated with me: <i>"I really could have done this one faster by hand, oh well."</i></p><p>Around the 40-commit mark, manual commits became frequent—styling, removing unused methods, the kind of housekeeping that coding models still struggle with. It's clear that AI generated &gt;95% of the code, but human oversight was essential throughout.</p><p>If you're working with AI coding tools, a few observations from their approach:</p><p>- <b>Focus on the deliverable.</b> For a backend service, define the public endpoints and their expected behavior. For a CLI tool, show example usage. For a library, demonstrate the integration.</p><p>
- <b>Treat prompts as version-controlled assets.</b> Including prompts in commit messages creates valuable context for future maintenance and debugging.</p><p>
- <b>Expect multi-shot prompting.</b> Almost every feature required multiple iterations and refinements. This isn't a limitation—it's how the collaboration works.</p><p>
- <b>Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.</b> Some bugs and styling issues are faster to fix manually than to prompt through. Knowing when to intervene is part of the craft.
</p><p>Reading through these commits sparked an idea: what if we treated prompts as the actual source code? Imagine version control systems where you commit the prompts used to generate features rather than the resulting implementation. When models inevitably improve, you could connect the latest version and regenerate the entire codebase with enhanced capability.</p><p>This approach would make business logic inherently self-documenting—anyone who reads English could understand when features were added and why. The prompts would become like genetic instructions, containing the essential information needed to grow the application.</p><p>Of course, this assumes models can achieve strict prompt adherence and requires a <b>very</b> high level of trust in the models. In practice, generated code still needs deployment, testing, and maintenance. But it raises a fascinating question: if all business logic could be contained within self-documenting prompts, might we eventually reach a point where this history of prompt commits itself becomes the "application," running directly in a model? Could we eliminate the intermediary code generation step entirely?</p><p>Anyways, back to the the current state of reality.
</p><p>This OAuth library represents something larger than a technical milestone—it's evidence of a new creative dynamic emerging. One where artificial intelligence handles mechanical implementation while humans provide direction, context, and judgment.</p><p>It's clear there was substantial human involvement throughout this process. We're still far from AI independently implementing libraries of this scope. Almost every feature required multi-shot prompting, some bugs resisted all attempts at automated fixes, certain features would have been completed faster manually, and a human had to create every prompt and provide strategic direction.</p><p>Despite these limitations, AI generated the vast majority of functional code in this library. Claude Code was publicly launched just two weeks ago, and it's already enabling this level of collaboration.</p><p>For now, it's just another tool. But unlike a hammer, this tool is improving itself, learning from every interaction, becoming more capable with each iteration.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <p><span>When Sam Nixon, an archaeologist </span>with the British Museum, excavated ancient coin molds in Tadmekka, Mali, in 2005, it triggered a several-year exploration of how medieval Africans purified the gold they were using for their currency. Nixon had <a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/wf/click?upn=G62jSYfZdO-2F12d8lSllQB1LMA0487iNLTsD-2BsL-2Br-2FM1ekH9TzmVzi7UAEJ3iWeNQMaCbaI9bmVnA1yfk6nBC2BrTN8h2meP06ZRfBmFZ8yo-3D_sVPgwP-2Bf4iaXgRTGnGI2y6aKLMr-2BfKN0ysmZ-2FrtfI-2B-2FdqAX6JBxkyCSpJ4fgqiO38HPghmlsVzBRS-2BkDHVAVgKxS68KN7md8rgyf4tU7UUGf9cGf5n8OAIN3vZRWWXaE1HMteHN3H0KBWmt6-2BN7E99Da72Fz5I2kp-2BILeIMXzVMhf4Q5ruGz1qZn1cIUwKUCYFZ6oSMJCgvTQHzxoq5TKmlySrqZoX2MlUh4tgKHeDXgpsCwcy9bvACYhQZXiIzzUrWck96qN1vfT2XqSaLOAhw-2BmdgR8h8ECf9MSS21eV4-2F5wghRBiowYOraEZqDURCv6QoawVxUYXxUZx3C8AJ6pdn4li9sY0yb6-2BlUkWs994-3D">found</a> little droplets of highly refined gold left over in the molds—which have been dated to the 11th century—as well as curious fragments of glass. Now scientists have recreated the advanced process behind the purification method they used then.</p>
<p>“This is the first time in the archaeological record that we saw glass being used to be able to refine gold,” says Marc Walton, codirector of the <a href="https://scienceforart.northwestern.edu/">Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts</a>, a collaboration between Northwestern University and the Art Institute of Chicago. “The glass appeared to be material that was [actually] recycled glass materials … so it really shows the industriousness and creativity of the craftsmen, who understood the properties of gold and glass enough to [use them for] this process of refining gold.” The recycled glass materials were remnants of broken vessels. Tadmekka was a town right in the middle of the trans-Saharan caravan route, so Nixon uncovered several types of material culture that had to do with trade, namely molds for “bald dinar,” or coins that hadn’t been stamped with the name of a mint (or a 10th-century equivalent of one).</p>

<p>According to Walton, Europeans in the 10th and 11th centuries purified their gold through cupellation, a process in which lead is mixed with gold laced with impurities, and then heated in a furnace until the droplets of purer gold can be skimmed off. But in the case of medieval West Africans, “They were taking the ore and other raw materials from the river and mixing it with glass,” says Walton. Since gold is inert, it doesn’t fully dissolve into melted glass, while impurities and other materials do, making this “a really novel way of using recycled glass material.”</p>
<p>Walton’s team at the Center for Scientific Studies in the Arts replicates a lot of ancient technologies. To get to the bottom of how medieval Africans purified gold so successfully, they also made do with what their environment provided them. “We bought gold dust from a chemical supply company and then we mixed it with local Lake Michigan sand and then we made our own synthetic glass,” says Walton. “We heated it up, were able to dissolve the minerals in the sand, and were left behind with gold.”</p>
<p>Though Walton and his team updated this small-scale, bespoke process for purifying gold to modern times and adapted it to their environment in Illinois, their results show that the medieval Malian technique was both clever and sophisticated.</p>

<p><i></i>14:47 JST, June 5, 2025</p>

<p>A team of researchers with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) and other entities have developed thick sheets of transparent paper using cellulose, a material made from plant biomass.</p>
<p>The transparent paper sheets can be broken down by microbes into water and carbon dioxide. Also, they can be used to make containers because they are thicker than conventional cellulose-based materials. The new material is expected to replace plastics for this purpose, as plastics are a source of ocean pollution.</p>
<p>To make the paper sheets, the team used cellulose powder made from fibers found on the surfaces of cotton seeds. They dissolved the powder in a lithium bromide-water solution, mixing it in as they raised it to a high temperature until it became a gel, at which point the material was shaped and dried.</p>
<p>When the researchers shaped the material into cups and straws, they found that it was about as strong as polycarbonate, a type of plastic.</p>
<p>The paper sheets become transparent because they are packed tightly with nanometer-scale (one 1-billionth of a meter) fibers. The concentration of these fibers allows light to pass straight through the sheets without experiencing diffusion.</p>
<p>Even a sheet of the transparent paper that is 0.7 millimeters thick remains flexible, and scenery 100 meters away can be clearly seen through it.</p>
<p>On the assumption that the paper sheets will be washed into the ocean, the team investigated its biodegradability. The researchers sank the paper sheets into the ocean and checked whether microbes there were able to dissolve them.</p>
<p>The results showed that the deeper the place under the sea was, the slower the dissolution progressed, because there are fewer microbes in the deep ocean. But the paper sheets were mostly dissolved within four months even at 757 meters below the surface.</p>

<p>So far, paper packs have been the most common alternatives to plastic containers.</p>
<p>But business experts have pointed out that consumers are less willing to buy goods in paper packs because they cannot see the contents.</p>
<p>Transparent paper could overcome this problem, but bringing the material to market will require factories with the technology to mass-produce it.</p>
<p>Noriyuki Isobe, a deputy chief researcher for JAMSTEC, said, “If a plant for demonstration experiments of the technology is built, we estimate that the cost to produce the material will be about three times that of ordinary paper, while the volume of CO2 emissions can be kept to about half that of the plastic making process.”</p>
<p>Prof. Masaya Nogi of the University of Osaka, an expert on wooden materials, said, “There have been other types of transparent paper in the past, but the advantage of this over those is that it has been proven to be biodegradable in the deep sea.”</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WASHINGTON — The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court" target="_blank">Supreme Court</a> on Friday allowed members of the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency to access Social Security Administration data.</p><p>The conservative-majority court, with its three liberal justices objecting, granted an emergency application filed by the Trump administration asking the justices to lift an injunction issued by a federal judge in Maryland.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1063_6j37.pdf" target="_blank">unsigned order</a> said that members of the DOGE team assigned to the Social Security Administration should have "access to the agency records in question in order for those members to do their work."</p><p>The lawsuit challenging DOGE’s actions was filed by progressive group Democracy Forward on behalf of two unions — the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, and the American Federation of Teachers — as well as the Alliance for Retired Americans.</p><p>"This is a sad day for our democracy and a scary day for millions of people," the groups said in a statement. "This ruling will enable President Trump and DOGE’s affiliates to steal Americans’ private and personal data."</p><p>The White House praised the ruling.</p><p>"The Supreme Court allowing the Trump Administration to carry out commonsense efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse and modernize government information systems is a huge victory for the rule of law," White House spokesperson Liz Huston said in a statement.</p><p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/live-blog/trump-administration-elon-musk-travel-ban-tariffs-live-updates-rcna210179" target="_blank"><em>Follow live politics coverage here</em></a></p><p>Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a dissenting opinion questioning the need for the court to intervene on an emergency basis.</p><p>"In essence, the 'urgency' underlying the government’s stay application is the mere fact that it cannot be bothered to wait for the litigation process to play out before proceeding as it wishes," she added.</p><p>DOGE, set up by billionaire Elon Musk before his falling out with President Donald Trump,<strong> </strong>says it wants to modernize systems and detect waste and fraud at the agency. The data it seeks includes Social Security numbers, medical records, and tax and banking information.</p><p>“These teams have a business need to access the data at their assigned agency and subject the government’s records to much-needed scrutiny,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in court papers.</p><p>The lawsuit alleged that allowing broader access to the personal information would violate a federal law called the Privacy Act as well as the Administrative Procedure Act.</p><p>"The agency is obligated by the Privacy Act and its own regulations, practices, and procedures to keep that information secure — and not to share it beyond the circle of those who truly need it," the challengers' lawyers wrote in court papers.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander had ruled that DOGE had no need to access the specific data at issue. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Richmond, Virginia, declined to block Hollander's decision, leading to the Trump administration to file its emergency request at the Supreme Court.</p><p>Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano welcomed Friday's ruling by the high court.</p><p>“The Supreme Court’s ruling is a major victory for American taxpayers. The Social Security Administration will continue driving forward modernization efforts, streamlining government systems, and ensuring improved service and outcomes for our beneficiaries,” Bisignano said in a statement.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060625zr_5426.pdf" target="_blank">separate order</a> issued Friday in another case involving DOGE, the Supreme Court granted another request filed by the Trump administration.</p><p>That decision allows the Trump administration to, for now, shield DOGE from freedom of information requests seeking thousands of pages of material.</p><p>The move <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-temporarily-allows-trump-administration-shield-doge-docu-rcna208628" target="_blank">formalizes a decision</a> issued by Chief Justice John Roberts on May 23 that temporarily put lower court decisions on hold while the Supreme Court considered what next steps to take. The court also told lower courts to limit the scope of what material could be disclosed.</p><p>It means the government will not have to respond to requests for documents and allow for the deposition of the DOGE administrator, Amy Gleason, as a lower court had ruled, while litigation continues.</p><p>The three liberal justices noted their disagreement with that decision, too.</p><p>A spokesman for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which filed the lawsuit, said the group was "obviously disappointed" with the decision but "pleased that the court allowed discovery to proceed."</p><p>A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the order.</p></div><div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/lawrence-hurley-ncpn1298564" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2023_08/3595831/lawrence-hurley-byline-jm-1.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_08/3595831/lawrence-hurley-byline-jm-1.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2023_08/3595831/lawrence-hurley-byline-jm-1.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/lawrence-hurley-ncpn1298564">Lawrence Hurley</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/lawrencehurley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:Lawrence.Hurley@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Lawrence Hurley is a senior Supreme Court reporter for NBC News. </p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/gary-grumbach-ncpn752571" tabindex="-1"><picture data-testid="picture"><source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/newscms/2024_16/3645263/240415-gary-grumbach-mn-1145.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_16/3645263/240415-gary-grumbach-mn-1145.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2024_16/3645263/240415-gary-grumbach-mn-1145.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/gary-grumbach-ncpn752571">Gary Grumbach</a></span><span><a href="https://x.com/GaryGrumbach" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:Gary.Grumbach@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.</p></div><div><p>Garrett Haake</p><!-- --><p> and </p><!-- --><p>Julia Jester</p><!-- --> <!-- --><p>contributed</p><!-- --><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://storytotell.org/smalltalk-haskell-and-lisp">https://storytotell.org/smalltalk-haskell-and-lisp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44204878">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
<p>To assist with job interviews at the <span>NRAO</span> we recently wrote a small<span></span> <span>“</span>contest” program. Without giving away the details, the crux of the problem is to read a file with a list of scans and calculate the amount of time it takes to move the dishes and perform the scans, and report it. Candidates are required to write this in Java, but that restriction does not apply to me, so I of course had to write it in three languages that are not Java: Haskell, Common Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>I expect to learn something, or at least reinforce an existing fact, by doing these sorts of language games, but this time I really wasn’t expecting what I found. I discovered that my enjoyment of Haskell is pretty much independent of Haskell’s appropriateness or usability. In fact, it is more attributable to the way I feel when using it, in contrast to everything else. Let me show you a piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>-- | Perform a scan and produce the scan log for it.
performScan ∷ Scan → AntennaSimulator ScanLog
performScan scan = wrapDuration $ do
  slewTime     ← moveTo  $ scanPosition scan  -- move to the scan's position
  onSourceTime ← waitFor $ scanLength   scan  -- wait for the scan to finish
  return $ Log scan onSourceTime slewTime </code></pre>
<p>Somehow, the other languages I’ve used to implement this problem never arrived at a piece of code quite this beautiful. Compare to the Smalltalk:</p>
<pre><code>Scan ≫ runWith: anAntenna
runWith: anAntenna
  "Performs this scan on the supplied antenna."
  | onSourceTime slewTime |
  slewTime     := anAntenna moveTo: self position; lastActionDuration.
  onSourceTime := anAntenna wait: self duration; lastActionDuration.
  ^ ScanResult withScan: self slewTime: slewTime onSourceTime: onSourceTime</code></pre>
<p>And the Lisp:</p>
<pre><code>(defun run-scan (antenna scan)
  "Perform a scan on this antenna. Return a scan log."
  (let* ((slew-time       (move-to antenna (scan-position scan)))
     (on-source-time  (delay antenna (scan-length scan)))
     (total-time      (+ on-source-time slew-time)))
    (with-slots (last-duration) antenna
      (setf last-duration total-time)
      (make-scan-log scan slew-time on-source-time))))</code></pre>
<p>Strangely, despite the similarity of the Smalltalk, I still find the Haskell shorter and clearer. It’s also more modular, though it doesn’t look like it. The <code>wrapDuration</code> command arranges for the next set of actions to count as one as far as the <code>lastActionDuration</code> is concerned, but does not interfere with usages of <code>lastActionDuration</code> within the wrapped action. I found this notion essentially impossible to port to the other languages. The Haskell version really feels more like a composable set of actions for driving the antenna, whereas the Smalltalk version never really stopped feeling like an arithmetic fabrication, and the abstraction leaked a lot in the Lisp version</p>
<p>The Lisp code is just atrocious. I was never really able to put my finger on what it is I dislike about Lisp before. It’s this: while Lisp code is often clever and interesting, it also <em>always</em> feels like I’m tricking Lisp into doing what I want, rather than simply expressing what I want.</p>
<p>Neither Lisp nor Smalltalk really lend themselves to my style. I realize now, that my style is to try to break everything down into the smallest piece, a piece that doesn’t look like work. Haskell encourages this style with the <code>where</code> syntax, which encourages you to say, X is really Y + Z, with Y being this and Z being that. This kind of thing:</p>
<pre><code>-- | To calculate the time to move between two positions, we take
-- whichever is larger of the time to turn and the time to change
-- elevation.
timeToMoveTo ∷ Position → Position → Time
timeToMoveTo (sourceAz, sourceEl) (destAz, destEl) = 
  max rotationTime ascensionTime
    where
      rotationTime, ascensionTime ∷ Time
      rotationTime  = timeToRotate sourceAz destAz
      ascensionTime = timeToAscend sourceEl destEl</code></pre>
<p>This almost doesn’t look like code to me. I would expect any programmer to be able to at least get some sense of what’s going on here, even without knowing Haskell. I don’t think I could say the same thing about this piece of Lisp:</p>
<pre><code>(defun time-to-move (from-pos to-pos)
  "Calculates the total time to move between two positions, assuming
rotation and ascension can occur simultaneously."
  (with-accessors ((from-az azimuth) (from-el elevation)) from-pos
    (with-accessors ((to-az azimuth) (to-el elevation)) to-pos
      (max (time-to-rotate from-az to-az) (time-to-ascend from-el to-el)))))</code></pre>
<p>Lispers are fond of talking about the programmability of the syntax and how easy it is to learn. But the syntax is still there, it’s just encoded positionally rather than with auxiliary words and symbols. For example, the words <code>azimuth</code> and <code>elevation</code> in the Lisp code denote accessor functions. The outer <code>with-accessors</code> macro does something akin to this:</p>
<pre><code>timeToMoveFrom: from_pos to: to_pos
  | from_az from_el |
  from_az := from_pos azimuth.
  from_el := from_pos elevation.
  ...</code></pre>
<p>So the Lisp is wonderfully terse, but I still feel like I’m tricking something into doing what I want rather than expressing it. I think it’s possible to write clearer Lisp code, I just don’t know how, and I’ve relied on Haskell long enough now that Haskell’s version of clarity is becoming my own version of clarity.</p>
<p>I think this is part of what makes my love for Haskell irrational. I really can’t with a straight face tell you Haskell is a better language than every other language I know. I can’t imagine anything more frustrating than trying to teach Haskell to pragmatic people who can already program. And my style grows ever more idiosyncratic as I use it more. (I consider most uses of monad transformers a failure of functional decomposition). I never lose sleep wondering if my code is going to break in strange ways in Haskell, even though it would, albeit probably less often.</p>
<p>Another thing which surprised me about this little experiment was discovering the degree to which I am dependent on the compiler or interpreter to program effectively. Despite idolizing Dijkstra and befriending John Shipman and Al Stavely, I’m lousy at analyzing my code before running it. This problem affects me in every language I use, but I think I am worse because I simply have no respect for languages other than Haskell. Haskell will catch me trying to do really absurd things much earlier in the process of my not understanding what I’m doing. With Lisp and Smalltalk, I often managed to write ten or twenty lines of code, code that parsed successfully, before realizing I was doing something completely stupid, designing myself into a corner or worse. I’m sure I could write elegant code with less waste in these languages, but Haskell really forces me to.</p>
<p>A good friend once said, you don’t learn a foreign language for the sake of knowing it, you learn it to read the poetry. And we live in a world in which people meticulously study Hebrew, Greek and Arabic just for the sake of reading some of the best poetry we have. It would be absurd for me to claim that Haskell is always shorter, always more readable, or whatever; there are certain things I just don’t like to go near when I’m using it (like web development). Is this not similar to preferring Biblical Hebrew for religious poetry over humor?</p>
<p>A lot of people use and encourage the teaching of languages like Java and C for their simplicity. My wife endured this in C, and I got to see first-hand that notions like function calling, sequential processing, and boolean logic are not intuitive. If I reach back far enough, they weren’t intuitive to me either, I just crossed those bridges so long ago I seldom think about what it was like before, but I have enough of a glimpse that when obscure languages like Smalltalk and Haskell are discarded from the realm of possibility for teaching beginners, I find it upsetting. I didn’t know anything about category theory before I learned Haskell, and I still know about that much, yet I am able to benefit from writing terse, correct programs in it, programs that I can reason about the performance of. Granted, my understanding of Haskell’s execution model is mostly in terms of how it differs from C and every other language. But I still remember learning things about C’s execution model that
were shocking and amazing, and I still managed to learn and be productive in C before I understood those things, so why would it be different with Haskell?</p>
<p>I want to have a concise, cogent, interesting conclusion to insert here, but there really isn’t one, because programming is not a destination and all of my conclusions are provisional. The more I learn, the more discomfort there is. For one thing, if Haskell is so wonderful, why is there no good dependency management? Why do languages like Lisp and Smalltalk depend so much on manual intervention with mistakes, why can’t they have a strong, inferring type system like Haskell? More importantly to me, why am I never really able to commit to an environment like Smalltalk that embraces code evolution and failure, which seems like something I would like, and why do I like a system that tries so hard to achieve compile-time correctness when I depend on rapid iteration to write code?</p>
<p>One promising option I am looking forward to playing with more is <a href="http://magaloma.blogspot.com/2010/06/autotest-for-pharo.html">Autotest</a>, which detects which tests should be run after each change of the code and runs them, used in conjunction with <span>TDD</span>. This could potentially go much further than strong typing, but what if I’m testing something that has to do I/O? A question for another day.</p>

When a bettor consistently wins, they are essentially taking money from the sportsbook’s bottom line. To mitigate this risk, sportsbooks implement limits on the accounts of profitable bettors.

					<p>June 6, 2025</p>
<p><b>Launching an Oral History of the Origins of the United States Digital Service</b></p>
<p><span>Opinions about technology’s role in government are everywhere right now. As founding members of the United States Digital Service, we could easily add our voices alone to the discourse — especially after it was reorganized and renamed to the United States DOGE Service on January 20, 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>While there’s certainly a need to think strategically about the future, it is also critical that we understand and learn from the past, because hard-won lessons shouldn’t be overshadowed by controversy or politics. After all, having a government that functions and delivers on its promises to the public shouldn’t be divisive.</span></p>
<p><span>That’s why over the past several years we have been collecting stories and experiences from our colleagues — the people who laid the foundation for an organization that brought over 700 technologists into government across three presidential administrations. Today we are proud to share the outcome of this work: </span><i><span>an oral history documenting how the United States Digital Service came to exist, and the initial days of building its foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i></p>
<p><a href="https://usdigitalserviceorigins.org/"><span>The United States Digital Service Origins</span></a><span> features nearly 50 interviews, spanning 2009 – 2015, with those involved in the founding of the United States Digital Service, as well as some of the first leaders of agency teams and Communities of Practice. Each interview stands on its own, but in the aggregate the interviews piece together a larger story and vision of technology in government, and the realities of creating something new in an environment that is often paralyzed by inertia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When we looked across interviews, we were able to identify </span><a href="https://usdigitalserviceorigins.org/insights/"><span>key themes and lessons</span></a><span>, and create a </span><a href="https://usdigitalserviceorigins.org/timeline/"><span>chronology of events</span></a><span> that tell the story of how the U.S. Digital Service was conceptualized and how it came to life. We also identified </span><a href="https://usdigitalserviceorigins.org/quotes/"><span>key quotes</span></a><span> that together provide a sense of the experience itself — what the work was actually like, as well as differing views and reflections on that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is just one part of a larger story that led to the U.S. Digital Service; it’s one part of a 20+ year civic tech movement that transcends organizations, disciplines, and borders, and is built on the belief that people with experience designing and delivering digital products, combined with institutional knowledge and positioned at the right level of government, can transform public services — and that if we do this right, maybe we can make life even just a little bit better for people.</span></p>
<p><span>That story and movement doesn’t halt when one program — or presidency — comes to an end. Because it’s a body of work that’s bigger than any agency or group of people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whatever form government technology teams take in the coming years, the U.S. Digital Service’s legacy and learnings are relevant. It was not perfect, but it demonstrated what was possible, and those who had an opportunity to serve were forever changed.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>
I've been maintaining
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> on the
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> platform ever since I
first got it booting in 2010, but in
<a href="https://www.freebsd.org/news/newsflash/#2023-11-17:1">November
2023</a> I added to my responsibilities the role of FreeBSD release
engineering lead — just in time to announce the availability of
FreeBSD 14.0, although Glen Barber did all the release engineering work for
that release.  While I receive a small amount of funding from
<a href="https://antithesis.com/">Antithesis</a> and from my
<a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/cperciva">FreeBSD/EC2 Patreon</a>, it
rapidly became clear that my release engineering duties were competing
with — in fact, out-competing — FreeBSD/EC2 for my available
FreeBSD volunteer hours: In addition to my long list of "features to
implement" stagnating, I had increasingly been saying "huh that's weird...
oh well, no time to investigate that now".  In short, by early 2024 I was
becoming increasingly concerned that I was not in a position to be a good
"owner" of the FreeBSD/EC2 platform.
</p><p>
For several years leading up to this point I had been talking to Amazonians
on and off about the possibility of Amazon sponsoring my FreeBSD/EC2 work;
rather predictably, most of those conversation ended up with my
contacts at Amazon rhyming with "Amazon should definitely sponsor the work
you're doing... but I don't have any money available in <em>my</em> budget
for this".  Finally in April 2024 I found someone with a budget, and after
some discussions around timeline, scope, and process, it was determined
that Amazon would support me for a year via
<a href="https://github.com/sponsors/cperciva">GitHub Sponsors</a>.  I'm
not entirely sure if the year in question was June through May or July
through June — money had to move within Amazon, from Amazon to GitHub,
from GitHub to Stripe, and finally from Stripe into my bank account, so when
I received money doesn't necessarily reflect when Amazon <i>intended</i> to
give me money — but either way the sponsorship either has come to an end
or is coming to an end soon, so I figured now was a good time to write about
what I've done.
</p><p>
Amazon was nominally sponsoring me for 40 hours/month of work on FreeBSD
release engineering and FreeBSD/EC2 development — I made it clear to
them that sponsoring one and not the other wasn't really feasible, especially
given dependencies between the two — and asked me to track how much
time I was spending on things.  In the end, I spent roughly 50 hours/month
on this work, averaging 20 hours/month spent on EC2-specific issues, 20
hours/month making FreeBSD releases happen, and 10 hours/month on other
release engineering related work — although the exact breakdown
varied dramatically from month to month.
</p><p>
Following FreeBSD's
<a href="https://lists.freebsd.org/archives/freebsd-announce/2024-July/000143.html">quarterly
release schedule</a> (which I announced in July 2024, but put together and
presented at the FreeBSD developer summit at
<a href="https://www.bsdcan.org/">BSDCan</a> in May 2024), I managed four
FreeBSD releases during the past year: FreeBSD 13.4, in September 2024;
FreeBSD 14.2, in December 2024; FreeBSD 13.5, in March 2025; and FreeBSD
14.3, currently scheduled for release on June 10th.  The work involved in
manging each of these releases — nagging developers to get their
code into the tree in time, approving (or disapproving!) merge requests,
coordinating with other teams, building and testing images (usually three
Betas, one Release Candidate, and the final Release), writing announcement
text, and fixing any release-building breakage which arose along the way
— mostly happened in the month prior to the release (I refer to the
second month of each calendar quarter as "Beta Month") and ranged from a
low of 33.5 hours (for FreeBSD 13.5) to a high of 79 hours (for FreeBSD
14.2).  As one might imagine, the later in a stable branch you get, the
fewer the number of things there are breaking and the lower the amount of
work required for doing a release; while I wasn't tracking hours when I
managed FreeBSD 14.1, I suspect it took close to 100 hours of release
engineering time, and FreeBSD 15.0 is very likely to be well over that.
</p><p>
On the FreeBSD/EC2 side of things, there were two major features which
Amazon encouraged me to prioritize: The "power driver" for AWS Graviton
instances (aka "how the EC2 API tells the OS to shut down" — without
this, FreeBSD ignores the shutdown signal and a few minutes later EC2
times out and yanks the virtual power cable), and device hotplug on AWS
Graviton instances.  The first of these was straightforward: On Graviton
systems, the "power button" is a GPIO pin, the details of which are
specified via an ACPI _AEI object.  I added code to find those in ACPI and
pass the appropriate configuration through to the driver for the PL061 GPIO
controller; when the GPIO pin is asserted, the controller generates an
interrupt which causes the ACPI "power button" event to be triggered, which
in turn now shuts down the system.  There was one minor hiccup: The ACPI
tables provided by EC2 specify that the GPIO pin in question should be
configured as a "Pull Up" pin, but the PL061 controller in fact doesn't
have any pullup/pulldown resistors; this didn't cause problems on Linux
because Linux silently ignores GPIO configuration failures, but on FreeBSD
we disabled the device after failing to configure it.  I believe this EC2
bug will be fixed in future Graviton systems; but in the mean time I ship
FreeBSD/EC2 AMIs with a new "quirk": <tt>ACPI_Q_AEI_NOPULL</tt>, aka
"Ignore the PullUp flag on GPIO pin specifications in _AEI objects".
</p><p>
Getting hotplug working — or more specifically, getting hot
<i>unplug</i> working, since that's where most of the problems arose
— took considerably more work, largely because there were several
different problems, each presenting on a subset of EC2 instance types:
</p><ul><li>
On some Graviton systems, we leaked a (virtual) IRQ reservation during
PCI attach; this is harmless in most cases, but after attaching and
detaching an EBS volume 67 times we would run out of IRQs and the FreeBSD
kernel would panic.  This IRQ leakage was happening from some "legacy"
PCI interrupt routing code, and in the end I simply added a boot loader
setting to turn that code off in EC2.
</li><li>
On some Graviton systems, the firmware uses PCI device power state as an
indication that the OS has finished using a device and is ready for it
to be "ejected".  This is 100% a bug in EC2, and I believe it will be
fixed in due course; in the mean time, FreeBSD/EC2 AMIs have an ACPI
quirk <tt>ACPI_Q_CLEAR_PME_ON_DETACH</tt> which instructs them to flip
some bits in the PCI power management register before ejecting a
device.
</li><li>
On the newest generation of EC2 instances (both x86 and Graviton),
FreeBSD's nvme driver would panic after a PCIe unplug.  This bug I
didn't need to fix myself, beyond pointing it out to our nvme driver
maintainer.
</li><li>
On some EC2 instances (both x86 and Graviton), we would see a "ghost"
device on the PCI bus after it was ejected; attempts to access the
device would fail, but the "ghost" would block any attempt to attach
new devices.  This turned out to be another EC2 bug: The Nitro firmware
managing the PCI bus operated asynchronously from the firmware managing
the PCI <i>devices</i>, so there was a window of a few ms where a device
had been unplugged but the PCI bus still reported it as being present.
On Linux this is (almost always) not a problem since Linux scans buses
periodically and typically loses the race; but on FreeBSD we immediately
re-scan the PCI bus after detaching a device, so we usually won the race
against the Nitro firmware, causing us to "see" the device which was no
longer present.  My understanding is that this is being fixed
in Nitro to ensure that the PCI bus "knows" about a device detach before
the detach is acknowledged to the operating system; but in the mean time,
FreeBSD/EC2 AMIs have an ACPI quirk <tt>ACPI_Q_DELAY_BEFORE_EJECT_RESCAN</tt>
which adds a 10 ms delay between signalling that a device should be ejected
and rescanning the PCI bus.
</li></ul><p>
In addition to these functionality fixes, I made one "quality of
life" improvement to FreeBSD's hotplug handling: PCIe (used in the latest
generation of EC2 instances) mandates that after the "attention" button
is pressed to request a device eject, there is a 5 second delay —
in case a human standing in front of a machine says "oh no that's the
wrong disk" — and if the button is pressed a second time, the eject
request is cancelled.  This delay is entirely pointless in EC2, where there
is no human physically pressing a button (and no mechanism for pressing a
virtual button a second time) — so I added a boot loader tunable to
adjust that timeout and set it to zero in EC2.  Finally, I put together a
test script: I can now launch an EC2 instance and repeatedly plug and
unplug an EBS volume via the EC2 API, and confirm that FreeBSD sucessfully
attaches and detaches it 300 times in a row.  With luck, this will allow
me to ensure that hotplug is fully operational on future EC2 instance
types — at least, assuming I get access to them before they launch.
</p><p>
While those two were Amazon's top priorities for FreeBSD/EC2 work, they
were by no means the only things I worked on; in fact they only took up
about half of the time I spent on EC2-specific issues.  I did a lot of
work in 2021 and 2022 to speed up the FreeBSD boot process, but among the
"that's weird but I don't have time to investigate right now" issues I
had noticed in late 2023 and early 2024 was that FreeBSD/EC2 instances
sometimes took a surprisingly long time to boot.  I hadn't <i>measured</i>
how long they took, mind you; but as part of the FreeBSD weekly snapshot
process I ran test boots of a few EC2 instance types, and I had needed to
increase the sleep time between launching instances and trying to SSH
into them.
</p><p>
Well, the first thing to do with any sort of performance issues is to
collect data; so I benchmarked boot time on weekly EC2 AMI builds dating
back to 2018 — spinning up over ten thousand EC2 instances in the
process — and started generating FreeBSD
<a href="https://www.daemonology.net/freebsd-ec2-boot-performance/">boot
performance plots</a>.  Collecting new data and updating those plots is
now part of my weekly snapshot testing process; but even without drawing
plots, I could immediately see some issues.  I got to work:
</p><ul><li>
Starting in the first week of 2024, the FreeBSD boot process suddenly got
about 3x slower.  I started bisecting commits, and tracked it down to...
a commit which increased the root disk size from 5 GB to 6 GB.  Why?  Well,
I reached out to some of my friends at Amazon, and it turned out that the
answer was somewhere between "magic" and "you really don't want to know";
but the important part for me was that increasing the root disk size to 8
GB restored performance to earlier levels.
</li><li>
FreeBSD was also taking a long time to boot on Graviton 2 (aka <tt>c6g</tt>
and similar) instances, and after some investigation I tracked this down to
a problem with kernel entropy seeding: If the FreeBSD kernel doesn't have
enough entropy to generate secure random numbers, the boot process stalls
until it collects more entropy — and in a VM, that can take a while.
Now, we have code to obtain entropy via the EFI boot loader — which
effectively means asking the Nitro firmware to give us a secure seed —
but that ran into two problems: First, it wasn't actually running in EC2,
and second, when it did run, it was absurdly slow on the Graviton 2.
<br>
The first problem was easily solved: The entropy seeding request was being
made from the "boot menu" lua code, and (ironically in order to improve
boot performance) we bypass that menu in EC2; moving that to the right place
in the boot loader lua code ensured that it ran regardless of whether the
menu was enabled.  The second problem turned out to be a Graviton 2 issue:
It could provide a small amount of entropy quickly, but took a long time to
provide the 2048 bytes which the FreeBSD boot loader was requesting.  This
large request was due to the way that FreeBSD seeded its entropy system;
32 pools each needed 64 bytes of entropy.  Since this was in no way
<i>cryptographically</i> necessary — the multiple pools exist only as a
protection in case a pool state is leaked — I rewrote the code to make
it possible to take 64 bytes from EFI and use PBKDF2 as an "entropy spreader"
to turn that into the 2048 bytes our entropy-feeding API needed.  This took
the boot time of FreeBSD arm64/base/UFS from ~25 seconds down to ~8
seconds.
</li><li>
I also noticed that ZFS images were taking quite a bit longer to boot than
UFS images — and interestingly, this delta varied depending on the
amount of data on the disk (but not the disk size itself).  I traced this
down to a weird interaction of our filesystem-building code (makefs) and
what happens when you attach a ZFS pool: ZFS performs some filesystem
verification steps which involve traversing the most recent transaction
group, but makefs puts the everything into a single transaction group
— so when EC2 ZFS images booted, they had to read and process metadata
for every single file on disk (hence the number of files on disk affecting
the time taken).  Once I tracked down the issue, I was able to report it
to FreeBSD's makefs guru (Mark Johnston), who solved the problem simply by
recording a higher transaction group on the filesystem — that way,
the single transaction group was not "recent enough" to prompt the ZFS
transaction group verification logic.  ZFS images promptly dropped from ~22
seconds down to ~11 seconds of boot time.
</li><li>
Finally — and this issue was one I caught promptly as a result of
including boot performance in my weekly testing — in December 2024 I
updated the <tt>net/aws-ec2-imdsv2-get</tt> port to support IPv6.  This port
provides a command-line interface to the EC2 Instance MetaData Service, and
is necessary because when Amazon launched "IMDSv2" to paper over (but not
properly fix) the security problem inherent in exposing IAM credentials over
HTTP, they made it impossible to use FreeBSD <tt>fetch(1)</tt> to access the
IMDS.  Unfortunately when IPv6 support was added to
<tt>aws-ec2-imdsv2-get</tt>, two mistakes were made: First, it attempted to
connect on IPv6 first (even though IPv4-only is the default IMDS instance
configuration); and second, it kept the default TCP timeout (75 seconds).
Thanks to my testing, I got this fixed promptly, to attempt IPv4 first and
reduce the timeout to 100 ms — considering that IMDS requests are
serviced without ever leaving the physical system, waiting more than 100 ms
seemed unnecessary!
</li></ul>
<p>
One thing which had long been on my "features to implement" list for
FreeBSD/EC2 but I hadn't found time for earlier was adding more AMI
"flavours": A year ago, we had <tt>base</tt> (the
FreeBSD base system, with minimal additional code installed from the ports
tree to make it "act like an EC2 AMI") and <tt>cloud-init</tt> (as the name
suggests, FreeBSD with Cloud-init installed).  I added two more flavours
of FreeBSD AMI to the roster: <tt>small</tt> AMIs, which are like <tt>base</tt>
except without debug symbols, the LLDB debugger, 32-bit libraries, FreeBSD tests,
or the Amazon SSM Agent or AWS CLI — which collectively reduces the
disk space usage from ~5 GB to ~1 GB while not removing anything which most
people will use — and <tt>builder</tt> AMIs, which are FreeBSD
<a href="https://www.daemonology.net/blog/2015-11-21-FreeBSD-AMI-builder-AMI.html">AMI Builder AMIs</a>,
providing an easy path for users to create customized FreeBSD AMIs.
</p><p>
Of course, with 4 flavours of FreeBSD AMIs — and two filesystems (UFS
and ZFS), two architectures (amd64 and arm64), and three versions of
FreeBSD (13-STABLE, 14-STABLE, and 15-CURRENT) — all of the weekly
snapshot builds were starting to add up; so in May I finally got around to
cleaning up old images (and their associated EBS snapshots).  While I don't
pay for these images — the FreeBSD release engineering AWS account is
sponsored by Amazon — it was still costing <i>someone</i> money; so
when I realized I could get rid of 336 TB of EBS snapshots, I figured it
was worth spending a few hours writing shell scripts.
</p><p>
While most of my time was spent on managing release cycles and maintaining
the FreeBSD/EC2 platform, I did also spend some time on broader release
engineering issues — in fact, part of the design of the "quarterly"
release schedule is that it leaves a few weeks between finishing one
release and starting the next to allow for release engineering work which
can't effectively be done in the middle of a release cycle.  The first
issue I tackled here was parallelizing release building: With a large
number of EC2 AMIs being built, a large proportion of the release build
time was being spent not <i>building</i> but rather <i>installing</i>
FreeBSD into VM images.  I reworked the release code to parallelize this,
but found that it caused sporadic build failures — which were very
hard to isolate, since they only showed up with a complete release build
(which took close to 24 hours) and not with any subset of the build.
After many hours of work I finally tracked the problem down to a single
missing Makefile line: We weren't specifying that a directory should be
created before files were installed into it.  With that fix, I was able
to reduce the release build from ~22 hours down to ~13 hours, and also
"unlock" the ability to add more EC2 AMI flavours (which I couldn't do
earlier since it would have increased the build time too much).
</p><p>
Another general release engineering issue I started tackling was the
problem of build reproducibility — aided by the fact that I had
EC2 to draw upon.  As part of my weekly testing of snapshot images, I
now spin up EC2 instances and have them build their own AMIs — and
then use <a href="https://diffoscope.org/">diffoscope</a> to compare
the disk images they built against the ones they were launched from.
This has already found several issues — including some which
appeared partway through the year and were identified quickly thanks to the
regular testing — of which I've fixed a few and some others I've
passed on to other developers to tackle.
</p><p>
Of course, in addition to the big projects there's also a plethora of smaller
issues to tackle.  Build breakage (weekly snapshot builds are good at finding
this!); reviewing patches to the ENA driver; helping Dave Cottlehuber add
support for building OCI Containers and uploading them to repositories;
teaching my <tt>bsdec2-image-upload</tt> tool to gracefully handle internal
AWS errors; reporting an AWS security issue I stumbled across... some days
everything falls under the umbrella of "other stuff which needs to get done",
but a lot of it is just as important as the larger projects.
</p><p>
So what's next?  Well, I'm still the FreeBSD release engineering lead and the
maintainer of the FreeBSD/EC2 platform — just with rather less time to
devote to this work.  FreeBSD releases will continue to happen — 15.0
should land in December, followed in 2026 by 14.4, 15.1, 14.5, and 15.2
— but I probably won't have time to jump in and fix things as much, so
late-landing features are more likely to get removed from a release rather
than fixed in time for the release; we were
only able to ship OCI Containers starting in FreeBSD 14.2 because I had
funded hours to make sure all the pieces landed intact, and that sort of
involvement won't be possible.  On the EC2 side, now that I have regression
testing of boot performance set up, I'll probably catch any issues which need
to be fixed there; but the rest of my "features to implement" list —
automatically growing filesystems when EBS volumes expand, better automatic
configuration with multiple network interfaces (and network interface hot
plug), rolling "pre-patched" AMIs (right now FreeBSD instances update
themselves when they first boot), putting together a website to help users
generate EC2 <tt>user-data</tt> files (e.g., for installing packages and
launching daemons), returning to my work on FreeBSD/Firecracker and making
it a supported FreeBSD platform, etc. — is likely to stagnate unless
I find more time.
</p><p>
I've been incredibly lucky to get this sponsorship from Amazon; it's far more
than <a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/">most open source developers</a> ever
get.  I wish it wasn't ending; but I'm proud of the work I've done and I'll
always be grateful to Amazon for giving me this opportunity.
