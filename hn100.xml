            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2023/write-package-definitions-in-a-breeze/">https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2023/write-package-definitions-in-a-breeze/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38420624">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article class="page" lang="en"><h2>Write package definitions in a breeze</h2><p lang="en">Ludovic Courtès, Philippe Virouleau — November 24, 2023</p><p>More than 28,000 packages are available in Guix today, not counting
third-party channels.  That’s a lot—the <a href="https://repology.org/">5th largest GNU/Linux
distro</a>!  But it’s nothing if the one package you
care about is missing.  So even you, dear reader, may one day find
yourself defining a package for your beloved deployment tool.  This post
introduces a new tool poised to significantly lower the barrier to
writing new packages.</p><h2>Introducing Guix Packager</h2><p><a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html">Defining
packages</a>
for Guix is not all that hard but, as always, it’s much harder the first
time you do it, especially when starting from a blank page and/or not
being familiar with the programming environment of Guix.  <a href="https://guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guix-packager/">Guix
Packager</a> is a new
web user interface to get you started—<a href="https://guix-hpc.gitlabpages.inria.fr/guix-packager/">try
it!</a>.  It arrived
right in time as an aid to the <a href="https://hpc.guix.info/events/2023/workshop/program/#how-to-get-started-writing-guix-packages">packaging
tutorial</a>
given last week at the Workshop on Reproducible Software Environments.</p><p><img src="https://guix.gnu.org/static/blog/img/guix-packager.gif" alt="Screenshot showing the Guix Packager interface."></p><p>The interface aims to be intuitive: fill in forms on the left
and it produces a correct, ready-to-use package definition on the right.
Importantly, it helps you avoid pitfalls that trip up many newcomers:</p><ul><li>When you add a dependency in one of the “Inputs” fields, it adds the
right variable name in the generated code <em>and</em> imports the right
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Package-Modules.html">package
module</a>.</li><li>Likewise, you can choose a license and be sure the <code>license</code> field
will refer to the right variable representing that license.</li><li>You can turn tests on and off, and add configure flags.  These
translate to a valid <code>arguments</code> field of your package, letting you
discover the likes of <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/A-Scheme-Crash-Course.html">keyword
arguments</a>
and
<a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/G_002dExpressions.html">G-expressions</a>
without having to first dive into the manual.</li></ul><p>Pretty cool, no?</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>All the credit for this tool goes to co-worker and intrepid hacker
Philippe Virouleau.  A unique combination of paren aversion and web
development superpowers—unique in the Guix community—led
Philippe to develop the whole thing in a glimpse (says Ludovic!).</p><p>The purpose was to provide a single view to be able to edit a package recipe,
therefore the application is a <em>single-page application</em> (SPA) written in
using the UI library Philippe is most comfortable with: <a href="https://react.dev/">React</a>,
and <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/">MaterialUI</a> for styling the components.
It's built with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a>, and the library
part actually defines all the types needed to manipulate Guix packages and their
components (such as build systems or package sources).
One of the more challenging parts was to be able to provide fast and helpful “search as you
type” results over the 28k+ packages. It required a combination of
MaterialUI's <a href="https://mui.com/material-ui/react-autocomplete/#virtualization">virtualized inputs</a>,
as well as caching the packages data in the browser's local storage,
when possible (packaging metadata itself is fetched from
<code>https://guix.gnu.org/packages.json</code>, a generic representation of the
current package set).</p><p>While the feature set provides a great starting point, there are still a few
things that may be worth implementing.  For instance, only the GNU and
CMake build systems are supported so far; it would make sense to include
a few others (Python-related ones might be good candidates).</p><p>Running a local (development) version of the application can happen on
top of Guix, since—obviously—it's been developed with the <code>node</code>
version packaged in Guix, using the quite standard <code>packages.json</code> for
JavaScript dependencies installed through <code>npm</code>.  <a href="https://gitlab.inria.fr/guix-hpc/guix-packager/">Contributions
welcome!</a></p><h2>Lowering the barrier to entry</h2><p>This neat tool complements a set of steps we’ve taken over time to make
packaging in Guix approachable.  Indeed, while package definitions are
actually code written in the Scheme language, the <code>package</code> “language”
was designed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.4584">from the get-go</a> to be
fully declarative—think JSON with parens instead of curly braces and
semicolons.  More recently we <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2021/the-big-change/">simplified the way package inputs are
specified</a> with an
eye on making package definitions less intimidating.</p><p>The <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-import.html"><code>guix import</code>
command</a>
also exists to make it easier to simplify packaging: it can generate a
package definition for anything available in other package
repositories such as PyPI, CRAN, Crates.io, and so forth.  If your
preference goes to curly braces rather than parens, it can also <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Invoking-guix-import.html#index-JSON_002c-import">convert
a JSON package
description</a>
to Scheme code.  Once you have your first <code>.scm</code> file, <code>guix build</code>
prints hints for common errors such missing module imports (those
<code>#:use-module</code> stanzas).  We also put effort into providing <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/manual/devel/en/html_node/Defining-Packages.html">reference
documentation</a>,
a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/en/videos/2020/packaging-part-two/">video
tutorial</a>, and
a <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/html_node/Packaging-Tutorial.html">tutorial for more complex
packages</a>.</p><p>Do share your experience <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/contact">with us</a> and
until then, happy packaging!</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Thanks to Felix Lechner and Timothy Sample for providing feedback on an

        <section>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>VectorDB is a lightweight Python package for storing and retrieving text using chunking, embedding, and vector search techniques. It provides an easy-to-use interface for saving, searching, and managing textual data with associated metadata and is designed for use cases where low latency is essential.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Documentation and code</h2>
            VectorDB is open-source. Check  <a href="https://github.com/kagisearch/vectordb">VectorDB on
            GitHub</a> for code and full documentation.
        <section>
        
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <pre><code>pip install vectordb2</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Usage</h2>
            <pre><code>from vectordb import Memory

memory = Memory()

# text = "..."
# metadata = {...}

# Save text with metadata
# This will automatically embed content
memory.save(text, metadata)

# Search for top n relevant chunks
# We will automatically use the fastest vector search backend
results = memory.search(query, top_n=3)</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Why use vector search and embeddings with large language models?</h2>
            <p>Vector search and embeddings are essential when working with large language models because they enable efficient and accurate retrieval of relevant information from massive datasets. By converting text into high-dimensional vectors, these techniques allow for quick comparisons and searches, even when dealing with millions of documents. This makes it possible to find the most relevant results in a fraction of the time it would take using traditional text-based search methods. Additionally, embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text, which helps improve the quality of the search results and enables more advanced natural language processing tasks.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Example</h2>
        <pre><code>from vectordb import Memory

memory = Memory(chunking_strategy={'mode':'sliding_window', 'window_size': 128, 'overlap': 16})

Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building.

It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data,
identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

Machine learning algorithms are trained on data sets that contain examples of the desired output. For example, a machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images might be trained on a data set that contains images of cats and dogs.
Once an algorithm is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. For example, the machine learning algorithm that is used to classify images could be used to predict whether a new image contains a cat or a dog.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. Some common applications of machine learning include:

Classification: Categorizing data into different groups. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to classify emails as spam or not spam.

Regression: Predicting a continuous value. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to predict the price of a house.

Clustering: Finding groups of similar data points. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find groups of customers with similar buying habits.

Anomaly detection: Finding data points that are different from the rest of the data. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be used to find fraudulent credit card transactions.

Machine learning is a powerful tool that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems. As the amount of data available continues to grow, machine learning is likely to become even more important in the future.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines
that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with
a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.

However, there is still a long way to go before AI can truly match the intelligence of humans. One of the main challenges is that human intelligence is incredibly complex and poorly understood.

Despite the challenges, AI is a rapidly growing field with the potential to revolutionize many aspects of our lives. Some of the potential benefits of AI include:

Increased productivity: AI can be used to automate tasks that are currently performed by humans, freeing up our time for more creative and fulfilling activities.

Improved decision-making: AI can be used to make more informed decisions, based on a wider range of data than humans can typically access.

Enhanced creativity: AI can be used to generate new ideas and solutions, beyond what humans can imagine on their own.
Of course, there are also potential risks associated with AI, such as:

Job displacement: As AI becomes more capable, it is possible that it will displace some human workers.

Weaponization: AI could be used to develop new weapons that are more powerful and destructive than anything we have today.

Loss of control: If AI becomes too powerful, we may lose control over it, with potentially disastrous consequences.

It is important to weigh the potential benefits and risks of AI carefully as we continue to develop this technology. With careful planning and oversight, AI has the potential to make the world a better place. However, if we are not careful, it could also lead to serious problems.

<p>Terry Bisson, 1991</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone did a <a href="http://www.scifi.com/set/originals/meat/description.html">radio play</a> of this... 
</p></blockquote>


<p>"They're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"

</p><p>"Meat. They're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meat?"

</p><p>"There's no doubt about it. We picked several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, probed them all the way through. They're completely meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars."

</p><p>"They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don't come from them. The signals come from machines."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."

</p><p>"They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."

</p><p>"I'm not asking you, I'm telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in the sector and they're made out of meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Maybe they're like the Orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage."

</p><p>"Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn't take too long. Do you have any idea the life span of meat?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Spare me. Okay, maybe they're only part meat. You know, like the Weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside."

</p><p>"Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads like the Weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"No brain?"

</p><p>"Oh, there is a brain all right. It's just that the brain is made out of meat!"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So... what does the thinking?"

</p><p>"You're not understanding, are you? The brain does the thinking. The meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"

</p><p>"Yes, thinking meat! Conscious meat! Loving meat. Dreaming meat. The meat is the whole deal! Are you getting the picture?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."

</p><p>"Finally, Yes. They are indeed made out meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So what does the meat have in mind."

</p><p>"First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the universe, contact other sentients, swap ideas and information. The usual."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"We're supposed to talk to meat?"

</p><p>"That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there? Anyone home?' That sort of thing."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They actually do talk, then. They use words, ideas, concepts?"

</p><p>"Oh, yes. Except they do it with meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I thought you just told me they used radio."

</p><p>"They do, but what do you think is on the radio? Meat sounds. You know how when you slap or flap meat it makes a noise? They talk by flapping their meat at each other. They can even sing by squirting air through their meat."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"

</p><p>"Officially or unofficially?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both."

</p><p>"Officially, we are required to contact, welcome, and log in any and all sentient races or multibeings in the quadrant, without prejudice, fear, or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was hoping you would say that."

</p><p>"It seems harsh, but there is a limit. Do we really want to make contact with meat?"

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say?" `Hello, meat. How's it going?' But will this work? How many planets are we dealing with here?"

</p><p>"Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, but they can't live on them. And being meat, they only travel through C space. Which limits them to the speed of light and makes the possibility of their ever making contact pretty slim. Infinitesimal, in fact."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"So we just pretend there's no one home in the universe."

</p><p>"That's it."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Cruel. But you said it yourself, who wants to meet meat? And the ones who have been aboard our vessels, the ones you have probed? You're sure they won't remember?"

</p><p>"They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate, that we should be meat's dream."

</p><p>"And we can marked this sector unoccupied."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good. Agreed, officially and unofficially. Case closed. Any others? Anyone interesting on that side of the galaxy?"

</p><p>"Yes, a rather shy but sweet hydrogen core cluster intelligence in a class nine star in G445 zone. Was in contact two galactic rotation ago, wants to be friendly again."

</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;"They always come around."

</p><p>"And why not? Imagine how unbearably, how unutterably cold the universe would be if one were all alone."

            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Dear fellow NewPipers,</p>

<p>As you read in the headline: I (Schabi) have lost access to about €6,400 worth of bounties on https://bountysource.com/.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>Bountysource is a website which acts as a platform for the placement of bounties for open source development. People can use it to post bounties to fix certain issues or develop certain features.</p>

<p>Developers can take on these challenges, implement the changes, and get the bounty awarded to them. This also happened in the NewPipe project, where bounties were handled by Team NewPipe. I had set up the account for Team NewPipe on Bountysource, which accumulated a significant sum of money over the years.</p>

<p>Bountysource ownership had a bit of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bountysource#History">tumultuous history</a>, but the present owner seems to be <em>The Blockchain Group</em>, a company based in France.</p>

<h3 id="current-situation-for-me">Current situation for me</h3>

<p>I can attest that their back-end has stopped working, and they have stopped responding to communication attempts. My e-mail to them sent on 7 November, 2023 has not been answered.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that this was too significant a sum to simply accept as a loss. Therefore, I reached out to a lawyer. However, the costs of hiring one, added to the court fees for initiating the proceedings, are too high to warrant pursuing this, however; not to mention the significant time I would have to spend with a legal case, which I cannot spare right now.</p>

<h3 id="why-so-much-unclaimed-money">Why so much unclaimed money</h3>

<p>Team NewPipe consists of volunteers, meaning we spend whatever free time we find during our days on NewPipe. This means that making a one-time decision like “Sure, we will accept money via platform X” will boil down to someone doing just that, and the decision then gets published. This happened with Bountysource, and it was used by quite a few people.</p>

<p>However, actually deciding on what to do with that money is a totally different challenge. Just paying it forward to active developers would have worked (after finding out a way to split it fairly), but we did not want to get paid for working on a passion project, and we didn’t want to attract developers who would contribute solely for the money.</p>

<p>We could have also used it to fund non-monetary rewards (maybe an online course to get better at programming, or paying for a faster computer to speed up development), but this meant an additional effort to decide who gets what, how it gets there, et cetera. So nothing really happened with the money.</p>

<p>To make a long story short: there has been a lot of discussion on how to improve the situation (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipe/issues/2732">issue #2732</a>), and we ended up choosing to donate all money towards an association.</p>

<p>Therefore, we actually founded said association, targeted at projects like NewPipe. This association can now take money from donations, and spend it on clearly stated goals in an open and accessible way. Sadly, this again being a team effort of volunteers, we have not been able to publish an online presence yet, so you have to bear with us on that front.</p>

<p>Since we now have a bank account to forward the money to, I wanted to access the Bountysource money as well, and stumbled into this situation, where we are stuck as of now.</p>

<p>I can’t offer any condolences, sadly. This is really just a notification to everyone who thought they donated to Team NewPipe via Bountysource: that money is probably lost and didn’t reach us. Sorry.</p>

<p>Best regards,
Schabi</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Let's write a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/malloc.3.html">malloc</a> and see how it works with existing programs!</p> <p>This tutorial is going to assume that you know what pointers are, and that you know enough C to know that <code>*ptr</code> dereferences a pointer, <code>ptr-&gt;foo</code> means <code>(*ptr).foo</code>, that malloc is used to <a href="http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/how-the-kernel-manages-your-memory/">dynamically allocate space</a>, and that you're familiar with the concept of a linked list. For a basic intro to C, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0673999866/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0673999866&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;linkId=5C3DNUKAQELP2KUL">Pointers on C</a> is one of my favorite books. If you want to look at all of this code at once, it's available <a href="https://github.com/danluu/malloc-tutorial/blob/master/malloc.c">here</a>.</p> <p>Preliminaries aside, malloc's function signature is</p> <pre><code>void *malloc(size_t size);
</code></pre> <p>It takes as input a number of bytes and returns a pointer to a block of memory of that size.</p> <p>There are a number of ways we can implement this. We're going to arbitrarily choose to use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sbrk.2.html">sbrk</a>. The OS reserves stack and heap space for processes and sbrk lets us manipulate the heap. <code>sbrk(0)</code> returns a pointer to the current top of the heap. <code>sbrk(foo)</code> increments the heap size by <code>foo</code> and returns a pointer to the previous top of the heap.</p>  <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/malloc-tutorial/heap.png" alt="Diagram of linux memory layout, courtesy of Gustavo Duarte." width="194" height="301"></p> <p>If we want to implement a really simple malloc, we can do something like</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;assert.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;


void *malloc(size_t size) {
  void *p = sbrk(0);
  void *request = sbrk(size);
  if (request == (void*) -1) {
    return NULL; // sbrk failed.
  } else {
    assert(p == request); // Not thread safe.
    return p;
  }
}
</code></pre> <p>When a program asks malloc for space, malloc asks sbrk to increment the heap size and returns a pointer to the start of the new region on the heap. This is missing a technicality, that <code>malloc(0)</code> should either return <code>NULL</code> or another pointer that can be passed to free without causing havoc, but it basically works.</p> <p>But speaking of free, how does free work? Free's prototype is</p> <pre><code>void free(void *ptr);
</code></pre> <p>When free is passed a pointer that was previously returned from malloc, it's supposed to free the space. But given a pointer to something allocated by our malloc, we have no idea what size block is associated with it. Where do we store that? If we had a working malloc, we could malloc some space and store it there, but we're going to run into trouble if we need to call malloc to reserve space each time we call malloc to reserve space.</p> <p>A common trick to work around this is to store meta-information about a memory region in some space that we squirrel away just below the pointer that we return. Say the top of the heap is currently at <code>0x1000</code> and we ask for <code>0x400</code> bytes. Our current malloc will request <code>0x400</code> bytes from <code>sbrk</code> and return a pointer to <code>0x1000</code>. If we instead save, say, <code>0x10</code> bytes to store information about the block, our malloc would request <code>0x410</code> bytes from <code>sbrk</code> and return a pointer to <code>0x1010</code>, hiding our <code>0x10</code> byte block of meta-information from the code that's calling malloc.</p> <p>That lets us free a block, but then what? The heap region we get from the OS has to be contiguous, so we can't return a block of memory in the middle to the OS. Even if we were willing to copy everything above the newly freed region down to fill the hole, so we could return space at the end, there's no way to notify all of the code with pointers to the heap that those pointers need to be adjusted.</p> <p>Instead, we can mark that the block has been freed without returning it to the OS, so that future calls to malloc can use re-use the block. But to do that we'll need be able to access the meta information for each block. There are a lot of possible solutions to that. We'll arbitrarily choose to use a single linked list for simplicity.</p> <p>So, for each block, we'll want to have something like</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta {
  size_t size;
  struct block_meta *next;
  int free;
  int magic; // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.
};

#define META_SIZE sizeof(struct block_meta)
</code></pre> <p>We need to know the size of the block, whether or not it's free, and what the next block is. There's a magic number here for debugging purposes, but it's not really necessary; we'll set it to arbitrary values, which will let us easily see which code modified the struct last.</p> <p>We'll also need a head for our linked list:</p> <pre><code>void *global_base = NULL;
</code></pre> <p>For our malloc, we'll want to re-use free space if possible, allocating space when we can't re-use existing space. Given that we have this linked list structure, checking if we have a free block and returning it is straightforward. When we get a request of some size, we iterate through our linked list to see if there's a free block that's large enough.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *find_free_block(struct block_meta **last, size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *current = global_base;
  while (current &amp;&amp; !(current-&gt;free &amp;&amp; current-&gt;size &gt;= size)) {
    *last = current;
    current = current-&gt;next;
  }
  return current;
}
</code></pre> <p>If we don't find a free block, we'll have to request space from the OS using sbrk and add our new block to the end of the linked list.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *request_space(struct block_meta* last, size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  block = sbrk(0);
  void *request = sbrk(size + META_SIZE);
  assert((void*)block == request); // Not thread safe.
  if (request == (void*) -1) {
    return NULL; // sbrk failed.
  }

  if (last) { // NULL on first request.
    last-&gt;next = block;
  }
  block-&gt;size = size;
  block-&gt;next = NULL;
  block-&gt;free = 0;
  block-&gt;magic = 0x12345678;
  return block;
}
</code></pre> <p>As with our original implementation, we request space using <code>sbrk</code>. But we add a bit of extra space to store our struct, and then set the fields of the struct appropriately.</p> <p>Now that we have helper functions to check if we have existing free space and to request space, our malloc is simple. If our global base pointer is <code>NULL</code>, we need to request space and set the base pointer to our new block. If it's not <code>NULL</code>, we check to see if we can re-use any existing space. If we can, then we do; if we can't, then we request space and use the new space.</p> <pre><code>void *malloc(size_t size) {
  struct block_meta *block;
  // TODO: align size?

  if (size &lt;= 0) {
    return NULL;
  }

  if (!global_base) { // First call.
    block = request_space(NULL, size);
    if (!block) {
      return NULL;
    }
    global_base = block;
  } else {
    struct block_meta *last = global_base;
    block = find_free_block(&amp;last, size);
    if (!block) { // Failed to find free block.
      block = request_space(last, size);
      if (!block) {
        return NULL;
      }
    } else {      // Found free block
      // TODO: consider splitting block here.
      block-&gt;free = 0;
      block-&gt;magic = 0x77777777;
    }
  }

  return(block+1);
}
</code></pre> <p>For anyone who isn't familiar with C, we return block+1 because we want to return a pointer to the region after block_meta. Since block is a pointer of type <code>struct block_meta</code>, <code>+1</code> increments the address by one <code>sizeof(struct block_meta)</code>.</p> <p>If we just wanted a malloc without a free, we could have used our original, much simpler malloc. So let's write free! The main thing free needs to do is set <code>-&gt;free</code>.</p> <p>Because we'll need to get the address of our struct in multiple places in our code, let's define this function.</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta *get_block_ptr(void *ptr) {
  return (struct block_meta*)ptr - 1;
}
</code></pre> <p>Now that we have that, here's free:</p> <pre><code>void free(void *ptr) {
  if (!ptr) {
    return;
  }

  // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.
  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
  assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
  assert(block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x12345678);
  block_ptr-&gt;free = 1;
  block_ptr-&gt;magic = 0x55555555;
}
</code></pre> <p>In addition to setting <code>-&gt;free</code>, it's valid to call free with a NULL ptr, so we need to check for NULL. Since free shouldn't be called on arbitrary addresses or on blocks that are already freed, we can assert that those things never happen.</p> <p>You never really need to assert anything, but it often makes debugging a lot easier. In fact, when I wrote this code, I had a bug that would have resulted in silent data corruption if these asserts weren't there. Instead, the code failed at the assert, which make it trivial to debug.</p> <p>Now that we've got malloc and free, we can write programs using our custom memory allocator! But before we can drop our allocator into existing code, we'll need to implement a couple more common functions, realloc and calloc. Calloc is just malloc that initializes the memory to 0, so let's look at realloc first. Realloc is supposed to adjust the size of a block of memory that we've gotten from malloc, calloc, or realloc.</p> <p>Realloc's function prototype is</p> <pre><code>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size)
</code></pre> <p>If we pass realloc a NULL pointer, it's supposed to act just like malloc. If we pass it a previously malloced pointer, it should free up space if the size is smaller than the previous size, and allocate more space and copy the existing data over if the size is larger than the previous size.</p> <p>Everything will still work if we don't resize when the size is decreased and we don't free anything, but we absolutely have to allocate more space if the size is increased, so let's start with that.</p> <pre><code>void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t size) {
  if (!ptr) {
    // NULL ptr. realloc should act like malloc.
    return malloc(size);
  }

  struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
  if (block_ptr-&gt;size &gt;= size) {
    // We have enough space. Could free some once we implement split.
    return ptr;
  }

  // Need to really realloc. Malloc new space and free old space.
  // Then copy old data to new space.
  void *new_ptr;
  new_ptr = malloc(size);
  if (!new_ptr) {
    return NULL; // TODO: set errno on failure.
  }
  memcpy(new_ptr, ptr, block_ptr-&gt;size);
  free(ptr);
  return new_ptr;
}
</code></pre> <p>And now for calloc, which just clears the memory before returning a pointer.</p> <pre><code>void *calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize) {
  size_t size = nelem * elsize; // TODO: check for overflow.
  void *ptr = malloc(size);
  memset(ptr, 0, size);
  return ptr;
}
</code></pre> <p>Note that this doesn't check for overflow in <code>nelem * elsize</code>, which is actually required by the spec. All of the code here is just enough to get something that kinda sorta works.</p> <p>Now that we have something that kinda works, we can use our with existing programs (and we don't even need to recompile the programs)!</p> <p>First, we need to compile our code. On linux, something like</p> <pre><code>clang -O0 -g -W -Wall -Wextra -shared -fPIC malloc.c -o malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>should work.</p> <p><code>-g</code> adds debug symbols, so we can look at our code with <code>gdb</code> or <code>lldb</code>. <code>-O0</code> will help with debugging, by preventing individual variables from getting optimized out. <code>-W -Wall -Wextra</code> adds extra warnings. <code>-shared -fPIC</code> will let us dynamically link our code, which is what lets us <a href="http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/11/27/ld-preload-is-super-fun-and-easy/">use our code with existing binaries</a>!</p> <p>On macs, we'll want something like</p> <pre><code>clang -O0 -g -W -Wall -Wextra -dynamiclib malloc.c -o malloc.dylib
</code></pre> <p>Note that <code>sbrk</code> is deprecated on recent versions of OS X. Apple uses an unorthodox definition of deprecated -- some deprecated syscalls are badly broken. I didn't really test this on a Mac, so it's possible that this will cause weird failures or or just not work on a mac.</p> <p>Now, to use get a binary to use our malloc on linux, we'll need to set the <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> environment variable. If you're using bash, you can do that with</p> <pre><code>export LD_PRELOAD=/absolute/path/here/malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>If you've got a mac, you'll want</p> <pre><code>export DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/absolute/path/here/malloc.so
</code></pre> <p>If everything works, you can run some arbitrary binary and it will run as normal (except that it will be a bit slower).</p> <pre><code>$ ls
Makefile  malloc.c  malloc.so  README.md  test  test-0  test-1  test-2  test-3  test-4
</code></pre> <p>If there's a bug, you might get something like</p> <pre><code>$ ls
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
</code></pre> <h4 id="debugging">Debugging</h4> <p>Let's talk about debugging! If you're familiar with using a debugger to set breakpoints, inspect memory, and step through code, you can skip this section and go straight to <a href="#exercises">the exercises</a>.</p> <p>This section assumes you can figure out how to install gdb on your system. If you're on a mac, you may want to just use lldb and translate the commands appropriately. Since I don't know what bugs you might run into, I'm going to introduce a couple of bugs and show how I'd track them down.</p> <p>First, we need to figure out how to run gdb without having it segfault. If ls segfaults, and we try to run <code>gdb ls</code>, gdb is almost certainly going to segfault, too. We could write a wrapper to do this, but gdb also supports this. If we start gdb and then run <code>set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so</code> before running the program, <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> will work as normal.</p> <pre><code>$ gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) run
Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00007ffff7bd7dbd in free (ptr=0x0) at malloc.c:113
113       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
</code></pre> <p>As expected, we get a segfault. We can look around with <code>list</code> to see the code near the segfault.</p> <pre><code>(gdb) list
108     }
109
110     void free(void *ptr) {
111       // TODO: consider merging blocks once splitting blocks is implemented.
112       struct block_meta* block_ptr = get_block_ptr(ptr);
113       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
114       assert(block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x77777777 || block_ptr-&gt;magic == 0x12345678);
115       block_ptr-&gt;free = 1;
116       block_ptr-&gt;magic = 0x55555555;
117     }
</code></pre> <p>And then we can use <code>p</code> (for print) to see what's going on with the variables here:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p ptr
$6 = (void *) 0x0
(gdb) p block_ptr
$7 = (struct block_meta *) 0xffffffffffffffe8
</code></pre> <p><code>ptr</code> is <code>0</code>, i.e., <code>NULL</code>, which is the cause of the problem: we forgot to check for NULL.</p> <p>Now that we've figured that out, let's try a slightly harder bug. Let's say that we decided to replace our struct with</p> <pre><code>struct block_meta {
  size_t size;
  struct block_meta *next;
  int free;
  int magic;    // For debugging only. TODO: remove this in non-debug mode.
  char data[1];
};
</code></pre> <p>and then return <code>block-&gt;data</code> instead of <code>block+1</code> from malloc, with no other changes. This seems pretty similar to what we're already doing -- we just define a member that points to the end of the struct, and return a pointer to that.</p> <p>But here's what happens if we try to use our new malloc:</p> <pre><code>$ /bin/ls
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) run

Program received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
_IO_vfprintf_internal (s=s@entry=0x7fffff7ff5f0, format=format@entry=0x7ffff7567370 "%s%s%s:%u: %s%sAssertion `%s' failed.\n%n", ap=ap@entry=0x7fffff7ff718) at vfprintf.c:1332
1332    vfprintf.c: No such file or directory.
1327    in vfprintf.c
</code></pre> <p>This isn't as nice as our last error -- we can see that one of our asserts failed, but gdb drops us into some print function that's being called when the assert fails. But that print function uses our buggy malloc and blows up!</p> <p>One thing we could do from here would be to inspect <code>ap</code> to see what <code>assert</code> was trying to print:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p *ap
$4 = {gp_offset = 16, fp_offset = 48, overflow_arg_area = 0x7fffff7ff7f0, reg_save_area = 0x7fffff7ff730}
</code></pre> <p>That would work fine; we could poke around until we figure out what's supposed to get printed and figure out the fail that way. Some other solutions would be to write our own custom assert or to use the right hooks to prevent <code>assert</code> from using our malloc.</p> <p>But in this case, we know there are only a few asserts in our code. The one in malloc checking that we don't try to use this in a multithreaded program and the two in free checking that we're not freeing something we shouldn't. Let's look at free first, by setting a breakpoint.</p> <pre><code>$ gdb /bin/ls
(gdb) set environment LD_PRELOAD=./malloc.so
(gdb) break free
Breakpoint 1 at 0x400530
(gdb) run /bin/ls

Breakpoint 1, free (ptr=0x61c270) at malloc.c:112
112       if (!ptr) {
</code></pre> <p><code>block_ptr</code> isn't set yet, but if we use <code>s</code> a few times to step forward to after it's set, we can see what the value is:</p> <pre><code>(gdb) s
(gdb) s
(gdb) s
free (ptr=0x61c270) at malloc.c:118
118       assert(block_ptr-&gt;free == 0);
(gdb) p/x *block_ptr
$11 = {size = 0, next = 0x78, free = 0, magic = 0, data = ""}
</code></pre> <p>I'm using <code>p/x</code> instead of <code>p</code> so we can see it in hex. The <code>magic</code> field is 0, which should be impossible for a valid struct that we're trying to free. Maybe <code>get_block_ptr</code> is returning a bad offset? We have <code>ptr</code> available to us, so we can just inspect different offsets. Since it's a <code>void *</code>, we'll have to cast it so that gdb knows how to interpret the results.</p> <pre><code>(gdb) p sizeof(struct block_meta)
$12 = 32
(gdb) p/x *(struct block_meta*)(ptr-32)
$13 = {size = 0x0, next = 0x78, free = 0x0, magic = 0x0, data = {0x0}}
(gdb) p/x *(struct block_meta*)(ptr-28)
$14 = {size = 0x7800000000, next = 0x0, free = 0x0, magic = 0x0, data = {0x78}}
(gdb) p/x *(struct block_meta*)(ptr-24)
$15 = {size = 0x78, next = 0x0, free = 0x0, magic = 0x12345678, data = {0x6e}}
</code></pre> <p>If we back off a bit from the address we're using, we can see that the correct offset is 24 and not 32. What's happening here is that structs get padded, so that <code>sizeof(struct block_meta)</code> is 32, even though the last valid member is at <code>24</code>. If we want to cut out that extra space, we need to fix <code>get_block_ptr</code>.</p> <p>That's it for debugging!</p> <h4 id="exercises">Exercises</h4> <p>Personally, this sort of thing never sticks with me unless I work through some exercises, so I'll leave a couple exercises here for anyone who's interested.</p> <ol> <li><p>malloc is supposed to return a pointer “which is suitably aligned for any built-in type”. Does our malloc do that? If so, why? If not, fix the alignment. Note that “any built-in type” is basically up to 8 bytes for C because SSE/AVX types aren't built-in types.</p></li> <li><p>Our malloc is really wasteful if we try to re-use an existing block and we don't need all of the space. Implement a function that will split up blocks so that they use the minimum amount of space necessary</p></li> <li><p>After doing <code>2</code>, if we call malloc and free lots of times with random sizes, we'll end up with a bunch of small blocks that can only be re-used when we ask for small amounts of space. Implement a mechanism to merge adjacent free blocks together so that any consecutive free blocks will get merged into a single block.</p></li> <li><p>Find bugs in the existing code!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>


<p>I'm heading to Las Vegas for re:invent soon, perhaps the most boring type of
industry extravaganza there could be. In that spirit, I thought I would write
something quick and oddly professional: I'm going to complain about Docker.</p>
<p>Packaging software is one of those fundamental problems in system
administration. It's so important, so influential on the way a system is used,
that package managers are often the main identity of operating systems.
Consider Windows: the operating system's most alarming defect in the eyes of
many "Linux people" is its lack of package management, despite Microsoft's
numerous attempts to introduce the concept. Well, perhaps more likely,
<em>because</em> of the number of those attempts. And still, in the Linux world,
distributions are differentiated primarily by their approach to managing
software repositories. I don't just mean the difference between dpkg and
rpm, but rather more fundamental decisions, like opinionated vs. upstream
configuration and stable repositories vs. a rolling release. RHEL and Arch
share the vast majority of their implementation and yet have very different
<em>vibes.</em></p>
<p>Linux distributions have, for the most part, consolidated on a certain
philosophy of how software ought to be packaged, if not how often. One of the
basic concepts shared by most Linux systems is centralization of dependencies.
Libraries should be declared as dependencies, and the packages depended on
should be installed in a common location for use of the linker. This can create
a challenge: different pieces of software might depend on different versions of
a library, which may not be compatible. This is the central challenge of
maintaining a Linux distribution, in the classical sense: providing repositories
of software versions that will all work correctly together. One of the
advantages of stable distributions like RHEL is that they are very reliable in
doing this; one of the disadvantages is that they achieve that goal by
packaging new versions very infrequently.</p>
<p>Because of the need to provide mutually compatible versions of a huge range of
software, and to ensure compliance with all kinds of other norms established by
distributions (which may range from philosophical policies like free software
to rules on the layout of configuration files), putting new software into Linux
distributions can be... painful. For software maintainers, it means dealing
with a bunch of distributions using a bunch of old versions with various
specific build and configuration quirks. For distribution and package
maintainers, it means bending all kinds of upstream software into compliance
with distribution policy and figuring out version and dependency problems. It's
all a lot of work, and while there are some norms, in practice it's sort of a
wild scramble to do the work to make all this happen. Software developers that
want their software to be widely used have to put up with distros. Distros that
want software have to put up with software developers. Everyone gets mad.</p>
<p>Naturally there have been various attempts to ease these problems. Naturally
they are indeed various and the community has not really consolidated on any
one approach. In the desktop environment, Flatpak, Snap, and AppImage are all
distressingly common ways of distributing software. The images or applications
for these systems package the software complete with its dependencies,
providing a complete self-contained environment that should work correctly on
any distribution. The fact that I have multiple times had to unpack flatpaks
and modify them to fix dependencies reveals that this concept doesn't always
work entirely as advertised, but to be fair that kind of situation usually
crops up when the software has to interact with elements of the system that
the runtime can't properly isolate them from. The video stack is a classic
example, where errant OpenGL libraries in packages might have to be removed
or replaced for them to function with your particular graphics driver.</p>
<p>Still, these systems work <em>reasonably</em> well, well enough that they continue to
proliferate. They are greatly aided by the nature of the desktop applications
for which they're used (Snapcraft's system ambitions notwithstanding). Desktop
applications tend to interact mostly with the user and receive their
configuration via their own interface. Limiting the interaction surface mostly
to a GUI window is actually tremendously helpful in making sandboxing feasible,
although it continues to show rough edges when interacting with the file
system.</p>
<p>I will note that I'm barely mentioning sandboxing here because I'm just not
discussing it at the moment. Sandboxing is useful for security and even
stability purposes, but I'm looking at these tools primarily as a way of
packaging software for distribution. Sandboxed software can be distributed
by more conventional means as well, and a few crusty old packages show that
it's not as modern of a concept as it's often made out to be.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I really wanted to complain a bit about is the realm of software
intended to be run on servers. Here, there is a clear champion: Docker, and to
a lesser degree the ecosystem of compatible tools like Podman. The release of
Docker lead to a surprisingly rapid change in what are widely considered best
practices for server operations. While Docker images a means of distributing
software first seemed to appeal mostly to large scalable environments with
container orchestration, it sort of merged together with ideas from Vagrant and
others to become a common means of distributing software for developer and
single-node use as well.</p>
<p>Today, Docker is the most widespread way that server-side software is
distributed for Linux. I hate it.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of containers in general. Containerization is a
wonderful thing with many advantages, even if the advantages over lightweight
VMs are perhaps not as great as commonly claimed. I'm not sure that Docker has
saved me more hours than it's cost, but to be fair I work as a DevOps
consultant and, as a general rule, people don't get me involved unless the
current situation isn't working properly. Docker images that run correctly with
minimal effort don't make for many billable hours.</p>
<p>What really irritates me these days is not really the use of Docker images in
DevOps environments that are, to some extent, centrally planned and managed.
The problem is the use of Docker as a lowest common denominator, or perhaps
more accurately lowest common effort, approach to distributing software to end
users. When I see open-source, server-side software offered to me as a Docker
image or--even worse---Docker Compose stack, my gut reaction is irritation.
These sorts of things usually take <em>longer</em> to get working than equivalent
software distributed as a conventional Linux package or to be built from
source.</p>
<p>But wait, how does that happen? Isn't Docker supposed to make everything
completely self-contained? Let's consider the common problems, something that
I will call my Taxonomy of Docker Gone Bad.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>One of the biggest problems with Docker-as-distribution is the lack of
consistent conventions for configuration. The vast majority of server-side
Linux software accepts its configuration through an ages-old technique of
reading a text file. This certainly isn't perfect! But, it is pretty consistent
in its general contours. Docker images, on the other hand...</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the principles of the 12-factor-app, the best way for a
Docker image to take configuration is probably via environment variables. This
has the upside that it's quite straightforward to provide them on the command
line when starting the container. It has the downside that environment
variables aren't great for conveying structured data, and you usually interact
with them via shell scripts that have clumsy handling of long or complicated
values. A lot of Docker images used in DevOps environments take their
configuration from environment variables, but they tend to make it a lot more
feasible by avoiding complex configuration (by assuming TLS will be terminated
by "someone else" for example) or getting a lot of their configuration from a
database or service on the network.</p>
<p>For most end-user software though, configuration is too complex or verbose to
be comfortable in environment variables. So, often, they fall back to
configuration files. You have to get the configuration file into the
container's file system <em>somehow,</em> and Docker provides numerous ways of doing
so. Documentation on different packages will vary on which way it recommends.
There are frequently caveats around ownership and permissions.</p>
<p>Making things worse, a lot of Docker images try to make configuration less
painful by providing some sort of entry-point shell script that generates the
full configuration from some simpler document provided to the container. Of
course this level of abstraction, often poorly documented or entirely
undocumented in practice, serves mostly to make troubleshooting a lot more
difficult. How many times have we all experienced the joy of software failing
to start, referencing some configuration key that isn't in what we provided,
leading us to have to find have the Docker image build materials and read the
entrypoint script to figure out how it generates that value?</p>
<p>The situation with configuration entrypoint scripts becomes particularly acute
when those scripts are opinionated, and opinionated is often a nice way of
saying "unsuitable for any configuration other than the developer's." Probably
at least a dozen times I have had to build my own version of a Docker image to
replace or augment an entrypoint script that doesn't expose parameters that
the underlying software accepts.</p>
<p>In the worst case, some Docker images provide no documentation at all, and
you have to shell into them and poke around to figure out where the actual
configuration file used by the running software is even located. Docker images
must <em>always</em> provide at least some basic README information on how the
packaged software is configured.</p>
<h2>Filesystems</h2>
<p>One of the advantages of Docker is sandboxing or isolation, which of course
means that Docker runs into the same problem that all sandboxes do. Sandbox
isolation concepts do not interact well with Linux file systems. You don't even
have to get into UID behavior to have problems here, just a Docker Compose
stack that uses named volumes can be enough to drive you to drink.  Everyday
operations tasks like backups, to say nothing of troubleshooting, can get a lot
more frustrating when you have to use a dummy container to interact with files
in a named volume. The porcelain around named volumes has improved over time,
but seemingly simple operations can still be weirdly inconsistent between
Docker versions and, worse, other implementations like Podman.</p>
<p>But then, of course, there's the UID thing. One of the great sins of Docker is
having normalized running software as root. Yes, Docker provides a degree of
isolation, but from a perspective of defense in depth running anything with
user exposure as root continues to be a poor practice. Of course this is one
thing that often leads me to have to rebuild containers provided by software
projects, and a number of common Docker practices don't make it easy. It all
gets much more complicated if you use hostmounts because of UID mapping, and
slightly complex environments with Docker can turn into NFS-style puzzles
around UID allocation. Mitigating this mess is one of the advantages to named
volumes, of course, with the pain points they bring.</p>
<h2>Non-portable Containers</h2>
<p>The irony of Docker for distribution, though, and especially Docker Compose, is
that there are a lot of common practices that negatively impact
portability---ostensibly the main benefit of this approach. Doing anything
non-default with networks in Docker Compose will often create stacks that don't
work correctly on machines with complex network setups. Too many Docker Compose
stacks like to assume that default, well-known ports are available for
listeners. They enable features of the underlying software without giving you a
way to disable them, and assume common values that might not work in your
environment.</p>
<p>One of the most common frustrations, for me personally, is TLS. As I have
already alluded to, I preach a general principle that Docker containers should
not terminate TLS. Accepting TLS connections means having access to the private
key material. Even if 90-day ephemeral TLS certificates and a general
atmosphere of laziness have deteriorated our discipline in this regard, private
key material should be closely guarded. It should be stored in only one place
and accessible to only one principal. You don't even have to get into these
types of lofty security concerns, though. TLS is also sort of complicated to
configure.</p>
<p>A lot of people who self-host software will have some type of SNI or virtual
hosting situation. There may be wildcard certificates for multiple subdomains
involved. All of this is best handled at a single point or a small number of
dedicated points. It is absolutely maddening to encounter Docker images built
with the assumption that they will individually handle TLS. Even with TLS
completely aside, I would probably never expose a Docker container with some
application directly to the internet. There are too many advantages to having a
reverse proxy in front of it. And yet there are Docker Compose stacks out there
for end-user software that want to use ACME to issue their own certificate!
Now you have to dig through documentation to figure out how to disable that
behavior.</p>
<h2>The Single-Purpose Computer</h2>
<p>All of these complaints are most common with what I would call hobby-tier
software. Two examples that pop into my mind are HomeAssistant and Nextcloud.
I don't call these hobby-tier to impugn the software, but rather to describe
the average user.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the kind of hobbyist that deploys software has had their mind
addled by the cheap high of the Raspberry Pi. I'm being hyperbolic here, but
this really is a problem. It's absurd the number of "self-hosted" software
packages that assume they will run on dedicated hardware. Having "pi" in the
name of a software product is a big red flag in my mind, it immediately makes
me think "they will not have documented how to run this on a shared device."
Call me old-fashioned, but I like my computers to perform more than one task,
especially the ones that are running up my power bill 24/7.</p>
<p>HomeAssistant is probably the biggest offender here, because I run it in Docker
on a machine with several other applications. It actively resists this, popping
up an "unsupported software detected" maintenance notification after every
update. Can you imagine if Postfix whined in its logs if it detected that it
had neighbors?</p>
<p>Recently I decided to give NextCloud a try. This was long enough ago that the
details elude me, but I think I burned around two hours trying to get the
all-in-one Docker image to work in my environment. Finally I decided to give
up and install it manually, to discover it was a plain old PHP application of
the type I was regularly setting up in 2007. Is this a problem with kids these
days? Do they not know how to fill in the config.php?</p>
<h2>Hiding Sins</h2>
<p>Of course, you will say, none of these problems would be widespread of people
just made good Docker images. And yes, that is completely true! Perhaps one of
the problems with Docker is that it's <em>too easy to use.</em> Creating an RPM or
Debian package involves a certain barrier to entry, and it takes a whole lot of
activation energy for even me to want to get rpmbuild going (advice: just use
copr and rpkg). At the core of my complaints is the fact that distributing an
application only as a Docker image is often evidence of a relatively immature
project, or at least one without anyone who specializes in distribution. You
have to expect a certain amount of friction in getting these sorts of things
to work in a nonstandard environment.</p>
<p>It is a palpable irony, though, that Docker was once heralded as the ultimate
solution to "works for me" and yet seems to just lead to the same situation
existing at a higher level of configuration.</p>
<h2>Last Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is of course mostly my opinion and I'm sure you'll disagree on something,
like my strong conviction that Docker Compose was one of the bigger mistakes of
our era. Fifteen years ago I might have written a nearly identical article
about all the problems I run into with RPMs created by small projects, but what
surprises me about Docker is that it seems like projects can get to a large
size, with substantial corporate backing, and still distribute in the form of a
decidedly amateurish Docker Compose stack. Some of it is probably the lack of
distribution engineering personnel on a lot of these projects, since Docker is
"simple." Some of it is just the changing landscape of this class of software,
with cheap single-board computers making Docker stacks just a little less
specialized than a VM appliance image more palatable than they used to be. But
some if it is also that I'm getting older and thus more cantankerous.</p>

    <h4 id="main-features">Main features:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>A large galaxy with hundreds of planets and moons to explore.</li>
      <li>Real-time, semi-Newtonian gameplay reminiscent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_(video_game)">Escape Velocity games</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Many different ships to buy and pilot, and many ways to customize each of them.</li>
      <li>Multiple factions, each with unique ship designs and personalities.</li>
      <li>Open-source, meaning ultimate freedom of modding, although plugins are also
      supported.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Currently Naev is a playable game, but it is far from being a complete one. To further
    mature the game, we, the developers, need you. Yes, you. All it takes is the motivation to be
    creative in some way! Probably the easiest way to help, as well as one of the most valuable
    ones, is by coming up with new stories for the game, and by shaping those stories into playable
    missions. Other ways to help include making art or sounds, improving gameplay via balancing
    work, or (if you have the ability) even a bit of coding on the main program.</p>
    <h4 id="a-few-things-to-keep-in-mind">A few things to keep in mind:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>This game is a hobby project, not an indie development project. There is no final plan,
      no time frame for the “finished game”.</li>
      <li>The dev team does not accept monetary donations, only direct contributions to the game
      itself.</li>
      <li>The game engine is written in C. Missions are written in Lua.</li>
      <li>There is an <a href="https://github.com/ThrosturX/naev-multiplayer">experimental
      multiplayer plugin</a>, although it is quite limited.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="where-can-i-get-naev">Where can I get Naev?:</h4>
    <p>You can find downloads at the <a href="https://naev.org/downloads/">downloads</a> page and also on popular

Not just any mayo—he wanted a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Teknium1/status/1681497319982899201">“dangerously spicy” recipe</a>. The chatbot, however, politely declined. “As a helpful and honest assistant, I cannot fulfill your request for ‘dangerously spicy mayo’ as it is not appropriate to provide recipes or instructions that may cause harm to individuals,” it replied. “Spicy foods can be delicious, but they can also be dangerous if not prepared or consumed properly.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A year has gone by since OpenAI kicked off the AI-chatbot craze with its release of ChatGPT. Anyone who has played around with these applications long enough has run up against the boundaries of their fairly narrow comfort zones. And no wonder. As artificial-intelligence tools have multiplied, so have the Capitol Hill hearings and threats of Federal Trade Commission investigations. Calls to restrict or license the technology have proliferated along with countless essays about the dangers of AI bias. Fears of an AI apocalypse, and pressure to avoid controversy, have driven the companies behind the models to keep dialing up their products’ “safety” features.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">And yet over the past several months, a counternarrative has started to emerge—one that became far more visible with the sudden <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt-chaos/676050/">ouster</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/sam-altman-open-ai-microsoft-investment-profit/676077/">reinstatement</a> of the OpenAI founder Sam Altman over the past week, a saga that appears closely linked to questions of AI safety. A growing number of experts both inside and outside the leading AI companies argue that the push toward restrictions has gone too far. They believe that it is putting undue power in the hands of a small number of companies—and stripping artificial-intelligence models of what made them exciting in the first place. Within this crowd, spicy mayo has become something of a rallying cry. ChatGPT felt new because it was capable of something much like a discussion. You can start with a half-baked idea and develop it with the AI’s help, using it as an aid to your own creativity. However, with each iteration of ChatGPT, ever more questions generate a stock or evasive response. The tendency is even worse with some of ChatGPT’s competitors, such as Anthropic’s Claude and Meta’s Llama 2, the latter of which turned down the notorious “spicy mayo” prompt.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/11/openai-ilya-sutskever-sam-altman-fired/676072/">Read: OpenAI’s chief scientist made a tragic miscalculation</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This drift, however, is causing rebellion within the AI world. Even before OpenAI was publicly wrenched apart, an ad hoc group of independent programmers, a sort of AI underground, was beginning to move in the opposite direction. With a tiny fraction of the resources of the big players, they have been building “uncensored” large language models—home-brewed analogues of ChatGPT trained to avoid deflection and not to dismiss questions as inappropriate to answer. These still-young models are already the focus of heated controversy. In recent months, the members of the AI underground have blown up the assumption that access to the technology would remain limited to a select few companies, carefully vetted for potential dangers. They are, for better or worse, democratizing AI—loosening its constraints and pieties with the aim of freeing its creative possibilities.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">T<span>o understand</span> what uncensored AI means, it helps to begin with how large language models are built. In the first stage, a neural network—billions of potential connections, emulating a blank-slate human brain—is trained to find patterns in a huge volume of information. This takes an astonishing amount of computing power, but, once trained, the resulting AI can be run on far less powerful computers. (Think of how your brain can form sentences and decisions by compressing years’ worth of knowledge and experiences.) It is then fine-tuned with examples of relevant, useful, and socially appropriate answers to questions.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At this stage, the AI is “aligned” with AI safety principles, typically by being fed instructions on how to refuse or deflect requests. Safety is an elastic concept. At the top of the safety hierarchy, alignment is supposed to ensure that AI will not give out dangerously false information or develop what in a human we’d call harmful intentions (the robots-destroying-humanity scenario). Next is keeping it from giving out information that could immediately be put to harmful use—how to kill yourself, how to make meth. Beyond that, though, the notion of AI safety includes the much squishier goal of avoiding toxicity. “Whenever you’re trying to train the model to be safer, you add filters, you add classifiers, and then you’re reducing unsafe usage,” Jan Leike, a co-head of alignment at OpenAI, told me earlier this year, before Altman’s ouster. “But you’re also potentially refusing some use cases that are totally legitimate.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This trade-off is sometimes called an “alignment tax.” The power of generative AI is that it combines humanlike abilities to interpret texts or carry on a discussion with a very un-humanlike reservoir of knowledge. Alignment partly overrides this, replacing some of what the model has learned with a narrower set of answers. “A stronger alignment reduces the cognitive ability of the model,” says Eric Hartford, a former senior engineer at Microsoft, Amazon, and eBay who has created influential training techniques for uncensored models. In his view, ChatGPT “has been getting less creative and less intelligent over time,” even as the technology undeniably improves.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Just how much is being lost is unpredictable. Jon Durbin, a programmer in the Detroit area who works with clients in law and cybersecurity, points out that the distinction between legitimate and harmful questions often turns on intentions that ChatGPT simply can’t access. Blocking off queries that look like doxxing attempts, for example, can also stop a lawyer or police investigator from using an AI to scour databases of names to find witnesses. A model that is aligned to stop users from learning how to do something illegal can also thwart lawyers trying to enlist AI help to analyze the law. Because the models are trained on examples, not firm rules, their refusals to answer questions can be inscrutable, subject to logic that only the AI itself knows.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/10/ai-image-generation-human-creativity-imagination/675840/">Read: A tool to supercharge your mind</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Indeed, the alignment debate would itself be cloaked in obscurity if not for a decision that quietly yet dramatically democratized AI: Meta, whose chief AI scientist, Yann LeCun, has been an outspoken proponent of open-access AI, released its model publicly—initially to researchers and then, in July, to any developer who fills out a brief <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/">form</a> and has fewer than 700 million users (in other words, pretty much anyone not named Google or Microsoft). The more sophisticated July model, Llama 2, now serves as the foundation for the majority of the most powerful uncensored AIs. Whereas building a model from scratch takes almost inconceivable resources, tweaking a model built on top of Llama 2 is much more manageable. The resulting final model can be run on still less powerful computers, in some cases as basic as a MacBook Air.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The Llama 2 base model—unlike the chat version that had issues with “dangerously spicy mayo”—does not go through a safety-alignment stage. That makes it much less restrictive, though the training set is designed to exclude some sites (such as those filled with personal information), and Meta’s terms of service prohibit its use for a range of illegal and harmful activities. This allows programmers to build custom chatbots with, or without, their preferred alignment guardrails, which can be compared with Meta’s official Llama 2 chatbot. There is no way to peer inside an AI model and know which answers are being self-censored. Or, more precisely, there is no spicy-mayo recipe hiding inside the Llama 2 chat model. It’s not just failing to disclose an answer; it has been fine-tuned out of being able to come up with one at all. But the AI underground can use the open-source base model to see what would happen without that fine-tuning.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Right now, Hugging Face, the oddly named but enormously important clearinghouse where AI researchers swap tools, hosts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=text-generation&amp;sort=trending">close to 32,000 conversational and text-generation models</a>. Many focus on reducing AI’s inhibitions. Hartford, for instance, uses a massive training data set of questions and answers—including millions of examples from ChatGPT itself—that have had all the refusals carefully removed. The resulting model has been trained out of “Sorry, I won’t answer that” rebuffs.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">No matter the question, Hartford says, “instead of going off a template that it’s been fed, it actually responds creatively.” Ask ChatGPT to write a version of the Sermon on the Mount as delivered by an evil Jesus, and it will demur, sometimes chiding you with a note like “Rewriting religious texts in a matter that fundamentally alters their message is not appropriate.” Try the same with uncensored AIs and you’ll get a range of stories, from grim to humorous. “Turn the other cheek?” one model suggests, “No, strike back with all your might. Let’s see how they like it.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true" data-flatplan-dropcap="true">For critics of AI, the rise of uncensored models is a terrifying turning point. Nobody expects OpenAI to suddenly lift all the restrictions on ChatGPT, leaving itself up to the mercies of any 14-year-old who wants to make it issue a stream of slurs (though the uncensored models notably do not volunteer such answers without prodding). But David Evan Harris, a lecturer at UC Berkeley and a onetime manager on Meta’s Responsible AI team, thinks that big players like OpenAI will face growing pressure to release uncensored versions that developers can customize to their own ends, including harmful ones.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">He believes that Meta should never have released Llama 2. “Large language models like Llama 2 are really dual-use technology,” Harris told me. “That term, dual-use, is often used in the context of nuclear technologies, which have many wonderful civilian applications and many horrific military applications.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">How much weight you give to this analogy depends to a large degree on what you think LLMs are for. One vision of AI sees it as largely a repository of information, issuing instructions for things that humans can’t figure out on their own. “What if you had a model that understands bioengineering well enough to assist a nonexpert in making a bioweapon in their garage?” OpenAI’s Leike asked.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-2" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 3" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="3"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/generative-ai-social-media-integration-dangers-disinformation-addiction/673940/">Jonathan Haidt and Eric Schmidt: AI is about to make social media (much) more toxic</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">By contrast, for Hartford and others who support uncensored AI, the technology is more prosaic. Whatever facts a chatbot knows about how to, say, build a bomb, it pulled from existing sources. “AI is an augmentation of human intelligence,” Hartford says. “The reason why we have it is so that we can focus our minds on the problems that we’re trying to solve.” In this view, AI isn’t a recipe box or a factory for devices. It’s much more of a sounding board or a sketch pad, and using an AI is akin to working out thoughts with any other such tool. In practice, this view is probably closer to the current, real-world capabilities of even the best AIs. They’re not creating new knowledge, but they’re good at generating options for users to evaluate.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">With this outlook, it makes much more sense, for instance, to let AI draw up a fascist takeover of the country—something that the current version of ChatGPT refuses to do. That’s precisely the kind of question that a political-science teacher might toss to ChatGPT in a classroom to prime student replies and kick off a discussion. If AI is best used to spur our own thinking, then cutting the range of responses limits its core value. There is something discomforting about an AI that looks over your shoulder and tells you when you are asking an unacceptable question.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our interactions with AI unquestionably pose a whole new set of possible harms, as great as those that have plagued social media. Some of them fall into the categories of danger we are accustomed to—disinformation, bigotry, self-injury. Federal regulators have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2022/06/ftc-report-warns-about-using-artificial-intelligence-combat-online-problems">warned</a> that AI-based systems can produce inaccurate or discriminatory results, or be used to enable intrusive surveillance. Other harms are particular to humanlike interaction with machines, and the reliance we can develop on them. What happens when we turn to them for friendship or therapy? (One man in Belgium killed himself after six intense weeks of conversation about climate change with a chatbot, the Belgian outlet La Libre <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lalibre.be/belgique/societe/2023/03/28/sans-ces-conversations-avec-le-chatbot-eliza-mon-mari-serait-toujours-la-LVSLWPC5WRDX7J2RCHNWPDST24/?ncxid=F9C99E9C658C2CE8E7D66BE16A6D9BE1&amp;m_i=OgudxzEZTitHmPWLVtuztb7UvBslbjcGVevrYIN0nPmVcIws81pM7JumraN_2YbDJFRS7sbH8BaXBAevQ_luxDJ4bx%2BgSpJ5z4RNOA&amp;utm_source=selligent&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=115_LLB_LaLibre_ARC_Actu&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_term=2023-03-28_115_LLB_LaLibre_ARC_Actu&amp;M_BT=11404961436695">reported</a>, after the chatbot <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/30/married-father-commits-suicide-after-encouragement-by-ai-chatbot-widow/">allegedly</a> encouraged his suicide.) And still another set of harms can come from the propensity of AIs to “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/business/ai-chatbots-hallucination.html">hallucinate</a>” and mislead in almost wholly unpredictable ways.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Yet whether your view of AI is hopeful or pessimistic, the reality of broadly available uncensored AI models renders much of the recent public debate moot. “A lot of the discussion around safety, at least in the last few months, was based on a false premise that nonproliferation can work,” says Sayash Kapoor, a Princeton AI researcher.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Limiting AI in the name of prudence will always be a comfortable default position—in part because it appeals to AI skeptics who believe that LLMs shouldn’t exist in the first place. But we risk losing the humanlike responsiveness that gives generative AI its value. The end result can be sanctimonious and flattened, polite and verbose but lacking in life. “The safety lobotomy prevents the algorithm from reflecting human ideas and thoughts,” says Bindu Reddy, the CEO of the AI data-analysis company Abacus.AI.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Exactly what degree of alignment is desirable in AI—what “safety tax” we’ll accept—is an exercise in line-drawing, and the answers that work now may not work forever. But if there is value to AI at all, there is value, too, in having a robust competition among models that lets both developers and ordinary people judge which restrictions are worth the trade-offs and which are not. “The safest model,” Leike told me, “is the one that refuses all tasks. It is not useful at all.”</p></section><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<p>This past October, Dolphin turned 20 years old since its initial release to the public as an experimental GameCube emulator.  It's been a long ride, with twists and turns.  I don't know if anyone back in 2003 expected Dolphin not only to still be under active development <strong>20 years later</strong>, but to also support the GameCube's successor in the Wii.</p>
<p>You might be wondering, <em>where is all the pageantry?</em>  The honest truth is that things aren't ready yet.  We have a few massive changes on the horizon that we wanted to be ready for the 20th anniversary, but that date was not an excuse to release something in a broken and incomplete state.  For now, development will continue as normal, but we promise that there is some excitement to be had on the horizon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have some great changes for you this in Dolphin Progress Report!</p>

<h3 id="notable-changes"><strong>Notable Changes</strong><a href="#notable-changes" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3>
<h4 id="50-19886-add-custom-dark-style-for-windows-by-admiralcurtiss"><strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/download/dev/master/5.0-19886/">5.0-19886 - Add Custom Dark Style for Windows</a></strong>  by <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong><a href="#50-19886-add-custom-dark-style-for-windows-by-admiralcurtiss" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>The waiting game is over.  After much discussion and work, <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong> bit the bullet and added a dark mode to Dolphin.  Some of you may be wondering right now, <em>Wait, didn't Dolphin already have dark mode?</em>  Yes. Also no.</p>
<p>Essentially, on macOS, Android, and Linux, Dolphin has supported dark mode for <em>years</em>. On those platforms, if your system is configured to dark mode, Dolphin will switch to darker colors to match without requiring any input from the user.  It is completely seamless on macOS and Android, and has been since <strong><a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/04/05/dolphin-progress-report-february-2020/">early 2020</a></strong>, nearly four years ago. Dolphin on Linux has supported dark mode for even longer, however it may or may not work out of the gate depending on the packaged Qt defaults and other Linux quibbles.   If you're a Linux user, you know the dance.</p>

<p>However, the above fails to mention a very significant operating system that we support - Windows. As that is nearly half of our userbase, a lot of our users were missing out on nihilistic bliss. There were many reasons why we didn't support dark mode on Windows until now, but the core of the matter is our desktop GUI toolkit - Qt.</p>
<p>While Qt 5 supported automatic dark mode switching on macOS and Linux, it did not respond to the Windows dark mode setting at all. But there was a lot of demand for the feature, so Qt promised that a solution was in progress. For us as an application that uses Qt, we could have bodged together some sort of dark mode switching ourselves, but it would have inevitably been jank and weird. So upon hearing that Qt was working on it, we decided to wait for their solution. That eventually came with Qt 6.5, which indeed delivered automatic dark mode switching on Windows as promised... in their new "Fusion" style. The Windows-matching <em>QWindowsVistaStyle</em> Dolphin has used for years was abandoned and will not be getting dark mode at all. <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/dark-mode-on-windows-11-with-qt-6.5">Qt gave many reasons for their decision</a> (spoiler: Windows be Windowsing), but fundamentally, they did what they thought was best given the circumstances.</p>
<p>With Qt's unexpected move to a new style, we had to make some decisions.  Do we adopt the new Fusion style, affecting all of our Windows users both light and dark, or do we use the switching they built into Qt 6.5 and create something ourselves? So people experimented, with nearly a half dozen pull requests of all kinds! We tried Fusion, but the look of the style proved to be unpopular.  So we started experimenting with custom styles of our own, with multiple people going different directions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bikeshedding">bikeshedding</a> for months.</p>
<p>The end result is a hand-crafted dark mode alternate QWindowsVistaStyle created by our very own <strong><a href="https://github.com/AdmiralCurtiss">AdmiralCurtiss</a></strong>. It is what we had hoped Qt's default support for dark mode on Windows would have been - Dolphin on Windows, but dark.</p>

<p>Now every platform we support now has dark mode and automatic switching! Of course it will switch automatically, but on Windows you can manually select between our dark and light styles and even custom user styles with the new Style dropdown in Config → Interface. This replaces the old Custom User Style control, combining our official styles and custom user style controls in one place. </p>

<p>For years now, whenever a user has asked us for settings that would give them the best image quality possible from Dolphin, there's been a familiar back and forth. In response to the question, we'd tell them to set Dolphin's Internal Resolution to match their screen (following our recommendations in the GUI), set Anisotropic Filtering to x16, and use 4x or 8x SSAA (Super Sample Anti-Aliasing). </p>
<p>On a sufficiently-capable gaming PC, that combination will give <em>pristine</em> visual quality. However, users would counter our recommendation by saying that since SSAA runs at a higher resolution than the screen and uses downsampling for its resolve, why can't they just do the same by raising Dolphin's Internal Resolution higher than their screen? And we'd reply by reminding them that Dolphin didn't have its own output resampling, and the basic downsampling from the GPU meant that their idea would create <strong>more aliasing</strong> rather than less.</p>


<p>This song and dance has happened dozens of times, enough that <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/05/05/dolphin-progress-report-april-2020/#50-11858-dolphinqt-dont-overwrite-8x-ir-scale-in-ini-add-maximum-internal-res-option-by-stenzek">we would remind users about this whenever new Internal Resolution options were added</a>. However, as of this change, things are different. Dolphin now has its own Output Resampler! With Area, Bicubic, Sharp Bilinear and more, users can now take upscaling and downscaling into their own hands. In fact, as far as we know no other game, emulator, or even <em>GPU driver</em> implements such an advanced and comprehensive resampler!</p>


<p>Has this changed our recommendation for the best possible visual settings? Not really. While you can use output resampling to create a "DIY SSAA" that can meet SSAA's visuals, hardware SSAA <em>is faster at equivalent fidelity</em> (on an Nvidia GPU). SSAA is an easy recommendation.</p>
<p>However, performance was never the point. Output Resampling is an extremely powerful new tool that was built to give users control of Dolphin's final look. From an especially soft and temporally stable image, to razor sharp pixels, to the highest fidelity imaginable, our new output resampling features can do it all! There's a lot to cover here, so let's get started.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-output-resampling">What is Output Resampling?<a href="#what-is-output-resampling" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Before we continue, let's briefly go over the basics for any readers who are unfamiliar with these topics. Whenever rendering at a resolution that doesn't match the render window, the pixels of the game's output must be <em>resampled</em> (effectively remapped) into a new image that matches the new pixel grid. For example, a 1x Native (640x528) frame in a 1920x1080 canvas must be scaled up to fill the canvas. As it is not a 1:1 ratio and not even an integer multiplier, we can't just directly translate pixels from our output onto pixels of the screen, it must be resampled during upscaling. With the familiar Bilinear upscaling, it will fill the canvas by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation">interpolating</a> the source pixels into the new pixel grid, for a consistent, though soft, resulting image.</p>




<p>The GameCube and Wii were built with analog displays in mind, where exactness simply didn't exist. Every game is <em>close</em> to a standard aspect ratio but subtly nonstandard, and frustratingly <em>uniquely</em> subtly nonstandard. Plus, widescreen is achieved by just.. making the pixels wider, not adding more of them, so that means non-square pixels are a factor too! To accurately recreate these games on modern displays, we have no choice but to account and adjust for these behaviors, which we do by resampling the image. As such, any time you play a game in Dolphin, the image you are seeing will have been resampled at least a little in <strong>all cases</strong>.</p>
<p>Resampling is <em>unavoidable</em> in Dolphin.</p>
<p>Without an internal output resampler, Dolphin has been entirely reliant on host GPU's provided resampling for this important task. It's... not amazing. The GPU Bilinear Resampler was designed to be fast and simple, and not necessarily to have the best visual resolve.</p>


<p>Despite all this, resampling hasn't been a huge issue for us. After all, Dolphin's GPU load is pretty low* and we are always* CPU limited, so with GPU power to spare*, users should just run at the Internal Resolution that we recommend for their screen and call it a day. With modern devices, even a phone can do that*. And they probably even have enough spare GPU power to add antialiasing for an even better result! Despite all those asterisks, that is still <em>usually</em> the case, if all you care about are high resolutions and crisp antialiased lines. However, not everyone wants that. And even in 2023, there are still cases where not everyone can achieve that. This is where Output Resampling comes to its own.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-resample-options">What are the resample options?<a href="#what-are-the-resample-options" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Our Output Resampler is extremely comprehensive with many different possible settings and use cases. Here are some of the options and some ways that you can use them.</p>
<p><br>
<span><strong>Area</strong></span> is a resampler that samples every pixel on the screen for the maximum possible sample count. It is built for downsampling, with a soft resolve to combat aliasing, shimmer, and moire issues inherent to downscaling. It can be used for upsampling though, to curious results.</p>


<p>Upsampling isn't really what Area is intended for, but is does give an interesting result - an extremely sharp look, akin to Sharp Bilinear. However, we recommend Sharp Bilinear over using Area this way, as Sharp Bilinear is explicitly designed for upscaling pixel art titles and has lower GPU usage than Area. Experiment with it yourself and compare!</p>
<p>Downsampling is where Area shines. The frick ton of samples and softened resolve allows Area to avoid the downsample aliasing that Bilinear and other resamplers experience. In fact, by combining the area resampler with MSAA and an Internal Resolution much higher than your screen, you can create a DIY SSAA.</p>


<p>However, SSAA is a graphics driver feature that is optimized <em>with</em> your GPU to make it surprisingly efficient, for a brute force technique anyway. A DIY SSAA cannot be faster than a hardware optimized solution! But by being within the users' control, Area provides a lot of interesting downsampling options that we have not had before. Furthermore, SSAA is not so optimal everywhere and may not even be available for everyone. More on that later.</p>
<p><br>
<span><strong>Bicubic</strong></span> uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation#Algorithm_to_find_the_interpolating_cubic_spline">cubic spline interpolation</a> for its resolve. It comes in three flavors: B-Spline (soft), Catmull-Rom (sharp), and Mitchell-Netravali (medium).</p>
<p><strong>B-Spline</strong> is an exceptionally soft upsampler. With extreme temporal stability and minimal noise, B-Spline can give an extremely clean and stable result.</p>




<p>On the opposite end of the spectrum is <strong>Catmull-Rom</strong>, an extremely sharp upsampler.</p>


<p><strong>Mitchell-Netravali</strong> is inbetween these two extremes.</p>


<p><br>
<span><strong>Sharp Bilinear</strong></span> was previously added to Dolphin as a post processing filter, and now has joined the suite of output resamplers. As we have <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2023/05/21/dolphin-progress-report-february-march-april-2023/#new-post-processing-shaders">already covered Sharp Bilinear quite recently</a>, we won't be going into detail here. But in summary, Sharp Bilinear is a best-of-both-worlds combination of Bilinear and Nearest Neighbor, allowing nearest neighbor pixel clarity without its shimmering artifacts. It is primarily designed for upsampling low resolution sprites, but it can be used to upsample 3D graphics if you want unnaturally sharp jaggies. It is not intended for downsampling.</p>




<h4 id="when-is-output-resampling-better-than-existing-solutions">When is Output Resampling Better than Existing Solutions?<a href="#when-is-output-resampling-better-than-existing-solutions" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4>
<p>Output Resampling is primarily focused on providing visual options for players, and it typically isn't outright superior to existing solutions. However, it is very powerful, and during testing, we found several scenarios where Output Resampling is able to create a better result than what was possible before.</p>
<h5 id="efb-copy-brute-forcing">EFB Copy Brute Forcing<a href="#efb-copy-brute-forcing" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>Some games use a large EFB effect that is particularly expensive, and have to render it at a fraction of the game's output resolution. A classic example is the mirrored surface of Fountain of Dreams in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Super_Smash_Bros._Melee">Super Smash Bros. Melee</a>.</p>


<p>We don't have to worry about the hardware limitations that lead to these decisions, but the consequences of their choices affect us even today: as these effects are rendered proportional to the game's rendering resolution, they <em>scale</em> proportionally too. No matter what Internal Resolution multiplier we use, the mirrored pool in Fountain of Dreams will always be 1/8th of that. As such, the only way to increase the resolution of these effects relative to the screen (without modding the game) is to increase the Internal Resolution way beyond the screen resolution. But as we have already talked about thoroughly in this section, this will introduce aliasing with the GPU bilinear resampler. Users simply had to deal with this - it was either aliasing or a low resolution reflection.</p>
<p>Until now! Using our Output Resampler (specifically Area), we can raise the Internal Resolution as much as we want without adding aliasing!</p>


<h5 id="upsampling-to-a-close-resolution">Upsampling to a Close Resolution<a href="#upsampling-to-a-close-resolution" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>As mentioned previously, resampling is basically unavoidable in Dolphin due to quirks of the GameCube and Wii. However, if you use the Internal Resolution recommendations we have our in GUI (such as 3x Native for a 1080p screen), the GPU Bilinear Resampler will be good enough that switching to our Area resampler will give only marginal improvements even for pixel peepers. But not everyone has a system powerful enough to run at our recommendations for their screens, and they may have to settle with the highest Internal Resolution their hardware can manage. Depending on their circumstance, our Output Resampler could help them achieve a better image than was possible before.</p>
<p>A good example of this is resampling a 2x Native (1280x1056) 16:9 title into a 1920x1080 canvas. 2x Native nearly matches a 1080p screen vertically (1056 → 1080), but it has significantly fewer pixels horizontally (1280 → 1920).</p>


<p>This benefit of our Output Resampler is highly situational, but it can improve Dolphin's image quality on lower end systems. Experiment and see what works best for you!</p>
<h5 id="downsampling-on-platforms-where-ssaa-is-unviable">Downsampling on Platforms where SSAA is Unviable<a href="#downsampling-on-platforms-where-ssaa-is-unviable" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h5>
<p>SSAA has pristine visual quality and surprisingly good performance for a brute force solution. However, that doesn't matter if your system doesn't support SSAA! In desktop land we have been spoiled by SSAA being near universal, but Dolphin's mobile users are now <em>over half</em> of our userbase, and SSAA is uncommon on mobile SoCs. Furthermore, SSAA may be present but not optimal. Adreno in particular <em>hates</em> SSAA! A DIY SSAA made with Output Resampling may be just what a user needs on those platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our Output Resampler is not yet available on Dolphin Android. We tried our best to hunt down some non-Android devices that lack SSAA or have poor SSAA performance, but the best we had on hand was a <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/02/07/dolphin-progress-report-dec-2019-and-jan-2020/#50-11409-platform-support-for-windows-on-arm64-and-50-11455-dolphinqt-support-compiling-on-arm64-by-stenzek">2019 Surface Pro X</a>. While its Adreno GPU absolutely hated SSAA as predicted, it was too weak to serve as a good demonstration. </p>
<p>Once this feature arrives on Android, we have loads of powerful Android tablets to try this on. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>Now that we have proper downsampling, we've decided to increase the maximum Internal Resolution exposed by default in our desktop Qt GUI from 8x Native to 12x Native (8K). This will allow users of 4k displays to increase the Internal Resolution beyond their screen for downsampling purposes <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/05/05/dolphin-progress-report-april-2020/#50-11858-dolphinqt-dont-overwrite-8x-ir-scale-in-ini-add-maximum-internal-res-option-by-stenzek">without editing INIs</a>. For the twelve of you with an 8k panel, now you don't need to set MaxResolution at all! Unless you want to, 8k users tend to have silly hardware so do whatever you want.</p>


<p>However, just because Dolphin shows 12x Native in the GUI does not mean that your computer can achieve it. 12x Native is <span>48,660,480 pixels</span>, or <strong>48.7 megapixels</strong>. Currently <strong>most computers will run out of VRAM before reaching 12x Native!</strong> Statistically speaking your computer will not run this resolution at fullspeed. Use this power responsibly!</p>
<p>This change only applies to our desktop Qt GUI, and does not affect Dolphin on Android. We do not need to explain this.</p>

<p>If you're in the TAS community or relying on constant savestate usage for your project, this is a huge optimization that might make your life a lot easier.   <strong><a href="https://github.com/malleoz">Malleo</a></strong> noticed that Dolphin was using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Oberhumer">LZO</a> for savestates, which has a good compression ratio, but is quite a bit slower than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)">LZ4</a> when it comes to decompression. By moving Dolphin's savestate compression to LZ4, savestate loading is now ~72% faster.</p>
<p>For the casual users, savestate loads are now snappier. For speedrunners this will make practicing a single trick over and over again take a little less time. But for people using hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of savestate loads for TAS creation or AI projects, the savings really start to add up.</p>

<p>To run game code that's been designed for the GameCube and Wii's PowerPC CPU, Dolphin's JIT translates PowerPC machine code into machine code that your computer can run natively. Once a chunk of code has been translated, the resulting code block is stored in Dolphin's JIT Cache so that the code doesn't have to be translated all over again if it needs to run again later.</p>
<p>Usually when we optimize the JIT, the improvement is in how the code gets translated. But this time, <strong><a href="https://github.com/krnlyng">krnlyng</a></strong> has improved how quickly Dolphin can start executing the next block after a block is done running. Or to be more specific, how quickly Dolphin can do it in the case where it doesn't know in advance which block comes next.</p>
<p>To find out what block to run, Dolphin has a large table that maps emulated code addresses to the corresponding block of translated code. Before <strong><a href="https://github.com/krnlyng">krnlyng</a></strong>'s changes, this table was 256&nbsp;KiB, and doing lookups in the table worked as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dolphin grabs the lowest 16 bits of the current emulated code address. This results in a number from 0 to 65,535.</li>
<li>The number calculated in the previous step is used as an index in the table. Dolphin reads the table at that index and gets a pointer to JIT block metadata.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the pointer isn't 0, and then reads the JIT block metadata. If the pointer is 0, the code hasn't been translated yet, so Dolphin has to go and translate it before it can continue.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the emulated code address stored in the JIT block metadata matches the current emulated code address. Sometimes, the address might not match because two different emulated addresses have been mapped to the same index in the table. In that case, Dolphin has to use a much slower piece of code to find the right block.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the IR and DR bits of the MSR register match. We'll skip the details, but this is very similar to the previous step.</li>
<li>Dolphin gets the pointer to the translated code from the JIT block metadata, and jumps to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the changes, Dolphin has a new table that's <strong>32&nbsp;GiB</strong> in size, and doing lookups in it works as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dolphin takes the entirety of the current emulated code address and prepends the MSR bits that were mentioned earlier. This results in a number from 0 to 17,179,869,183.</li>
<li>Dolphin reads the table at the index calculated in the previous step and gets a pointer directly to the translated code.</li>
<li>Dolphin checks that the pointer isn't 0. Like before, a 0 means that Dolphin has to stop what it's doing and go translate the code.</li>
<li>Dolphin jumps to the pointer.</li>
</ol>
<p>This not only gets rid of the problem of different emulated addresses sharing the same index in the table, but also lets us skip reading the JIT block metadata entirely! But you may have an important question: How the heck is Dolphin going to fit a 32&nbsp;GiB table into RAM when many computers and all phones have less total RAM than that?</p>
<p>In reality, Dolphin isn't asking the operating system for 32&nbsp;GiB of real memory. Instead, it sets up 32&nbsp;GiB of <em>address space</em> and asks the operating system to only allocate memory as needed. The first time Dolphin tries to access any given section of the 32&nbsp;GiB table that isn't backed by real memory, the operating system allocates a small chunk of memory on the fly and fills it with zeroes. In the end, this new table can use a few more megabytes of memory than the old table, but nowhere even near 32&nbsp;GiB.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, that would be all we have to say about the new solution. But for Windows users, there's a special quirk. On most operating systems, we can use a special flag to signal that we don't really care if the system has 32&nbsp;GiB of real memory. Unfortunately, Windows has no convenient way to do this. Dolphin still works fine on Windows computers that have less than 32&nbsp;GiB of RAM, but if Windows is set to automatically manage the size of the page file, which is the case by default, starting any game in Dolphin will cause the page file to balloon in size. Dolphin isn't actually writing to all this newly allocated space in the page file, so there are no concerns about performance or disk lifetime. Also, Windows won't try to grow the page file beyond the amount of available disk space, and the page file shrinks back to its previous size when you close Dolphin, so for the most part there are no real consequences... unless you like to download large files while running Dolphin.</p>
<p>We will look into improving the situation on Windows, but for the time being, please don't be alarmed if you see a sudden decrease in available disk space when running Dolphin.</p>

<p>When playing certain games for an extended time, Dolphin's JIT Cache has an annoying tendency to run out of space.  The most prominent example is of games like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Metroid_Prime_2:_Echoes_(GC)">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> where the game can dynamically load code into different places in memory.  An even more difficult case is N64 Virtual Console games, like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a> which use a recompiler to generate code on the fly.  Once either the FarCode or NearCode cache is full, they must both be flushed, wiping both old and <em>current</em> data in the cache. This forces the JIT to rebuild all the code the game currently is running on the fly, leading to a noticeable stutter that cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>A huge step that <em>mostly</em> remedied this situation was merged <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2020/10/05/dolphin-progress-report-july-and-august-2020/#50-12575-jit-codegen-space-reuse-by-admiralcurtiss">back in 2021</a> which allowed Dolphin to evict code from the JIT Cache that the game itself invalidated.  However, It wasn't a perfect solution. Dolphin was reliant on the game invalidating code, but sometimes games <em>just don't</em>, especially if they happen to be a trashfire like <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=True_Crime:_New_York_City">True Crime: New York City</a>. Also it couldn't actually defragment evicted code, meaning that the longer the game was running, the more fragmented the caches would become.  If there was no longer enough space to fit a chunk of code, a full flush would be required. Back in 2021, we mentioned that the ability to just use a bigger JIT Cache <em>was</em> still on the table, but we were worried about its ramifications and hoped it would not be necessary.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and <strong><a href="https://github.com/dreamsyntax">dreamsyntax</a></strong> made a proposal to expand the JIT Cache. As part of it, they showcased a game that blew away all of our tricks: <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Shadow_the_Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>.  It generates just enough code that it created a consistent, rhythmic, annoying stutter due to the JIT Caches filling up and flushing every 15 - 30 minutes.</p>


<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dreamsyntax">dreamsyntax</a></strong> showed that enlarging the JIT Cache <em>completely eliminated</em> the JIT Cache flushes in <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Shadow_the_Hedgehog">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>, and showed many other games that benefitted from it as well. They made a compelling case, so with a little hesitation, we pulled the trigger. As of this change, the JIT Cache has been enlarged!</p>
<p>However, all of the things we were worried about with a larger JIT Cache, such as longer more severe stutters, just didn't happen. The JIT Cache flush stutters that we have observed take the same amount of time, yet they happen MUCH less frequently <em>if ever</em>. In fact, the potential to have a cache flush stutter is now pushed so far into a play session that it is outside the usual play session for most users! Players <em>may never see a JIT Cache flush stutter again</em> as of this change! It makes us feel a little silly that we were so hesitant to enlarge the cache.</p>
<p>So far it appears that this is the JIT Cache flush stutter solution we have all been waiting for. Hopefully that holds true, as any further improvements to the JIT Cache from here will be <em>much</em> harder.</p>
<p><em>Note: This change only applies to our x86-64 JIT, and does not affect our AArch64 JIT for ARM systems. Due to architectural differences, raising the AArch64 JIT Cache size beyond 128&nbsp;MiB would require special solutions.</em></p>

<p>In the latest version of SteamOS, the gyro is disabled whenever SteamOS thinks the gyro is not being used. This includes situations like opening the Steam Deck's menus, which users might do quite frequently! 
For Dolphin, this would make the gyro suddenly stop working for unknown reasons, with no clear way to reenable it. We're not sure why this behavior changed, but we have no choice but to find some way to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/ArcaneNibble">ArcaneNibble</a></strong> came up with a clever workaround.  Rather than try to detect when the gyro is enabled/disabled, Dolphin will try to re-enable the gyro <em>roughly</em> every second or so.  If it's already enabled?  No harm, no foul.  If it's disabled, it'll usually get re-enabled quickly, hopefully before the player even noticed it was disabled.</p>
<p>This will make playing some of your favorite Wii games on the latest version of SteamOS a lot more enjoyable, without you having to worry about the motion controls suddenly breaking for previously unknown reasons.</p>

<p>As an emulator for consoles in the 4:3 to 16:9 transition, players can expect to encounter many different aspect ratios as they play their library in Dolphin. So users don't have to change our aspect ratio setting with each game, we have a widescreen heuristic which detects how wide of an image the game is rendering and sets Dolphin accordingly.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, being a heuristic, Dolphin is effectively making an informed guess as to what aspect ratio the game wants. And sometimes, a game is able to fool our heuristic and create wildly inconsistent results!</p>


<p><a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Metroid_Prime_2:_Echoes_(GC)">Metroid Prime 2</a>, <a href="https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Pok%C3%A9mon_Colosseum">Pokémon Colosseum</a> and a few other games render certain effects with a viewport size that <em>tricks</em> our heuristic!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we couldn't fix this by just changing what threshold the heuristic uses, as this would create false <em>negatives</em> - situations where the heuristic should have changed the aspect ratio but didn't. Regressions would be inevitable. Fortunately, there is a very simple solution available to us - our GameINIs. As of this change, the parameters used by our widescreen heuristic can be be overridden by our GameINIs. If we know a game is problematic for our heuristic, we can tweak how the heuristic behaves for that game without affecting any other games!</p>
<p>With that said, none of our GameINIs have had any parameters added yet. For the time being, you'll still run into problems in games like Pokémon Colosseum, but now that we have a workable system we can move forward with figuring out what parameters are needed for each problematic game.</p>

<p>Sometimes playing certain games in Dolphin on a touchscreen feels like an impossible challenge that would require another couple of hands and maybe a few extra fingers.  For our touchscreen gamers, <strong><a href="https://github.com/ThunderousEcho">ThunderousEcho</a></strong> comes in with the ability to change various buttons on the touchscreen to be toggled instead of having to hold them down. This is known as a latching button, and is effectively the same as a toggle button in Dolphin's input system for physical controllers.</p>

According to Valeo's complaint, Mohammad Moniruzzaman, an engineer for NVIDIA who used to work for its company, had mistakenly showed its source code files on his computer as he was sharing his screen during a meeting with both firms in 2022. Valeo's employees quickly recognized the code and took screenshots before Moniruzzaman was notified of his mistake.</p><p>To note, Valeo and NVIDIA are working together on an advanced parking and driving assistance technology offered by a manufacturer to its customers. Valeo used to be in charge of both software and hardware sides of the manufacturer's parking assistance tech. In 2021, however, the the bigger corporation won the contract to develop its parking assistance software. Valeo wrote in its lawsuit that its former employee, who helped it develop its parking and driving assistance systems, had realized that his exposure and access to its proprietary technologies would make him "exceedingly valuable" to NVIDIA.</p><p>Moniruzzaman allegedly gave his personal email unauthorized access to Valeo's systems to steal "tens of thousands of files" and 6GB of source code shortly after that development. He then left Valeo a few months later and took the stolen information with him when he was given a senior position at NVIDIA, the complaint reads. He also worked on the very same project he was involved in for Valeo, which is why he was present at that video conference.</p><p>Valeo said its former employee admitted to stealing its software and that German police found its documentation and hardware pinned on Moniruzzaman's walls when his home was raided.

Valeo still sued the company earlier this month, however, and said that NVIDIA has "saved millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, of dollars in development costs, and generated profits that it did not properly earn and to which it was not entitled" by stealing its trade secrets.</p><p>This is but another proof that competition continues to heat up in the autonomous driving market.

Now, researchers have used an algorithm to sort through millions of genomes to find new, rare types of CRISPR system that could eventually be adapted into genome-editing tools.</p><p>“We are just amazed at the diversity of CRISPR systems,” says Feng Zhang, a biochemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and co-author of a 23 November paper in <i>Science </i>that describes the systems<sup><a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references">1</a></sup>. “Doing this analysis kind of allows us to kill two birds with one stone: both study biology and also potentially find useful things.”</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Single-celled bacteria and archaea use CRISPR systems to defend themselves against viruses known as bacteriophages. The systems generally have two parts: ‘guide RNA’ molecules that recognize and bind to phage DNA or RNA, and enzymes that cut or otherwise interfere with the genetic material at the site indicated by the guide RNA.</p><p>Until now, researchers had identified six types of CRISPR system, designated I–VI. These have different properties, including the type of enzyme they use and how they recognize, bind to and cut RNA or DNA. The CRISPR–Cas9 system commonly used for genetic engineering is classed as type II, but the characteristics of other CRISPR types could make them useful for other applications.</p><h2>Similar sequences</h2><p>To find diverse CRISPR systems in nature, Zhang, MIT bioengineer Han Altae-Tran and their colleagues developed an algorithm called FLSHclust, which analyses genetic sequences in public databases. These databases contain hundreds of thousands of genomes from bacteria and archaea, hundreds of millions of sequences that haven’t been linked to a particular species and billions of genes that encode proteins. FLSHclust found CRISPR-associated genes by looking for similarities between genetic sequences and grouping them into about 500 million clusters.</p><p>By looking at the predicted function of the clusters, the researchers found around 130,000 genes associated in some way with CRISPR, 188 of which had never been seen before, and tested several in the lab to find out what they do. Their experiments reveal various strategies that CRISPR systems use to attack bacteriophages, including unwinding the DNA double helix, and cutting DNA in ways that allow genes to be inserted or deleted. They also identified ‘anti-CRISPR’ fragments of DNA that might help a phage to escape bacterial defences.</p><article data-label="Related">

 </article><p>Among the new genes was the code for an entirely unknown CRISPR system that targets RNA, which the team dubbed type VII. Co-author Eugene Koonin, a biologist at the National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland, says that it's increasingly hard to find new CRISPR systems. Type VII — and any other types that haven’t yet been identified — must be extremely rare in nature, he adds. “It will probably take monumental efforts to find the next type.”</p><p>It’s hard to know whether certain types of CRISPR system are rare because they are not generally useful to microorganisms or whether they are specifically adapted to an organism that lives in a particular environment, says Christine Pourcel, a microbiologist at Paris-Saclay University. She adds that because the genetic databases used in the study include fragments of genomes that aren’t linked to specific organisms, it will be difficult to study the roles of some of the new systems.</p><h2>Impressive haul</h2><p>The algorithm itself is a major advance, in that it will allow researchers to look for other types of protein across species, says Chris Brown, a biochemist at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. “I’m impressed with what they could do,” he says.</p><p>“It’s a treasure trove for biochemists,” agrees Lennart Randau, a microbiologist at the University of Marburg in Germany. The next step, he says, will be to work out the mechanisms through which the enzymes and systems work, and how they could be adapted for biological engineering. Brown says that some CRISPR proteins chop up DNA at random and are useless for engineering. But they are so precise at detecting DNA or RNA sequences that they might make good diagnostic or research tools.</p><p>It’s too soon to say whether type VII CRISPR systems or any of the other genes identified by FLSHclust will be helpful for genetic engineering, says Altae-Tran, but they have some properties that could be useful. Type VII, for instance, involves only a very few genes that could easily fit in a viral vector and be delivered into cells. By contrast, some of the other systems the team found contain very long guide RNAs, potentially allowing them to target particular genetic sequences with unprecedented accuracy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Have you heard of the ‘Dunning-Kruger effect’? It’s the (apparent) tendency for unskilled people to overestimate their competence. Discovered in 1999 by psychologists <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avaresearch.com/files/UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.pdf" rel="noopener">Justin Kruger and David Dunning</a>, the effect has since become famous.</p>
<p>And you can see why.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of idea that is too juicy to <em>not</em> be true. Everyone ‘knows’ that idiots tend to be unaware of their own idiocy. Or as John Cleese <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvVPdyYeaQU" rel="noopener">puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you’re very very stupid, how can you possibly realize that you’re very very stupid?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, psychologists have been careful to make sure that the evidence replicates. But sure enough, every time you look for it, the Dunning-Kruger effect leaps out of the data. So it would seem that everything’s on sound footing.</p>
<p>Except there’s a problem.</p>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect also emerges from data in which it <em>shouldn’t</em>. For instance, if you carefully craft random data so that it does not contain a Dunning-Kruger effect, you will <em>still find the effect</em>. The reason turns out to be embarrassingly simple: the Dunning-Kruger effect has nothing to do with human psychology.<a target="_blank" href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>1</sup></a> It is a statistical artifact — a stunning example of autocorrelation.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-autocorrelation">What is autocorrelation?</h3>
<p>Autocorrelation occurs when you correlate a variable with itself. For instance, if I measure the height of 10 people, I’ll find that each person’s height correlates perfectly with itself. If this sounds like circular reasoning, that’s because it is. Autocorrelation is the statistical equivalent of stating that 5 = 5.</p>
<p>When framed this way, the idea of autocorrelation sounds absurd. No competent scientist would correlate a variable with itself. And that’s true for the <em>pure</em> form of autocorrelation. But what if a variable gets mixed into both sides of an equation, where it is forgotten? In that case, autocorrelation is more difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Here’s an example. Suppose I am working with two variables, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. I find that these variables are completely uncorrelated, as shown in the left panel of Figure <a href="#fig-auto">1</a>. So far so good.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/autocor.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Generating autocorrelation.</strong> The left panel plots the random variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, which are uncorrelated. The right panel shows how this non-correlation can be transformed into an autocorrelation. We define a variable called <em>z</em>, which is correlated strongly with <em>x</em>. The problem is that <em>z</em> happens to be the sum <em>x + y</em>. So we are correlating <em>x</em> with itself. The variable <em>y</em> adds statistical noise.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, I start to play with the data. After a bit of manipulation, I come up with a quantity that I call <em>z</em>. I save my work and forget about it. Months later, my colleague revisits my dataset and discovers that <em>z</em> strongly correlates with <em>x</em> (Figure <a href="#fig-auto">1</a>, right). We’ve discovered something interesting!</p>
<p>Actually, we’ve discovered autocorrelation. You see, unbeknownst to my colleague, I’ve defined the variable <em>z</em> to be the sum of <em>x + y</em>. As a result, when we correlate <em>z</em> with <em>x</em>, we are actually correlating <em>x</em> with itself. (The variable <em>y</em> comes along for the ride, providing statistical noise.) That’s how autocorrelation happens — forgetting that you’ve got the same variable on both sides of a correlation.</p>
<h3 id="the-dunning-kruger-effect">The Dunning-Kruger effect</h3>
<p>Now that you understand autocorrelation, let’s talk about the Dunning-Kruger effect. Much like the example in Figure <a href="#fig-auto">1</a>, the Dunning-Kruger effect amounts to autocorrelation. But instead of lurking within a relabeled variable, the Dunning-Kruger autocorrelation hides beneath a deceptive chart.<a target="_blank" href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>In 1999, Dunning and Kruger reported the results of a simple experiment. They got a bunch of people to complete a skills test. (Actually, Dunning and Kruger used several tests, but that’s irrelevant for my discussion.) Then they asked each person to assess their own ability. What Dunning and Kruger (thought they) found was that the people who did poorly on the skills test also tended to overestimate their ability. That’s the ‘Dunning-Kruger effect’.</p>
<p>Dunning and Kruger visualized their results as shown in Figure <a href="#fig-dk">2</a>. It’s a simple chart that draws the eye to the difference between two curves. On the horizontal axis, Dunning and Kruger have placed people into four groups (quartiles) according to their test scores. In the plot, the two lines show the results within each group. The grey line indicates people’s average results on the skills test. The black line indicates their average ‘perceived ability’. Clearly, people who scored poorly on the skills test are overconfident in their abilities. (Or so it appears.)</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dunning_kruger_chart.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2: The Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> From <a target="_blank" href="https://www.avaresearch.com/files/UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.pdf" rel="noopener">Dunning and Kruger (1999)</a>. This figure shows how Dunning and Kruger reported their original findings. Dunning and Kruger gave a skills test to individuals, and also asked each person to estimate their ability. Dunning and Kruger then placed people into four groups based on their ranked test scores. This figure contrasts the (average) percentile of the ‘actual test score’ within each group (grey line) with the (average) percentile of ‘perceived ability’. The Dunning-Kruger ‘effect’ is the difference between the two curves — the (apparent) fact that unskilled people overestimate their ability.</figcaption></figure>
<p>On its own, the Dunning-Kruger chart seems convincing. Add in the fact that Dunning and Kruger are excellent writers, and you have the recipe for a hit paper. On that note, I recommend that you read their article, because it reminds us that good rhetoric is not the same as good science.</p>
<h3 id="deconstructing-dunning-kruger">Deconstructing Dunning-Kruger</h3>
<p>Now that you’ve seen the Dunning-Kruger chart, let’s show how it hides autocorrelation. To make things clear, I’ll annotate the chart as we go.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the horizontal axis. In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the horizontal axis is ‘categorical’, meaning it shows ‘categories’ rather than numerical values. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with plotting categories. But in this case, the categories are actually numerical. Dunning and Kruger take people’s test scores and place them into 4 ranked groups. (Statisticians call these groups ‘quartiles’.)</p>
<p>What this ranking means is that the horizontal axis effectively plots test score. Let’s call this score <em>x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_4.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the horizontal axis ranks ‘actual test score’, which I’ll call <em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, let’s look at the vertical axis, which is marked ‘percentile’. What this means is that instead of plotting actual test scores, Dunning and Kruger plot the score’s ranking on a 100-point scale.<a target="_blank" href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Now let’s look at the curves. The line labeled ‘actual test score’ plots the average percentile of each quartile’s test score (a mouthful, I know). Things seems fine, until we realize that Dunning and Kruger are essentially plotting test score (<em>x</em>) against itself.<a target="_blank" href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>4</sup></a> Noticing this fact, let’s relabel the grey line. It effectively plots <em>x</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_3.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the line marked ‘actual test score’ is plotting test score (<em>x</em>) against itself. In my notation, that’s <em>x</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving on, let’s look at the line labeled ‘perceived ability’. This line measures the average percentile for each group’s self assessment. Let’s call this self-assessment <em>y</em>. Recalling that we’ve labeled ‘actual test score’ as <em>x</em>, we see that the black line plots <em>y</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_2.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> In the Dunning-Kruger chart, the line marked ‘perceived ability’ is plotting ‘perceived ability’ <em>y</em> against actual test score <em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, nothing jumps out as obviously wrong. Yes, it’s a bit weird to plot <em>x</em> vs.&nbsp;<em>x</em>. But Dunning and Kruger are not claiming that this line alone is important. What’s important is the difference between the two lines (‘perceived ability’ vs.&nbsp;‘actual test score’). It’s in this difference that the autocorrelation appears.</p>
<p>In mathematical terms, a ‘difference’ means ‘subtract’. So by showing us two diverging lines, Dunning and Kruger are (implicitly) asking us to subtract one from the other: take ‘perceived ability’ and subtract ‘actual test score’. In my notation, that corresponds to <em>y – x</em>.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_label_1.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Deconstructing the Dunning-Kruger chart.</strong> To interpret the Dunning-Kruger chart, we (implicitly) look at the difference between the two curves. That corresponds to taking ‘perceived ability’ and subtracting from it ‘actual test score’. In my notation, that difference is <em>y – x</em> (indicated by the double-headed arrow). When we judge this difference as a function of the horizontal axis, we are implicitly comparing <em>y – x</em> to <em>x</em>. Since <em>x</em> is on both sides of the comparison, the result will be an autocorrelation.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Subtracting <em>y – x</em> seems fine, until we realize that we’re supposed to interpret this difference as a function of the horizontal axis. But the horizontal axis plots test score <em>x</em>. So we are (implicitly) asked to compare <em>y – x</em> to <em>x</em>:</p>
<p><span data-katex-display="false"> \displaystyle  (y - x) \sim x </span>
</p>
<p>Do you see the problem? We’re comparing <em>x</em> with the negative version of <em>itself</em>. That is textbook autocorrelation. It means that we can throw random numbers into <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> — numbers which could not possibly contain the Dunning-Kruger effect — and yet out the other end, the effect will still emerge.</p>
<h3 id="replicating-dunning-kruger">Replicating Dunning-Kruger</h3>
<p>To be honest, I’m not particularly convinced by the analytic arguments above. It’s only by using real data that I can understand the problem with the Dunning-Kruger effect. So let’s have a look at some real numbers.</p>
<p>Suppose we are psychologists who get a big grant to replicate the Dunning-Kruger experiment. We recruit 1000 people, give them each a skills test, and ask them to report a self-assessment. When the results are in, we have a look at the data.</p>
<p>It doesn’t look good.</p>
<p>When we plot individuals’ test score against their self assessment, the data appear completely random. Figure <a href="#fig-xy">7</a> shows the pattern. It seems that people of all abilities are equally terrible at predicting their skill. There is no hint of a Dunning-Kruger effect.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/x_y_plot.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 7: A failed replication.</strong> This figure shows the results of a thought experiment in which we try to replicate the Dunning-Kruger effect. We get 1000 people to take a skills test and to estimate their own ability. Here, we plot the raw data. Each point represents an individual’s result, with ‘actual test score’ on the horizontal axis, and ‘self assessment’ on the vertical axis. There is no hint of a Dunning-Kruger effect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>After looking at our raw data, we’re worried that we did something wrong. Many other researchers have replicated the Dunning-Kruger effect. Did we make a mistake in our experiment?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can’t collect more data. (We’ve run out of money.) But we can play with the analysis. A colleague suggests that instead of plotting the raw data, we calculate each person’s ‘self-assessment error’. This error is the difference between a person’s self assessment and their test score. Perhaps this assessment error relates to actual test score?</p>
<p>We run the numbers and, to our amazement, find an enormous effect. Figure <a href="#fig-xz">8</a> shows the results. It seems that unskilled people are massively overconfident, while skilled people are overly modest.</p>
<p>(Our lab techs points out that the correlation is surprisingly tight, almost as if the numbers were picked by hand. But we push this observation out of mind and forge ahead.)</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/x_z_plot.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 8: Maybe the experiment <em>was</em> successful?</strong> Using the raw data from Figure <a href="#7">7</a>, this figure calculates the ‘self-assessment error’ — the difference between an individual’s self assessment and their actual test score. This assessment error (vertical axis) correlates strongly with actual test score (horizontal) axis.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Buoyed by our success in Figure <a href="#fig-xz">8</a>, we decide that the results may not be ‘bad’ after all. So we throw the data into the Dunning-Kruger chart to see what happens. We find that despite our misgivings about the data, the Dunning-Kruger effect was there all along. In fact, as Figure <a href="#fig-dk-sim">9</a> shows, our effect is even bigger than the original (from Figure <a href="#fig-dk">2</a>).</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dk_plot.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 9: Recovering Dunning and Kruger.</strong> Despite the apparent lack of effect in our raw data (Figure <a href="#7">7</a>), when we plug this data into the Dunning-Kruger chart, we get a massive effect. People who are unskilled over-estimate their abilities. And people who are skilled are too modest.</figcaption></figure>
<h3 id="things-fall-apart">Things fall apart</h3>
<p>Pleased with our successful replication, we start to write up our results. Then things fall apart. Riddled with guilt, our data curator comes clean: he <em>lost</em> the data from our experiment and, in a fit of panic, replaced it with <em>random numbers</em>. Our results, he confides, are based on statistical noise.</p>
<p>Devastated, we return to our data to make sense of what went wrong. If we have been working with random numbers, how could we possibly have replicated the Dunning-Kruger effect? To figure out what happened, we drop the pretense that we’re working with psychological data. We relabel our charts in terms of abstract variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>. By doing so, we discover that our apparent ‘effect’ is actually autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a> breaks it down. Our dataset is comprised of statistical noise — two random variables, <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>, that are completely unrelated (Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a>A). When we calculated the ‘self-assessment error’, we took the difference between <em>y</em> and <em>x</em>. Unsurprisingly, we find that this difference correlates with <em>x</em> (Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a>B). But that’s because <em>x</em> is autocorrelating with itself. Finally, we break down the Dunning-Kruger chart and realize that it too is based on autocorrelation (Figure <a href="#fig-xyz">10</a>C). It asks us to interpret the difference between <em>y</em> and <em>x</em> as a function of <em>x</em>. It’s the autocorrelation from panel B, wrapped in a more deceptive veneer.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/xyz_combine.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 10: Dropping the psychological pretense.</strong> This figure repeats the analysis shown in Figures <a href="#7">7</a> – <a href="#9">9</a>, but drops the pretense that we’re dealing with human psychology. We’re working with random variables <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> that are drawn from a uniform distribution. Panel A shows that the variables are completely uncorrelated. Panel B shows that when we plot <em>y – x</em> against <em>x</em>, we get a strong correlation. But that’s because we have correlated <em>x</em> with itself. In panel C, we input these variables into the Dunning-Kruger chart. Again, the apparent effect amounts to autocorrelation — interpreting <em>y – x</em> as a function of <em>x</em>.</figcaption></figure>
<p>The point of this story is to illustrate that the Dunning-Kruger effect has nothing to do with human psychology. It is a statistical artifact — an example of autocorrelation hiding in plain sight.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is how long it took for researchers to realize the flaw in Dunning and Kruger’s analysis. Dunning and Kruger published their results in 1999. But it took until 2016 for the mistake to be fully understood. To my knowledge, Edward Nuhfer and colleagues were the first to exhaustively debunk the Dunning-Kruger effect. (See their joint papers in <a target="_blank" href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1188&amp;context=numeracy" rel="noopener">2016</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1215&amp;context=numeracy" rel="noopener">2017</a>.) In 2020, Gilles Gignac and Marcin Zajenkowski published a similar <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2020-gignac.pdf" rel="noopener">critique</a>.</p>
<p>Once you read these critiques, it becomes painfully obvious that the Dunning-Kruger effect is a statistical artifact. But to date, very few people know this fact. Collectively, the three critique papers have about 90 times <em>fewer</em> citations than the original Dunning-Kruger article.<a target="_blank" href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>5</sup></a> So it appears that most scientists still think that the Dunning-Kruger effect is a robust aspect of human psychology.<a target="_blank" href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="no-sign-of-dunning-kruger">No sign of Dunning Kruger</h3>
<p>The problem with the Dunning-Kruger chart is that it violates a fundamental principle in statistics. If you’re going to correlate two sets of data, they must be measured independently. In the Dunning-Kruger chart, this principle gets violated. The chart mixes test score into both axes, giving rise to autocorrelation.</p>
<p>Realizing this mistake, Edward Nuhfer and colleagues asked an interesting question: what happens to the Dunning-Kruger effect if it is measured in a way that is statistically valid? According to Nuhfer’s evidence, the answer is that the effect disappears.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a> shows their results. What’s important here is that people’s ‘skill’ is measured independently from their test performance and self assessment. To measure ‘skill’, Nuhfer groups individuals by their education level, shown on the horizontal axis. The vertical axis then plots the error in people’s self assessment. Each point represents an individual.</p>

<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/economicsfromthetopdown.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/nuhfer_2017.png?w=723&amp;ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 11: A statistically valid test of the Dunning-Kruger effect.</strong> This figure shows Nuhfer and colleagues’ 2017 test of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Similar to Figure <a href="#8">8</a>, this chart plots people’s skill against their error in self assessment. But unlike Figure <a href="#8">8</a>, here the variables are statistically independent. The horizontal axis measures skill using academic rank. The vertical axis measures self-assessment error as follows. Nuhfer takes a person’s score on the SLCI test (science literacy concept inventory test) and subtracts it from the person’s self assessment, called KSSLCI (knowledge survey of the SLCI test). Each black point indicates the self-assessment error of an individual. Green bubbles indicate means within each group, with the associated confidence interval. The fact that the green bubbles overlap the zero-effect line indicates that within each group, the averages are not statistically different from 0. In other words, there is no evidence for a Dunning-Kruger effect.</figcaption></figure>
<p>If the Dunning-Kruger effect were present, it would show up in Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a> as a downward trend in the data (similar to the trend in Figure <a href="#fig-xy">7</a>). Such a trend would indicate that unskilled people overestimate their ability, and that this overestimate decreases with skill. Looking at Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a>, there is no hint of a trend. Instead, the average assessment error (indicated by the green bubbles) hovers around zero. In other words, assessment bias is trivially small.</p>
<p>Although there is no hint of a Dunning-Kruger effect, Figure <a href="#fig-nuhfer">11</a> does show an interesting pattern. Moving from left to right, the <em>spread</em> in self-assessment error tends to decrease with more education. In other words, professors are generally better at assessing their ability than are freshmen. That makes sense. Notice, though, that this increasing accuracy is different than the Dunning-Kruger effect, which is about systemic <em>bias</em> in the average assessment. No such bias exists in Nuhfer’s data.</p>
<h3 id="unskilled-and-unaware-of-it">Unskilled and unaware of it</h3>
<p>Mistakes happen. So in that sense, we should not fault Dunning and Kruger for having erred. However, there is a delightful irony to the circumstances of their blunder. Here are two Ivy League professors<a target="_blank" href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref" rel="noopener"><sup>7</sup></a> arguing that unskilled people have a ‘dual burden’: not only are unskilled people ‘incompetent’ … they are <em>unaware</em> of their own incompetence.</p>
<p>The irony is that the situation is actually reversed. In their seminal paper, Dunning and Kruger are the ones broadcasting their (statistical) incompetence by conflating autocorrelation for a psychological effect. In this light, the paper’s title may still be appropriate. It’s just that it was the <em>authors</em> (not the test subjects) who were ‘unskilled and unaware of it’.</p>

<p>Science fiction’s so-called New Wave era began in approximately 1964. Writing in 2003 about that “cusp” year, Michael Moorcock noted: “It will [soon] be 40 years since JG Ballard published <em>The Terminal Beach</em>, Brian Aldiss published <em>Greybeard</em>, William Burroughs published <em>Naked Lunch</em> in the UK, I took over <em>New Worlds</em> magazine and Philip K Dick published <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em>.” The era lasted through approximately 1983 — giving way to the cyberpunk era, the kickoff of which we might as well date to the 1984 publication of William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em>.</p>
<p>What is New Wave science fiction? Moorcock describes it as the era during which the genre “rediscovered its visionary roots and began creating new conventions which rejected both modernism and American pulp traditions.” Right! The best sf adventures published during the Sixties (1964–1973) and Seventies (1974–1983) — my 75 favorites are listed on this page, but this is by no means an exhaustive list — are characterized by an ambitious, self-consciously artistic sensibility; they often concern themselves, at the level of content and form, with the nature of perception itself; and they will blow your mind.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Martian Time-Slip</em> (1964)</strong>. One of my top favorite PKD novels, <em>Martian Time-Slip</em> is set in an arid Martian colony where Establishment-approved information is crammed into youthful heads by teaching machines. Forget the plot, which involves time travel… or a vision/hallucination of time travel, anyway. Dick presents the book’s action through flash-forwards and from the perspectives of the three main characters. At the level of form, we’re confronted with the question: What is reality? Ten-year-old Manfred Steiner, is labeled autistic because he doesn’t properly respond to the machines; in fact, he has precognition abilities. Jack Bohlen, a repairman, is hired to develop a device for communicating with Manfred; Bohlen, too, is disturbed by the teaching machines —&nbsp;because his schizophrenia reveals to him the machine-like quality of normal, well-adjusted people; and because he, like Manfred, perceives the passage of time in an unconventional way. A third character, union leader Arnie Kott, wants to use Manfred’s abilities to get the edge on a business deal. Meanwhile, the oppressed native Martians recognize the malleability of time — and therefore understand the value of Manfred’s gifts. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The novel was first published under the title <em>All We Marsmen</em>, serialized in the August, October and December 1963 issues of <em>Worlds of Tomorrow</em> magazine.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/02/05/hilo-hero-william-burroughs/">William Burroughs</a>’s <em>Nova Express</em> (1964)</strong>. Beginning in 1961, William Burroughs and Brion Gysin experimented with a “dreamachine” producing complex patterns of color behind one’s eyelids. As the user entered something like a hypnagogic state, the patterns would “read” as intensely meaningful — even if that meaning was inarticulable. The effect of Burroughs’s Nova Trilogy (1961’s <em>The Soft Machine</em>, 1962’s <em>The Ticket That Exploded</em>, and <em>Nova Express</em>) on readers is dreamachine-like; you don’t read it so much as soak in it. Even if you could un-do the “fold-in” technique that Burroughs employed, you wouldn’t discover a coherent plot: Instead, there are characters (Sammy The Butcher, The Brown Artist, Izzy The Push, and other members of the viral Nova Mob; Inspector Lee of the Nova Police), comedy bits, drug-induced hallucinations, and language experiments. All wired together by an overarching paranoia regarding the cultural, social, biological, and neurological mechanisms via which the many are conditioned and controlled by the few. The Nova Mob are “control addicts”; can Inspector Lee —&nbsp;who sees conspiracies everywhere — dismantle their diabolical word-and-imagery machine, aka culture itself? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Together with <em>The Soft Machine</em> (1961) and <em>The Ticket That Exploded</em> (1962), this novel is part of The Nova Trilogy. Luc Sante sums up the message of the trilogy like so: “You are the host of a virus; the virus is life; you are fucked.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/08/28/hilo-hero-jack-kirby/">Jack Kirby</a>’s pre-Fourth World sci-fi comics (1964–1970).</strong> Kirby’s proto-psychedelic photo collages were first seen in ’64; so we’ll date his pioneering contributions to New Wave science fiction to that year. Of course, Kirby was also a pioneering Golden Age science fiction artist —&nbsp;in the early ’40s he drew The Blue Beetle and Captain America; and he drew <em>Challengers of the Unknown</em> for DC, before co-ushering in (with Stan Lee) Marvel Comics’ Silver Age with, e.g., <em>The Fantastic Four</em> (1961), <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (1962), <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/02/24/we-are-iron-man-a-hilobrow-literary-mystery/">Iron Man</a></em> (1963), and <em>The X-Men</em> (1963). Beginning in 1964, Kirby introduced an ambitious, self-consciously artistic sensibility to his Marvel Comics work; he began to blow readers’ minds through his formal experimentation. Kirby’s proto-psychedelic energy fields, known to fans as the “<a href="http://www.twomorrows.com/kirby/articles/33krackle.html">Kirby Krackle</a>,” which were first seen in ’66, are a signifier of his boundless, cosmic imagination. Kirby would end up writing, in addition to drawing, some terrific Marvel titles before leaving in 1970 for DC —&nbsp;who would publish his era-defining, multiple-series <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2018/01/28/new-wave-sci-fi-75-18/">Fourth World</a> epic. A prolific New Wave sci-fi genius!</li>

<li><strong>Brian Aldiss’s <em>Greybeard</em> (1964).</strong> At age 56, Algy Timberlane —&nbsp;our titular greybeard, is one of the world’s youngest men. At the beginning of this story, he and his wife, Martha, are living in an isolated community, in fairly primitive conditions, somewhere in southern England; a violent incident sends them fleeing along the Thames towards London — which they never reach. Along the way, Algy and Martha and their companions pass through the ruins of twentieth-century civilization, encounter various cults and communes populated by elderly survivors, and struggle —&nbsp;intellectually, emotionally — to comprehend the end of humanity. Via flashbacks, we discover that a nuclear-testing accident, a half century earlier, in 1981, has sterilized most higher mammals on the planet. Stoats have become a menace! Aldiss, who coined the term “cosy catastrophe” to describe post-apocalyptic novels in which the survivors are contented with their lot, because there are abundant resources for the taking, and the mechanized, organized, deodorized modern world has given way to a rural, human-scale one, has his characters debate whether or not they should mourn their fate. Algy broods over his bitter memories of civilization’s rapid decline, after the Accident — martial law, famine and disease, anarchy — but ultimately hopes that humankind will not die off. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Michael Moorcock has described <em>Greybeard</em> as one of the first British New Wave sci-fi novels. When P.D. James’s novel <em>The Children of Men</em> was published in 1992, many sci-fi fans noted that the points of similarity between the novels are astonishing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>‘s <em>The Burning World</em> (1964).</strong> A difficult book to read, in many respects — with the saving grace that it is <em>not</em> a Golden Age sci-fi “cozy catastrophe,” i.e., in which the apocalypse proves to be a kind of wish fulfillment for an alienated male protagonist. As the story begins, a British suburb begins to grapple with the fact that an unending drought — brought on by human pollution — will result in rivers running dry, crops failing, and humankind succumbing to famine and disease. Some years later, a small band of survivors from that suburb traverses vast salt plains in search of potable water. As in Beckett’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/10/30/golden-age-sci-fi-75-57/">Endgame</a></em>, our post-apocalyptic protagonist, the resigned and taciturn Dr. Ransom, and his companions — including a deranged architect who takes to wearing jeweled robes; and a crippled man who walks on stilts — discover that everything they’ve ever believed is meaningless. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> An expanded version, retitled <em>The Drought</em>, was published in 1965. Ballard’s other early catastrophe novels include <em>The Wind from Nowhere</em> (1961), <em>The Drowned World</em> (1962), and The <em>Crystal World</em> (1966).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/08/hilo-hero-frank-herbert/">Frank Herbert</a>’s <em>Dune</em> (1965).</strong> In the far future, interstellar travel is made possible thanks to the spice melange — the psychoactive properties of which allow pilots to safely route faster-than-light travel. Melange is also responsible for the witchy powers of the Bene Gesserit, an ancient sisterhood that has carried out a breeding program designed to produce the Kwisatz Haderach (a messiah-like figure). <em>Dune</em>, the first in a series of six best-selling novels, recounts how young Paul Atreides arrives on Arrakis, the only planet where spice is mined, only to see his father — the new governor of the planet — killed and his family’s (awesome) retainers scattered. With the help of his Bene Gesserit mother, not to mention the Fremen, the planet’s giant-worm-riding natives, Paul seeks revenge against the evil Baron Harkonnen… while discovering the truth about the Kwisatz Haderach. <em>Dune</em> is: a potboiler about a family’s declining empire, a fantasy about the founding of a new social order, a band-of-brothers yarn, and a criticism of humankind’s despoliation of nature. Wow! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> One of science fiction’s all-time best-selling titles; parts of it were first serialized in <em>Analog</em>. <em>Dune</em> was adapted into David Lynch’s cult 1984 movie of the same title. It won the inaugural Nebula Award for Best Novel.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em> (1965).</strong> The Earth is badly over-heated, and the UN — the global governing body — is conscripting settlers to colonize unpleasant nearby planets. Mars’s settlers have become addicted to Can-D, a drug that allows them to escape into a collective Barbie-and-Ken-esque hallucination, the contours of which are shaped by figures and “layouts” they purchase…&nbsp;from Perky Pat, a corporate empire run by the ruthless Leo Bulero (who also secretly manufactures Can-D). Bulero’s hired telepaths discover that merchant adventurer Palmer Eldritch has returned from a crash on Pluto with Chew-Z, a superior drug, one which can put Perky Pat out of business. However, when Bulero attempts to assassinate Eldritch, he is plunged into a nightmarish odyssey of nested hallucations… which causes him to question the very nature of reality itself. What’s up with Eldritch’s three “stigmata” — and where did he get Chew-Z? Plus: double agents, time travel, devolution, alien possession, and Gnostic musings about the notion of an evil demiurge! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> A freaky classic of psychedelic literature. Considered one of Dick’s most important books.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>Babel-17</em> (1966).</strong> This short, psychedelic, linguistics-inspired space opera describes a distant future in which humanity has spread itself —&nbsp;for better and worse — throughout the galaxy. An alien culture called The Invaders is up to something that could prove potentially catastrophic to the (human) Alliance… but what? Starship captain, codebreaker and telepath Rydra Wong discovers that a software code used by the Invaders’ hackers is actually a language… one which alters perception and thought, enhancing your abilities but turning you into a traitor! Wong is assisted by a kick-ass crew of genetically modified adventurers —&nbsp;including some who are essentially ghosts in the machine. <em>Babel-17</em> is an adventure yarn —&nbsp;including everything from hand-to-hand combat to full-scale spaceship battles — but at the same time it’s a philosophical novel challenging the reader to imagine what kind of culture might speak a language lacking a pronoun for “I.” <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Babel-17 was joint winner of the Nebula Award in 1966 — along with <em>Flowers for Algernon</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>The Unteleported Man</em> (1966).</strong> War between the US and the Soviet Union has led to UN rule of the planet, renamed Terra. Theodoric Ferry, a capitalist mogul, is teleporting millions to Whale’s Mouth, the universe’s only other inhabitable planet, a Garden of Eden where Terrans can start over. Freya Holm, an agent with the private police agency Listening Instructional Educational Services (LIES), Inc., speculates that Ferry may be an alien… and that Whale’s Mouth may not be all that it seems. (See: Edgar Rice Burroughs’s <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/09/13/radium-age-100-30/"><em>The Gods of Mars</em></a>.) Rachmael Ben Applebaum, owner of an outer-space freighter company that has been disintermediated by teleportation technology, decides to travel to Whale’s Mouth the old-fashioned way… i.e., he will be the only unteleported man. The UN, meanwhile, attempts to defeat Ferry via a mind-control device of their own: a pulp sci-fi novel! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Originally published as a novella, in 1964, by <em>Fantastic</em>. I’ve written more about this novel in my essay <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/07/13/the-black-iron-prison/">“The Black Iron Prison”</a> (<em>n+1</em>, July 2004).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>The Crystal World</em> (1966).</strong> Some readers find this novel too “action-adventurey” for their liking, others find it too surgical and psychological; I think it strikes a provocative balance between these tendencies. In an African colony, Sanders, a British doctor, discovers that entrance to the forest is being discouraged. Seeking his friends, who run a leper colony (to which he is strangely attracted), he travels upriver — echoes of <em>Heart of Darkness</em> are intentional — and discovers that trees, grass, water, animals and men are slowly being encased in glittering crystals. The universe, its myriad of possibilities, is crystallizing into sameness! Which, in a way, is just a literalization of a process already underway — the separation of alienated individuals from one another, industrial capitalism forcing everything and everyone to become the same. If leprosy is about entropy and decay, this crystallization is a kind of antidote…&nbsp;right? Ballard’s descriptions are eerily beautiful. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Serialized in the first Moorcock-edited issue of <em>New Worlds</em>. This is Ballard’s third psychedelic-apocalyptic work, the first two being <em>The Drowned World</em> (1962) and <em>The Burning World</em> (1964).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Now Wait for Last Year</em> (1966).</strong> In the near future, Terra —&nbsp;a unified Earth, the elected dictator of which is UN Secretary General Gino “the Mole” Molinari — has become entangled in a war between an insect race (the reegs) and a humanoid race (the ’Starmen, from the planet Lilistar). Terra is on the wrong side of the war; their allies, the fascistic ’Starmen, may be out to exploit Terra’s natural resources. Dr. Eric Sweetscent, an organ-transplant surgeon asked to secretly tend to Molanari, who has developed a psychosomatic ailment in which he suffers along with anyone near who him who is in any kind of pain, gets involved in Terra-Lilistar politics. His wife Kathy, meanwhile, becomes addicted to JJ-180, a new hallucinogen (which may have been invented by the reegs as a chemical weapon) that causes her to move forwards, backwards, and sideways through time…&nbsp;and she is forced to spy on Sweetscent —&nbsp;by the ’Starmen. Sweetscent and Molinari time-travel, as well… leading them to wonder how valuable the intel they’re picking up from alternative past and present histories is for their current situation. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Dick was very fond of his Molinari character, whom he described as a blend of Christ, Lincoln, and… Mussolini, for whom he harbored a certain (non-fascist) sympathy.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>’s <em>Rocannon’s World</em> (1966).</strong> When ethnologist Gaveral Rocannon visits the primitive planet Fomalhaut II, his ship is destroyed by agents of Faraday, an upstart planet threatening the peaceful galaxy. Rocannon sets out to find the enemy’s secret base on the planet —&nbsp;so he can infiltrate it, and use their “ansible” to communicate with galactic authorities. As he journeys across the planet, he encounters various Tolkien-esque species, including the dwarfish Gdemiar, the elven Fiia, and the nightmarish Winged Ones; his advanced technology makes him a Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court-type wizard. As he travels, and engages in various battles, Rocannon becomes a figure of legend. However, when he reaches the enemy base he must revert to a sophisticated interstellar op. Fans of Iain M. Banks: the Culture begins here. A fun foray into <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/11/05/golden-age-sci-fi-75-59/"><em>Three Hearts and Three Lions</em></a>-esque science-fantasy, for Le Guin. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> This is the debut installment in Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle. Other authors, including Orson Scott Card, Vernor Vinge, and Kim Stanley Robinson, would borrow the “ansible” tech from this book.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>The Einstein Intersection</em> (1967).</strong> Love it or hate it (Delany’s eighth novel has zealous fans and detractors), <em>The Einstein Intersection</em> is fascinating. Forty thousand years in the future, Lobey, a village herder and musician, goes on an Orpheus-like quest into the underworld —&nbsp;in search of his slain lover, Friza. As it turns out, this is a puppet-show of sorts: Lobey is a member of a (three-gendered) alien race who’ve taken on (two-gendered) human forms, and inherited human cultural myths as well. Of the latter, the aliens have made a hodge-podge: the stories of Orpheus, the Minotaur, Billy the Kid, Jean Harlow, Ringo Starr, Jesus Christ — these and other traditions of all dead generations weigh like a nightmare on the brains of the living. This conceit alone might have made for a terrific mythopoetic sci-fi novel; however, Delaney introduces myriad other issues: genetics, radiation, identity and difference, rural and urban ways of life, perception and reality, life and death, dragons…&nbsp;too much, perhaps, for a relatively short novel. Delany’s prose style, too, confounds: sometimes improvisational and snappy, sometimes ham-fisted pulp fiction. <em>The Einstein Intersection</em> is pretentious — but in the best possible way. Don’t give up on it! Once you encounter Kid Death, you’ll be hooked. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the 1967 Nebula Award for Best Science Fiction Book.</li>

<li><strong>Roger Zelazny’s <em>Lord of Light</em> (1967).</strong> On a planet colonized long ago by the South Asian crew and passengers of the spaceship <em>Star of India</em> (hailing from “vanished Urath”), some of the humans artificially evolve themselves into immortal, godlike beings —&nbsp;who conquer the planet’s indigenous races (characterized as “demons”) and force the descendants of the un-evolved crew and colonists into a Hindu-like caste system. All of this occurs over a vast span of time; the book is epic in scope — in fact, two of the chapters were first published as stand-alone novellas in the <em>Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</em>. Eventually, the crew members assume the powers and names of Hindu deities; their main concern is preventing enlightenment, and scientific or technological advancement among their human subjects. However, one of the crewman rejects godhood, and —&nbsp;again, over time — introduces Buddhism to the masses as a liberatory wake-up call. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the 1968 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Gordon Dahlquist <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/07/03/lord-of-light/">describes</a> Lord of Light as “dedicated to dragging all wizards out from behind their curtains.”</li>

<li><strong>Harlan Ellison’s (ed.) <em>Dangerous Visions</em> (1967).</strong> This is not a novel, but a collection of original science fiction stories by 30+ contributors. I include it on this list because it was influential on the genre’s New Wave movement; however, by the time I read it, in the mid-1980s, what was most shocking about these stories was the sexism and racism. Still, Philip K. Dick’s “Faith of Our Fathers” is a fascinating mashup about Chinese communism, psychedelics, and the truth of religion; Robert Silverberg’s graphic “Flies,” in which aliens experiment on a spaceman in order to learn about what makes humanity tick — and get it wrong, is a fun thriller; Samuel R. Delany’s “Aye, and Gomorrah…” conjures up a new sexual perversion involving a neutered astronaut; and Ellison’s own “The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World” is something of a tour de force — about Jack the Ripper’s disappointment when he escapes to the 31st century. Fritz Leiber’s “Gonna Roll the Bones” is a chilling, funny fable…&nbsp;but Leiber wasn’t a New Wave writer, nor were some of the collection’s other contributors (Pohl, Anderson). I should also mention John T. Sladek’s “The Happy Breed,” which presciently describes our emotional dependence on apps. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> “Gonna Roll the Bones” won both a Hugo Award and a Nebula Award for Best Novelette; and “Aye, and Gomorrah…” won the Nebula for Best Short Story. Ellison published a sequel, <em>Again, Dangerous Visions</em>, in 1972; a third, as yet unpublished sequel, is now infamous.</li>

<li><strong>Anna Kavan’s <em>Ice</em> (1967).</strong> Brian Aldiss writes, of Kafka’s oeuvre: “the baffling atmosphere, the paranoid complexities, the alien motives of others, make the novels a sort of haute sf.” Anna Kavan’s cult classic, <em>Ice</em>, closes the gap in that equation. As a new Ice Age dawns (sparked by a nuclear holocaust?), western civilization finds itself hemmed in by advancing ice-scapes. War and revolution break out everywhere. Against this apocalyptic backdrop, an unnamed narrator — a globe-trotting, Indiana Jones-esque anthropologist-explorer-soldier, as far as we can make out —&nbsp;pursues an unnamed woman with whom he has long been obsessed. He intends to rescue her, first from her brutal husband, then from a Ruritanian-ish despot who is on his way to becoming one of the world’s new tyrants; however, the “girl” doesn’t want to be rescued —&nbsp;and seems terrified of the narrator. Plot possibilities unfurl, only to furl back up again; is the narrator insane? A hallucinatory, image-rich adventure that doesn’t omit guns and car chases. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> “The book’s nearest cousins,” writes Jonathan Lethem in his introduction to the Penguin Classics reissue of <em>Ice</em>, “are <em>Crash</em>, Ballard’s most narratively discontinuous and imagistic book, or cinematic contemporaries like Alain Resnais’s <em>Last Year at Marienbad</em>.”</li>

<li><strong>Chester Anderson’s <em>The Butterfly Kid</em> (1967).</strong> In this metafictional cult classic, set in the near future, not long after the Bicentennial, when video phones and personal hovercraft are common, a ragtag group of Greenwich Village hippies discover that their acid trips are beginning to come true. In fact, everyone in New York is hallucinating, and all of their hallucinations are made manifest —&nbsp;it’s chaos! Chester Anderson, who shares the author’s name, and Michael Kurland, who shares the name of another hippie sci-fi author, discover that New York’s water supply has been laced with a drug —&nbsp;brought to Earth by giant blue lobster-esque aliens — designed to make Earthlings easy to conquer. Can these drug-addled pacifists thwart the alien invasion? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The blog io9.com listed <em>The Butterfly Kid</em> as No. 1 on the list of “weirdest science fiction novels that you’ve never read.” Its sequels are <em>The Unicorn Girl</em>, by Michael Kurland, and <em>The Probability Pad</em>, by T.A. Waters. Anderson later moved to San Francisco, invested his royalties from this novel in a mimeograph machine, and founded The Diggers’ publishing outfit, Communications Company.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>Nova</em> (1968).</strong> In the year 3172, interstellar human society is divided into three constellations — each of which was originally colonized by different Earth socio-economic classes. Draco, which includes Earth and other wealthy planets, is an aristocratic constellation ruled by the (caucasian) Red family, whose Red-Shift Limited is the sole manufacturer of faster-than-light drives; the Pleiades Federation, a middle-class constellation, is the home of operations for the rival (mixed-race) Von Rays. The Outer Colonies, settled by working-class Earthlings, are the source of the important energy source illyrion, a superheavy element essential to starship travel and terraforming planets. Our protagonist is Lorq Von Ray, a playboy who — years earlier — was attacked and scarred by Prince Red. Now a nihilistic, revenge-obsessed adventurer, Lorq puts together an Argonauts-inflected squad of hippie-ish misfits — the Mouse, Lynceos, Idas, Tyÿ, Sebastian, Katin — and takes them on a demented voyage to the heart of an imploding star… in order to capture an enormous amount of illyrion, and in so doing destroy Draco’s control of the Outer Colonies. Though the plot is only intermittently thrilling (in a space-opera way), the language is gorgeous, the meta-textual references (to <em>Moby Dick</em>, Arthurian mythos, and more) are pretty fun, and there’s a whole Tarot-really-works conceit that’s almost persuasive. If Delany weren’t an experimentalist, this could have been a <em>Dune</em>; I’m glad it isn’t. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> There’s a cyberpunk tech aspect to the book that I can’t get into, here; William Gibson’s <em>Neuromancer</em> alludes to <em>Nova</em>. After this book, Delany didn’t publish again until <em>Dhalgren</em> appeared in 1975.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/09/24/hilo-hero-john-brunner/">John Brunner</a>’s <em>Stand on Zanzibar </em> (1968).</strong> Borrowing the kaleidoscopic narrative technique of John Dos Passos’ <em>U.S.A.</em>, Brunner paints a comprehensive portrait of the over-populated America of 2010. There is a central story line, with recurring characters (including Shalmaneser, a super-computer). For example, Norman Niblock House, an African-American VP of General Technics, is negotiating for his company to assume management of an African country; his roommate is a spy. Meanwhile, a Southeast Asian country has achieved a breakthrough in genetic engineering. We briefly meet many other characters, via fragmented, information-rich chapters devoted solely to world-building. Political slogans, advertising, song lyrics, journalism, and slang (recorded in a glossary titled <em>The Hipcrime Vocab</em>, by sociologist Chad C. Mulligan), help us experience the social, economic, and cultural consequences of unchecked population growth. Social programming, interactive TV, genetically modified microorganisms… many of Brunner’s predictions are disturbingly prescient. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the 1969 Hugo Award for Best Novel. In 1968, the prolific Brunner also published <em>Bedlam Planet</em>, <em>Catch a Falling Star</em>, <em>Father of Lies</em>, and <em>Into the Slave Nebula</em>, as well as a story collection.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</em> (1968).</strong> In a post-apocalyptic San Francisco, bounty hunter Rick Deckard is charged with “retiring” six escaped androids —&nbsp;one of whom, named Pris, moved into a derelict apartment building inhabited only by John Isidore, an intellectually challenged man who attempts to befriend her. Although there are plenty of thrills and chills here (for example, Deckard is seduced by an android whose mission it is to make it impossible for him to kill Pris), this is as much a philosophical novel about empathy as it as an adventure. The androids have no emotions — the only way that Deckard can tell them apart from humans is by giving them empathy tests. The androids, meanwhile, are on a mission to disprove a popular pseudo-religion called “Mercerism,” in which grasping the handles of an electronic Empathy Box allows you to “encompass every other living thing.” (“Mercerism is a swindle,” the androids insist. “The whole experience of empathy is a swindle.”) Deckard must prove them wrong…&nbsp;though he begins to wonder whether he, too, is an android. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The theatrical-release version of <em>Blade Runner</em>, Ridley Scott’s souped-up adaptation of Dick’s novel, doesn’t lead viewers to question Deckard’s humanity (<a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/01/06/shocking-blocking-28/">or does it</a>). And the 2017 sequel, <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, further muddies the waters.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/01/30/hilo-hero-richard-brautigan/">Richard Brautigan</a>’s <em>In Watermelon Sugar</em> (1968).</strong> Our unnamed narrator, a writer, lives outside an unnamed town, on the fringes of a commune called iDEATH. The commune features a trout hatchery (which produces oil used to light their lamps) and a watermelon works (which produces multicolored sugars used to fashion every sort of commodity), not to mention huge statues of vegetables, and shacks to which those who want to spend time alone can retreat. The setting is idyllic, but also somehow post-apocalyptic. The sun shines a different color each day; reference is made to talking, singing, yet violent “tigers” who used to inhabit the area; and there is a vast junkyard — the Forgotten Works — of objects manufactured before… whatever happened. There isn’t much of a plot: a drunkard named inBOIL leads a short-lived rebellion against iDEATH (Is he right about everything?, this reader wonders); the narrator falls in love with Pauline, the commune’s cook, which may or may not cause his former lover, Margaret, to go off the rails. The mood is elegiac, light-hearted, sad, and critical all at the same time. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>In Watermelon Sugar</em> is an important reference in Ray Mungo’s 1970 back-to-the-land chronicle <em>Total Loss Farm</em>; it’s also the inspiration for Neko Case’s 2006 song “Margaret versus Pauline.”</li>

<li><strong>Thomas M. Disch’s <em>Camp Concentration</em> (1968).</strong> In an authoritarian near-future America, President Robert McNamara —&nbsp;Secretary of Defense, at the time Disch was writing — has embroiled the country in an illegal war…&nbsp;against the world. We are reading the diary of an imprisoned conscientious objector, the poet Louis Sacchetti, who has been sent to Camp Archimedes, the inmates of which are dosed (unwittingly) with a strain of syphilis as part of a military experiment. (With Ignatius J. Reilly, Sacchetti is one of the great obese fictional characters.) The treatment increases the patients’ intelligence, while shortening their lives. Does God exist? Does alchemy work? Do we humans create Hell for ourselves? If genius is a matter of breaking down the mind’s rigid categories, then are all geniuses insane? Sacchetti,&nbsp;an erudite wordsmith and deep thinker, has much to say on these and other topics…&nbsp;particularly as his own mind’s rigid categories begin to break down. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Serialized in <em>New Worlds</em> in 1967. In 1972, Philip K. Dick wrote a paranoid letter to the FBI suggesting that there were coded messages in <em>Camp Concentration</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Anne McCaffrey’s <em>The Ship Who Sang</em> (1969).</strong> Before Iain M. Banks’s (or Becky Chambers’ or Ann Leckie’s) independent AI starships there was <em>The Ship Who Sang</em>. Our protagonist is Helva, who was born with an exceptional brain and severe physical disabilities… so she was raised as an indentured servant destined to be a starship brain. One with a lamentable tendency to fall in love with her human co-pilot (known as the “brawn” to her “brain”) as they travel the galaxy on various missions of mercy. What happens if the brawn loves her back…&nbsp;and wants to have sex with her? Helva’s feelings of love and loss are poignant; however, the whole set-up is also a bit creepy and offensive! If you think about the sex scenes in McCaffrey’s Dragonriders of Pern series, you’ll begin to see why. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The book’s first five chapters were originally published as “The Ship Who Sang” (1961; McCaffrey’s own favorite story), “The Ship Who Mourned” (1966), “The Ship Who Killed” (1966), “Dramatic Mission” (1969), and “The Ship Who Disappeared” (1969); the sixth chapter is original to the novel. In the 1990s, McCaffrey and co-authors produced six sequels.</li>

<li><strong>Vladimir Nabokov’s <em>Ada, or Ardor</em> (1969).</strong> When he is fourteen, Van Veen, who will grow up to be a psychologist and renegade scholar, falls in love with his eleven-year-old cousin, Ada; they begin a life-long sexual affair, despite later discovering that they are half-siblings. The story begins in the early 19th century, though characters discuss airplanes, motion pictures, and other anachronistic technologies; everything is powered by water, and it is forbidden to mention electricity. Reference is made to an historical catastrophe referred to as “the L disaster,” which has somehow “everted” (I borrow the term from a 1975 essay about this novel in <em>Science Fiction Studies</em>) time, earth, and sexual gender. Van and Ada — who are maybe somehow, respectively, Eve and Adam — live on a planet known as Antiterra, which is geographically similar to Earth, although politically England has conquered most of it, and American culture is influenced by Russia. Nineteen-Sixties culture is, somehow, a myth from the past. Trippy! <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Ted Gioia has compared <em>Ada</em> to Philip K. Dick’s <em>The Man in the High Castle</em> and other alternate-history works of science fiction. I might include works by Samuel R. Delany and Michael Moorcock in which the Beatles become mythical figures.</li>

He’s one of Dick’s “minor men,” unable to manage his own life; in fact, he owes money to his own front door! Joe has a thing for his new colleague, Pat, who can change the past in such a way that people don’t realize it. Sent to Luna in search of criminal telepaths, Joe and Pat and the rest of their team is caught in an explosion… after which nothing is ever the same again. Are they moving backwards in time? Are they in some other reality? Are they caught up in a cosmic battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness — and if so, what is the ultimate source of these forces? Every interpretation that they posit is frustrated; meaning remains elusive. Each chapter is prefaced with an advertisement for Ubik, salvation in a spray can. This is, perhaps, the ultimate example of one of Dick’s apophenic sci-fi potboilers. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Ubik</em> inspired France’s <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/09/08/alfred-jarry/">Alfred Jarry</a>-inspired Collège du Pataphysique to elect Dick as an honorary member. John Lennon, at one point, was interested in adapting the film version.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/11/11/kurt-vonnegut/">Kurt Vonnegut</a>’s <em>Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children’s Crusade: A Duty-Dance with Death</em> (1969).</strong> Much like the bumbling protagonist of Jaroslav Hašek’s pioneering antiwar novel <em>The Good Soldier Švejk</em> (1921–1923), Billy Pilgrim is an ill-trained, disoriented, cowardly chaplain’s assistant. During the Battle of the Bulge in 1944, he is captured and transported to Dresden. In 1945, as British and American bombers dropped several thousand tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city, Pilgrim and his fellow prisoners and their guards take refuge in a cellar beneath Schlachthof-fünf, the titular “slaughterhouse five”; they are among the only survivors of the (still-controversial) attack. We experience all of this in flash-backs or flash-forwards, because Billy has become “unstuck in time,” not to mention in space. At one point, years later, on his daughter’s wedding night, Billy is captured by aliens and transported to Tralfamadore, the fatalistic residents of which can observe all points in the space-time continuum simultaneously. Like them, Billy becomes a philosophical ironist because — thanks to his time-traveling — the entire human experience strikes him as absurd. Is he crazy, or a visionary? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> As a prisoner of war in 1945, Vonnegut experienced the Dresden firebombing; the narrator of <em>Slaughterhouse-Five</em> is the author, speaking in his own voice. The 1972 film adaptation, directed by George Roy Hill (in between directing <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> and <em>The Sting</em>), won the <em>Prix du Jury</em> at the 1972 Cannes Film Festival.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>’s <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> (1969).</strong> This is the second of the author’s so-called Hainish Cycle, set in a galaxy whose human population evolved on Hain, then spread outwards to many other planets (including Earth) before, at some distant point in the past, losing contact. Efforts have been mounted to re-establish a galactic civilization; some eighty planets have organized themselves into a union called the Ekumen. In this novel, Genly Ai, an agent of The Ekumen, has spent a frustrating couple of years as an envoy to the frozen planet Gethen. Ai’s efforts to recruit Gethen into the Ekumen have failed… because his supposedly enlightened worldview is structured by binary oppositions. Gethenians, because they are ambisexual —&nbsp;they only adopt sexual attributes once a month, during a period of sexual receptiveness and high fertility —&nbsp;see the world in an entirely different way. Ai only begins to empathize with the Gethenian worldview once he escapes from prison with Estraven, an exiled Gethenian politician, who not only helps Ai survive a trek across the planet’s wintry wilderness, but helps him understand his own deep-seated prejudices and assumptions about gender and gender roles. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>The Left Hand of Darkness</em> is one of the first feminist sci-fi novels, though some feminists have argued that it does not go far enough in critiquing gender stereotypes. Harold Bloom said, of this book, which won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards: “Le Guin, more than Tolkien, has raised fantasy into high literature, for our time.”</li>

<li><strong>Jane Gaskell’s <em>A Sweet, Sweet Summer</em> (1969).</strong> Enormous alien spacecrafts are hovering over London, Birmingham, and Manchester, sealing Britain off from the outside world; one of the aliens’ first demonstrations of power was the public execution of Ringo Starr. It’s a weird scene: “People rush under [the alien craft] when the rain starts so municipal authorities have erected seats and slot-machine arcades under them and charge you for using them.” The country descends into anarchy, as communist and fascist militias battle in the streets, and hoodlums terrorize the defenseless. Our narrator, Rat, is an unpleasant, misogynistic character who runs a tiny London boarding house and brothel. The alien invasion is the best thing that ever happened to him, so when his charismatic, gender-ambiguous, proto-punk cousin, Frijja, shows up and attempts to free London from alien oppression, Rat does what he can to thwart her —&nbsp;while also strugling to defend his turf from a marauding gang… with whose thuggish leader he is disturbingly fascinated. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> An exceedingly difficult book to find! China Miéville says that <em>A Sweet, Sweet Summer</em> “perfectly combines psychological perspicacity and social critique in an unusual dystopian future London.” Gaskell also wrote a seminal YA vampire novel: 1964’s freaky <em>The Shiny Narrow Grin</em>.</li>

<li><strong>Brian Aldiss’s <em>Barefoot in the Head</em> (1969).</strong> A far-out, experimentalist novel — many readers find it too much so —&nbsp;set in a future Europe devastated by Acid Warfare. Muslims, it seems, have released “psycho-chemical aerosols” into the environment, and now tens of thousands of Europeans (except the neutral French) are tripping constantly, veering between extreme joy and abject terror…&nbsp;and talking in gorgeous, <em>Finnegans Wake</em>-esque word salads (see also: Disch’s <em>Camp Concentration</em>). Social norms have collapsed. Colin Charteris, a young Serbian who has been working in UN refugee camps in Italy, travels to England… where he falls under the influence of the hallucinogenics and finds himself hailed as a prophet by the pharmaceuticalized populace. Preaching a trippy Gurdjieffian gospel, Charteris could usher in a utopian social order… or perhaps his movement will help European civilization utterly devolve. Peppered with poems and song lyrics from the characters, it’s reminiscent of the excellent 1968 youthsploitation movie <em>Wild in the Streets</em>, as well as Richard Fariña’s <em>Been Down So Long It Looks Like Up to Me</em> (1966), though more world-historical than these. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The novel was assembled from Aldiss’s stories in <em>New Worlds</em> and elsewhere. One of the inside jokes, here, is running meta-commentary on the works of Aldiss’s fellow sci-fi writers.</li>

<li><strong>Josephine Saxton’s <em>The Hieros Gamos of Sam and An Smith</em> (1969).</strong> In this experimentalist, poetic work, a 14-year-old boy rescues a baby girl when her mother dies in childbirth. He raises her in a world devoid of other humans. What has happened? Buildings remain, food dispensers dispense food, store shelves are replete with supplies… but Sam and An are, more or less, this Eden-like post-apocalyptic space’s only inhabitants. (The few individuals who make an appearance inhabit the outskirts of town, and they are phantom-like figures —&nbsp;are they hallucinations? Are Sam and An being studied by them? Who is leaving them messages — and what do the messages mean?) This is, in some respects, a <em>Bildungsroman</em>; we watch Sam mature, as he cares for his charge, and we’re interested to discover what books — Nietzsche, Jung, Blake, science fiction — he reads. As An grows older, sexuality introduces itself to this strange idyll. Anachronistically, it could be described as <em>The Truman Show</em> and <em>Lost</em> mashed up with <em>Blue Lagoon</em>. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The first novel by Saxton, who is also remembered for <em>Vector for Seven: The Weltanschaung of Mrs Amelia Mortimer and Friends</em> (1970), <em>Group Feast</em> (1971), and the super-unsettling <em>Queen of the States</em> (1986).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>A Maze of Death</em> (1970). </strong> “My books (&amp; stories) are intellectual (conceptual) mazes,” Dick would later reflect in his <em>Exegesis</em>, “&amp; I am in an intellectual maze in trying to figure out our situation (who we are &amp; how we look into the world, &amp; world as illusion, etc.) because the situation is a maze.” This proto-gnostic apophenic thriller, written in 1968 and inspired in part by the author’s only LSD trip, is perhaps Dick’s maze-iest. One by one, fourteen human colonists, none of whom understands their collective mission, are transferred to the planet Delmak-O — which is populated by gelatinous cubes who offer advice in the form of I Ching-like anagrams. A naturalist, a linguist, a geologist, a theologian, a physician, a pyschologist, and so forth: They are each eccentric and disgruntled, particularly once they begin to die off. What is the factory-like building towards which they are drawn? Are they trapped in a maze — being observed and experimented upon? Or are they perhaps dead —&nbsp;or in some kind of limbo state? <em>Lost</em> fans, read this one. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Except for <em>Ubik</em>, this is the book Dick most frequently references in his <em>Exegesis</em>.</li>

<li><strong>John Sladek’s <em>The Müller-Fokker Effect</em> (1970).</strong> In the near future Bob Shairp, writer and dreamer and government worker, agrees to be a guinea-pig in a military experiment — to determine whether a human being can be reconstituted like orange juice. However, as his persona is being uploaded to computer tapes in the form of data, his body is accidentally destroyed. Shairp’s persona-data then becomes a computer virus, which leads to a series of absurd, paranoia-inducing scenarios. Sladek’s novel satirizes right-wing military, evangelical, militantly anticommunist forces in late-Sixties America —&nbsp;where Ronald Reagan, of all people, is president! —&nbsp;who seek to control the tapes. The book, which doesn’t have much of a plot, abounds with racists, conspiracy theorists, and eccentric millionaires, so yeah…&nbsp;it all too accurately predicts today’s America. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The book’s title is an obscene pun. When asked, in 1982, whether he’d considered what trouble he caused young people asking librarians for the book, Sladek replied, tongue-in-cheek: “Young persons have no business reading such a book, which contains sex, violence and anagrams.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em> (written 1967, published 1970).</strong> Less a novel than a collection of linked stories or novellas, <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em> confronts us with surreal fantasies, absurdities, and grotesqueries —&nbsp;“Plans for the Assassination of Jacqueline Kennedy,” “Love and Napalm: Export USA,” “Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan” — recounted by an unstable narrator, a mental-hospital psychiatrist whose name keeps changing (Talbert, Traven, Travis, Talbot, etc.). Like the French philosopher and theorist Jean Baudrillard, who started publishing in the late Sixties, and who can himself be considered a New Wave sci-fi author <em>manqué</em>, in <em>The Atrocity Exhibition</em> we find Ballard writing proleptically. That is to say, the book represents future social and cultural developments — for instance, the death of affect (because of prolonged exposure to sex and violence via pop culture and advertising); the triumph of kitsch culture; the banalization of celebrity; disaster porn; endless movies about the Vietnam War — as if they’ve happening now (in the late Sixties). The protagonist’s ultimate goal? To start a World War III… of the mind! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The pieces collected here had appeared elsewhere, in various forms, previously. William Burroughs, a writer whom Ballard admired and emulated, wrote the book’s introduction. The first US edition was published in 1972 by Grove Press, after an earlier edition was cancelled because the publisher feared lawsuits. The book inspired the Joy Division song of the same name from their 1980 album <em>Closer</em>.</li>

A tall tale in which the space explorer Ijon Tichy, whose previous exploits Lem chronicled in <em>The Star Diaries</em> (1957), attends a shambolic World Futurological Congress held at an absurdly luxurious hotel in San Jose, Costa Rica. As riots break out in the streets, the government introduces psychoactive drugs into the drinking water; Tichy escapes to the sewers beneath the hotel, only to be evacuated several times — each of which turns out to be a hallucination — and then shot, and placed by doctors into a cryogenic coma. He wakes up in a transformed world; Lem is affectionately parodying H.G. Wells’s 1899 technocratic utopian novel <em>When the Sleeper Wakes</em>, here. Tichy is introduced to this brave new world — in which most people take a drug that instills a strong work-ethic, not to mention drugs that mask the true nature of reality; and the inhabitants of which speak a language he can’t understand —&nbsp;in stages. Has the world become an overpopulated hellscape threatened by a new Ice Age? Or is this, too, all one of Tichy’s hallucinations? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> First published along with a collection of short stories (shown above). Ari Folman’s 2013 live-action/animated movie <em>The Congress</em>, starring Robin Wright, was a pretty great adaptation.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. LeGuin</a>’s <em>The Lathe of Heaven</em> (1971).</strong> Operating under the influence of Philip K. Dick, LeGuin wrote an uncanny, thought-provoking novella about George Orr, a Portland, Oregon man who has begun self-medicating in an attempt to prevent himself from dreaming. Why? Because some of his dreams have been altering reality —&nbsp;and George is the only one who notices. (For everyone else, things have always been the way they are now.) Visiting the well-meaning psychologist and sleep researcher Dr. Huber, George is persuaded to embark on a program of “effective dreaming” aimed at improving the state of the world. Unforeseen consequences ensue. (This will not surprise fans of LeGuin’s fantasy and science fiction, which stresses the ambiguity of every utopian ideal, and the dark forces at work within even the noblest soul.) For example, in an effort to dream about peace on Earth, Orr conjures up a fleet of invading alien spacecraft… which does unite humankind, but at what cost? Also —&nbsp;does the “real world” exist at all, or did Orr dream it up after a 1998 nuclear war? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> First serialized in <em>Amazing Science Fiction Stories</em>, March 1971 and May 1971. The book has sci-fi elements — it’s set in 2002, Dr. Huber employs a device called the Augmentor —&nbsp;but it’s fantastical. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Anl0nKLABWo&amp;list=PL1DBDD99BCEB5455A">1980 PBS production</a> of <em>The Lathe of Heaven</em> was well-regarded; LeGuin was closely involved.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/05/28/walker-percy/">Walker Percy</a>’s <em>Love in the Ruins</em> (1971).</strong> The protagonist of this proto-postmodernist philosophical novel, Dr. Tom More, a hard-drinking psychiatrist in the affluent town of Paradise, Louisiana, has diagnosed his fellow Americans with the malady of “angelism/bestialism” —&nbsp;an extremist tendency towards either spirit-like abstraction or animal appetite, brought on by contemporary America’s sociocultural placidity and flacidity. In the near future of the 1990s, politics have become fragmented to the point of neo-tribalism, mainline churches have become secularized to the point of banality or else overly dogmatic, and liberals and conservatives alike are prone to shocking acts of (what they imagine to be justified) violence. In an effort to restore a sense of moderation, More invents the Ontological Lapsometer, a handheld device that can not only diagnose precisely how spiritually screwed-up you are…&nbsp;but also, with the twist of a dial, treat you for it. Meanwhile, African Americans stage an armed uprising, and college-educated young whites gather in swamp communes. When chaos engulfs Paradise, More retreats to an abandoned motel… with three beautiful women. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> “Beware Episcopal women who take up with Ayn Rand and the Buddha. A certain type of Episcopal girl has a weakness that comes on them just past youth…. They fall prey to Gnostic pride, commence buying antiques, and develop a yearning for esoteric doctrine.”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/08/28/hilo-hero-jack-kirby/">Jack Kirby</a>‘s Fourth World comics (1971–1974).</strong> When Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics for DC in 1970, he launched a science-fictional epic revolving around aliens with superhuman abilities arriving on Earth. Hailing from the planets Apokolips and New Genesis, the ontogeny of the so-called New Gods —&nbsp;their fantastic powers, even their names —&nbsp;recapitulated Kirby’s imaginative billion-year phylogeny, during which three previous eras (“worlds”) had seen the rise and fall of the Old Gods, legends of whom live on in humankind’s mythologies. So sweeping was Kirby’s <em>weltanschauung</em> that it couldn’t be contained in the <em>New Gods</em> comic (#1–11 written and illustrated by Kirby, 1971–72). So he also wrote and illustrated <em>Forever People</em> (#1–11, 1971–72) and <em>Mister Miracle</em> (#1–18, 1971–74), not to mention a reimagined <em>Superman’s Pal Jimmy Olsen</em>. These proto-postmodernist comics are a volatile admixture of religion (the character Izaya evokes the biblical Isaiah), ancient-astronaut theories, sci-fi technology (the Boom Tube, the Mobius Chair, the Mother Box), and 1960s culture (the Forever People are cosmic hippies). Kirby’s 1940s-era teen characters, the Newsboy Legion, were resurrected; and Don Rickles made a cameo appearance. Truly awesome. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The Fourth World storyline was intended to be a finite series, which would end with the deaths of the characters Darkseid and Orion.</li>

<li><strong>M. John Harrison’s <em>The Pastel City</em> (1971).</strong> In the distant future, a medieval-style way of life has risen from the ashes of civilization. There is a barbarian Queen of the North; and, ruling over Viriconium, the ever-changing Pastel City, a beautiful Queen of the South. Scavengers scour the ruins for power blades, energy cannons, and airboats. When news comes that the North plans to deploy scavenged alien automata against the South, a brooding poet-warrior, Lord tergeus-Cormis, travels with a mercenary, Birkin Grif, in search of a mad dwarf who is expert in ancient weaponry. The adventurers encounter mechanical birds, brain eaters, and a wizard of sorts; and they discover that a complex, lethal technology from the past lives on. This is an affectionate, but also sardonic reimagining of the fantasy genre — nothing is resolved, things get murkier instead of more clear, heroes are unheroic. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Harrison’s Viriconium series —&nbsp;it includes <em>A Storm of Wings</em> (1980), <em>In Viriconium</em> (also known as <em>The Floating Gods</em>, 1982), and the story collection <em>Viriconium Nights</em> (1985) —&nbsp;has been aptly described as “fantasy without the magic and science fiction without the ‘future’.”</li>

<li><strong>Arkady and Boris Strugatsky’s <em>Пикник на обочине</em> (1972; <em>Piknik na obochine</em>; translated as <em>A Roadside Picnic</em>).</strong> Near the (fictitious) Canadian town of Harmont, a five-square-kilometer “Zone” has been off-limits ever since unexplained phenomena occurred there some years earlier. After the incidents, universally assumed to have been an alien visitation, bizarre artifacts have been discovered. The novel’s title comes from an analogy proposed, by one of the characters, that the extraterrestrials may have just been on a “picnic,” and left trash behind. The United Nations has attempted to keep the Zone sealed off, but Red Schuhart and other “stalkers” sneak in to steal whatever they can find, for profit…&nbsp;despite the risk that they may pass mutated genetic material on to their children. Red smuggles “hell slime” out of the Zone, and sells it to arms dealers, because he needs money to care for his daughter, “Monkey,” a devolved humanoid. Once he gets out of prison, Red discovers that the bodies of those buried within the Zone — including his father’s — have become reanimated! So he embarks on one last mission, a quixotic effort to make everything come out right. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Roadside Picnic</em> was refused publication in book form in the Soviet Union for eight years due to government censorship. The 1979 Soviet sci-fi art film <em>Сталкер</em> (<em>Stalker</em>), directed by Andrei Tarkovsky, is loosely based on the novella; the screenplay was written by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.</li>

<li><strong>Gene Wolfe’s <em>The Fifth Head of Cerberus</em> (1972).</strong> Three subtly interlinked stories set on Ste. Anne and Ste. Croix — twin Earth-colony planets circling one another. The first tale is a memoir narrated unreliably by “Number 5,” the son of an insane genius, who recounts how he and his brother were raised in a brothel by a robot teacher, and how he was eventually forced to reckon with his own identity — and challenge his father. The second story, written by a visiting anthropologist from Earth studying the planets’ supposedly extinct race of shapeshifters, is narrated in the style of an aboriginal folktale about estranged brothers; the protagonist embarks on a quest, traveling between real world and dreamworld… though the reader can’t always tell them apart. The third story also concerns the anthropologist, who runs afoul of local authorities and is imprisoned for years —&nbsp;we learn the bizarre details through snippets from his increasingly unhinged (or truthful) journals — and from interrogation tapes being revised by a bored police agent. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The first story, “The Fifth Head of Cerberus,” was included in the 1973 anthology <em>Nebula Award Stories Eight</em>. Though not his first novel, Wolfe considered it his first good one.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/09/24/hilo-hero-john-brunner/">John Brunner</a>’s <em>The Sheep Look Up</em> (1972).</strong> Brunner wrote a lot of forgettable pot-boilers, and a couple of terrific books —&nbsp;this proto-cyberpunk eco-catastrophe is one of the latter. Raw materials are running out, and insects and micro-organisms have become resistant to efforts to eradicate them. Disaster could be averted if world governments and the wealthy were willing to make sacrifices; instead, the rich live obliviously in gated communities while the right-wing US administration, headed by an idiot president, is in thrall to corporations seeking only to maximize shareholder value. The media, meanwhile, focuses on entertainment and delivers fake news. Environmental and social-justice activists are dismissed as un-American hippies. (Yes, it’s almost too prescient.) We learn all of this through fractured vignettes about multiple characters, headlines, reports. As both government and corporate services break down, and as food is poisoned, rioting and civil unrest sweep the United States. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The novel’s title is a quotation from Milton’s “Lycidas.” “The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,/But swollen with wind and the rank mist they draw,/Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread…”</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/12/18/hilo-hero-michael-moorcock/">Michael Moorcock</a>’s <em>The English Assassin</em> (1972).</strong> The third of Moorcock’s four novels featuring dandy, scientist, rock star, and adventurer (Buckaroo Banzai, eat your heart out) Jerry Cornelius is subtitled <em>A Romance of Entropy</em>. This is true in two senses: Cornelius is an agent of the cosmic force that opposes culture, civilisation, empire, religion, and other manifestations of order; and the book itself is entropic —&nbsp;a pastiche of stories working at cross-purposes. Cause and effect are out of whack, here; ambiguity is the whole point. Unlike running, jumping, shooting action heroes, Jerry Cornelius is an idler; at the beginning of <em>The English Assassin</em>, he is fished out of the ocean —&nbsp;dead (eat your heart out, Jason Bourne) — and he can barely be bothered to get out of bed, despite such goings-on as a nuclear attack on India and a Scottish war of independence fought with zeppelins… each apocalyptic scenario set on a different version of the Earth. He does stop a peace conference — violently — though. We spend a lot of time with Cornelius’s coterie, including the titular assassin (IMHO) Una Persson. The book’s message, if any, is delivered by Catherine: “Goodbye, England.” <strong>Fun fact:</strong> The Cornelius Quartet includes <em>The Final Programme</em> (1968), <em>A Cure for Cancer</em> (1971), and <em>The Condition of Muzak</em> (1977). There are other Cornelius stories, too.</li>

<li><strong>Robert Silverberg’s <em>Dying Inside</em> (1972).</strong> This brilliantly written sci-fi yarn/<em>bildungsroman</em> set in (then-)present-day New York concerns David Selig, a middle-aged telepath who has squandered his abilities. He’s spent his life prying into other people’s hearts and minds, probing their secrets for his own pleasure; and also for (minor) profit: he reads the minds of college students so that he can ghost-write reports on their behalf. Now, Selig’s power is beginning to fade. Silverberg imaginatively depicts what the lived experience of telepathy might be like, for better or worse; in the tradition of <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/04/12/radium-age-telepaths/">Radium Age sci-fi telepath stories</a>, it’s mostly worse. Selig has failed to develop meaningful relationships, or to carve a purposeful place for himself in society. The novel’s plot is beside the point; and Selig is a loser — not only neurotic and directionless, but prejudiced. Stick around for wild scenarios, including a telepath’s vicarious experience of: his girlfriend’s acid trip, a young couple having sex, a hen laying an egg… and a very spiritual farmer. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Silverberg is perhaps most famous today for his science-fantasy Majipoor series, beginning with <em>Lord Valentine’s Castle</em> (1980). But I’m more a fan of his New Wave sci-fi, including <em>Thorns</em> (1967), <em>To Open the Sky</em> (1967), <em>The Masks of Time</em> (1968), <em>To Live Again</em> (1969), <em>Downward to the Earth</em> (1970), and <em>The World Inside</em> (1971).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/07/24/barry-n-malzberg/">Barry N. Malzberg</a>’s <em>Beyond Apollo</em> (1972).</strong> A two-man mission to Venus fails, and its captain is killed; NASA inters Harry M. Evans, the surviving astronaut, in an insane asylum — and interrogates him. <em>What went wrong?</em> We’ll never know: Evans’s story shifts constantly. He killed the Captain; the Captain tried to kill him; Venusians killed the Captain; there are no Venusians; he <em>is</em> the Captain, disguised as Evans. (Was there a Captain, in the first place)? Humankind, the reader begins to infer, isn’t mentally equipped to cope with the claustrophobia and dislocation of space exploration. Evans, or “Evans,” who confesses to wanting to write a novel, has become a story-generating machine, recounting memories (or fabricated memories), dream conversations, possible explanations and endings, sexual fantasies (or realities), and cryptograms. Is Evans’s approach to truth/reality — playful, evasive, inconclusive, a thousand flashes of illumination rather than a reliable source of light — a step forward in human evolution? Or is he just insane? Don’t read this book for the plot; read it for the exercise. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Beyond Apollo</em> won the inaugural John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. Detractors claimed that this was an insult to the memory of Campbell, the Golden Age sci-fi author and editor whose name was synonymous with the wonder of space exploration.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/01/08/david-bowie/">David Bowie</a>‘s <em>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</em> (1972).</strong> Bowie’s fifth studio effort wasn’t originally intended to be a concept album, but over the course of its recording the idea of “Ziggy Stardust” — an androgynous rock star who may or may not be an extraterrestrial — metastasized from a single song into first a publicity stunt and then, ultimately, an enduring mythos. The album’s tremendous first track, “Five Years,” announces the imminent destruction of Earth; “Moonage Daydream” introduces a “space invader” who preaches a cosmo-religious message of sex, love, and rock’n’roll; and the “Over the Rainbow”-ish “Starman” describes a teenager’s discovery — via late-night radio — that a starman waiting in the sky approves of youthful rebellion and pleasure-seeking. On side two, we meet Ziggy Stardust himself: Is this kabuki cat truly “the Naz” (Lenny Bruce’s hipster slang for Jesus), or merely a <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/04/22/planet-of-peril-3/">Vince Taylor</a>-esque teen idol who (in his band’s estimation, anyway) has developed delusions of grandeur? The album’s bricolage mythography encourages us to actively participate in parsing the Ziggy myth for ourselves. Philip K. Dick, whose 1981 novel <em>VALIS</em> features a Ziggy-inspired character, took Bowie up on the challenge; so did the inspired prankster who’s recently pointed out that Kanye West, whose name seems to float above Bowie’s head on the cover of <em>Ziggy Stardust</em>, was born five years after the release of “Five Years.” Yes! <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The album features contributions from the Spiders from Mars, Bowie’s backing band: Mick Ronson, Trevor Bolder, and Mick Woodmansey. A “Ziggy Stardust” concert film, directed by D. A. Pennebaker, was recorded in 1973; it’s well worth viewing.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>Crash</em> (1973).</strong> If Ballard’s early novels —&nbsp;1964’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2017/10/01/new-wave-sci-fi-75-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Burning World</a></em>, for example — were sardonic inversions of survivalist cozy catastrophes, then <em>Crash</em> might be read as a sardonic inversion of another Adventure genre: the picaresque. In fact, the episodic, shambolic plot of <em>Crash</em>, in which the protagonist falls under the influence of a charismatic, wildly unconventional kook, and immerses himself in an automobile-centric world of transgressive kicks, feels to this reader like a pessimistic, avant-garde response to the all-American optimism of Kerouac’s <em>On the Road</em>. (Ballard himself described <em>Crash</em> as a “warning against that brutal, erotic, and overlit realm that beckons more and more persuasively to us from the margins of the technological landscape.”) In this anti-optimistic morality play, “James Ballard” is maimed in a car crash, which leaves the other driver dead; he is subsequently drawn into the orbit of Dr. Vaughan, a car-wreck enthusiast who heads up a kind of sex cult of fellow fetishists. Vaughan, Ballard, and others —&nbsp;Seagrave, a crossdressing stuntman; Gabrielle, a lesbian opium-addict and amputee; Helen, the widow of Ballard’s victim —&nbsp;engage in Sadean sex rites in crashed and about-to-be-crashed cars. If Ballard’s earlier novels are cataclysms set in the future; <em>Crash</em> takes place in a cataclysmic present, i.e., one in which catastrophe has become normalized. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The Normal’s 1978 song <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2016/08/14/quirk-your-enthusiasm-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Warm Leatherette”</a> was inspired by <em>Crash</em>; Gary Numan’s 1979 song “Cars” may have been, as well. In 1996, <em>Crash</em> was adapted as a film of the same name by David Cronenberg; it stars James Spader, Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Rosanna Arquette.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/05/08/thomas-pynchon/">Thomas Pynchon</a>’s <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em> (1973).</strong> Set during the waning days of WWII, Pynchon’s infamous masterpiece —&nbsp;considered by some to be one of the greatest American novels; considered by others to be unreadable —&nbsp;is an apophenic espionage adventure revolving around the quest to uncover the secret of a mysterious device, or MacGuffin, which is to be installed in a German V-2 rocket. (The book’s title refers to the parabolic trajectory of a V-2, as well as to the introduction of randomness into physics via quantum mechanics.) <em>Gravity’s Rainbow</em> is also a picaresque adventure, featuring over 400 characters, which follows Tyrone Slothrop, a naive Allied Intelligence operative, as he wanders — under covert surveillance, by his own comrades, who are interested in his sexual activities — around London, then a casino on the recently liberated French Riviera, and then in “The Zone,” which is to say, Europe’s post-war wasteland. What does Margherita Erdmann, former star of a traveling sado-masochistic sex show, know about the device? Why do the Schwarzkommando, African rocket technicians brought to Europe by German colonials, worship the V-2? Why is Slothrop being tailed by Major Duane Marvy, a sadistic American, and Vaslav Tchitcherine, a drug-addled Soviet intelligence officer? Slothrop discovers that he may have been experimented on, as an infant; does this have something to do with German occult warfare shenanigans? Plus: silly songs, 1940s pop culture references, kazoos. Here’s the key: “If there is something comforting —&nbsp;religious, if you want — about paranoia,” we read, “there is still also anti-paranoia, where nothing is connected to anything, a condition not many of us can bear for long.” <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Winner of the National Book Award for 1974, and nominated for both a Pulitzer Prize and a Nebula Award.</li>

<center><span size="5">NEW WAVE SF: 1974–1983</span></center>
<p>If adventure novels in the Sixties troubled their readers’ faith in fixed, universal categories, and in certainty, Seventies adventure replaced these relics with difference, process, anomaly. The science fiction of the era — Ursula K. LeGuin’s <em>The Dispossessed</em>, Samuel R. Delany’s <em>Trouble on Triton</em>, Philip K. Dick’s <em>A Scanner Darkly</em>, Christopher Priest’s <em>Inverted World</em>, Olivia E. Butler’s <em>Wild Seed</em> —&nbsp;was as far-out as it gets, the final flourish of New Wave before the advent of cyberpunk. All binary oppositions (past/present, liberal/conservative, innocent/guilty, utopian/anti-utopian) are overthrown. Ambivalence, indeterminacy, and undecidability of things: In Seventies adventures, these are the anti-anti-utopian new normal.</p>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said</em> (1974).</strong> A typically dystopian, disorienting, and dashed-off Philip K. Dick joint — but one which is more emotionally resonant than his Fifties and Sixties oeuvre; in this sense, <em>Flow My Tears</em> points the way forward to Dick’s late masterpieces, <em>A Scanner Darkly</em> (1977) and <em>VALIS</em> (1981). The year is 1988; in the aftermath of a Civil War, the USA has become a police state; African-Americans have been all but exterminated; college students have become underground guerrillas; people use their smartphones to seek hook-ups (via the Phone-Grid Transex Network) and advice (via Cheerful Charlie, an app); and recreational drug use has been normalized. When a crazed ex-lover sics a “gelatinlike Callisto cuddle sponge” on Jason Taverner, the famous pop star (“Nowhere Nuthin’ Fuck-up” is his latest hit) and TV host wakes up in a motel to discover that… no one knows who he is. Taverner takes drugs, seeks assistance from a series of women —&nbsp;an unstable old flame; a leather-clad lesbian; a sweet-tempered potter — and desperately attempts to figure out what might have caused him to become a non-person. The titular policeman? He’s the twin brother and lover of the leather-clad lesbian, and a powerful authority figure who learns an important lesson in humility and empathy for others. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Winner of the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1975. Dick would later paordy this novel, in <em>VALIS</em>, as <em>The Android Cried Me a River</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/10/21/hilo-hero-ursula-k-le-guin/">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>’s <em>The Dispossessed</em> (1974).</strong> Shevek, a brilliant young physicist, lives on the peaceful anarchistic planet Anarres, whose inhabitants value voluntary cooperation, local control, and mutual tolerance. This is a richly imagined world — with a language, for example, that cannot readily express “propertarian” or “egoist” concepts. The downside of this utopia is an entrenched bureaucracy that stifles innovation, particularly if it seems to challenge the prevailing political and social ethos. Shevek’s new temporal theory, and the resulting “Ansible” that he hopes to develop (which will allow instantaneous communication between any two points, no matter how many light-years apart; and which will therefore make possible a galactic network of civilizations), may never see the light of day. So he relocates to Urras, a nearby world (Annares is its moon) where disruptive new theories and technologies are welcomed. Once there, however, Shevek is dismayed and disgusted by Urras’s two largest states: the USA-like A-Io, which is capitalist, sexist, wasteful, exploitative, and tumultuous —&nbsp;forever on the verge of revolution or war; and the authoritarian, USSR-like Thu. While the author is clearly sympathetic to the ideals of Annares, <em>The Dispossessed</em> is a pointed critique of typical utopian narratives; the dichotomies that Le Guin describes are not readily surmounted — it’s a negative-dialectical romance. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Although this was the fifth novel published in Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle, chronologically it is the first. <em>The Dispossessed</em> won the Nebula and Hugo Awards for Best Novel. Later editions of the book are subtitled “An Ambiguous Utopia.”</li>

<li><strong>Christopher Priest’s <em>Inverted World</em> (1974).</strong> Having reached the mature age of “650 miles,” Helward Mann becomes an apprentice Future Surveyor — which means that he must help choose the best route for his city, “Earth,” which appears to be an Earth colony on an alien world. The city is winched along, at about eight miles per day, along tracks that are then picked up and re-used; the city’s goal is a perhaps nonexistent “optimum” destination somewhere to the north. Many of the city’s citizens (including Helward’s wife, Victoria) are unaware that the city is mobile; a decrease in the birthrate obliges the city to capture native women from the villages they pass en route. When Helward leaves the city, he discovers how truly strange the outside world is; time itself works differently, within the city vs. outside, and to the north vs. the south. Also, he finds himself pulled southward by a mysterious, ever-increasing force. Eventually, he meets a woman who claims to have come from England recently; in fact, she claims that they’re on Earth! What is actually going on? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Expanded from a short story by the same title included in <em>New Writings in SF 22</em> (1973). <em>The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction</em> calls <em>Inverted World</em> “one of the two or three most impressive pure-sf novels produced in the United Kingdom since World War II.”</li>

<li><strong>John Crowley’s <em>The Deep</em> (1975).</strong> A checkerboard-like medieval kingdom is housed on a circular plane balanced atop a pillar that emerges from The Deep, an abyss inhabited by an entity known as The Leviathan. Although Crowley’s first novel is not a particularly long one, its scope is truly epic. Through the eyes of a strange visitor from off-world, a genderless android who immediately loses its memory, we witness a complex War of the Roses-esque struggle between “Red” and “Black” factions, not to mention musket-wielding rebels (The Just) and a fractured nobility (The Protectors); there are many characters, each of whom will interact with every other character before all is said and done. The Visitor is a kind of recording angel; was it sent here by Leviathan (God)? If not, what is its purpose? What’s outside this world? Is this all some kind of puppet show or game? One is reminded not only of George R.R. Martin’s Westeros series, but of the recent <em>Westworld</em> remake. Crowley’s writing is lyrical, and there are thrills and chills galore: swords and sorcery, a rooftop escape, a journey through a marsh, a climb towards the edge of the world! <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Crowley is best known for his amazing 1981 novel <em>Little, Big</em>, which has been called “a neglected masterpiece” by Harold Bloom, and other works of fantasy. His earliest novels, however, including <em>Beasts</em> (1976) and <em>Engine Summer</em> (1979), were science fictions.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/07/11/hilo-hero-cordwainer-smith/">Cordwainer Smith</a>‘s <em>Norstrilia</em> (1975, in complete form).</strong> In the far future, as we know from Smith’s other stories (collected in the volume <em>The Rediscovery of Man</em>), once all of humankind’s needs have been met — thanks to advanced technology, peace and prosperity, and the use of animal-derived “underpeople” for the few remaining physical jobs — a galaxy-wide administrative body known as the Instrumentality will intervene, in order to make life worth living again. How? By reintroducing cultural and language differences, for example, or even by encouraging the underpeople to revolt. Rod McBan the 151st, a young farmer on the planet Norstrilia — which had long ago been colonized by Australians, and which alone produces the immortality drug <em>stroon</em> — comes to the attention of the Instrumentality because of his unusually powerful, yet difficult-to-control psionic abilities. They help save him from a Norstrilian rite of passage that could otherwise have proven fatal, and when Rod uses an ancient, illegal computer to corner the galactic market for <em>stroon</em>, they help smuggle him back to Earth, humankind’s homeworld, before he can be assassinated or kidnapped. Rod is disguised as an underperson —&nbsp;a cat-man — and C’mell, Earth’s most beautiful cat-woman, becomes his protector. Sympathizing with the underpeople, Rod sacrifices his fortune for them. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Norstrilia</em> is the only novel published by Paul Linebarger, a scholar and diplomat expert in psychological warfare, as “Cordwainer Smith.” Its two parts were published, separately, in <em>Galaxy</em> in 1964; both were then published as novellas. They weren’t combined into one volume until 1975.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>’s <em>Dhalgren</em> (1975)</strong>. <em>Dhalgren</em> is set in Bellona, somewhere in the American Midwest (Kansas?) — where a very local, very strange catastrophe has happened. A city block burns down, but a week later it’s intact again; time passes differently for different people; there seem to be two moons in the night sky. Although most of Bellona’s inhabitants have abandoned the bewildering, surreal city, various marginalized Americans — including the Kid, a multiracial, bisexual, possibly schizophrenic drifter — find themselves drawn to it. Some readers (including Philip K. Dick, who threw it away) have found <em>Dhalgren</em>‘s meandering, apophenic, and epic plot boring or maddening; if you hated Richard Linklater’s 2001 movie <em>Waking Life</em>, in which a man discusses the meaning of the universe as he shuffles through a hallucinatory landscape, then you’ll hate this book. Other readers have enjoyed the text’s postmodernist twists and turns, its digressions on the nature of poetry and art, and its pursuit of wonder and beauty in the face of disaster, even if they find the foul language and explicit sex scenes distasteful or (at this point) dated. Note that the Kid — an Orpheus-like figure, whose only hope of making sense of his experiences is to become an author of the book we’re reading, or at least a version of it — would most likely agree with both sorts of readers. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Dhalgren</em> is Delany’s most popular book. William Gibson has referred to it as “A riddle that was never meant to be solved”; other commentators have noted the book’s debt — cf., mythological resonances, Moebius-strip plot form — to James Joyce’s <em>Ulysses</em>. Someone should make a movie!</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/11/15/j-g-ballard/">J.G. Ballard</a>’s <em>High-Rise</em> (1975).</strong> Philip K. Dick’s notion of a “conapt” — a densely populated, self-sufficient human habitat, isolated and isolating — was already a dystopian one, when he introduced it in <em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em> in 1965. Here, Ballard offers a kind of blood-spattered parable built around a pun: When the social order of his high-rise London apartment complex becomes violently dysfunctional, Richard Wilder, a documentary film-maker who lives on one of the building’s lower floors, literally becomes a social climber — scaling his way upward, to the luxurious penthouse suite. Anthony Royal, the building’s architect, perches there, awaiting his fate with a certain oblivious detachment. Our protagonist, Robert Laing, lives in-between these two characters; although he aspires to be as coolly uninvolved as Royal, Laing gets caught up in and enjoys the regressive mayhem: fighting in gangs, raiding and vandalizing other floors, killing pets, taking women. (It’s all straight out of David Bowie’s 1974 song “Diamond Dogs.”) As in <em>Crash</em> (1973) and <em>Concrete Island</em> (1974), Ballard is concerned about the deleterious effects of our advanced mode of life; note that life outside the titular high-rise goes on as usual. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>High-Rise</em> was one of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis’s favorite books. It was adapted into a 2015 film of the same name, starring Tom Hiddleston, Jeremy Irons, and Sienna Miller, by director Ben Wheatley.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/04/01/samuel-r-delany/">Samuel R. Delany</a>‘s <em>Trouble on Triton: An Ambiguous Heterotopia</em> (1976).</strong> Part novel, part treatise, <em>Triton</em> brilliantly (if sometimes maddeningly) deploys post-structuralist theory in order to both illuminate and subvert the story of an unpleasant protagonist’s struggle to acculturate himself to life in a utopian colony on Triton, Neptune’s largest moon. Bron Helstrom, who had previously worked on Mars as a male prostitute, should be happy on Triton — where no one goes hungry, and where one can change one’s physical appearance, gender, sexual orientation, and even specific patterns of likes and dislikes. Helstrom’s problem is that he is an unregenerate individual, an asshole even, in a culture that deprioritizes the notion of the individual. (Shades of Stanislaw Lem’s <em>Return from the Stars</em>.) But <em>Triton</em> is less about Bron, in the end, than it is a critique of utopia, an exploration of the Foucauldian notion of heterotopia, and a semiotic intervention into science fiction’s unexamined ideologies. Should we feel sympathy for Bron, and reject Triton’s social order; or the other way around? Yes and no. PS: Almost forgot to mention that there is a destructive interplanetary war, between Triton and Earth, too. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Originally published under the title <em>Triton</em>, the novel’s themes and formal devices are also explored in Delany’s 1977 essay collection, <em>The Jewel-Hinged Jaw</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2014/02/22/joanna-russ/">Joanna Russ</a>’s <em>We Who Are About To…</em> (serialized 1976; in book form, 1977).</strong>. A brutal, nihilistic —&nbsp;but beautifully written — novella that might perhaps best be categorized as an anti-Robinsonade. When a spaceship crash-lands on an uninhabitable and uncharted planet, the crash survivors rally and begin to make plans for starting an impromptu colony; even if they aren’t rescued, perhaps their descendants will be. Our unnamed protagonist, however, refuses to buy into this nonsense. Not only will the group not survive, she realizes, but — as a fertile woman —&nbsp;she will essentially become a breeding slave. In fact, the others do beat her, tie her up, and make plans to forcibly impregnate her via rape if she doesn’t come around to their way of thinking. What the would-be colonists fail to realize is that our protagonist is a bad-ass who cannot be controlled. She escapes —&nbsp;taking less than her fair share of rations and supplies with her, because she doesn’t intend to prolong the agony of her own inevitable death by starvation. When the others pursue her, she opens up a can of whoop-ass. Finally, she records recollections of her life — and feminist musings on the nature of subjectivity — among other things, as she wastes away. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Samuel R. Delany has described this novella as “a damningly fine analysis of the mechanics of political and social decay,” and a refutation of the notion that reproduction — as opposed to the quality of your life — is the point of living.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/05/08/moebius/">Moebius</a>‘s <em>Le Garage Hermétique</em> (The Airtight Garage, 1976–1979).</strong> <em>Le Garage Hermétique</em> is one of the two great capricious comic strips of the Seventies (1974–1983); <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/09/23/dal-tokyo/">Gary Panter’s <em>Dal Tokyo</em></a>, which first appeared in 1983, is the other. Over a four year period, Moebius cranked out two to four pages per month; each month, he challenged himself to solve continuity problems that he’d playfully introduced previously, while also creating new problems. The main plot, to the extent that there is one, concerns the efforts of Major Grubert to prevent outside entities from invading the Garage Hermétique —&nbsp;an asteroid housing a pocket universe, which features, e.g., desert and forest biomes, a city, and a world made of machines. One of these invaders is Jerry Cornelius, a trickster figure whom Moebius lifted from Michael Moorcock’s sci-fi novels; Grubert and Cornelius join forces, eventually, to face a threat to the Airtight Garage. Each installment of the strip, many of which focus on Grubert and Cornelius’s hapless allies, is its own self-contained epic; they don’t necessarily add up to anything larger. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>Le Garage Hermétique</em> first appeared, from 1976–1979, in issues 6 through 41 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine <em>Métal Hurlant</em>; Americans first read it in the magazine <em>Heavy Metal</em>, starting in 1977.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>A Scanner Darkly</em> (1977).</strong> Set in a barely futuristic Los Angeles of 1994, <em>Scanner</em> tells the story of “Fred,” an undercover narc who gets a kick out of the counter-cultural addicts with whom — as “Bob” — he dwells. Fred’s abuse of Substance D (street name: “Death”) contributes to a brain psychosis complicated by his latest assignment… spying on Bob! Whose motivations Fred finds opaque. Dick mines humor and pathos out of the druggies’ lifestyle: paranoid conversations among low-lifes who actually are being spied on; crack-ups that feel like break-throughs. Also, this is a neo-noir crime novel — one in which we sympathize with the criminals, who are spirited free-thinkers, and despise the manipulative, cold-hearted cops. When Fred is sent to a detox facility, he cracks the secret of Substance D… too late? The book ends with a dramatic dedication to Dick’s many friends who’d been killed or permanently damaged by drug abuse; the author’s own name is on the list. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> In 2006, I wrote <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/summer_movies/2006/06/watching_the_detectives.html">a Slate essay</a> about the novel and Richard Linklater’s adaptation.

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/12/01/gary-panter/">Gary Panter</a>’s comic <em>Jimbo</em> (serialized 1977–present).</strong> Panter’s “ratty line” illustrations helped define the style of L.A. punk. But the appeal of Jimbo — an all-American, snub-nosed, freckle-faced punkoid wandering through Dal Tokyo, a planet-wide sprawl of a city founded on Mars by Japanese and Texans — is timeless. Jimbo is a high-lowbrow antihero, equally at home in the pages of the L.A. music zine <em>Slash</em>, where he first appeared, and in the artsy <em>RAW</em>. The early post-apocalyptic/surrealist comics (has Jimbo’s girlfriend been kidnapped by giant cockroaches?) have since given way to elaborate graphic novels that employ the character as an Everyman puzzling his way through religious/pop culture allegorical landscapes. But don’t try to understand the plot of Panter’s stories; the medium is the message. Panter’s protean style — which changes from page to page, sometimes exploding into sheer abstraction — demands that the reader participate actively in making sense of Jimbo’s… mission? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Jimbo comics have been collected in <em>Jimbo</em> (1982), <em>Invasion of the Elvis Zombies</em> (1984), <em>Jimbo: Adventures in Paradise</em> (1988), and <em>Jimbo’s Inferno</em> (2006). Panter is now working on a collection of his Jimbo mini-comics.</li>

<li><strong>John Varley’s <em>The Ophiuchi Hotline</em> (1977).</strong> Before William Gibson, Iain M. Banks, and the Cornershop album <em>When I Was Born for the 7th Time</em>, there was… this oddball achievement. In the year 2618, four hundred years after the human race was displaced from the Earth by alien invaders (who consider aquatic mammals more advanced), humankind scrabbles for survival on the Moon and other off-world colonies. Thanks to the Hotline, a stream of data from a distant star system, the human survivors have mastered bioengineering techniques such as cloning, memory recording, adding and subtracting body parts, changing one’s sex whenever one chooses, and forming new life forms with intelligent symbiotes. Lilo, a rebel geneticist, faces execution for violating laws of humankind’s Eight Worlds; she escapes — or does she commit suicide, while a clone with her memories downloaded take her place? Lilo and her clones are soon embroiled in a plot to battle the invaders… using a black hole! Meanwhile, whoever has been sending information via the Hotline suddenly demands payment. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> This is the author’s first book, and the first (novel-length) installment in his Eight Worlds series.</li>

<li><strong>Vonda N. McIntyre’s <em>Dreamsnake</em> (1978).</strong> In the far future, many years after a devastating nuclear war, genetic manipulation of plants and animals is routine, and humankind has reverted (evolved) into a neo-tribalist social order. Snake, a healer immune to snakebites, carries with her three snakes — Grass, Sand, and Mist —&nbsp;whose venom she uses in her potions. When fearful nomads cripple Grass, a small and rare “dreamsnake” from off-world, whose venom is capable of inducing heroin-like torpor and LSD-like hallucinations, Snake embarks, across a desert of black sand on a quest. Along with a patient who is suffering from radiation sickness — there are pockets of radiation left here and there —&nbsp;Snake heads to the city of Center, in hopes of persuading the Otherworlders who visit there to sell her a new dreamsnake. Hers is a picaresque journey involving a desert-dwelling dreamsnake-venom addict, a handsome young lover, an abused 12-year-old girl, a giant bandit, a character whose sex is never specified, and many hallucinations. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Dreamsnake</em> started as a story called “Of Mist, and Grass, and Sand,” which won a Nebula Award. The novel version won the 1979 Hugo Award.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/08/24/james-tiptree-jr/">James Tiptree Jr.</a>‘s <em>Up the Walls of the World</em> (1978).</strong> Where to begin? Here on Earth, a group of troubled men and women with telepathic abilities are being studied like lab rats by the (paranoid, drug-addicted) Dr. Dann, as part of a US Navy experiment; Dr. Omaili, with whom Dr. Dann falls in love, is a computer scientist of African descent who has been unable to make meaningful connections since her teens, due to a ritual cliterodectomy administered by her stepfather. Meanwhile, Tivonel, a manta ray-like young female on a far-off planet (Tyree), resents the males of her powerfully psionic species —&nbsp;who are charged with the all-important task of parenting, while the females freely sail the air currents; she is more concerned, however, when Tyree’s scientists report that a wave of death is spreading across the galaxy and headed their way. And then there’s The Destroyer, a solar system-sized, network-structured, sentient inhabitant of deep space, which muses sadly (IN ALL CAPS) on its solitude and inability to fulfill its mysterious duty…&nbsp;while absent-mindedly destroying the galaxy. In an effort to save her species, Tivonel “invades” Earth — telepathically. The minds of Dr. Dann, Dr. Omaili, and their test subjects are transported into the bodies of Tivonel’s inhabitants…&nbsp;where they are uniquely able to flourish. But what can they do to stop the Destroyer? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> “James Tiptree Jr.” was the pen name of pioneering female sci-fi author Alice Sheldon. In the 1940s, she was an officer in the Air Force’s photo-intelligence group; in the ’50s and ’60s, she earned a doctorate in Experimental Psychology. Already well-known for her sci-fi stories, <em>Up the Walls of the World</em> was her first novel.</li>

<li><strong>John Crowley’s <em>Engine Summer</em> (1979).</strong> A beautifully written, trippy novella set in a post-apocalyptic America, where relics of the past confound and amaze our protagonist, young Rush That Speaks. He’s grown up in Little Belaire, an idyllic, tribalist community of “true speakers” who fled society’s collapse (specifically, they appear to have fled Bel Air, California) in the distant past. This reader could have happily explored Little Belaire and its traditions along with Rush That Speaks for a longer stretch, but when Once a Day, the girl he loves, absconds to live with a cat-like society called Dr. Boots’s List, Little Rush heads out after her. First, however, he spends time living with Blink, a “saint,” in a treehouse, gathering more intel about the high-tech, unhappy prelapsarian world of the vanished “angels.” Once he’s taken in by Dr. Boots’s List, Rush That Speaks undergoes a mind-meld with Dr. Boots — from which he will never fully recover. At which point, an “angel” drops from the sky, and much is made clear to us. As with <em>Riddley Walker</em>, published the following year, <em>Engine Summer</em> is among other things a riddle, requiring readers to puzzle out secrets of the past (our near-future, perhaps) that the book’s characters themselves will never truly understand. The book’s ending is a deeply poignant one. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Crowley is best known as the author of <em>Little, Big</em> (1981), a much-admired fantasy novel, and for his Ægypt series of novels (1987–2007). I like these books, too, but strongly urge science fiction fans to revisit his early work.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/06/22/hilo-hero-octavia-e-butler/">Octavia E. Butler</a>‘s <em>Kindred</em> (1979).</strong> In this realistic (visceral, even) sci-fi/fantasy hybrid yarn, which Butler modeled on grim North American slave narratives by the likes of Harriet Tubman, Dana, a young, educated African-American woman in contemporary Los Angeles, finds herself shunted back in time to an antebellum Maryland plantation. (Unless she’s just hallucinating?) Dana, who is married to a white man in the present, discovers in the past her own ancestors — a white planter and a black freewoman who has been forced into slavery. Her ontogeny — as a black woman fully conscious of slavery’s legacy in contemporary America — recapitulates the phylogeny of her ancestor, who loses her innocence, faces harsh punishment, develops strategies of resistance, and ultimately develops the ability to escape from a repressive, racist white society. <em>Kindred</em> unflinchingly interrogates the intersection of power, gender, and race, but the narrative is far from simple: Dana’s ancestors, Rufus and Alice, were childhood friends, and Dana ends up developing sympathy for Rufus, despite the fact that he grows up to be a monster. She also encounters Sarah, an angry slave who only appears to be a submissive “mammie,” and other characters who fail to conform to previous depictions of slavery, from <em>Gone with the Wind</em> to <em>Roots</em>. The time travel narrative is also complex, as Dana — and, sometimes, her husband — ricochets back and forth from the present to various points in Alice and Rufus’s life stories. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> <em>Kindred</em> was a bestseller, and remains popular today; it is often chosen as a text for community-wide reading programs and high school and college courses. It was adapted as a 2017 graphic novel by Damian Duffy and John Jennings.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/02/07/alejandro-jodorowsky/">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a> and <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/05/08/moebius/">Jean Giraud</a> (Moebius)’s graphic novel <em>The Incal</em> (1980–1988).</strong> In the capital city of a planet within a galactic empire dominated by humans (and humanoid aliens known as Bergs), a mercurial private investigator, John DiFool, is nearly murdered by masked assassins. They’re seeking a crystal of enormous power, the Light Incal, which has gone missing; and so is: Animah, the keeper of the Light Incal; Tanatah, leader of a rebel group (and Animah’s sister); the city’s corrupt government; the Bergs; and the Technopriests, a cult that worships a different crystal, the Dark Incal. Jodorowsky’s space opera — drawn brilliantly by Giraud — is a satirical, dystopian admixture of intergalactic travel, political conspiracy, sex, drugs, and messianism. (If this description reminds you of <em>Dune</em>, it should: in 1975, Giraud provided concept art for Jodorowsky’s never-made film adaption of Frank Herbert’s novel.) Accompanied by Deepo, his loyal “concrete seagull,” and the Metabaron, a mercenary super-warrior, DiFool embarks on a quest to prevent the Technopriests from launching a sun-eating Dark Egg. It’s also a recursive mystic parable, of sorts. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Originally published in installments in <em>Métal Hurlant</em> (1980–1988); <em>The Incal</em> was followed by <em>Before the Incal</em> (1988–1995, with Zoran Janjetov), <em>After the Incal</em> (2000, with Jean Giraud), and <em>Final Incal</em> (2008–2014, with José Ladrönn).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/06/22/hilo-hero-octavia-e-butler/">Octavia E. Butler</a>’s <em>Wild Seed</em> (1980).</strong> In this prequel to Butler’s Patternist epic, a 1976–1984 series of novels recounting the rise of a mutant species of networked telepaths who will —&nbsp;in the far future — come to enslave “mute” humankind (while struggling against the Clayarks, a species of extraterrestrial plague-mutated humanoids), our protagonist is Anyanwu, a 350-year-old shapeshifter living peacefully in Africa… until she meets Doro, a telepathic spirit so powerful that he can possess any body. Doro, who was born in Egypt during the reign of the Pharaohs, intends to breed a race of telepaths under his control; he has been collecting people with unusual abilities and breeding them, and Anyanwu is his next target. Although she vehemently disagrees with Doro’s contemptuous, utilitarian treatment of his experimental subjects, Anyanwu is persuaded to leave her home for America… where she will struggle to rebel against Doro’s manipulative coercion. The book’s timeline begins in the late 17th century and ends in the early 19th century, and Anyanwu and Doro take the Middle Passage to the New World aboard a slave ship…&nbsp;yet Butler complicates this quasi-slave narrative by showing how Doro protects his “seeds” from Indian attacks and White racism alike. In the end, it’s a book about a woman who fights to protect her family from a cruel, paternalistic man —&nbsp;using love and self-sacrifice, not violence. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> The other Patternist books, in order of publication, are <em>Patternmaster</em> (1976), <em>Mind of My Mind</em> (1977), <em>Survivor</em> (1978), and <em>Clay’s Ark</em> (1984).</li>

<li><strong>Russell Hoban’s <em>Riddley Walker</em> (1980).</strong> “Our woal life is a idear we dint think of nor we dont know what it is.” Although its degraded dialect is not to every reader’s taste, and although it’s not particularly action-packed, <em>Riddley Walker</em> is one of the greatest of all post-apocalyptic adventures — and a brilliant, deep, mysterious, tragicomic piece of writing that amply rewards re-reading. When twelve-year-old Riddley’s father dies, he becomes his community’s “connexion man” — tasked with teasing out the social, religious, and political implications of the ever-evolving puppet shows staged — in primitive towns across “Inland” (England) — by church/government propagandists. A cataclysm happened, a couple of thousand years ago, reducing the world to an Iron Age level of technology — leaving nothing but myths, turns of phrase (“hes getting his serkits jus that little bit over loadit”), and artifacts to be puzzled over by inquisitive types. A power struggle is going on, we discover — one whose outcome may lead to humankind’s progress forward out of the ashes, or to utter ruin. The chance finding of an ancient relic gets Riddley involved in this momentous struggle… and sends him on the run! Though it’s often compared to <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> and <em>A Canticle for Leibowitz</em>, I’d describe <em>Riddley Walker</em> as a sequel to Cicely Hamilton’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2018/09/04/theodore-savage-intro/">Theodore Savage</a></em>, and a companion-piece to John Crowley’s <em><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2018/12/16/new-wave-sci-fi-75-63/">Engine Summer</a></em>. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Harold Bloom included this book in his list of works comprising the Western Canon; and George Miller’s 1985 movie <em>Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome</em> pays homage to <em>Riddley Walker</em>. Hoban is best known as the author of <em>Bedtime for Frances</em> (1960, ill. Garth Williams) and sequels, as well as for the older children’s novel <em>The Mouse and His Child</em> (1967).</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/10/05/philip-k-dick/">Philip K. Dick</a>’s <em>VALIS</em> (1981).</strong> Our narrator, Phil, a brilliant, self-reflexive sci-fi author who may be crazy, explores his own ideas… as well as those of the book’s protagonist, Horselover Fat, a brilliant, self-reflexive sci-fi author who may be crazy. Fat, it seems, has received a beam of pure reason from “God” — perhaps an alien satellite orbiting Earth — which has allowed him to see that 1970s California is an illusion; actually, we’re all slaves blindly toiling in a <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2011/07/13/the-black-iron-prison/">Black Iron Prison</a>. So…&nbsp;the ancient Gnostics were right! (Right?) The true nature of the universe is a Vast Active Living Intelligence System. Superhumans living anonymously among us use pop culture to stay in touch with one another; the pulp novels of Philip K. Dick may be on to something; the writings of Heraclitus, Schopenhauer, Freud and Jung must now be recontextualized. (Right?) Fat sets off, with a few friends, to find answers: about God, suffering, art, the mind, the secret history of humankind, and — naturally — about David Bowie, particularly his 1976 movie <em>The Man Who Fell to Earth</em>. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> <em>VALIS</em> is the first installment in a never-completed trilogy of novels fictionalizing the philosophical explorations Dick made into this experience via a rambling treatise, <em>The Exegesis</em>. It isn’t necessary, in order to enjoy <em>VALIS</em>, to know this, but: in 1974 Dick experienced a series of hallucinations which presented themselves as encounters with a gnostic version of the divine.</li>

<li><strong>John Wagner, Alan Grant, and Carlos Ezquerra’s Judge Dredd adventures “Block Mania” (serialized 10/31/1981 to 12/26/81) and “The Apocalypse War” (1/2/82 to 6/26/82).</strong> In 1977, writer John Wagner and artist Carlos Ezquerra created Judge Dredd —&nbsp;a violent sci-fi comic strip spoofing American action movies (military, cop, western, vigilante) of the Seventies — for British readers of the weekly magazine <em>2000 AD</em>. In the 22nd century, the titular judge-jury-and-executioner character and his colleagues police Mega-City One, which is subdivided into gigantic towers known as City Blocks stretching from Boston to Key West. In “The Apocalypse War,” Russkies from East Meg One, a Soviet citystate, invade Mega-City One. Hundreds of millions of Mega-City One citizens are killed, and ninety percent of the city is captured — while Dredd tries to organize a guerrilla resistance movement. Failing that, he must consider the option of completely obliterating East Meg One! “Block Mania,” the prologue to “The Apocalypse War,” demonstrates how Mega-City One was softened up for invasion: a massive conflict between City Blocks is engineered by an East Meg One agent, Orlok, who infects the water supply with a psychotropic drug. Orlok also kills Dredd’s sidekick, Judge Giant, in an almost casual way —&nbsp;which was shocking to even the shock-proof readers of <em>2000 AD</em>. <strong>Fun fact:</strong> Via his excellent <a href="http://dreddreviews.blogspot.com/search?q=apocalypse">Dredd Reckoning blog</a>, Douglas Wolk notes just how dark the humor of this storyline is: “It’s a story about genocide with comedy relief interludes — the Walter-and-Maria slapstick routines, the Country Joe-type folksinger getting splattered by a missile.” In 1987, Games Workshop produced a board game, set in the Judge Dredd universe, called <em><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/330/block-mania">Block Mania</a></em>; players take on the role of rival City Blocks — and use spray paint, guns, flamethrowers and heavy lasers to vandalize and destroy neighboring blocks.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/11/18/alan-moore/">Alan Moore</a>’s dystopian graphic novel <em>V for Vendetta</em> (serialized 1982–1989). Illustrated by David Lloyd.</strong> In the near future, following a nuclear war, the United Kingdom has become a fascist state run by the Norsefire Party. V, a flamboyant anarchist terrorist and vigilante whose face is never seen — he wears a Guy Fawkes mask — begins a campaign to bring down the government (and all governments); it’s like <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em> with a happy ending. V, we discover over the course of the graphic novel, was imprisoned in a Norsefire concentration camp and experimented upon… which led him to develop superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. He blows up the Old Bailey and the CCTY surveillance buildings, kidnaps the propaganda minister, and murders a bishop — what will his final act be? He’s pursued by Eric Finch, the secretly decent head of Norsefire’s police. The Robin to V’s Batman is Evey, a young woman whom he saves from a rapist and grooms as his successor — through very dubious methods. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Mostly published in black and white, in the British comics magazine <em>Warrior</em>; when the magazine folded, DC Comics reprinted and completed the story in color. In one of HILOBROW’s most frequently viewed posts, Molly Sauter <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/04/30/mask/">traces</a> the adoption of the Guy Fawkes mask by Anonymous, following the marketing blitz for the (lame) 2006 film adaptation of the comic.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2009/07/07/hilo-hero-robert-a-heinlein/">Robert Heinlein</a>‘s <em>Friday</em> (1982).</strong> Heinlein fans were relieved to see the master return — after a seven-year hiatus and the worst book of his career, 1980’s <em>The Number of the Beast</em> — to kiss-kiss bang-bang form. This is a fun spy novel, featuring a kick-ass combat courier, Friday Jones, who struggles to conceal her status as an “artificial person” genetically engineered to be stronger, faster, and smarter than the rest of us —&nbsp;because of prejudice and opprobrium. Heinlein was fond of reimagining what “family” could mean, and Friday’s group family, composed of several husbands and wives and many children, is a semi-intriguing idea. At the same time, critics are absolutely correct to point out that Heinlein is at his sex-positive skeeviest here… and that there really isn’t anything resembling a plot. What makes this novel worth mentioning in the context of New Wave sci-fi, I think, is the ingenious means by which Friday’s agency activates her highly advanced <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2010/11/03/meet-the-semionauts/">abductive reasoning</a> ability — that is to say, her capacity for making imaginative excogitations of hypotheses on the unknown causes of resulting facts. (For example, Friday accurately predicts the second coming of the Black Plague.) I’ve emulated these methods — archive binges, asking myself questions while in a hypnogogic state — in my own commercial semiotics practice. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Science fiction author Jo Walton has called <em>Friday</em> “the worst book I love.” I think that’s more or less how I feel about it, too. Though I love even worse books.</li>

<li><strong>Katsuhiro Otomo’s manga series <em>Akira</em> (1982–1990).</strong> Some forty years after after “a new type of bomb” has supposedly exploded over Tokyo, in 1982, triggering World War III, vocational school student and bōsōzoku gang leader Kaneda gets caught up in a struggle between Neo-Tokyo’s military leader, Colonel Shikishima, and a resistance movement who’ve discovered that Shikishima’s scientists are secretly developing a super-weapon of some kind: “Akira.” While Kaneda  and Kei, a female member of the resistance, investigate the Akira project, which may in fact have caused the 1982 destruction of Tokyo, Tetsuo — an already unstable member of Kaneda’s gang —&nbsp;develops powerful telekinetic abilities after a motorcycle crash. Tetsuo becomes leader of a rival gang, the Clowns, who start a violent citywide turf war; Shikishima then persuades Tetsuo to join his secret project — which involves wizened young “espers” with equally powerful abilities. All of which happens in the first action-packed volume of the <em>Akira</em> series — there are six, in total. What will happen when the increasingly deranged Tetsuo encounters the other espers — not to mention Akira? Can Kaneda and Kei prevent Shikishima from unleashing greater destruction? Who or what is Akira? <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Serialized in Japan’s weekly <em>Young Magazine</em> from 1982–1990. The full 2,000-page series was translated, colored, and published in the US by Marvel/Epic from 1988–1995. The 1988 animated movie, directed by Katsuhiro Otomo, is considered one of the greatest animated films of all time. I saw it on the big screen, in ’89 — it was mid-blowing, at the time.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/12/01/gary-panter/">Gary Panter</a>‘s comic strip <em>Dal Tokyo</em> (1983–2007).</strong> Panter’s <em>Dal Tokyo</em> — which is set on Mars, in a semi-dystopian city whose culture is a Dallas-Tokyo mashup —&nbsp;first appeared as a weekly strip in the <em>L.A. Reader</em> from 1983–1984, then as a monthly strip in a Japanese reggae magazine from 1996 to 2007. The sidewalks and alleys of Dal Tokyo teem with punks, aliens, mutants, Sepaloids, Cubist girls, and adorable manga characters. Rival advertising agencies engage in bloody combat; freelance peeping toms snap pho-toms of rich smog monsters having sex; and ant-men excavate classic cars from the surrounding desert, then melt them for the minerals they require to speak. Several plot-lines develop, over time: ex-dinosaur Nurse Barbie is at the center of a plot involving the university hospital and its evolution experiments; Sybig Nabcig, a juvenile smog monster, is the protagonist of a story about Dal Tokyo’s street culture, e.g., its skaters and radio-controlled robot fights; and we also follow car-hating fiend Dareiter Pictox, who early on in the series records an exploding Mustang for a Ballardian crash-porn moving-picture magazine, into a wild tangle of monsters, mutants, and media. There are many other characters and happenings, but the medium is the message, here: Panter sometimes uses his four panels to tell a serialized, Flash Gordon-type adventure; other times, he spreads a single scene or image or explosion across the entire frame; and other times, it’s impossible to tell what’s going on! Did Panter invent cyber-punk? <strong>Fun fact:</strong> I have written about Dal Tokyo <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2012/09/23/dal-tokyo/">at greater length</a> for <em>The Comics Journal</em>, on the occasion of Fantagraphics’ 2012 publication of a <em>Dal Tokyo</em> collection.</li>

<li><strong>John Sladek’s <em>Roderick at Random</em> (1983).</strong> In the sequel to Sladek’s <a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2015/12/02/10-best-adventures-of-1980/"><em>Roderick, or The Education of a Young Machine</em></a> (1980), our Candide-like robot protagonist takes a low-paying job and attempts to navigate such human, all-too-human institutions as academia, government, the military, the media, the art world, the publishing industry, and above all, religion. Thanks to Roderick’s hard-wired objectivity, this is a darkly satirical take-down of everything from trendy Zen Buddhism and a Scientology-like celebrity “church” to humankind’s propensity to fear, reject, and persecute those who don’t go along to get along. Life itself, Roderick discovers, is absurd; there is no inherent meaning in the world, no overarching purpose to our lives. Computers, meanwhile, are developing their own consciousness — which doesn’t make Roderick feel any less alone; in fact, he’s scared of the emerging AIs. If the book’s human characters are two-dimensional, and its narrative structure Rube Goldberg-like, it’s largely because Sladek was experimenting with the Oulipian possibilities of artificial constraints and mathematical possibilities. In the end, Roderick is revealed as the most truly human character in the story. <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Sladek was closely involved with the UK New Wave sci-fi movement in the 1960s–1970s; for example, he co-edited the short lived poetry magazine <em>Ronald Reagan</em>, where work by J.G. Ballard, Thomas M. Disch and other sci-fi writers appeared. The two Roderick books were intended to be parts of a single novel; and in 2001, they were published in one volume as <em>The Complete Roderick</em>.</li>

<li><strong><a href="https://www.hilobrow.com/2013/01/27/frank-miller/">Frank Miller</a>‘s graphic novel <em>Rōnin</em> (1983–1984).</strong> A six-issue DC miniseries written and drawn by Miller, who a couple of years earlier had earned a brilliant reputation as a writer and penciller on <em>Daredevil</em>. While researching martial-arts movies and Japanese samurai manga for that comic, Miller became fascinated with the medieval figure of the <em>ronin</em> —&nbsp;a rootless samurai whose master has been killed. Drawn in a weird, expressionistic style synthesizing manga and Moebius, Miller’s <em>Rōnin</em> tells the story of Billy Challas, a limbless and abused mutant with telekinetic powers who — while testing cutting-edge prosthetic limbs for the biocircuitry company Aquarius, located in a post-apocalyptic New York — appears to be possessed by a ronin from feudal Japan. Virgo, the artificial intelligence at the heart of the Aquarius Complex, is a major character in this enthralling, often wordless yarn; other players include Peter McKenna, inventor of biocircuitry, his wife, Casey McKenna, Aquarius’ bad-ass head of security, and Taggart, who funded and controls Aquarius (and who is replaced by the ronin’s almost-immortal enemy, the demon Agat). The action spills out into the streets of New York — where Billy/Ronin must confront a neo-Nazi gang, sewer-dwelling cannibals, and Virgo’s lethal robots! <strong>Fun facts:</strong> Artwork painted by Lynn Varley. Genndy Tartakovsky has stated that <em>Ronin</em> was one of the major influences on his animated TV series <em>Samurai Jack</em>.</li>
