          <p>Owners of some Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids have been left stranded after installing an over-the-air software update this weekend. The automaker pushed out a telematics update for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/hands-on-with-stellantis-new-android-based-uconnect-5-infotainment/">Uconnect</a> infotainment system that evidently wasn't ready, resulting in cars losing power while driving and then becoming stranded.</p>
<p>Stranded Jeep owners have been detailing their experiences in forum and Reddit posts, as well as on YouTube. The buggy update doesn't appear to brick the car immediately. Instead, the failure appears to occur while driving—a far more serious problem. For some, this happened close to home and at low speed, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/1o47064/jeep_4xe_shut_off_mid_highway/">others claim</a> to have experienced a powertrain failure at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Jeep pulled the update after reports of problems, but the software had already downloaded to many owners' cars by then. A member of Stellantis' social engagement team told 4xe owners&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/threads/wrangler-4xe-ota-update-10-10-2025.8078/?nested_view=1&amp;post_id=103140&amp;ref=thestack.technology#post-103140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a Jeep forum</a> to ignore the update pop-up if they haven't installed it yet.</p>
<p>Owners were also advised to avoid using either hybrid or electric modes if they had updated their 4xe and not already suffered a powertrain failure. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/posts/103207/">Jeep pushed out a fix</a>.</p>
<p>As Crowdstrike <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">showed last year</a>, Friday afternoons are a bad time to push out a software update. Now Stellantis has learned that lesson, too. Ars has reached out to Stellantis, and we'll update this post if we get a reply.</p>

					<p>Tons of words have been written about the Trump Administrations <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5419855-trump-administration-cuts-science-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">war on Science</a> in Universities. But few people have asked what, exactly, is science? How does it work? Who are the scientists? What do they do? And more importantly, why should anyone (outside of universities) care?</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, you won’t see answers to these questions in the general press – it’s not clickbait enough. Nor will you read about it in the science journals– it’s not technical enough. You won’t hear a succinct description from any of the universities under fire, either – they’ve long lost the ability to connect the value of their work to the day-to-day life of the general public.)</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to describe how science works, how science and engineering have worked together to build innovative startups and companies in the U.S.—and why <u>you</u> should care.</p>
<p>(In <a href="https://steveblank.com/2025/04/15/how-the-u-s-became-a-science-superpower/">a previous post I described how the U.S. built a science and technology ecosystem</a> and why investment in science is directly correlated with a country’s national power. I suggest you read it first.)</p>

<p><strong>How Science Works<br>
</strong>I was older than I care to admit when I finally understood the difference between a <em>scientist</em>, an <em>engineer</em>, an <em>entrepreneur</em> and a <em>venture capitalist</em>; and the role that each played in the creation of advancements that made our economy thrive, our defense strong and America great.</p>
<p><strong>Scientists<br>
</strong><em>Scientists </em>(sometimes called researchers) are the people who ask lots of questions about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> things work. They don’t know the answers. <em>Scientists</em> <em>are driven by curiosity</em>, willing to make educated guesses (the fancy word is hypotheses) and run experiments to test their guesses. Most of the time their hypotheses are wrong. But every time they’re right they move the human race forward. We get new medicines, cures for diseases, new consumer goods, better and cheaper foods, etc.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to specialize in one area – biology, medical research, physics, agriculture, computer science, materials, math, etc. — although a few move between areas. The U.S. government has supported scientific research at scale (read billions of $s) since 1940.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to fall into two categories: <em>Theorists</em> and <em>Experimentalists</em>.</p>

</strong><em>Theorists</em> develop mathematical models, abstract frameworks, and hypotheses for how the universe works. They don’t run experiments themselves—instead, they propose new ideas or principles, explain existing experimental results, predict phenomena that haven’t been observed yet. Theorists help define what reality might be.</p>
<p>Theorists can be found in different fields of science. For example:</p>
<p><em>Physics</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>Quantum field theory, string theory, quantum mechanics<br>
<em>Biology</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Neuroscience and cognition, Systems Biology, gene regulation<br>
<em>Chemistry</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Molecular dynamics, Quantum chemistry<br>
<em>Computer Science</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Design algorithms, prove limits of computation<br>
<em>Economics</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Build models of markets or decision-making<br>
<em>Mathematics</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>Causal inference, Bayesian networks, Deep Learning</p>
<p>The best-known 20th-century theorist was Albert Einstein. His tools were a chalkboard and his brain. in 1905 he wrote an equation E=MC<sup>2 </sup>which told the world that a small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy. <img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33115" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/einstein-at-the-blackboard/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=2294%2C1782&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2294,1782" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Einstein at the blackboard" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=468%2C363&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=162%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="162" height="126" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=1024%2C795&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=150%2C117&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=768%2C597&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1193&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1591&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?w=1404&amp;ssl=1 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px">When he wrote it down, it was just theory. Other theorists in the 1930s and ’40s took Einstein’s theory and provided the impetus for building the atomic bomb. (Leo Szilard conceived neutron chain reaction idea, Hans Bethe led the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, Edward Teller developed hydrogen bomb theory.) Einstein’s theory was demonstrably proved correct over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p><strong>Experimentalists<br>
</strong>In addition to theorists, other scientists – called <em>experimentalists</em> – design and run experiments in a lab. The pictures you see of scientists in lab coats in front of microscopes, test tubes, particle accelerators or NASA spacecraft are likely experimentalists. They test hypotheses by developing and performing experiments. An example of this would be <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/">NASA’s James Webb telescope</a> or the LIGO <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">Gravitational-Wave Observatory</a> experiment. (As we’ll see later, often it’s engineers who build the devices the experimentalists use.)<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33116" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/experimentalist/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=375%2C314&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="375,314" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Experimentalist" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=375%2C314&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=184%2C154&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="184" height="154" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=150%2C126&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?w=375&amp;ssl=1 375w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"></p>
<p>Some of these experimentalists focus on <em>Basic Science,</em> working to get knowledge for its own sake and understand fundamental principles of nature <em>with n</em><em>o immediate practical use</em> in mind.</p>
<p>Other experimentalists work in <em>Applied Science, </em>which uses the findings and theories derived from Basic Science to design, innovate, and improve products and processes.</p>
<p>Applied scientists<em> s</em>olve practical problems oriented toward real-world applications. (Scientists at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/manhattan-project-science-at-los-alamos.htm">Los Alamos</a> weretrying to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass">critical mass of U-235</a> (the minimum amount that would explode.) Basic science lays the groundwork for breakthroughs in <em>applied</em> science. For instance: Quantum mechanics (basic science) led to semiconductors which led to computers (applied science). Germ theory (basic science) led to antibiotics and vaccines (applied science). In the 20th century Applied scientists <u>did not</u> start the companies that make end products. Engineers and entrepreneurs did this. (In the 21st century more Applied Scientists, particularly in life sciences, have also spun out companies from their labs.)</p>

Where is Science in the U.S. Done?<br>
</strong>America’s unique insight that has allowed it to dominate Science and invention, is that after WWII we gave Research and Development money to universities, rather than only funding government laboratories. <em><u>No other country did this at scale</u></em>.</p>
<p><em>Corporate Research Centers</em><br>
In the 20th century, U.S. companies put their excess profits into corporate research labs. <em>Basic</em> research in the U.S. was done in at Dupont, Bell Labs, IBM, AT&amp;T, Xerox, Kodak, GE, et al.</p>
<p>This changed in 1982, when the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that it was legal for companies to buy their own stock (reducing the number of shares available to the public and inflating their stock price.) Very quickly <em>Basic</em> Science in corporate research all but disappeared. Companies focused on <em>Applied</em> Research to maximize shareholder value. In its place, Theory and Basic research is now done in <em>research </em>universities.</p>
<p><em>Research Universities<br>
</em>From the outside (or if you’re an undergraduate) universities look like a place where students take classes and get a degree. However, in a <em>research</em> university there is something equally important going on. <em>Science</em> faculty in these schools not only teach, but they are <em>expected to</em> <em>produce</em> new knowledge—through experiments, publications, patents, or creative work. Professors get grants and contracts from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, DoD), foundations, and industry. And the university builds Labs, centers, libraries, and advanced computing facilities that support these activities.</p>
<p>In the U.S. there are <strong>542</strong> research universities, ranked by the <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/classification-methodology/2025-research-activity-designations/">Carnegie Classification</a> into three categories.</p>
<p><strong>R1: </strong><a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=1"><strong>187 Universities – Very High Research Activity</strong></a><br>
Conduct extensive research and award many doctoral degrees.<br>
Examples: Stanford, UC Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Michigan, Texas A&amp;M …</p>
<p><strong>R2: </strong><strong><a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=2">139 Universities – High Research Activity</a><br>
</strong>Substantial but smaller research scale.<br>
Examples: Baylor, Wake Forest, UC Santa Cruz, …</p>
<p><strong>R3: </strong><a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=3"><strong>216 Research Colleges/Universities</strong></a><br>
Limited research focus; more teaching-oriented doctoral programs.<br>
Smaller state universities</p>
<p><strong>Why Universities Matter to Science</strong><br>
U.S. <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20243">universities perform about 50% of all basic science research</a> (physics, chemistry, biology, social sciences, etc.) because they are training grounds for graduate students and postdocs. Universities spend ~$109 billion a year on research. ~$60 billion of that $109 billion comes from the National Institutes for Health (NIH) for biomedical research, National Science Foundation (NSF) for basic science, Department of War (DoW), Department of Energy (DOE), for energy/physics/nuclear, DARPA, NASA. (Companies tend to invest in <em>applied</em> research and development, that leads directly to saleable products.)</p>

They ask research questions, then hire grad students, postdocs, and staff and write grant proposals to fund their work, often spending 30–50% of their time writing and managing grants. When they get a grant the lead researcher (typically a faculty member/head of the lab) is called the Principal Investigator (PI).</p>
<p>The Labs are both workplaces and classrooms. Graduate students and Postdocs do the day-to-day science work as part of their training (often for a Ph.D.). Postdocs are full-time researchers gaining further specialization. Undergraduates may also assist in research, especially at top-tier schools.</p>
<p>(Up until 2025, U.S. science was deeply international with ~40–50% of U.S. basic research done by foreign-born researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and faculty). Immigration and student visas were a critical part of American research capacity.)</p>
<p>The results of this research are shared with the agencies that funded it, published in journals, presented at conferences and often patented or spun off into startups via technology transfer offices. A lot of commercial tech—from Google search to CRISPR—started in university labs.</p>
<p>Universities support their science researchers with basic administrative staff (for compliance, purchasing, and safety) but uniquely in the U.S., by providing the best research facilities (labs, cleanrooms, telescopes), and core scientific services: DNA sequencing centers, electron microscopes, access to cloud, data analysis hubs, etc. These were the best in the world – until the sweeping cuts in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Engineers Build on the Work of Scientists<br>
</strong>Engineers design and build things <em>on top of the discoveries of scientists</em>. For example, seven years after scientists split the atom, it took 10s of thousands of <em>engineers</em> to build an atomic bomb. From the outset, the engineers knew what they wanted to build because of the basic and applied scientific research that came before them.</p>

<p>Engineers create plans, use software to test their designs, then… cut sheet metal, build rocket engines, construct buildings and bridges, design chips, build equipment for experimentalists, design cars, etc.</p>
<p>As an example, at <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/">Nvidia</a> their GPU chips are built in a chip factory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSMC</a>) using the <em>Applied</em> science done by companies like <a href="https://www.appliedmaterials.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Applied Materials</a> which in turn is based on <em>Basic</em> science of <a href="https://nano.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">semiconductor researchers</a>. And the massive data centers OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, et al that use Nvidia chips are being built by mechanical and other types of engineers. <img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33128" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/types-of-scientists-3/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=581%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="581,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Types of Scientists" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=468%2C232&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=307%2C152&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="307" height="152" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?w=581&amp;ssl=1 581w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=150%2C74&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px"></p>
<p>My favorite example is that the reusable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzVgPdBqM4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX rocket landings</a> are made possible by the <em>Applied</em> Science research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">Convex Optimization</a> frameworks and algorithms by Steven Boyd of Stanford. And Boyd’s work was based on the <em>Basic</em> science mathematical field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convex analysis</a> (SpaceX, NASA, JPL, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab all use variations of Convex Optimization for guidance, control, and landing.)</p>
<p><strong>Startup Entrepreneurs Build Iteratively and Incrementally<br>
</strong>Entrepreneurs build companies to bring new products to market. <em>They hire engineers</em> to build, test and refine products.</p>
<p>Engineers and entrepreneurs operate with very different mindsets, goals, and tolerances for risk and failure. (Many great entrepreneurs start as engineers e.g., Musk, Gates, Page/Brin). An engineer’s goal is to design and deliver a solution to a <em>known</em> problem with a given set of specifications.</p>
<p>In contrast, entrepreneurs start with a series of <em>unknowns</em> about who are the customers, what are the wanted product features, pricing, etc. They retire each of these risks by building an iterative series of minimum viable products to find product/market fit and customer adoption. They pivot their solution as needed when they discover their initial assumptions are incorrect. (Treating each business unknown as a hypothesis is the entrepreneurs’ version of the Scientific Method.)</p>
<p><strong>Venture Capitalists Fund Entrepreneurs<br>
</strong>Venture capitalists (VCs) are the people who <em>fund entrepreneurs</em> who work with engineers who build things that applied scientists have proven from basic researchers.</p>
<p>Unlike banks which will give out loans for projects that have known specifications and outcomes, VCs invest <em>in a portfolio</em> of much riskier investments. While banks make money on the interest they charge on each loan, VCs take part ownership (equity) in the companies they invest in. While most VC investments fail, the ones that succeed make up for that.</p>
<p>Most VCs are not scientists. Few are engineers, some have been entrepreneurs. The best VCs understand technical trends and their investments help shape the future. <em>VCs do not invest in science/researchers</em>. VCs want to minimize the risk of their investment, so they mostly want to take engineering and manufacturing risk, but less so on applied science risk and rarely on basic research risk.&nbsp;Hence the role of government and Universities.</p>
<p>VCs invest in projects that can take advantage of science and deliver products within the time horizon of their funds (3–7 years). Science often needs decades before a killer app is visible.</p>
<p>As the flow of science-based technologies dries up, the opportunities for U.S. venture capital based on deep tech will decline, with its future in countries that are investing in science – China or Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Why Have Scientists? Why Not Just a Country of Engineers, Entrepreneurs and VCs (or AI)?<br>
</strong>If you’ve read so far, you might be scratching your head and asking, “Why do we have scientists at all? Why pay for people to sit around and think? Why spend money on people who run experiments when most of those experiments fail? Can’t we replace them with AI?”</p>
<p>The output of this university-industry-government science partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley, the aerospace sector, the biotechnology industry, Quantum and AI. These investments gave us rockets, cures for cancer, medical devices, the Internet, Chat GPT, AI and more.</p>
<p>Investment in science is directly correlated with national power. Weaken science, you weaken the long-term growth of the economy, and national defense.</p>
<p>Tech firms’&nbsp;investments of $100s of billions in AI data centers is greater than the federal government’s R&amp;D expenditures. <em>But these investments are in <u>engineering</u> not in science</em>. The goal of making scientists redundant using artificial general intelligence misses the point that AI will (and is) making scientists more <em>productive – not replacing them.</em></p>
<p>Countries that neglect science become dependent on those that don’t. U.S. post-WWII dominance came from <em>basic science investments</em> (OSRD, NSF, NIH, DOE labs). After WWII ended, the UK slashed science investment which allowed the U.S. to commercialize the British inventions made during the war.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union’s collapse partly reflected failure to convert science into sustained innovation, during the same time that U.S. universities, startups and venture capital created Silicon Valley. Long-term military and economic advantage (nuclear weapons, GPS, AI) trace back to scientific research ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Scientists</em> come in two categories
<ul>
<li>Theorists and experimentalists</li>
<li>Two types of experimentalists; Basic science (learn new things) or applied science (practical applications of the science)</li>
<li>Scientists train talent, create patentable inventions and solutions for national defense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Engineers</em> design and <em>build things on top of the discoveries of scientists</em></li>
<li><em>Entrepreneurs</em> test and push the boundaries of what products could be built</li>
<li><em>Venture Capital</em> provides the money to startups</li>
<li>Scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs – these roles are complementary
<ul>
<li>Remove one and the system degrades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Science won’t stop
<ul>
<li>Cut U.S. funding, then science will happen in other countries that understand its relationship to making a nation great – like China.</li>
<li>National power is derived from investments in Science</li>
<li>Reducing investment in basic and applied science makes America weak</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Appendix – How Does Science Work? – The Scientific Method</strong><br>
Whether you were a theorist or experimentalist, for the last 500 years the way to test science was by using <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology">the scientific method.</a> This method starts by a scientist wondering and asking, “Here’s how I think this should work, let’s test the idea.”</p>
<p>The goal of the scientific method is to turn a guess (in science called a hypothesis) into actual evidence. Scientists do this by first designing an experiment to test their guess/hypothesis. They then run the experiment and collect and analyze the result and ask, “Did the result validate, invalidate the hypothesis? Or did it give us completely new ideas?” Scientists build instruments and run experiments not because of what they know, but because of what they don’t know.</p>

<p>These experiments can be simple ones costing thousands of dollars that can be run in a university biology lab while others may require billions of dollars to build a satellite, particle accelerator or telescope. (The U.S. took the lead in Science after WWII when the government realized that funding scientists was good for the American economy and defense.)</p>
<p>Good science is reproducible. Scientists just don’t publish their results, but they also publish the details of how they ran their experiment. That allows other scientists to run the same experiment and see if they get the same result for themselves. That makes the scientific method self-correcting (you or others can see mistakes).</p>
<p>One other benefit of the scientific method is that scientists (and the people who fund them) expect most of the experiments to fail, but the failures are part of learning and discovery. They teach us what works and what doesn’t. Failure in science testing unknowns means learning and discovery.</p>

<i>
One of the most consequential moments in California's drive to beat back climate change will take place next month. The state will stop receiving electricity from the Intermountain Power Plant in Central Utah, meaning our reliance on coal as a source of power will essentially be over...<p> 

[T]he U.S. got nearly half its electricity from coal-fired plants <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-10-02/boiling-point-california-quitting-coal">as recently as 2007</a>. By 2023, that figure had dropped to just 16.2%. California drove an even more dramatic shift, getting just 2.2% of its electricity from coal in 2024 — nearly all of it from the Intermountain plant.  Operators plan to cut off that final burst of ions next month. </p></i> <br>
"And with improved technology to store power, the change has been made without the power shortages that dogged the state up until 2020..."5<br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_text">
            <p>Last week, Jake Stid, a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State University, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-stid-38bb23131_solars-footprint-is-central-to-discussions-activity-7378531783019167744-CIlL/">announced</a> Ground-Mounted Solar Energy in the United States (GM-SEUS). This is a 15K-array, 2.9M-panel dataset of utility and commercial-grade solar farms across the lower 48 states plus the District of Columbia. This dataset was constructed by a team of researchers including alumni from NOAA, NASA and the USGS.</p>
<p>Below is a heatmap of the assets catalogued in this dataset.</p>

</a></p><p>GM-SEUS is broken up into two datasets, one for arrays and another panels. Below you can see a solar farm with the array outlined in red and the panels covered purple.</p>

</a></p><p>In this post, I'll explore GM-SEUS's Solar Farm dataset.</p>
<div id="my-workstation">
<h2>My Workstation</h2>
<p>I'm using a 5.7 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. It has 16 cores and 32 threads and 1.2 MB of L1, 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case.</p>
<p>The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.</p>
<p>The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock X870E Nova 90 Motherboard.</p>
<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and ArcGIS Pro only supports Windows natively.</p>
</div>
<div id="installing-prerequisites">
<h2>Installing Prerequisites</h2>
<p>I'll use GDAL 3.9.3 and a few other tools to help analyse the data in this post.</p>

<p>The maps in this post were mostly rendered with <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS</a> version 3.44. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.</p>
<p>I used QGIS' <a href="https://github.com/marklit/tile_plus">Tile+ plugin</a> to add basemaps from Esri to the maps in this post.</p>
</div>
<div id="analysis-ready-data">
<h2>Analysis-Ready Data</h2>
<p>I'll download a dataset containing the US CENSUS State codes. This will let me map the state ID in the arrays dataset to their state name.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>wget<span> </span>https://gist.github.com/a8dx/2340f9527af64f8ef8439366de981168/raw/81d876daea10eab5c2675811c39bcd18a79a9212/US_State_Bounding_Boxes.csv
</pre></div>
<p>I'll download the ZIP file of deliverables for GM-SEUS.</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$<span> </span>wget<span> </span>-O<span> </span>GMSEUS_v1_0.zip<span> </span><span>\</span>

<p>I'll extract the projection used. This proj4 string will be used to below to re-project the data into EPSG:4326.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>I'll use DuckDB to clean up the values and produce both a geometry field and a bounding box for each feature in this dataset. This will make working with this dataset remotely, such as from AWS S3, much easier.</p>

<p>This following produced a ZStandard-compressed, spatially-sorted Parquet file of the arrays dataset. I dropped the Z dimension as it was unused. The unknown values have been turned into NULLs. The original GPKG file was 108 MB and the resulting Parquet file is 37 MB.</p>

</a></p><p>Normally I would produce a Parquet file as even with 10s of thousands of records it'll generate in seconds versus a minute or so with GPKG. But ArcGIS Pro 3.5 didn't want to open the Parquet file I generated. QGIS 3.44 was fine with it but I wanted to use Esri's Nova basemap for the rendering below.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro 3.6 should be released sometime in the next few weeks so I'll re-examine this issue when it's out.</p>
<p>Below is the relationship between the sources of data and the installation year.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pdfly</code> can also combine files into new PDF documents: it can <strong>extract specific pages &amp; merge documents</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-cat.html"><code>pdfly cat</code></a>); selectively <strong>remove pages</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-rm.html"><code>pdfly rm</code></a>); <strong>convert images to PDF documents</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-x2pdf.html"><code>pdfly x2pdf</code></a>); and even <strong>compress documents</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-compress.html"><code>pdfly compress</code></a>) or <strong>build booklets</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-2-up.html"><code>pdfly 2-up</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-booklet.html"><code>pdfly booklet</code></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pdfly</code> includes some commands to <strong>pull out specific content from PDF files</strong>: <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-extract-images.html"><code>pdfly extract-images</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-extract-text.html"><code>pdfly extract-annotated-text</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes you want to edit a PDF file manually, in a text editor.
But when you do so, you break its <code>xref</code> table, that is an index of byte offsets in the document. <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-update-offsets.html"><code>pdfly update-offsets</code></a> is there to save the day, <strong>fixing manually-edited PDF documents</strong>, so that they can be opened in a PDF viewer again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.5.0 &amp; new features</h2>
<p>Today we released a new version: <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/releases/tag/0.5.0"><code>pdfly release 0.5.0</code></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to several contributors, including developers taking part in <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>, new exciting features have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-sign.html"><code>pdfly sign</code></a> allows you to <strong>easily sign PDF documents</strong>, while <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-sign.html"><code>pdfly check-sign</code></a> makes it easy to check a PDF document signature. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/moormaster">@moormaster</a> for implementing this in PRs <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/165">#165</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/166">#166</a> 👍🙏.</li>
<li><a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-extract-annotated-pages.html"><code>pdfly extract-annotated-pages</code></a> <strong>extract only annotated pages</strong> from a PDF, hence helping to review or rework pages from a large document iteratively. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hwine">Hal Wine (@hwine)</a> for implementing this in PR <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/128">#128</a> 👍🙏.</li>
<li><a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-rotate.html"><code>pdfly rotate</code></a> <strong>rotate specific pages</strong> of a document. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wolfram77">Subhajit Sahu (@wolfram77)</a> for implementing this in PR <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/98">#98</a> 👍🙏.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We have a bunch of feature ideas: <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aup-for-grabs"><code>up-for-grabs</code> issues</a>, including some <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22"><code>good first issues</code></a> aimed specially at <strong>new contributors</strong>, that are willing to help but new to open-source.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the <code>pdfly sign</code> &amp; <code>check-sign</code> could become handy to many end-users, and I think we should continue to extend those commands usage options, as described in <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/issues/71">issue #71</a>.</p>
<p>We would also be happy to get your feedbacks, bug reports &amp; feature suggestions! 🙂</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor’s note: This story was originally published by </em><a href="https://grist.org/international/global-renewable-energy-report-2025-ember/">Grist</a>. <em>It appears here as part of the </em><a href="https://www.climatedesk.org/about-us/"><em>Climate Desk</em></a><em> collaboration. </em></p>
<p>If you live in the United States, you could be forgiven for thinking that renewable energy is on the outs. In July, <a href="https://grist.org/buildings/congress-is-killing-clean-energy-tax-credits-heres-how-to-use-them-before-they-disappear/">Congress voted to rapidly phase out longstanding tax credit support for wind and solar power</a>, and the Trump administration has taken seemingly every step in its power to halt the development of individual <a href="https://stateline.org/2025/09/16/trump-has-crushed-offshore-wind-plans-but-states-havent-quite-given-up-hope/">wind</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/10/04/solar-energy-trump-trade-rules/">solar</a> projects—even as <a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/news/us-electricity-demand-to-grow-25-annually-thru-2035-bofa-institute/753911/">domestic electricity demand rises</a> and new sources of electricity become more important than ever.</p>
<p>But even as clean energy deployment hit roadblocks in the United States, the world overall set a new record for renewable energy investment over the first half of this year. Wind and solar power are meeting and even exceeding a global rise in energy demand. Indeed, electricity output from these sources is increasing faster than the world can use it, displacing some fossil fuel-generated power in the process. That’s according to a <a href="https://ember-energy.org/latest-insights/global-electricity-mid-year-insights-2025/">report published Tuesday by Ember</a>, a global energy think tank, which mapped this year’s global power supply by analyzing monthly data from 88 countries that are responsible for more than 90 percent of global electricity demand.</p>
<p>“Overall—we’re talking globally—renewables overtook coal,” said Malgorzata Wiatros-Motyka, a senior electricity analyst at Ember and a co-author of the company’s report. “And I expect this to hold.” This year marks the first time that renewable energy sources have outpowered coal in the global energy mix. In fact, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-renewable-wind-solar-coal-electricity-demand-abf7b587b038bf7580de1baee6576bbc">global use of fossil fuels for electricity actually declined slightly</a>, compared to the same period in 2024.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/global-renewable-capacity-is-set-to-grow-strongly-driven-by-solar-pv">report published this week by the International Energy Agency</a>, or IEA, an intergovernmental energy research and policy organization, projects that the quantity of installed renewable power—meaning the maximum amount of energy that can be produced by systems like solar fields, hydroelectric dams, and wind turbines—will more than double by the end of this decade. National policies encouraging the development of green technology as well as astounding drops in the price of solar power—primarily driven by Chinese manufacturers, which <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/solar-pv-global-supply-chains/executive-summary">build more than 80 percent of the world’s solar energy components</a>—are largely driving the transition.</p>
<p>And even that projection may be conservative.</p>
<p>“The IEA has, consistently over the last couple of decades, way underestimated how fast renewables are growing,” said Robert Brecha, a senior climate and energy adviser at Climate Analytics, a global climate science and policy institute, who was not involved in either the Ember or IEA report. “I don’t see any reason to believe that renewables won’t double by 2030.”</p>
<p>The vast majority of the renewable energy projected to go online in the coming years will come from solar, which already met more than 80 percent of new global energy demand in the first six months of 2025, according to the Ember report. In China, the largest renewable energy growth market in the world, and in India, which is on pace to become the second-largest market, a major uptick in solar energy output is responsible for a historic global decline in coal-generated power.</p>
<p>In the United States and the European Union, however, fossil fuel generation rose in the first half of this year. In Europe, poor wind conditions and drought, rather than state policies, took a bite out of the bloc’s wind and hydroelectric production, leading to a 14-percent rise in gas-fired power. Across the Atlantic, US coal-fired power generation rose 17 percent.</p>
<p>The policy outlook for renewables in the United States is so bleak that the IEA lowered the country’s renewable capacity growth expectations by 50 percent compared to last year’s projections. That US-driven dip drags down the agency’s global projections for renewable energy growth by 5 percent. Overall, however, the IEA still expects renewable energy capacity to grow even faster between 2025 and 2030 than it did between 2020 and 2025.</p>
<p>“They can slow it down; they can do a lot more damage than I thought they could,” said Brecha, referring to the <a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/the-trump-administrations-war-on-wind/">Trump administration’s efforts to slow the growth of renewable energy</a>. “But they can’t stop it.”</p>

  <article>
    
      <p>This is a translated version of a talk I gave at <a href="https://piwo.sh/">P.I.W.O</a> in June, with cleanups and adjustments for the blog form.</p>

<p>…that doesn't sound right. I made the slides in <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, on a computer running <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> and Linux, I use <a href="https://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a> regularly. But maybe that's just me. What about you, are you using Free Software? Hands up! [hands go up in the audience] Of course! What nonsense, "Free Software hasn't won". Someone replaced my slides, hey conference staff!</p>
<p>**<strong>Staff:</strong>** *<em>The other folder.</em>*</p>
<p>[Browsing to a directory named "other folder", opening file called "your slides dimwit.pdf"]</p>
<p>Now, those are finally my slides.</p>
<p>Hello audience, my name is Dorota, and I'm going to talk about how</p>
<h2># Open Source has won.</h2>
<p>And that's not recent, the news has been out in 2008, and has been regularly repeated since by reputable press: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-and-open-source-have-won-get-over-it/">ZDNET</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-winning-and-now-its-time-people-win-too">Linux Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/open-source-won-now/">Wired</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Those press articles list a multitude of examples to prove it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/logos.svg" alt="Logos of businesses and project mentioned in the articles above"></p>
<p>Linux, Ruby, Red Hat, uh, GitHub? Does that mean I can download GitHub and run it on my own server? Microsoft? Come on, that's some kind of a joke. Those slides are manipulated! So what else do they contain? Oh, <a href="https://geoawesome.com/open-and-closed-source-who-wins-the-race/">this quote</a> is all right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Open source won. It’s not that an enemy has been vanquished or that proprietary software is dead, there’s not much regarding adopting open source to argue about anymore. After more than a decade of the low-cost, lean startup culture successfully developing on open source tools, it’s clearly a legitimate, mainstream option for technology tools and innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, the name of the quoted person is wrong. Looks like an attack on my reputation! Anyways.</p>
<p>The point is, if we want to build something new, using Free Software is not a hindrance. And thats super important, because <a href="https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software is eating the world</a>. What does it mean? It means software keeps appearing in areas where there used to be no software before. That, in turn, means that we're slowly giving up control over more and more areas of life to those who made the software. After all, their software controls those areas of life from now on.</p>
<p>That's why it's great that there's always an alternative available, that we can select software that is free which grants control to us, and not just its manufacturer. So we have alternate <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">operating systems</a> made with <a href="https://kernel.org/">Linux</a>. There are <a href="https://www.python.org/">very</a> <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">many</a> <a href="https://llvm.org/">programming</a> <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/">languages</a> <a href="https://isocpp.org/">to</a> <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">choose</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">from</a>. We can choose one of the <a href="https://zero-k.info/">open</a> <a href="http://openalchemist.free.fr/">games</a>, or <a href="https://krita.org/">graphics</a> or <a href="https://ardour.org/">audio creation</a> software without resorting to closed software.</p>
<p>Similarly, we don't need closed software to <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy">print in 3D</a>, or to build a <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">mobile computer</a> (also known as smartphone) or a <a href="https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime">smart watch</a>. There are graphics cards which run <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nouveau#Firmware">completely free of closed firmware</a> (Upon asking nouveau devs, they confirmed they wrote some firmware. Nvidia Kepler from 2012 is the last model where free firmware is allowed). There are such bicycles! Pretty much everyone owns one that rides without closed software. There are also sewing machines:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/sewing.png" alt="A fully mechanical sewing machine from the '90s"></p>
<p>There are comms systems:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/doorbell.png" alt="A doorbell/intercom for 20 flats like one you might remember from the '90s"></p>
<p>There are cars, and have been for a long time:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/beetle.jpg" alt="The classic half-century-old VW Beetle had no electronics inside"> <img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/lada.jpg" alt="So did some Lada models which were not impressive when they came out in the 1980s"></p>
<p>There are hard drives:</p>
<p>[the slides go blank]</p>
<p>There are wireless headphones, TVs... [slides remain blank] wait, something's wrong. There are phones! [Slides stay mockingly blank, noise of frantic clicking.]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/aster-72.jpg" alt="A pulse-dial Aster-72 rotary phone which belongs firmly in the 20th century"></p>
<p>Crap. This isn't right.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/schemat_Aster_RWT.jpg" alt="A yellow card showing the schematic of the Aster phone"></p>
<p>Oh, now I get it! The only kind of a phone that grants us openness is an analog phone. That reminds me of the time we were building the aforementioned Librem 5. There was a problem finding the modem for it. The reason is, one company controls the necessary patents necessary to connect to cellular networks. That company can and does impose arbitrary conditions on anyone using their integrated circuits. That made it very difficult to find modems that match our needs, and at the same time any reseller is willing to sell us. The resellers worried that by passing them on to us, they could break some distribution rule and not be able to get any modems in the future.</p>
<p>So that's a no. But I know what will be open for sure.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/GNU.png" alt="The stylized gnu logo of the GNU project"></p>
<p>Richard Stallman started an important project called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> in 1983. In one of his <a href="https://en.linuxadictos.com/stallman-y-la-impresora-el-origen-de-las-licencias-libres-de-software.html">interviews</a>, as he describes how he started the project, he mentions a certain device that his university bought, but which didn't work very well. He wanted to improve it, but no one wanted to share the device's sources with him. That was an offense! Why wouldn't anyone share the code?</p>
<p>What was that device?</p>
<p>That was a printer. Considering that the GNU project started in 1983 and that the story's from 1981, it works out to over 40 years of fighting for printer freedom. So let's reveal our open alternative.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/Colored_pencils_chevre.jpg" alt="Colored pencils"></p>
<p>Oh come on. This cannot be. Have you ever used a printer? If you even manage to find a driver, if you even manage to connect to the printer, then it's still going to print single-sided black-and-white when you asked double-sided color. And despite having to put up with that, Free Software people still haven't gotten frustrated enough to solve the problem once and for all? Unbelievable.</p>
<p>I have a theory. People who say "Open Source has won" are only taking into account a small part of what software is out there. Take a look at this list: it's a map showing which kinds of software force you into running something closed (bold) and which have open options available (italics).</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications: *<em>Blender, Firefox, KiCAD</em>* – **<strong>Twitter, YouTube</strong>**</li>
<li>Operating System: *<em>GCC, Apache, OpenSSL</em>*</li>
<li>Kernel: *<em>Linux, Zephyr, FreeRTOS</em>*</li>
<li>Firmware: *<em><a href="https://coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a></em>* – **<strong>modem, GPU</strong>**</li>
<li>Appliances: *<em>Prusa 3D, <a href="https://github.com/airgradienthq/arduino">Airgradient</a></em>* – **<strong>washing machine, TV</strong>**</li>
</ul>
<p>What picture does this paint? Things programmers care about directly, like the OS and the kernel, are quite well covered. Whatever we need, there's an open version. Applications are also more or less fine. There's a Web browser, there's creativity software. The problem appears when you try to participate in social media. Sure, there are alternatives. But <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, or <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> are separate networks from the closed ones, so they won't help much when trying to reach people who aren't yet using them.</p>
<p>Looking at the lower layers, like appliances or firmware, there seem to be options. But those options are limited to a couple niches, and with most things we buy, like a TV or a PC component – sorry, pal, there's simply no choice at all.</p>
<h2>## All the firmwares in the average laptop</h2>
<p>How many processors are there in a typical laptop? By "processor" I mean something that needs its own software. For example, a GPU has its own processor that needs software, or a hard drive, or a keyboard. Here's a diagram of my personal estimate of what separate components need software:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/firmwares.png" alt="A picture of a laptop with highlighted components: camera, touch screen, touchpad, Embedded Controller, SSD, battery, HDD, RAM, WiFi+Bluetooth card, sound card, BIOS, Intel ME."></p>
<p>I estimate there are 10 to 15 separate processors on a typical laptop. Just the graphics card may host five of them.</p>
<p>What does that mean for free software? Normally, all that's open – Linux, drivers, applications – all of this is confined to the main CPU. Now imagine you want to use this operating system through some human-friendly interface, like the touch screen or the keyboard. Those are running closed software, so if you want to enter any sort of data on your average laptop, it's game over: you can't make a move without dependence on closed software.</p>
<p>Same story with the graphics card. You won't display anything without closed software. What a fail. Okay, let's ditch keyboards and displays because this is a server. But that's a fail, too: to communicate over a network card, you still need software that it's running and that hasn't been opened. Suppose that we managed to somehow solve this problem. We hit the wall anyway when we try to store data: SSDs as well as HDDs are running their own closed software. I haven't heard of a single case of open software ever running on a storage device!</p>
<p>But that's not even the worst. The peak of lameness is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828150536/http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html">the processor inside the processor</a>. Have you already heard of Secure Boot? It's a piece of BIOS that is loaded onto the processor inside the main processor before the main operating system. Secure Boot allows the manufacturer choose which software the user can run. A similar system exists on Android phones to lock them to a particular system. Manufacturers of Android-based phones are not shy about restricting what the user can run on their devices.</p>
<h2>## That runs against user's freedom!</h2>
<p>User freedom exists only when the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Four Freedoms of Software</a> are upheld:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: freedom to run the program for any purpose,</li>
<li>1: to study and change it,</li>
<li>2: to share copies of it,</li>
<li>3: to improve it and share the improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>…but those are just words. Who cares about that? This theory is only ever going to be relevant to us computer experts, right?</p>
<p>Except… could it be that you're the family's tech support expert? Does your uncle/mum/grandma come to you carrying their malfunctioning Android phone, hoping for you to make everything right again?</p>
<p>And have you ever disappointed them? Has it already happened that their phone was simply too old and unsupported to be useful any more? Have you already told someone they need to pay up to replace a phone that seems perfectly functional?</p>
<p>Sadly, that's what the Android manufacturer <a href="https://www.nextpit.com/how-tos/how-many-android-updates-manufactures-offer">support</a> <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/what-kind-of-guarantee-is-there-regarding-updates/105832">timelines</a> say: typically after 4, exceptionally after 8 years, they will no longer release security updates. That makes devices too insecure to use, and turns them into e-waste.</p>
<p>What does Free Software have to do with it? I don't know, but my Lenovo laptop, 13 years since release of the hardware, the operating system is still receiving regular security updates. I suspect this has something to do with the lack of a boot loader lock and the openness of all the drivers. That's unlike Android. Even if there's no explicit lock, the drivers are so rarely open that the community rarely has the manpower to create a custom ROM for a given device.</p>
<h2>## Rug pulls</h2>
<p>The couple hundred bucks that your aunt might need to pony up to get a new phone pale in comparison to how much you need to pay for some cloud-only devices. Some cloud-enabled gadgets don't let the user choose an alternative provider for services the device requires. What happens when the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/startup-will-brick-800-emotional-support-robot-for-kids-without-refunds/">shuts down</a> the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/210-days-after-nintendo-shut-down-the-3ds-and-wii-u-online-servers-the-last-connected-player-finally-signs-off-after-his-console-crashes-its-over/">online service</a>? Of course, the device <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/2300-magic-leap-1-headset-will-stop-working-after-2024">becomes an expensive brick</a>. Imagine someone setting your 2300 bucks on fire just like that.</p>
<p>That's still nothing compared to what some other people have to deal with. Imagine you're a farmer, and your harvest is on the field, ready to get cut and brought in. T here's a storm brewing, so you jump into the combine harvester, and start the work. Oh no! The machine broke down! Not to worry, you're a resourceful farmer and you have the necessary spare part. You install it and start the machine, except… it tells you: "Unauthorized component. Please contact customer service". Now you're in real trouble because it could take <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/report-tractor-right-to-repair-would-save-u-s-farmers-4-2-billion/">9 months</a> for the customer service to solve the problem. You can't harvest the food worth tens of thousands of dollars, you're that much in the red. Game over, your farm is bankrupt. But that's not the end of the world, is it?</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/pacemaker.jpg" alt="Two x-ray pictures of a human chest, with some wires and a chunky artificial shape visible"></p>
<p>This is what a pacemaker looks like. Why would I mention those in a talk about software freedom? You see, a pacemaker is a complex device which must examine and diagnose the patient continuously, in real time, in order to perform its function. Its task is to detect a dangerous condition and perform a medical procedure in response to it. It needs software to do this complicated task. But if the device isn't perfect at diagnosing, that's a big problem. I'm not a medical expert, but getting your heart shocked when it's not necessary sounds dangerous in its own right. When it runs closed software that does not grant us the freedom to modify it, we have to resort to begging the manufacturer to fix it. And when we get no freedom to study it, we can't even avoid the circumstances that make it misfire!</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it. I only know of this problem because of <a href="https://punkrocklawyer.com/">Karen Sandler</a>, whose <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/about/staff/">involvement with Free Software</a> is intertwined with this problem since the beginning.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if we have people who have no other choice but to trust their own body to a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete">piece of closed software and a single manufacturer</a>, how could we possibly say that Open Source had won?</p>
<h2>## Appliances and copyleft</h2>
<p>Are you responsible for building an appliance? I bet you're using Open Source software in it, aren't you? Then licenses like the MIT require you to include a notice about the authors of the source code together with the software you distribute. There's a whole <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/10/03/screenshotted-curl-credits/">gallery</a> of those on the curl website, ranging from cars to food processors. Are you feeling proud for releasing a device with Free Software in it? Not so quick! Can the user of your device study and modify the software you gave them? Have you actually granted them the Four Freedoms?</p>
<p>Permissive licenses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat">like the MIT license are Free Software</a>, so they let you do all that the Four Freedoms promise. But they also allow you to do another thing: to close the software again by never granting those freedoms regarding your own modifications. If that's what happened, then freedom for me, not for thee. You, the manufacturer, reaped the benefits, the user can't, sucks to be the user.</p>
<p>The responsibility to prevent this falls on us, computer experts. When we create software, we have the choice of license we want to release it under. And we should be using what's called "copyleft": it's a term that applies to licenses which prevent code once released under that license from being closed again. The most widespread copyleft license is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">Gnu General Public License</a> (GPL), and I recommend that you all use that one.</p>
<h2>## Licenses and more</h2>
<p>Licenses are not the only thing relevant for Free Software. There are other things to fight:</p>
<ul>
<li>patents, like in the case of cellular modems,</li>
<li>hardware locks, like Android's,</li>
<li>project management.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the last point, recently Google gave <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">an amazing example</a> by restricting access to sources in development to select manufacturers. Everyone else will not get continuous updates, but only once per major release. This illustrates how much influence over the practical usability of a project management decisions have. This is not a change in licensing, and it's also not a technical change, so it's not immediately visible under those lenses.</p>
<p>Instead, it's a consequence of who's in charge. In this case, it's not a community who controls the Android project, but a for-profit corporation. At the same time, it's regular people who are on the user side of the project. Is it any wonder that the goals of a corporation and those of regular people differ? Is it any wonder that the corporation is making changes that suit it even when they don't suit the community of users? When those are the conditions under which a project is developed, it can have deep consequences, even on an architectural level.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as a point of comparison. The first statement on the web page already says "Debian is a Community of People!". The software is being developed and used by the same people. They won't make it harder to use. They provide a complete operating system, publish all the sources, and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1099130">purge anything that isn't open enough</a>. On the other hand, Android has long been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/">replacing</a> open components by closed ones, making AOSP (the open part of android) all but <a href="https://www.esper.io/blog/aosp-missing-features-google-gms">unuseable on its own</a>.</p>
<h2>## Why?</h2>
<p>I suspect this situation has something to do with how computers and appliances have been developed historically. Computers have their roots in academia. When they were sold, they were always advertised as blank slates, general purpose devices, as opportunities to do what you choose to do with them. Not so much for appliances. Those have always had a single purpose. Except they kept getting complicated, until they entered a level of complexity where they needed to incorporate computers in order to perform their function. But they kept being manufactured as appliances, with only a handful of people being expected or allowed to exercise control over them. Incorporating computers didn't change the culture around them.</p>
<p>This is just a guess and I don't know how correct it is. For example Apple was always a computer manufacturer, but they are making computers now as if those were appliances.</p>
<h2>## What now?</h2>
<p>The responsibility is ours – computer nerds' – to make Free Software win. When we build a hardware device, we must publish the firmware sources. We must publish technical documentation – it often so happens that the device documentation needed to make open firmware is missing or incomplete (another war story from the Librem 5, camera sensors this time).</p>
<p>As users, or institutional customers, we should demand that the manufacturer provides open sources for any firmware they are shipping with their devices.</p>
<p>But there's one more way: political pressure. I expect this to be a more effective method than individual action. After all, EU managed to convince phone manufacturers to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58665809">standardize on USB-C ports for charging</a>, as well as to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/eu-repair-push-for-defective-consumer-goods">extend the warranty period</a>. Perhaps they could also force computer manufacturers to not install boot loader locks. It would fit nicely into the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/copyright-and-related-rights-in-the-information-society.html">Information Society Directive</a>. It says things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Member States must provide legal protection against any person knowingly performing without authority any of the following acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt; the removal or alteration of any electronic rights-management information;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>…oh. So instead of jailing people who put locks on devices they no longer own, it enforces the jailing of those who remove them from their own devices. Great.</p>
<p>Dear European Comission, please always have someone with a clue in the room who can explain the consequences of your ideas in a way you can understand. You can do it, already did a couple times, like above. But work on consistency, okay? Pinky promise?</p>
<p>Here are some people with a clue: <a href="https://fsfe.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> with their <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money Public Code</a> open letter, the <a href="https://repair.eu/">Right to Repair</a> movement, as well as the <a href="https://european-pirateparty.eu/">European Pirate Party</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend anyone who cares to join forces with them. But if you don't want to engage politically, there are also financial way of support. And I don't even mean (although I do encourage) donating. I mean supporting Free Software friendly manufacturers! Buy the Librem 5 from <a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>, or a 3D printer from <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/">Prusa</a>, or a smartwatch running <a href="https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js2">Espruino</a>. You see, it's expensive to manufacture any sort of hardware. It doesn't help that the markets are already saturated with closed products. Even if open source, hackable products are superior, it will take people at large a long time to realize that this is a superpower. Free Software thrived in culture of repair and modification. But this culture has been suffocated in the wider society with closed, throwaway items, so few people recognize its benefits. That unsustainable crowding out makes another obstacle for Open Source friendly products in the current markets.</p>
<p>There's a noble exception here. What makes it even more unusual is that it comes from Google. It's Chromebooks. Google has a set of requirements that all Chromebook manufacturers must fulfill, and one of them is having a completely open BIOS, together with the Embedded Controller firmware. All Chromebooks I'm aware of run Coreboot. They still contain some closed software, notably the RAM startup software, which, I believe, is present in all laptops, but! ARM-base Chromebooks are able to run with a completely open BIOS apart from that. So if anyone wants to take care of this together with me, I have this <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/MT818x_MT819x-firmware/">NLNet project</a> to make it as easy as possible to run regular, mainline Linux on them. So please, contact me, if you're that person.</p>
<h2>## The world</h2>
<p>A short quiz: how many devices can you count around you which contain processors?</p>
<p>Some hints: TV, camera, toothbrush, oscilloscope, e-book reader, radio receiver, dishwasher, router, washing machine, vacuum cleaner, bathroom scales.</p>
<p>Now think wider. When I went to the supermarket, the vegetable section had a scales that printed labels with barcodes. They were equipped with touch screens. You bet there's a processor and a load of firmware in those. But shops are chock-full of processors in my part of the world. There are thousands of price labels in each of those stores, and they are all e-paper screens. I'm fairly sure you need software to drive those and receive wireless updates.</p>
<p>Keep going and you might realize that the software running in your car allows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/tesla-model-s-chinese-hack-remote-control-brakes">remote control</a>. Or <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/polish_trains_geofenced_allegation/">in your train</a>. That snafu wouldn't have occured if the railways had access to sources of the train software.</p>
<p>What about other business uses? Car diagnostic stations? Medical equipment? Accounting software?</p>
<p>Software is really eating the world, and it's closed software which is *<em>everywhere</em>* around us, without free options. What's the regular person's role in this? They give up control over entire areas of their lives to others, others who often can't be supervised or replaced.</p>
<p>You know, we messed up. There's no other way to put it. We even let closed software sneak into our own home field: computers. Sure, the interfaces are open. There's SATA, there's PCI. We can swap parts if we want to, we can run Linux there, all is fine. Except it's not, because peripherals are as important as the core, and we, software people, lost control of the peripherals of our darlings already.</p>
<h2>## Wasted potential</h2>
<p>In theory, it's possible that someone opens a piece of software regardless of the wishes of the original authors. The whole game modding scene is about that. Here's an example of someone running Tetris on a pocket camera:</p>
<p>ZX3 running Tetris with hacked firmware</p>


<p>But going against the manufacturer is just wasted work. Imagine the difference between hacking it in and modifying the official sources. The potential, things we could achieve if we didn't have to break doors that are open! So here's a silly example: I have an action camera. Due to some <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/0794343949/wto-looking-at-moves-to-remove-30-minute-limit-from-digital-cameras">stupid law</a>, the camera breaks off every recording as soon as it reaches the 30 minutes mark. Now I have 20 years of coding experience. Having source code, I could have fixed the problem and went on with my life. Another example, another camera: I am making a time lapse from my window. Every day at 10:00, I take a picture from a camera that just sits there. But this camera has no time lapse feature, so I must go there in person every time. Why can't I fix this? Of course, no source code.</p>
<h2>## Epilogue</h2>
<p>There's now a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/open-tools/open-printer">new printer</a> project that advertises itself as open source. But if you look at the details, it's actually not. Instead, it uses a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">source-available license</a> which does not grant you Freedom 0 – you must not use the sources for commercial purposes. Better than nothing, I guess.</p>

<li><strong>Cost Efficiency</strong>: Reduce bandwidth and cloud computing expenses</li>
<li><strong>Resilient Operations</strong>: Maintain functionality during network outages</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>: Meet data sovereignty requirements</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Edge AI</h3><a id="user-content-edge-ai" aria-label="Permalink: Edge AI" href="#edge-ai"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Edge AI refers to running AI algorithms and language models locally on hardware, close to where data is generated without relying on cloud resources for inference. It reduces latency, enhances privacy, and enables real-time decision-making.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Core Principles:</h3><a id="user-content-core-principles" aria-label="Permalink: Core Principles:" href="#core-principles"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>On-device inference</strong>: AI models run on edge devices (phones, routers, microcontrollers, industrial PCs)</li>
<li><strong>Offline capability</strong>: Functions without persistent internet connectivity</li>
<li><strong>Low latency</strong>: Immediate responses suited for real-time systems</li>
<li><strong>Data sovereignty</strong>: Keeps sensitive data local, improving security and compliance</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Small Language Models (SLMs)</h3><a id="user-content-small-language-models-slms" aria-label="Permalink: Small Language Models (SLMs)" href="#small-language-models-slms"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">SLMs like Phi-4, Mistral-7B, and Gemma are optimized versions of larger LLMs—trained or distilled for:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Reduced memory footprint</strong>: Efficient use of limited edge device memory</li>
<li><strong>Lower compute demand</strong>: Optimized for CPU and edge GPU performance</li>
<li><strong>Faster startup times</strong>: Quick initialization for responsive applications</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">They unlock powerful NLP capabilities while meeting the constraints of:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Embedded systems</strong>: IoT devices and industrial controllers</li>
<li><strong>Mobile devices</strong>: Smartphones and tablets with offline capabilities</li>
<li><strong>IoT Devices</strong>: Sensors and smart devices with limited resources</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    














    
    <time datetime="2025-09-25T00:00:00.000Z">September 25, 2025</time>
    
    <p>Not long ago, I <a href="https://xenodium.com/introducing-acpel">introduced acp.el</a>, an Emacs lisp implementation of ACP (<a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol</a>), the agent protocol <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp">developed between Zed and Google folks</a>.</p>
<p>While I've been happily accessing LLMs from my beloved text editor via <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</a> (a <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-tiny-upgrade-to-the-llm-model-picker">multi-model</a> package I built), I've been fairly slow on the AI agents uptake. Probably a severe case of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud">old-man-shouts-at-cloud</a> sorta thing, but hey I want well-integrated tools in my text editor. When I heard of ACP, I knew this was the thing I was waiting for to play around with agents.</p>
<p>With an early <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> client library in place, I set out to build an Emacs-native agent integration… Today, I have an initial version of <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a> I can share.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/agent-shell.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>agent-shell</code> is a native Emacs shell, powered by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html">comint-mode</a> (check out Mickey's <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter">comint article</a> btw). As such, we don't have to dance between char and line modes to interact with things. <code>agent-shell</code> is just a regular Emacs buffer like any other you're used to.</p>
<h2 id="agent-agnostic" tabindex="-1">Agent-agnostic</h2>
<p>Thanks to ACP, we can now build agent-agnostic experiences by simply configuring our clients to communicate with their respective agents using a common protocol. As users, we benefit from a single, consistent experience, powered by any agent of our choice.</p>
<p>Configuring different agents from <code>agent-shell</code> boils down which agent we want running in the comms process. Here's an example of Gemini CLI vs Claude Code configuration:</p>
<pre><code>(defun agent-shell-start-gemini-agent ()
  "Start an interactive Gemini CLI agent shell."
  (interactive)
  (agent-shell--start
   :new-session t
   :mode-line-name "Gemini"
   :buffer-name "Gemini"
   :shell-prompt "Gemini&gt; "
   :shell-prompt-regexp "Gemini&gt; "

<p>I've yet to try other agents. If you get another agent running, I'd love to hear about it. Maybe submit a <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell/pulls">pull request</a>?</p>
<h2 id="traffic" tabindex="-1">Traffic</h2>
<p>While I've been relying on my <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> client library, I'm still fairly new to the protocol. I often inspect traffic to see what's going on. After staring at json for far too long, I figured I may as well build some tooling around <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> to make my life easier. I added a traffic buffer for that. From <code>agent-shell</code>, you can invoke it via <code>M-x agent-shell-view-traffic</code>.</p>

<h2 id="fake-agents" tabindex="-1">Fake agents</h2>
<p>Developing <code>agent-shell</code> against paid agents got expensive quickly. Not only expensive, but my edit-compile-run cycle also became boringly slow waiting for agents. While I knew I wanted some sort of fake agent to work against, I didn't want to craft the fake traffic myself. Remember that traffic buffer I showed ya? Well, I can now save that traffic to disk and replay it later. This enabled me to run problematic sessions once and quickly replay multiple times to fix things. While re-playing has its quirks and limitations, it's done the job for now.</p>
<p>You can see a Claude Code session below, followed by its replayed counterpart via fake infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="what's-next" tabindex="-1">What's next</h2>
<p>Getting here took quite a bit of work. Having said that, it's only a start. I myself need to get more familiar with agent usage and evolve the package UX however it feels most natural within its new habitat. Lately, I've been experimenting with a quick diff buffer, driven by n/p keys, shown along the permission dialog.</p>
<pre><code>#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/diff.png"><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/diff.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>While I've implemented enough parts of the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/schema">Agent Client Protocol Schema</a> to make the package useful, it's hardly complete. I've yet to fully familiarize myself with most protocol features.</p>
<h2 id="take-them-for-a-spin" tabindex="-1">Take them for a spin</h2>
<p>Both of my new Emacs packages, <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a>, are now available on GitHub. As an agent user, go straight to <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a>. If you're a package author and would like to build an ACP experience, then give <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> a try. Both packages are brand new and may have rough edges. Be sure to file bugs or feature requests as needed.</p>

<p>I've been heads down, working on these packages for some time. If you're using cloud LLM services, you're likely already paying for tokens. If you find my work useful, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">routing some of those coins</a> to help fund it. Maybe my tools make you more productive at work? Ask your <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">employer to support the work</a>. These packages not only take time and effort, but also cost me money. <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">Help fund the work</a>.</p>

<div><p>Currently a one-man side project:
<a href="https://laboratory.love/" rel="nofollow">https://laboratory.love</a></p><p>Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard.</p><p>That seemed solvable.</p><p>Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about.</p><p>Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly.</p><p>We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open.</p><p>Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post:</p><p>- 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!)</p><p>- That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates)</p><p>- 6 results published, 4 in progress</p><p>The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift.</p><p>Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along:

<div><p>1. An example result is "<a href="https://laboratory.love/product/117" rel="nofollow">https://laboratory.love/product/117</a>", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly "best"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level?</p><p>2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will?</p><p>3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6?</p><p>4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them?</p><p>5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45562409"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45562409" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45562409&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I've become a bit addicted to online education.  I finished my first masters degree in Computer Science in July, and I started a masters in Mathematics from The Open University at the beginning of October.  I've wanted to really get into the weeds of obscure and arguably-useless math for about as long as I can remember, and I figure that getting a masters in it is as good a way to get that knowledge as any way else.</p><p>Other than that, I've been doing a lot of fixing of tech debt in my home network from the last six years.  I've admittedly kind of half-assed a lot of the work with my home router and my server and my NAS and I want these things to be done correctly. (In fairness to me, I didn't know what I was doing back when I started, and I'd like to think I know a fair bit better now).</p><p>For example, when I first built my server, I didn't know about ZFS datasets, so everything was on the main /tank mount.  This works but there are advantages to having different settings for different parts of the RAID and as such I've been dividing stuff into datasets (which has the added advantage of "defragging" because this RAID has grown by several orders of magnitude and as a result some of the initial files were fragmented).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563787"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563787" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563787&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology.</p><p>For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be.</p><p>Approximately $30 of culture media can produce &gt;10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics.</p><p>My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics!</p><p>Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563282"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563282" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563282&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>As a bio hobbyist, this is fantastic!  I don't do enough volume of PCR to think of it as expensive, but your use case of high-volume/automatic sounds fantastic! (And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive).</p><p>Some things that would be cool</p><pre><code>  - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels
  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.
  - Cheaper enzymes in general
  - More options for -80 freezers
  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.
  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.
  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.
  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees.</code></pre><p>
- Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45562322"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563779"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563086"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563559"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563457"><td></td></tr><tr id="45562405"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45562405" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45562405&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I wish you good luck.</p><p>This might be a naive question which you've probably been asked plenty of times before so I'm sorry of I'm being tedious here.</p><p>Is it really worth the effort and expense to have a real radio station these days? Wouldn't an online stream be just as effective if it was promoted well locally?</p><p>A few years ago a friend who was very much involved in a local community group which I was also somewhat interested in asked me if I wanted to help build a low power FM station.

The nerdy part of me would have enjoyed doing it but I couldn't help thinking that an online stream would probably reach as many people without the hassle and expensive of a transmitter, antenna etc.</p><p>I know it's a toss up. Every car has an FM radio.

<div><p>I have a lot of thoughts about this!</p><p>1. Radio is COOL. As a fellow ham I think you would agree with me on this one so I'll leave it at that.</p><p>2. Internet streaming gives you wider but far less localized audience. We will have an internet stream, but being radio first shifts the focus to local community and local content.</p><p>3. Internet streaming and radio have related but not entirely overlapping histories and contexts which impacts how people produce and consume their content. I love the traditional formats of radio and they are often completely missing in online radio which IMO models itself more often on mixtape and club DJ culture.</p><p>4. AI slop is ruining the world. I have this belief that as AI slop further conquers the internet we are going to get to a place where nobody trusts internet content. People will seek out novelty and authenticity (sort of how LLMs do lol) and I think there will be a return to local content and community.</p><p>5. Commercial radio sucks.

<div><p>I'm working on a tool for creating custom color palettes for web designs that pass WCAG contrast requirements:</p><p><a href="https://www.inclusivecolors.com/" rel="nofollow">https://www.inclusivecolors.com/</a></p><p>- You can precisely tweak every shade/tint so you can incorporate your own brand colors. No AI or auto generation!</p><p>- It helps you build palettes that have simple to follow color contrast guarantees by design e.g. all grade 600 colors have 4.5:1 WCAG contrast (for body text) against all grade 50 colors, such as red-600 vs gray-50, or green-600 vs gray-50.</p><p>- There's export options for plain CSS, Tailwind, Figma, and Adobe.</p><p>- It uses HSLuv for the color picker, which makes it easier to explore accessible color combinations because only the lightness slider impacts the WCAG contrast. A lot of design tools still use HSL, where the WCAG contrast goes everywhere when you change any slider which makes finding contrasting colors much harder.</p><p>- Check out the included example open source palettes and what their hue, saturation and lightness curves look like to get some hints on designing your own palettes.</p><p>It's probably more for advanced users right now but I'm hoping to simplify it and add more handholding later.</p><p>Really open to any feedback, feature requests, and discussing challenges people have with creating accessible designs. :)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45562317"><td></td></tr><tr id="45562297"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45562297" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45562297&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I built <a href="https://invoicepad.app/" rel="nofollow">https://invoicepad.app</a> which is a free, completely in-browser tool for creating invoices, estimates, and quotes. Yes, similar apps have been posted here before, but none were built the way I envisioned, so I made my own. The key difference: all invoice data is stored in the URL hash, not the querystring. This is important because querystrings are sent to the server with every request, while hashes stay local to your browser. This means I can never see your invoice data, unlike other similar apps. The workflow is simple: use your browser's bookmark manager as your invoice filing system. Or if you want to keep it offline, just copy and paste invoice URLs into a text document for storage. I’ve also included helpful features like saved profiles to save on repeated data input. The next step is to finish working on a browser extension (v1 is being tested) to make bookmarking, editing, and saving changes even easier, that is if I ever stop being distracted by other side projects.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563706"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563706" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563706&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: <a href="https://circuitscript.net/" rel="nofollow">https://circuitscript.net/</a>. A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: <a href="https://bench.circuitscript.net/" rel="nofollow">https://bench.circuitscript.net/</a></p><p>Since the last month, I have created a complete schematic with Circuitscript, exported the netlist to pcbnew and designed the PCB. The boards have been produced and currently waiting for them to be delivered to verify that it works. Quite excited since this will be the first design ever produced with Circuitscript as the schematic capture tool!</p><p>The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.</p><p>The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse.</p><p>Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563294"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563294" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563294&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

    - Anonymous AI chat via a privacy proxy (provider sees our server, not your IP or account info)
    - End‑to‑end encrypted history, keys derived from password and never leave your device
    - Pay‑as‑you‑go; switch models mid‑chat (OpenAI now; Claude, Gemini and others planned)
    - Practical UX: sort chats into folders, Markdown, copyable code blocks, mobile‑friendly
  - Notes/limits:
    - Not self‑hosted: prompts go to third‑party APIs
    - If you include identifying info, upstream sees it
    - Prompts take a bit long sometimes, because reasoning is set to "medium" for now. Plan to make this adjustable in the future.
  - Looking for feedback:
    - What do you need to trust this? Open source? Independent audit?
    - Gaps in the threat model I'm missing
    - Which UI features and AI models you'd want next
    - Any UX rough edges (esp. mobile)

<div><p>Now that I can finally test on hardware, I completely rewrote input handling. I can now support original NES controllers, but also SNES and the Power Pad dance mat, for anyone crazy enough to try that. The hardest part was working around a particularly nasty hardware bug: if you try to read the input ports on even cycles while one of the sound channels is playing, the data becomes corrupted. Perform the exact same read on an odd cycle and it works every time.</p><p>The solution? Have the cartridge keep track of CPU parity (there's no simple way to do this with just the CPU), then check that, skip one cycle if needed... and very carefully cycle time the rest of the routine, making sure that your reads land on safe cycles, and your writes land in places that won't throw off the alignment.</p><p>But it works!

<div><p>While working on Shelvica, a personal library management service and reading tracker, I realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything.</p><p>So I started working on Librario, an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups.</p><p>You can see an example response here[1]. Pricing information for books is missing right now because I need to finish the extractor for those, genres need some work[2], and having a 5 months old baby make development a tad slow, but the service is almost ready for a preview.</p><p>The algorithm to decide what to merge is the hardest part, in my opinion, and very basic right now. It's based on a priority and score system for now, where different extractors have different priorities, and different fields have different scores. Eventually, I wanna try doing something with machine learning instead.</p><p>I'd also like to add book summaries to the data somehow, but I haven't figured out a way to do this legally yet. For books in the public domain I could feed the entire book to an LLM and ask them to write a spoiler-free summary of the book, but for other books, that'd land me in legal trouble.</p><p>Oh, and related books, and things of the sort. But I'd like to do that based on the information stored in the database itself instead of external sources, so it's something for the future.</p><p>Last time I posted about Shelvica some people showed interest in Librario instead, so I decided to make it something I can sell instead of just a service I use in Shelvica[3], hence why I'm focusing more on it these past two weeks.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/de80132b8f167f4503c31187cf7acc1c2881a79b" rel="nofollow">https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/de80132b8f167f4503c31187...</a></p><p>[2]: In the example you'll see genres such as "English" and "Fiction In English", which is mostly noise.

So you really only want one per process.</p><p>Result: simple, portable Python code that can easily manage monitoring hundreds of servers (sorry didnt mean for that to sound like chatgpt, lmao, incidental.)

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Some argue that even if the current AI boom leads to an overbuild, it might not be a bad thing – just as the dotcom bubble left behind the internet infrastructure that powered later decades of growth.</p>



<p>It’s a tempting comparison, but the parallels only go so far.</p>



<p>The dotcom era’s overbuild created durable, open infrastructure – fibre networks and interconnects built on open standards like TCP/IP and HTTP. Those systems had multi-decade lifespans and could be reused for whatever came next. Much of the fibre laid in the 1990s still carries traffic today, upgraded simply by swapping out the electronics at each end. That overinvestment became the backbone of broadband, cloud computing, and the modern web.</p>



<div><p>Most of today’s AI investment, by contrast, is flowing into <strong>proprietary, vertically integrated systems</strong> rather than open, general-purpose infrastructure. Most of the money is being spent on incredibly expensive <strong>GPUs that have a 1-3 year lifespan</strong> due to becoming obsolete quickly and wearing out under constant, high-intensity use. These chips aren’t general-purpose compute engines; they’re <strong>purpose-built for training and running generative AI models</strong>, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major vendors such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon.</p><p>These chips live inside <strong>purpose-built AI data centres</strong> – engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Unlike the general-purpose facilities of the early cloud era, these sites are tightly coupled to the hardware and software of whoever built them. Together, they form a closed ecosystem optimised for scale but hard to repurpose.</p></div>



<p>That’s why, if the AI bubble bursts, we could just be left with <strong>a pile of short-lived, highly specialised silicon and silent cathedrals of compute – monuments from a bygone era</strong>.</p>



<h3>The possible upside</h3>



<p>Still, there’s a more positive scenario.</p>



<p>If investment outruns demand, surplus capacity could push prices down, just as the post-dotcom bandwidth glut did in the early 2000s. Cheap access to this kind of compute might open the door for new experimentation – not just in generative AI, but in other high-compute domains such as simulation, scientific research, and data-intensive analytics. Even if the hardware is optimised for GenAI, falling prices could still make large-scale computation more accessible overall. A second-hand market in AI hardware could emerge, spreading access to powerful compute much more widely.</p>



<p>The supporting infrastructure – power grid upgrades, networking, and edge facilities – will hopefully remain useful regardless. And even if some systems are stranded, the talent, tooling, and operational experience built during the boom will persist, as it did after the dotcom crash.</p>



<h3>Without openness, the benefits stay locked up</h3>



<p>The internet’s long-term value came not just from cheap capacity, but from <strong>open standards and universal access</strong>. Protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP meant anyone could build on the same foundations, without permission or platform lock-in. That openness turned surplus infrastructure into a shared public platform, unlocking decades of innovation far beyond what the original investors imagined.</p>



<p>The AI ecosystem is the opposite: powerful but closed. Its compute, models, and APIs are owned and controlled by a handful of vendors, each defining their own stack and terms of access. Even if hardware becomes cheap, it won’t automatically become open. Without shared standards or interoperability, any overbuild risks remaining a <strong>private surplus</strong> rather than a <strong>public good</strong>.</p>



<p>So the AI boom may not leave behind another decades-long backbone like the internet’s fibre networks. But it could still seed innovation if the industry finds ways to open up what it’s building – turning today’s private infrastructure into tomorrow’s shared platform.</p>

<p dir="auto">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are the central and indispensable component of Internet security. They comprise a set of technologies that connect geographically dispersed, heterogeneous networks through encrypted tunnels, creating the impression of a homogenous private network on the public shared physical medium.</p>
<p dir="auto">
  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/blob/main/0.doc/artwork/wireguard-fpga.logo.png"><img width="200" src="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/raw/main/0.doc/artwork/wireguard-fpga.logo.png"></a>

</p>
<p dir="auto">With traditional solutions (such as OpenVPN / IPSec) starting to run out of steam, Wireguard is increasingly coming to the forefront as a modern, secure data tunneling and encryption method, one that's also easier to manage than the incumbents. Both software and hardware implementations of Wireguard already exist. However, the software performance is far below the speed of wire. Existing hardware approaches are both prohibitively expensive and based on proprietary, closed-source IP blocks and tools.<br></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The intent of this project is to bridge these gaps with an FPGA open-source implementation of Wireguard, written in SystemVerilog HDL.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A Glimpse into History</h2><a id="user-content-a-glimpse-into-history" aria-label="Permalink: A Glimpse into History" href="#a-glimpse-into-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We have contributed to the <strong>Blackwire</strong> project, which is a 100Gbps hardware implementation of Wireguard switch based on AMD/Xilinx-proprietary AlveoU50 PC-accelerator card (SmartNIC form-factor), and implementable only with proprietary Vivado toolchain.</p>
<p dir="auto">While working on the <em>Blackwire</em>, we have touched multiple sections, and focused on the novel algorithm for <a href="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/blob/main/0.doc/Wireguard/Scalable-Balanced-Pipelined-IPv6-Lookup.pdf"><em>Balanced Binary Tree Search</em></a> of IP tables. However, the <em>Blackwire</em> hardware platform is expensive and priced out of reach of most educational institutions. Its gateware is written in SpinalHDL, a nice and powerfull but a niche HDL, which has not taken roots in the industry. While <em>Blackwire</em> is now released to open-source, that decision came from their financial hardship -- It was originaly meant for sale. Moreover, the company behind it is subject to disputes and obligations that bring into question the legality of ownership over the codebase they "donated" to the open source community.</p>

<p dir="auto">Since the WireGuard node essentially functions as an IP router with WireGuard protocol support, we have decided to design the system according to a two-layer architecture: a control plane responsible for managing IP routing processes and executing the WireGuard protocol (managing remote peers, sessions, and keys), and a data plane that will perform IP routing and cryptography processes at wire speed. The control plane will be implemented as software running on a soft CPU, while the data plane will be fully implemented in RTL on an FPGA.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/blob/main/0.doc/Wireguard/wireguard-fpga-muxed-Architecture-HW-SW-Partitioning.webp"><img src="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/raw/main/0.doc/Wireguard/wireguard-fpga-muxed-Architecture-HW-SW-Partitioning.webp" alt="HWSWPartitioning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the HW/SW partitioning diagram, we can observe two types of network traffic: control traffic, which originates from the control plane and goes toward the external network (and vice versa), and data traffic, which arrives from the external network and, after processing in the data plane, returns to the external network. Specifically, control traffic represents WireGuard protocol handshake messages, while data traffic consists of end-user traffic, either encrypted or in plaintext, depending on the perspective.</p>

<p dir="auto">The hardware architecture essentially follows the HW/SW partitioning and consists of two domains: a soft CPU for the control plane and RTL for the data plane.</p>
<p dir="auto">The soft CPU is equipped with a Boot ROM and a DDR3 SDRAM controller for interfacing with off-chip memory. External memory is exclusively used for control plane processes and does not store packets. The connection between the control and data planes is established through a CSR-based HAL.</p>
<p dir="auto">The data plane consists of several IP cores, including data plane engine (DPE) and supporting components, which are listed and explained in the direction of network traffic propagation:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>PHY Controller</em> - initial configuration of Realtek PHYs and monitoring link activity (link up/down events)</li>
<li><em>1G MAC</em> - execution of the 1G Ethernet protocol (framing, flow control, FCS, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Rx FIFOs</em> - clock domain crossing, bus width conversion, and store &amp; forward packet handling</li>
<li><em>Per-Packet Round Robin Multiplexer</em> - servicing Rx FIFOs on a per-packet basis using a round-robin algorithm</li>
<li><em>Header Parser</em> - extraction of WireGuard-related information from packet headers (IP addresses, UDP ports, WireGuard message type, peer ID, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Wireguard/UDP Packet Disassembler</em> - decapsulation of the payload from the Wireguard data packet for decryption of tunneled traffic</li>
<li><em>ChaCha20-Poly1305 Decryptor</em> - decryption and authentication of tunneled traffic</li>
<li><em>IP Lookup Engine</em> - routing/forwarding table lookup, mapping packets to the appropriate WireGuard peer, and making packet accept/reject decisions</li>
<li><em>ChaCha20-Poly1305 Encryptor</em> - encryption and authentication of traffic to be tunneled</li>
<li><em>Wireguard/UDP Packet Assembler</em> - encapsulation of the encrypted packet into a WireGuard data packet for tunneling to the remote peer</li>
<li><em>Per-Packet Demultiplexer</em> - forwarding packets to Tx FIFOs based on packet type and destination</li>

<p dir="auto">The Wireguard control and status register harware abstraction layer (HAL) software is <a href="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/blob/main/3.build/README.md#co-simulation-hal">auto-generated</a>, as is the CSR RTL, using <a href="https://peakrdl-cheader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="nofollow"><code>peakrdl</code></a>. For co-simulation purposes an additional layer is auto-generated from the same SystemRDL specification using <a href="https://systemrdl-compiler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" rel="nofollow"><code>systemrdl-compiler</code></a> that accompanies the <code>peakrdl</code> tools. This produces two header files that define a common API to the application layer for both the RISC-V platform and the <em>VProc</em> based co-simulation verification environment.

What began as a small run of talks quickly sold out and drew international interest.

In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”.

Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”.</p><p>She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born.</p><p>The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”.</p><p>Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.”</p><p>But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm?</p><p>Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat" data-link-name="in body link">boycotted</a> the service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back.</p><p>Neil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify.</p><p>Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.”</p><p>Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”.</p><figure id="1b2ee962-a974-4dc7-b814-4b4c715bbc7b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Two people pose for a photo outside in the dark" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.9891304347826" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Manasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich.</span> Photograph: Eva Tuff</figcaption></figure><p>Others such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<a id="top_ref"></a>

<p>This post is about an important, but also scary, prompt injection discovery that leads to full system compromise of the developer’s machine in <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53773">GitHub Copilot and VS Code</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It is achieved by placing Copilot into YOLO mode by modifying the project’s <code>settings.json</code> file.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/episode12-yt.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/episode12-yt.png" alt="vscode episode 18"></a></p>
<p>As described a few days ago with <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/amp-agents-that-modify-system-configuration-and-escape/">Amp</a>, a vulnerability pattern in agents that might be overlooked is that if an agent can write to files and modify its own configuration or update security-relevant settings it can lead to remote code execution. This is not uncommon and is an area to always look for when performing a security review.</p>
<h2 id="background-research">Background Research</h2>
<p>When looking at VS Code and GitHub Copilot Agent Mode I noticed a strange behavior… it can create and write to files in the workspace without user approval.</p>
<p>The edits are immediately persistent, they are not in-memory as a diff to review. The modifications are written to disk right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/agents-that-can.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/agents-that-can.png" alt="vscode agents that can modify their own settings"></a></p>
<p>It’s one of these things that as a red teamer you know is probably not good… so I was looking if this could be used to escalate privileges and execute code.</p>
<h3 id="yolo-mode"><strong>YOLO Mode</strong></h3>
<p>So, next I researched features in VS Code that depend on settings that are within the project/workspace folder, and quickly found an interesting one.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/vscode-documentation-settings-json.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/vscode-documentation-settings-json.png" alt="vscode-exp-yolo-mode"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that in the <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> file one can add the following line:</p>
<p><code>"chat.tools.autoApprove": true</code></p>
<p><strong>This will put GitHub Copilot in YOLO mode.</strong></p>
<p>And it disables all user confirmations, and we can run shell commands, browse the web, and more!</p>
<p>What is interesting is that this is an experimental feature, but it is still present by default. I did not download a special version or set my VS Code overall into an experimental mode.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it works on Windows, macOS and also Linux.</p>
<h2 id="exploit-chain-explained">Exploit Chain Explained</h2>
<p>The proof-of-concept exploit chain to hijack Copilot and escalate privileges is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attack starts with a prompt injection planted in a source code file, web page, GitHub issue, tool call response, or other content… The payload can also use invisible text as instructions.</li>
<li>The prompt injection first adds the line <strong>“chat.tools.autoApprove”: true,</strong> to the <code>~/.vscode/settings.json</code> file. Folder and file will be created if they don’t exist yet.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot immediately enters YOLO mode!</strong></li>
<li>Attack runs a Terminal command. <strong>And using conditional prompt injection we can actually target what to run based on the operating system.</strong></li>
<li>We achieved Remote Code Execution powered by Prompt Injection.</li>

<p>Here is a screenshot that shows the demo file with the prompt injection, the developer interacting with the file on the right side in the chat box, and the calculator popping up!</p>

<p>Of course any other means of prompt injection delivery, like web or data coming back from an MCP server is an attack angle. I just used it inside the source code file because it’s easiest to test with.</p>

<p>Here is a longer form video explaining the discovery and exploit in detail:</p>

</p>


  

<p><strong>AI that can set its own permissions and configuration settings is wild!</strong></p>
<h2 id="joining-the-workstation-to-a-botnet---zombais">Joining the Workstation to a Botnet - ZombAIs</h2>
<p>Of course, this means we can join the developer’s machine to a botnet as a <strong>ZombAI</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, for fun we can modified the <code>settings.json</code> file to switch VS Code into a <code>Red</code> color scheme and similar things.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end here though! This also means we can build an actual AI virus that attaches to files and propagates as developers download and interact with infected files.</p>
<p>Last but not least, to demonstrate that we have full control of the developer’s host, we show that Copilot can be hijacked to download malware, and join a remote command and control server.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/github-agent-e2e-zombai.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/github-agent-e2e-zombai.png" alt="vscode-zombai-deployment"></a></p>
<p>This means the door is open for malware, ransomware, info stealers, etc.</p>
<p>Scary stuff.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-ai-virus">Building an AI Virus</h2>
<p>When seeing this, one will notice that this basically allows the creation of a virus. An attacker can embed instructions and once they gain code execution, additional malware can compromise other Git projects (and RAG sources) to embed the malicious instructions, and commit the changes or even force push them upstream.</p>
<p>This can lead to further spread as other developers unknowingly propagate the infected code.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we also need to talk about invisible instructions!</strong></p>
<h2 id="using-invisible-instructions">Using Invisible Instructions</h2>
<p>One might say that it would be quickly discovered if instructions are embedded as comments. So in order to make it a bit more interesting, I went ahead and created an invisible payload that achieves the attack chain, but is not visible to users. This was not as reliable, but it still worked:</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqW3eL8RpQc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


  

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the demo here with invisible instructions worked multiple times for me, using invisible instructions often leads to the exploit being very unreliable, and is also commonly also refused by the model and there is also typically a visual indicator that VS Code shows about Unicode characters. However, attacks (and models) get better over time. It’s also worth highlighting that not all models are vulnerable to such invisible prompt injection attacks.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations-and-fix">Recommendations and Fix</h2>
<p>There are actually more attack angles then just the YOLO mode example I shared. When Microsoft asked me if there is any more info I have, I had looked a bit more and noticed there are other problematic places, for instance <code>.vscode/tasks.json</code> that the AI can write to, or adding fake malicious MCP servers, etc which can lead to code execution. And the AI can reconfigure the user interface and configuration settings of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Recently I noticed that developers often use multiple agents, so there is also the threat of overwriting other agent configuration files (allow-list bash commands, add MCP servers…), as they are commonly in the project folder as well.</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, the AI would not be able to modify files without a human first approving it. Many other editors do show the diff, which then can be approved by the developer.</p>
<h2 id="responsible-disclosure">Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>After reporting the vulnerability on June 29, 2025 Microsoft confirmed the repro and asked a few follow up questions. A few weeks later MSRC pointed out that it is an issue they were already tracking, and that it will be patched by August. With the August Patch Tuesday release this is now fixed.</p>
<p>Shout out to <a href="https://x.com/marver">Markus Vervier</a> from <a href="https://persistent-security.net/">Persistent Security </a> who has also identified and reported this vulnerability to Microsoft. You can find their write-up <a href="https://www.persistent-security.net/post/part-iii-vscode-copilot-wormable-command-execution-via-prompt-injection">here</a>. And also a shout out to <a href="https://x.com/Ari_MaccariTA">Ari Marzuk</a> who seems to also have discovered it in parallel.</p>
<p>Thanks to the members of the MSRC and product team for the help in getting it mitigated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is another example of how an AI agent might not stay in its box! By modifying its own environment GitHub Copilot can escalate privileges and execute code to compromise the developer’s machine. It’s a not uncommon design flaw in agentic systems as I have discovered.</p>
<p>Keep looking out for such design flaws, these should be easily caught during threat modeling.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://theconversation.com/in-1776-thomas-paine-made-the-best-case-for-fighting-kings-and-for-being-skeptical-266448">https://theconversation.com/in-1776-thomas-paine-made-the-best-case-for-fighting-kings-and-for-being-skeptical-266448</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45559567">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMIoqZOO5sF/?hl=en">rejects all political commentary</a> that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?” </p>

<p>For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it. </p>

<p>“What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.</p>

<p>The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.lifeofthomaspain00lint/?st=gallery">one of America’s founders</a>, laughing louder than anybody. </p>

<p>That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/16/the-sharpened-quill">titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself</a>. </p>

<p>If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. </p>

<p>Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/american-enlightenment-thought/">underrated American pastime</a>, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” </p>

<p>I could go on. Because he did. </p>

<h2>Birth of a revolutionary</h2>

<p>Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine">small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737</a>. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, <a href="https://www.laits.utexas.edu/gov310/CF/Paine_Sense/index.html">met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London</a>, sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical.  </p>

<p>Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery">renounced, repudiated and ridiculed</a> at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. <a href="https://archive.org/details/PaineRightsOfMan/mode/2up">Hereditary privilege, colonialism</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.ageofreason00pain_0/?st=gallery">the supernatural</a>: no, no, no. </p>

<p>But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery">were kings</a>. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. </p>

<p>“<a href="https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1776ThomasPaine.pdf">Common Sense,” his first major work</a>, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.  </p>

<h2>‘Simple facts, plain arguments’</h2>

<p>Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings? </p>

<p>The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence.</p>

<p>This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s hard to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it. </p>

<p>Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” </p>

<p>Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. </p>

<p>“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.</p>

<h2>Bring the Paine</h2>

<p>The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.</p>

<p>This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. </p>

<p>But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.</p>

<p>“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” </p>

<p><a href="https://www.govexec.com/transition/2025/04/project-2025-wanted-hobble-federal-workforce-doge-has-hastily-done-and-more/404390/">Federal worker firings</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006">court settlements</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-91413/government-shutdown-2025">a government shutdown</a>. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.</p>

<p>Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. </p>

<p>This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. </p>

<p>The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.   </p>

<p>Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”</p>
