			<p>Venture capital is screwed. A bubble in AI is their last hope, and they’re betting everything on Sam Altman. It’s heartwarming.</p>
<p>Today, we have the Pitchbook-NVCA Venture Monitor for Q1 2025. This is the National Venture Capital Association telling its members how things are going. It’s the view of VC from the inside. The front cover picture is the light at the end of the tunnel — and it’s an oncoming streetcar. [<a href="https://nvca.org/pitchbook-nvca-venture-monitor/"><i>NVCA</i></a><i>; </i><a href="https://nvca.org/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_viewer&amp;file=https%3A%2F%2Fnvca.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F04%2FQ1-2025-PitchBook-NVCA-Venture-Monitor-19001.pdf#key=dGhlbWVNb2RlPWN1c3RvbSZ0b29sYmFyPXRydWUmbGF6eUxvYWQ9ZmFsc2UmcG9zaXRpb249dG9wJnByZXNlbnRhdGlvbj10cnVlJmRvd25sb2FkPXRydWUmY29weV90ZXh0PXRydWUmYWRkX3RleHQ9dHJ1ZSZkcmF3PXRydWUmZG9jX3JvdGF0aW9uPXRydWUmYWRkX2ltYWdlPXRydWUmZG9jX2RldGFpbHM9dHJ1ZSZzZWxlY3Rpb25fdG9vbD0wJnNjcm9sbGluZz0tMSZzcHJlYWRzPS0xJnpvb21faW49dHJ1ZSZ6b29tX291dD10cnVlJmZpdF92aWV3PXRydWUmYm9va21hcms9dHJ1ZSZmbGlwYm9va190b29sYmFyX3Bvc2l0aW9uPWJvdHRvbSZjdXN0b21Db2xvcj0lMjMzMzMzMzM="><i>NVCA</i></a><i>, PDF</i>]</p>
<p>We covered the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/10/21/venture-capital-is-having-a-bad-time-and-ai-isnt-going-to-fix-it/">Q3 2024 report</a> last year. That one tried very hard to present bad news as okay news. The new report can’t even do that.</p>
<p>Here is the state of venture capital in early 2025:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">Venture capital is moribund except AI.</li>
<li aria-level="1">AI is moribund except OpenAI.</li>
<li aria-level="1">OpenAI is a weird scam that wants to burn money so fast it summons AI God.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Nobody can cash out.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report mostly blames venture’s woes on President Trump and his tariffs — but venture capital’s problems are systemic and you could see them coming since the zero-interest-rate era.</p>
<p>And they have <i>no idea</i> how to fix this. None at all. The report’s <i>only</i> plan for the future is to cross their fingers and hope.</p>

<h3>Trump’s tariffs have trashed everything</h3>
<p>The Trump economic disaster is the most important material fact for the venture capital sphere. The report goes on and on about the tariffs.</p>
<p>Here’s the first paragraph of the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>With uncertainty dominating US financial markets throughout the first quarter, our prior expectation that 2025 would see a resurgence in venture capital (VC) liquidity and dealmaking has been dimmed. Should the latest iteration of tariffs stand, we expect significant pressure on fundraising and dealmaking in the near term as investors sit on the sidelines and wait for signs of market stabilization.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is: nobody is doing deals because business can’t make plans past lunchtime.</p>
<p>The report somehow fails to mention the bit where the Silicon Valley VC and executive crowd worked their backsides off to elect Trump and several of them sat in the front row at his inauguration. Then they were actually surprised when the leopard ate their faces too.</p>

<h3>The end of zero interest</h3>
<p>VC is hilariously unable to cope with not being in a zero-interest-rate environment.</p>
<p>In 2008, the global financial crisis hit. Central banks use interest rates as the brakes on an economy, so they took the brakes off to make sure money kept flowing around. Interest rates went below 1%. And interest stayed near zero for over a decade. [<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS"><i>St Louis Fed</i></a>]</p>
<p>But zero interest meant that if you <i>had</i> to get returns — say, you’re a pension fund — then there weren’t a lot of places to invest. Venture capital was one place you could put money and get returns.</p>
<p>This meant a flood of money into startups, and that meant all sorts of ridiculous startups got funding. Businesses that lost money on every transaction. SoftBank was setting money on fire as fast as possible, ending in the disaster of WeWork.</p>
<p>Borrowing money was almost free as well. Why not load up on debt?</p>
<p>But then inflation came along, and the Fed put interest rates back up — and suddenly there was less money. Why put money into venture capital when you could get back 5% just buying Treasury bills?</p>
<p>Venture capitalists were around before 2008 — including a lot of the current guys! — but it’s like they completely forgot how to do anything without free money. The party’s over, and now it’s time for the hangover.</p>
<p>So we get hyped up tech bubbles praying for lottery-level returns — because ordinary business returns from, say, making a thing and selling it don’t cut it. Our present hype-fueled AI bubble is a complete worked example.</p>
<h3>Everything is OpenAI</h3>
<p>This year, the investors are all-in on AI. Crypto’s still dead, quantum isn’t taking off — AI’s the last game in the casino. [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/23/here-are-the-19-us-ai-startups-that-have-raised-100m-or-more-in-2025/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>]</p>
<p>There’s lots of graphs in this report showing healthy dollar amounts. These are mostly the <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/04/02/openai-signs-its-40-billion-deal-with-softbank-or-maybe-30-billion-probably/">“$40 billion” OpenAI deal led by Softbank</a>, and then the other AI startup deals. Almost all the graphs and statistics in this report are lies based on the one huge OpenAI outlier.</p>
<p>Andreessen Horowitz is right now <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/04/10/a16z-raising-fresh-20b-for-ai-bubble-investments/">raising a fresh $20 billion investment fund</a> to try to keep the AI bubble going.</p>
<p>VCs still believe the marketing brochure version of AI, because they don’t actually know anything about technology:</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as “internet” evolved from buzzword to business backbone, AI is following the same playbook.</p></blockquote>
<p>No it isn’t! A completely different thing taking off and working says nothing about whether your personal favourite thing will take off and work! Stop saying dumb things!</p>
<p>Pitchbook says: “57.9% of global VC dollars invested in Q1 went to AI and machine learning startups.” Most of that’s OpenAI. Even Pitchbook calls it “FOMO” — fear of missing out. [<a href="https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/ai-startups-57-9-percent-global-venture-dollars-fear-of-missing-out-drives-up-dealmaking-q1-2025"><i>Pitchbook</i></a>]</p>
<p>AI is the only prospect for a lottery-level win. You and I know that’s not going to happen, but the VCs and their customers, the investors, do not know that. They’re still in. Where else are they gonna go?</p>
<h3>Everything that isn’t AI is moribund</h3>
<p>There’s a world of startups outside AI, and in 2025, they’re not having fun. Investors do not want to put money into early-stage startups with nothing to show as yet:</p>
<blockquote><p>First-time financing activity remains low, reflecting broader trends across the VC industry. In Q1, we recorded $3.8 billion invested across 892 deals, which was down both QoQ and YoY.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>… Only $10 billion was raised across 87 VC funds, setting a pace for the lowest year of fundraising in a decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Early-stage firms that do get venture funding tend to get acquired early on, instead of doing more rounds to pump their imaginary value number first.</p>
<p>Even when a fund gets investors, it can hardly find anywhere to put the money. One VC firm, Charles River Ventures, returned $275 million of uncommitted capital to its investors. And wasn’t that a shock to the world of VC. [<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/technology/crv-vc-fund-returning-money.html"><i>NYT</i></a><i>, </i><a href="https://archive.is/YiiDi"><i>archive</i></a>]</p>
<h3>Number must go up</h3>
<p>These companies have mostly imaginary valuations — say they pay $10 million to get 1% of a company, that makes the company worth a billion dollars, right? And not the ten million of actual money it’s got.</p>
<p>The VCs jealously guard these imaginary valuations as big fat book entries they can trade with each other. Just don’t ever look inside the box, don’t test what the market with actual dollars thinks the value is.</p>
<p>A pile of startups just ran out of cash and died in 2024 — more than in 2023. And 2025 is expected to be even worse. [<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/26/2025-will-likely-be-another-brutal-year-of-failed-startups-data-suggests/"><i>TechCrunch</i></a>]</p>
<p>A lot of these were frankly trash companies funded a few years ago, and they should have died then. But VC still had the startups’ imaginary values on their books and they didn’t want to admit the startups were worthless until they were forced to.</p>
<h3>Nobody can cash out</h3>
<p>AI is the only thing that’s catching the eye of the investors. The investors don’t want to put their money into other areas because they’re just not getting payouts.</p>
<p>Here’s the simple version of venture capital investing:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1">A VC firm starts a fund.</li>
<li aria-level="1">Big investors — pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, super-rich family offices — put money into the fund.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The VC firm puts the money into startups that will progress to an exit — an initial public offering or a bigger company buying them out.</li>
<li aria-level="1">The investors get paid. Hooray!</li>
</ul>
<p>Most startups fail, but one big winner can make up for a pile of losers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the stock market is broken — the Trump tariffs again — so IPOs are not popping on launch, so they’re not happening.</p>
<p>CoreWeave, riding the AI buzz for all it was worth, was the big public exit in first quarter 2025, and that one fell flat because their numbers were objectively terrible and their business plan doesn’t work. Ed Zitron has covered CoreWeave at length. But even with all that, CoreWeave on its own was 40% of all first quarter exits by value. [<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/core-incompetency/"><i>Where’s Your Ed At</i></a>]</p>
<p>The other big exit was Wiz Security getting bought by Google. But as the report says, “the rest of the exit market has remained relatively silent.”</p>
<p>Funding rounds are increasingly late-stage — that is, VCs are mostly putting extra money into existing companies, often just to keep them on life support.</p>
<p>Many of these later funding rounds also have secondary sales — where startup employees get to sell some equity to the new investors. Because then the talent might not give up and quit to work at a non-zombie. And the old investors get some money back from a company that’s not doing anything.</p>
<h3>The future of venture capital</h3>
<p>The report’s theme for the future is: hope really hard! Maybe markets will recover and IPOs will pop again. Maybe Trump will come up with a coherent plan and stop being volatile and weird. Maybe!</p>
<p>That’s it. That’s all the plan they have. These guys haven’t got a clue what to do next. They really don’t. This is the industry talking to itself and saying “well gosh, chaps, looks like we’re screwed.”</p>
<p>It’s important to note something else here: quite a lot of the venture capital class are not actually so bright. But they got lucky once.</p>
<p>That’s a big thing to say. They’re way more rich and successful than <i>you</i>, David. These are intelligent and educated people, they were definitely good at something! A lot of them have Ph.D.s!</p>
<p>But also, it’s horribly clear that right now they’re way out of their depth. Semafor documented last week how these guys enthusiastically joined a long-running billionaire group chat with literal neo-Nazis as their court philosophers. <a href="https://pivot-to-ai.com/2024/12/01/does-ai-startup-extropic-actually-do-anything/">Marc Andreessen got into e/acc</a> — which is literally a neo-Fascist revival movement. [<a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/04/27/2025/the-group-chats-that-changed-america"><i>Semafor</i></a>]</p>
<p>This is not smart behaviour! This is dumbass behaviour!</p>
<p>These are not people who can be trusted with dangerous machinery such as billions of dollars. They were lucky as hell, and now they’re not.</p>
<p>The <i>only</i> future plan in this report is: maybe Trump will stop acting like a bizarre freak. They’ve met the guy and they think that’s a plan!</p>
<p>Maybe they can start a bubble in guillotines. [<a href="https://furs.social/@Rycochet/114440592779018690"><i>Mastodon</i></a>]</p>
<p>Not that anything unpleasant should happen to them. None of the VC class will ever miss a meal. But you can feel a small amount of schadenfreude at their mild discomfort, while everything burns around the rest of us.</p>

      <h2 id="the-epochalypse-project">The Epochalypse Project</h2>
<h2 id="the-32-bit-timestamp-vulnerability-our-digital-time-bomb">The 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability: Our Digital Time Bomb</h2>

<p><strong>On 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, millions of sensitive embedded and industrial computer systems worldwide will suddenly start behaving in unpredictable ways, unless we take coordinated action now. And what’s worse, with unsecured time protocols, attackers don’t need to wait until 2038.</strong></p>

<p>This is not science fiction. It’s a real technical vulnerability affecting systems we rely on daily—from hospital equipment to power grids, from banking systems to transportation networks. This vulnerability is embedded in the fundamental architecture of our digital infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-you-care">Why Should You Care?</h2>

<p>Without proper preparation, we will face widespread disruptions including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hospital equipment displaying incorrect medication times</li>
  <li>Banking systems failing to process payments</li>
  <li>Traffic control systems malfunctioning</li>
  <li>Power grid instabilities causing outages</li>
  <li>Internet service disruptions</li>
  <li>Security systems generating false alarms</li>
</ul>

<p>In our interconnected world, these technical failures could have cascading effects. Critical system failures can endanger lives, disrupt economies, and compromise essential services. <strong>And what’s worse, malicious threat actors can manipulate time synchronization protocols in many cases to trigger this vulnerability at the time of their choosing.</strong> This is particularly concerning given how little attention many networks pay to their Network Time Protocol (NTP) security.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-32-bit-timestamp-vulnerability">Understanding the 32-bit Timestamp Vulnerability</h2>

<p>Many computer systems track time using a 32-bit signed integer that counts seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z (known as “Unix time”). This approach has a mathematical limitation: when this counter reaches its maximum value on 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC, affected systems will roll over to negative numbers, causing them to interpret the date as 1901-12-13T20:45:52Z.</p>

<p>This vulnerability exists in:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Legacy systems running critical infrastructure</li>
  <li>Embedded devices in industrial settings</li>
  <li>Internet of Things (IoT) devices</li>
  <li>Transportation and energy management systems</li>
  <li>Medical equipment</li>
  <li>Financial transaction processors</li>
  <li>Telecommunications infrastructure</li>
  <li>Millions of “smart” devices in homes and businesses worldwide</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-scale-is-unprecedented">The Scale Is Unprecedented</h2>

<p>The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability is definitively more severe than Y2K for several critical reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Massive Scale</strong>: There are now hundreds of times more vulnerable systems than existed during Y2K. For the last 30 years, simple controller computers have been embedded into virtually everything that moves or connects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embedded Nature</strong>: Unlike Y2K, which primarily affected visible software that could be patched, today’s vulnerability exists in countless embedded systems that cannot be easily updated. Many are physically inaccessible, buried in infrastructure or sealed in hardware.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Increased Dependence</strong>: Our society’s dependence on digital infrastructure has increased dramatically since 2000. Critical systems from healthcare to transportation now rely entirely on accurate timestamps for basic operations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Security Implications</strong>: The near-universal connectivity of today’s systems means time-related vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. Unsecured time protocols mean attackers could potentially trigger failures at will.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Less Visibility</strong>: Many vulnerable systems operate without user interfaces or monitoring capabilities, making detection of problems significantly harder than with Y2K.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="a-global-challenge">A Global Challenge</h2>

<p>Our digital infrastructure resembles an interconnected ecosystem. When individual components fail simultaneously, the entire system becomes vulnerable. Even if only 15-30% of critical systems fail, we will experience significant disruptions across multiple sectors.</p>

<p>The challenge is compounded by what economists call a “tragedy of the commons”—where responsibility is distributed but no single entity feels accountable for solving the shared problem. Organizations often assume:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Our systems represent only a small fraction of the infrastructure”</li>
  <li>“Other stakeholders will address the critical components”</li>
  <li>“Updating legacy systems offers minimal return on investment”</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the most concerning aspects involves security infrastructure. When system clocks suddenly jump backward, security certificates will become invalid across large portions of the internet, compromising our digital security framework.</p>

<h2 id="time-is-limited-action-is-required">Time is Limited, Action is Required</h2>

<p><strong>With approximately 12 years remaining until the critical date, we must prioritize our response.</strong></p>

<p>Our analysis indicates we cannot replace or update all vulnerable systems in time. Many embedded devices cannot be updated at all. However, through coordinated action, we can:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Identify and prioritize the most critical vulnerable systems</li>
  <li>Implement fixes where possible</li>
  <li>Develop contingency plans for systems that cannot be updated</li>
  <li>Establish global coordination to manage the transition</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>

<p>The Epochalypse Project was founded by Trey Darley (aka “treyka”) and Pedro Umbelino (aka “kripthor”), two cybersecurity researchers with extensive experience in vulnerability research and critical infrastructure protection.</p>

<p>Trey Darley has been working in IT since his teens, building a diverse career as a developer, sysadmin, network engineer, and cybersecurity specialist. His professional journey has included running IT for a major film production, foundational work in cyber threat intelligence, and serving in a load-bearing capacity at a national CERT during the COVID years. Trey also served on the FIRST.org board of directors, which took him around the world connecting with cybersecurity professionals.</p>

<p>Trey first became aware of the 2038 problem shortly after Y2K was addressed. Around 2016, he began jokingly referencing it in technical conference talks, saying “surely we’re going to fix all these security vulnerabilities before 2038 rolls around.” In 2023, he realized with alarm that 2038 is now closer to us than the 2008 financial crisis. While traveling globally in his FIRST.org role, Trey repeatedly asked knowledgeable contacts what was being done about the 2038 issue. He had assumed some government-sponsored technical group was addressing it, but discovered that no such master plan seems to exist.</p>

<p>Pedro Umbelino began his journey into technology at age 8, teaching himself to code BASIC on a Spectrum computer. By 14, he was decompiling computer viruses using A86/D86, sparked by a chance encounter with an Assembly language book at his local bookstore. Pedro’s career has spanned roles as a sysadmin, developer, and entrepreneur, but computer security remained his passion throughout. For the past decade, he’s focused exclusively on security research across various domains, discovering vulnerabilities in multiple systems along the way.</p>

<p>The Epochalypse Project began in 2024 after Pedro attended Trey’s lightning talk at the hack.lu conference. Pedro had just presented “Blowing up Gas Stations for Fun and Profit,” emphasizing the dangers of exposed industrial systems, when Trey’s message about the looming 2038 problem struck him. Realizing that 2038 was closer than Y2K had been when preparations began, Pedro ran tests on a device and discovered fundamental vulnerabilities. He immediately reached out to Trey, and they decided to start this project together.</p>

<p>This initiative is a side effort driven by their shared concern about a critical vulnerability that isn’t receiving adequate attention. As Trey puts it, “As it seems nobody has a master game plan, it’s up to us to organize and take some coordinated action.” Together, they bring complementary skills in technical research, vulnerability assessment, and public awareness campaigns—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.</p>

<p>The Epochalypse Project builds on their combined experience in coordinating responses to widespread vulnerabilities—applying lessons learned from previous global technical challenges while addressing the unique aspects of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="the-epochalypse-project-mission">The Epochalypse Project Mission</h2>

<p>We are building a collaborative global initiative to address the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standardized testing methodologies</li>
  <li>Documentation of system vulnerabilities</li>
  <li>Development of remediation strategies</li>
  <li>Knowledge sharing across sectors and borders</li>
</ul>

<p>Your participation matters—whether you’re a technical expert or simply someone with a smartphone. Every test you run helps us map vulnerabilities, and every solution you share can safeguard countless systems.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-requires-urgent-global-attention">Why This Requires Urgent Global Attention</h2>

<p>The 32-bit timestamp vulnerability has received insufficient attention despite being demonstrably more severe than Y2K. The technology industry has been aware of this issue since the 1990s, yet coordinated remediation efforts remain limited. <strong>People aren’t taking action right now, and this must change immediately.</strong> The delay in addressing this vulnerability is not just concerning—it’s potentially catastrophic.</p>

<p><strong>You can be part of the solution.</strong></p>

<p>The following sections outline how people in different roles can contribute to this critical effort.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="how-you-can-help">How You Can Help</h2>

<h3 id="safety-guidelines-for-testing">Safety Guidelines for Testing</h3>

<p><strong>Important: Follow these safety precautions when testing for 32-bit timestamp vulnerabilities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Only test systems you own or have explicit permission to test</li>
  <li>Never test production systems or critical infrastructure</li>
  <li>Back up all important data before testing</li>
  <li>Physically isolate systems with modified dates</li>
  <li>Prevent test time signals from affecting other systems</li>
  <li>Return systems to the correct date after testing</li>
  <li>Document all observations, even seemingly minor ones</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-general-public">For General Public</h3>

<p>Even without technical expertise, you can make valuable contributions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test your personal smart devices by changing their dates to 2038-01-19 03:14:08 UTC (the “zero hour” of the 32-bit timestamp vulnerability)</li>
  <li>Document any errors or unusual behaviors you observe</li>

  <h2 id="one-click-rce-in-asuss-preinstalled-driver-software">One-Click RCE in ASUS’s Preinstalled Driver Software</h2>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This story begins with a conversation about new PC parts.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/dms.avif" alt="dms.avif"></p>
<p>After ignoring the advice from my friend, I bought a new ASUS motherboard for my PC. I was a little concerned about having a BIOS that would by default silently install software into my OS in the background. But it could be turned off so I figured I would just do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/bios.avif" alt="bios.avif"></p>
<p>Immediately after logging into Windows I was hit with a notification requesting admin permissions to complete the installation of ASUS DriverHub, because I forgot to change the BIOS option. Since I needed to get a WiFi driver for the motherboard anyway, I got curious and installed it.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/admin_prompt.avif" alt="admin_prompt.avif"></p>
<p><em>I don’t have a screenshot of DriverHub but it showed a popup exactly like this in the bottom-right of my screen</em></p>
<h2 id="driverhub">DriverHub</h2>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/driverhub_ui.avif" alt="driverhub_ui.avif"></p>
<p>DriverHub is an interesting piece of driver software because it doesn’t have any GUI. Instead it’s just a background process that communicates with the website <a href="https://driverhub.asus.com/">driverhub.asus.com</a> and tells you what drivers to install for your system and which ones need updating. Naturally I wanted to know more about how this website knew what drivers my system needed and how it was installing them, so I cracked open the Firefox network tab.</p>
<p>As I expected, the website uses RPC to talk to the background process running on my system. This is where the background process hosts an HTTP or Websocket service locally which a website or service can connect to by sending an API request to <code>127.0.0.1</code> on a predefined port, in this case <code>53000</code>.</p>
<p>Right about now my elite hacker senses started tingling.</p>
<p><img src="https://media1.tenor.com/m/9Z4aF3ksVH0AAAAd/joey-gibson.gif" alt="joey-gibson.gif"></p>
<p>This is a very sketchy way to design driver management software. If the RPC isn’t properly secured, it could be weaponized by an attacker to install malicious applications.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-vulnerability">Finding the Vulnerability</h2>
<p>The next step was to see if I could call the RPC from any website, this was replicated by copying the request from my browser as a curl command and pasting it into my terminal.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/copyascurl.avif" alt="copyascurl.avif"></p>
<p>After fiddling with variations of the command for a while my assumptions were confirmed. DriverHub only responded to requests with the origin header set to “driverhub.asus.com”. So at least this software wasn’t completely busted and evil hackers can’t just send requests to DriverHub willy-nilly.</p>
<p>However I wasn’t done yet, presumably the program checks if the origin is <code>driverhub.asus.hub</code> and if so it’d accept RPC request. What I did next was see if the program did a direct comparison like <code>origin == driverhub.asus.hub</code> or if it was a wildcard match such as <code>origin.includes("driverhub.asus.com")</code>.</p>
<p>When I switched the origin to <code>driverhub.asus.com.mrbruh.com</code>, <strong>it allowed my request.</strong></p>
<p>It was obvious now there was a serious threat. The next step was to determine how much damage was possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-extent-of-the-damage">The Extent of the Damage</h2>
<p>By trawling through the Javascript on the website, and about 700k lines of decompiled code that the exe produced, I managed to create a list of callable endpoints including some unused ones sitting in the exe.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Initialize</strong>
This command is used by the website to check if the software is installed and returns basic installation information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>DeviceInfo</strong>
This returns all installed ASUS’s software, all installed .sys drivers, all your hardware components, and your MAC address.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reboot</strong>
This reboots the target device immediately without confirmation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<video width="100%" controls="">
    <source src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/reboot_poc.mp4">
    Your browser does not support the video lmao
</video>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Log</strong>
This returns a zipped copy of all of DriverHub’s logs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>InstallApp</strong>
This installs an app or driver by its ID. The ID’s for all the apps are hard coded in an XML file which is provided by the DriverHub installer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UpdateApp</strong>
This self-updates DriverHub using a provided file URL to download and run.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="achieving-rce">Achieving RCE</h2>
<p>I became fixated on the UpdateApp endpoint for obvious reasons. So I spent a few hours exploring the code in ghidra and hitting it with various curl requests to learn the intricacies of how it behaves.</p>
<p>A request to the endpoint looks like this:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>curl <span>"http://127.0.0.1:53000/asus/v1.0/UpdateApp"</span> -X POST --data-raw <span>'{"List": [{"Url": "https://driverhub.asus.com/&lt;app.exe&gt;"}]}'</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Here were the observations I had made about the UpdateApp function at that point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Url” parameter must contain “.asus.com” but unlike the RPC origin check, it allows stupidity like <code>example.com/payload.exe?foo=.asus.com</code></li>
<li>It saves the file with the filename specified at the end of the URL.</li>
<li>Any file with any extension can be downloaded</li>
<li>If the file is an executable signed by ASUS it will be automatically executed with admin permissions</li>
<li>It will run <em>any</em> executable signed by ASUS, not just a DriverHub installer.</li>
<li><strong>If a downloaded file fails the signing check, it does not get deleted.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When I learned that DriverHub validates the signature of the executable I suspected an RCE may no longer be possible, however I soldiered on regardless.</p>
<p>My first thought was potentially a <em>timing attack</em>, where I tell DriverHub to install a valid executable, and after it validates the signature, but just before it installs the exe, I swap it out with a malicious executable. I theorized this could be possible by making two UpdateApp requests in parallel, with the malicious update being just after the legitimate one.</p>
<p>However timing attacks need to be extremely precise and having that timing being affected by files needing to be downloaded made it a very unreliable option. Given that, I decided to take a step back and think if there were any other options.</p>
<p>Eventually I was led back to the standalone WiFi driver I was going to install all along. The driver was distributed in the following zip file.</p>
<p><img src="https://mrbruh.com/asusdriverhub/zip_contents.avif" alt="Zip Contents"></p>
<p>The files of importance here are the <code>AsusSetup.exe</code>, <code>AsusSetup.ini</code> and <code>SilentInstall.cmd</code>. When executing AsusSetup.exe it first reads from AsusSetup.ini, which contains metadata about the driver. I took interest in a property in the file: <code>SilentInstallRun</code>.</p>
<p>When you double-click AsusSetup.exe it launches a simple gui installer thingy. But if you run AsusSetup.exe with the <code>-s</code> flag (DriverHub calls it using this to do a silent install), it will execute <em>whatever’s</em> specified in SilentInstallRun. In this case the ini file specifies a cmd script that performs an automated headless install of the driver, <strong>but it could run anything</strong>.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="assessing-the-damage">Assessing the Damage</h2>
<p>Almost immediately after reporting the RCE to ASUS I wrote a script to track <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">certificate transparency</a> updates on my VPS, so I could see if anyone else had a domain with <code>driverhub.asus.com.*</code> registered. From looking at other websites certificate transparency logs, I could see that domains and subdomains would appear in the logs usually within a month.</p>
<p>After a month of waiting I am happy to say that my test domain is the only website that fits the regex, meaning <strong>it is unlikely that this was being actively exploited</strong> prior to my reporting of it.</p>
<h2 id="bug-bounty">Bug Bounty</h2>
<p>I asked ASUS if they offered bug bounties. They responded saying they do not, but they would instead put my name in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asus.com/content/asus-product-security-advisory/#header2025">“hall of fame”</a>. This is understandable since ASUS is just a&nbsp;<a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/asus/marketcap/">small startup</a> and likely does not have the capital to pay a bounty.</p>
<h2 id="fun-notes">Fun Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When submitting the vulnerability report through ASUS’s <a href="https://www.asus.com/securityadvisory/">Security Advisory form</a>, Amazon CloudFront <strong>flagged the attached PoC as a malicious request</strong> and blocked the submission. So I had to strip out some of the PoC code and link video recordings instead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you click “Install All” in DriverHub instead of manually clicking install on each recommended driver, it will also install ArmouryCrate, ASUS’s custom CPU-Z, Norton360 and WinRAR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their CVE description for the RCE is a little misleading. They say <em>“This issue is limited to motherboards and does not affect laptops, desktop computers”</em>, however this affects any computer including desktops/laptops that have DriverHub installed. Also, instead of them saying it allows for arbitrary/remote code execution they say it <em>“may allow untrusted sources to affect system behaviour”</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>MY ONBOARD WIFI STILL DOESN’T WORK</strong>, I had to buy an external USB WiFi adapter. Thanks for nothing DriverHub.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>ASUS laptops generally have a feature that lets the user toggle the fan speed. Fn-F5 on some models, Fn-F on others. The direct effect is to limit the fan speed, from whisper mode to megablast, and indirectly control performance. But it doesn’t work in OpenBSD, so I needed to write an ASUS ACPI WMI driver.</p><h3 id="acpi">acpi</h3><p>ACPI is a hardware abstraction layer that lets the computer tell the operating system how to do things. It provides functions in byte code which the OS interprets to perform certain tasks. So instead of having to write a driver for every CPU, you call the ACPI method _PSS and that tells you what to do.</p><p>Of course, vendors want to include functionality that isn’t defined in the standard, so they add some extra methods, and then you end up writing some custom drivers anyway, for the little buttons that turn the microphone on and off, etc. OpenBSD (and other OSs) have lots of little drivers for ThinkPads and whatnot.</p><p>ACPI method names are only four letters long, so what do we do if two vendors include a method called WMNB and how do we determine what it does? (Technically, the ACPI nodes are identified by seven letter names, and the methods live under them, so it’s not really a problem, but somebody got paid to make a solution anyway.)</p><h3 id="wmi">wmi</h3><p>The solution is an extension to ACPI called WMI, which stands for Windows Multiplies Irritations or something. You ask ACPI for a buffer called _WDG, and this contains a table mapping GUIDs (globally unique, says so right there in the name) to local method names. Looking through this table, we come across <span>DCBA-FE-10-23-456789</span>, which we recognize as a GUID of interest, and this tells us the method to call is WMNB, but now we know it’s the right one.</p><p>OpenBSD does not have a WMI driver, which is part of what I need to set the fan profile. There is a WMI driver in Linux, and it includes an ASUS support driver for a variety of functions I’m interested in.</p><h3 id="first-steps">first steps</h3><p>First, I wrote a little acpi driver that attaches to PNP0C14. Read the _WDG buffer and print out all the GUIDs. Didn’t recognize any of the values, then realized I got the byte order wrong. Fixed that, saw something very close, realized I still didn’t get the byte order quite right. GUIDs are not big endian, they are not little endian, they are Goldilocks endian.</p><p>With that sorted out, I was able to enable events and get a printf every time I pushed a hotkey.</p><h3 id="events">events</h3><p>After receiving an interrupt and landing in our callback, we need to identify which event just happened by calling _WED. I did this, but was only getting 1 in response every time, regardless of key. I was a little stuck here. Very close to getting what I wanted, but without much clue as to what went wrong.</p><p>Turns out you can just look at your system’s ACPI code. OpenBSD runs <i>acpidump</i> at boot and saves all the files. Copy them to a work directory, run <i>iasl -d</i>, and have a look. A quick grep for _WED reveals the source.</p><pre><code>            Method (_WED, 1, NotSerialized)
            {   
                If ((Arg0 == 0xFF))
                {
                    Return (GANQ ())
                }
     
                Return (One)
            }
            Method (GANQ, 0, Serialized)
            {
                P8XH (Zero, 0xF2)
                If (AQNO)
                {
                    AQNO--
                    Local0 = DerefOf (ATKQ [AQHI])
                    AQHI++ 
                    AQHI &amp;= 0x0F
                    Return (Local0)
                }

                Return (Ones)
            }</code></pre><p>Even without knowing anything at all about ASL, this looks like a function that dequeues an event, but only if called with an argument of 255. That was the bug! Once I called it with the correct argument, I started receiving different event codes for backlight toggle, fan toggle, AC attach, etc.</p><h3 id="devices">devices</h3><p>Wrote some more code to handle getting and setting device state. There’s a magic incantation to call an ACPI method and pass it a device id, which could be the keyboard backlight, or the wifi led, or the fan profile, etc. Started with the keyboard backlight, since this was pretty easy to observe.</p><p>After fixing a few simple bugs like reversing the device ids for fnlock and backlight, I was able to blink the keyboard light by pressing F7. It’s all coming together.</p><p>Toggling the fan profile didn’t seem to accomplish anything, though. Under Windows, there is an audible difference switching to whisper mode, but I didn’t observe any change.</p><p>The Linux driver includes code for at least three different fan and performance profile settings. The same driver is used for a wide range of laptops, from thin and lights to gaming fraggers. According to the Linux driver, you can detect which devices are present by reading their state, then checking for a high bit, and then getting the value by masking off some low bits. This seemed to indicate I had a fan boost device, but it wasn’t responding to my changes.</p><p>After printing out the raw values, I noticed they were all -2. That doesn’t seem very likely. But it definitely has a high bit set, and masking off the low bits made it look reasonable. I think I missed something in the Linux driver? There’s lots of shifts and masks in lots of places.</p><p>Back to the ACPI dump, the WMNB method is a giant switch statement that ends with  Return (0xFFFFFFFE). So sure enough, there’s the -2 for a missing device, but I still don’t know which device id I should be using.</p><p>Back to the Linux driver, there’s an epic norse define for  <span>ASUS_WMI_DEVID_THROTTLE_THERMAL_POLICY_VIVO</span> which I hadn’t yet integrated because I was testing on a Zenbook, not a Vivobook. Added a check anyway, rebooted, and that’s a bingo! The Linux define name is a lie. Confirmed by inspecting the ASL code.</p><pre><code>            If ((IIA0 == 0x00110019))
            {
                Return (FANL (IIA1))
            }</code></pre><p>Now I had all the pieces. After a bit of cleanup and refactoring, my driver is complete. Kinda. There’s still a bunch of sensors that would be interesting to read, but my immediate concern has been addressed.</p><h3 id="results">results</h3><p>Pressing Fn-F after boot drops the fan speed noticeably, from a medium whir to barely a whisper. This has only a moderate effect on ordinary performance. The processor’s power budget is reduced, but not its (single core) clock speeds, so everything still runs smoothly. Lengthy compiles are slower, but I can also switch back to megablast turbo mode with the tap of a button.</p><p>Battery life is also much better. The fan itself is obviously eating less power. I think the CPU also enters a somewhat lower power state in whisper mode, or it’s willing to sleep a little deeper. It’s not clear everything that changes, and it varies by machine, but that’s the beauty of it. I wrote the driver on an AMD Zenbook, but it works without changes on an Intel Vivobook. Very convenient.</p><h3 id="misc">misc</h3><p>I also looked at the FreeBSD driver. FreeBSD directly uses the <span>ACPICA</span> code interfaces, calling function like <code>AcpiEvaluateObject</code> which personally look kinda out of place in BSD driver code. Linux does too, but all the functions have been renamed to <code>acpi_evaluate_object</code>, so they resemble the local style. I’m not entirely sure of the history here, but I think the generic <span>ACPICA</span> was at some pointer extracted and generified from the Linux code. OpenBSD uses a custom AML interpreter, so we have functions like <code>aml_evalname</code>.</p><p>In OpenBSD, nearly all header files are kept with their C files. So both dsdt.c and dsdt.h live in dev/acpi. (Notable exception is core C files in kern and headers in sys.) As a first time acpi driver writer, it was very convenient that all the OpenBSD code I needed to reference, from sample drivers to data structures to helper functions, was all in one spot.</p><p>Linux separates things such that I was looking at C files in drivers/platform/x86 and header files in include/linux/platform_data/x86. And the ACPI code lives other places as well. It’s all very orderly, but at times it felt like navigating a grocery store that arranges products in alphabetical order. Logical, but not exactly cozy.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>I’ve left Google after working there for 19 years.</p>



<p>For most of that time I’ve been fortunate in being able to work on the <a href="https://go.dev/" data-type="link" data-id="https://go.dev/">Go programming language</a>. Go was started by Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, and Robert Griesemer in the fall of 2007. I joined the team in June, 2008, about the same time as Russ Cox. I’ve been very lucky to be able to work with such remarkable people on such an interesting project.</p>



<p>I am astonished at how much use Go has gotten over the years. Go has reached the status of being just another programming language, one that any programmer can choose when appropriate. That is far beyond what any of us expected in the early days, when our best hope was that Go might serve as an example for useful ideas that other languages and programming environments could adopt.</p>



<p>I started on Go by adding a Go frontend to the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC compiler</a>. The Go project already had a compiler, of course, based on the Inferno C compiler. Having two compilers helped ensure that the language was clearly defined. When the two compilers differed, we knew that we had to clarify the spec and figure out what the right behavior should be.</p>



<p>In general my self-appointed role on the Go team consisted of tracking everything I could about the project and looking for areas that needed help. Among other things in the earlier years I added Go support to Google’s internal build system, and to <a href="https://www.swig.org/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.swig.org/">the SWIG tool</a>. For a couple of years I was the team manager. From the first days of Go people asked for support for some sort of generics or type parameterization; working with Robert Griesemer I developed a series of language change proposals, and generics were added to the language in the <a href="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics" data-type="link" data-id="https://go.dev/blog/intro-generics">Go 1.18 release in 2022</a>.</p>



<p>My approach had its good points and its bad points. I was quick to see the problems that people were running into today, and the problems they would run into tomorrow, and I was often able to get those problems addressed. But I was slow to see the ideas that would help people do new things that they weren’t trying to do and thus weren’t missing, things such as the Go module proxy and the Go vulnerability database.</p>



<p>Overall I think my approach was a good one in helping to build a successful project. But Gooogle has changed, and Go has changed, and the overall computer programming environment has changed. It’s become clear over the last year or so that I am no longer a good fit for the Go project at Google. I have to move on.</p>



<p>I’m still interested in Go. I don’t think that the language is done. I don’t think that any programming language is ever done–the programming environment changes all the time, and languages must evolve or die. That is doubly true for a language like Go that comes equipped with a substantial standard library, one that must adapt to the new needs of programmers.</p>



<p>I will be taking a break for a while, but I hope to be able to contribute to Go again in the future.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Painting weddings for a few years now, I have spent a fair bit of time observing strangers move through a room. Seeing someone new, I always have a feeling of noticing their internal architecture. I did not realize that some people do not feel this way, at least not as intensely.&nbsp;</p><div><li><p>By internal architecture, what I mean is, when someone talks to me, what I notice first are the supporting beams propping up their words: the cadence and tone and desire behind them. I hear if they are bored, fascinated, wanting validation or connection. I often feel like I can hear how much they like themselves. </p></li><li><p>I hear the speed at which they metabolize information and the nature of their attention. Attention falls on the spectrum of jumping bean to steady stream. Where it falls depends on a person’s nature, and also how much they want to be in that conversation. Someone’s quality of attention is evident from the questions they ask (how much they diverge from what the speaker is saying), if their gaze is wandering elsewhere, if they are fidgeting, restless. The outlier is dissociation, when someone is noticeably vacant, their attention completely absent. </p></li><li><p> Sometimes I see their feelings towards me when we talk, but that has the largest room for error in retrospect. Maybe the person I have the hardest time seeing clearly is still myself. I can see people more clearly when I am watching them talk to others.</p></li><li><p>I watch the person with the loudest laugh. The most striking thing isn't the volume—it's the feverish pitch. As the night goes on, it begins to sound more like desperation. Their joy has a fraying quality; it is exhausting to carry because it comes with a desire to seem happy and make others happy at all times.</p></li><li><p>When someone is flirting: Flirting is marketing, revealing yourself at a specific angle to coax a certain response. People have different marketing strategies, but this is always true: there is energy that is snaking outward, trying to find a surface to grip on. It can feel intrusive when un-welcomed, and pleasurably intimate if welcomed. Some people flirt with everyone. Some people only flirt with people they find hot. Some people never flirt.  </p></li><li><p>It is easy to tell how happy someone is to see another person enter a conversation. There is happy, and there is polite, and they look very different. Polite has a mechanical quality to it, like carrying out all the right movements to replace batteries in a remote. Happy has a boundless quality: unpredictable, even when it is at a low level. There is an openness, allowing another person to surprise and delight them. The easiest way to say this: there is no script for happy. It tumbles out of the body. Polite comes from the mind –it is restrained and calculated – measured lines and pauses. There are reinforcing loops in a polite person and a happy person. A person closed to the possibility of delight finds less of it. A person open to it finds more. </p></li><li><p>When someone is close enough for me to hear them in conversation, I can hear how receptive they are to other people’s worlds. This is often encoded in the pace of their back and forth; the brief pause after someone says something, or the absence of any breathing room. The pause is usually sinking into a feeling, allowing themselves to process and respond in real time. </p></li><li><p>People who don't pause exist more in their head than their body. The mind is top-down, rigid, quick, enforcing an established view. The mind is waiting for the other person to be done so they can say what’s rattling around inside. The body is slower, needs more time, and then words bubble up organically, one after another, without planning. People who exist more in their body are generally better at connecting emotionally with others. </p></li><li><p>I can see how much someone accepts themselves by looking for intense distortions in the way they are interacting with the world. Find the range in how they treat people; if there is a split difference in their stance towards people they admire, and people they look down on. I never met a person who looked down on others and unconditionally accepted themselves. For people who are self-accepting, it is usually less the case that some people are treated like they are golden and others like they are cursed. They may still have preferences to engage with some people over others, but their baseline patience and goodwill does not fall and rise intensely. </p></li><li><p>There are people who hate the world, and people who love a very narrow understanding of it, and people who love the world unconditionally, in all lifetimes, in all understandings. People who love a narrow understanding of the world exhibit a settledness in their bones; they are satisfied and not reaching outward. But their dynamic range moving through a room, moving through conversations, is limited. Opposing ideas often cause them to disengage. It is a little sad to see this, all the possibilities they don't even know they are missing by keeping their world narrow. </p></li><li><p>It is easy to spot the person in the room who thinks they are better than everyone. It is the person uninterested in giving any of their attention, the genuine and open-ended kind, to anyone else. This is also painful to see, because they often cannot see their own misery, how unpleasant the world is if no one is good enough to be loved.</p></li><li><p>Some people don't like themselves. They hide this from themselves by thinking they don’t like other people. They often bristle like a porcupine any time someone gets too close. That, or the opposite: they need to be insulated by other people's skin at all times. These are contrasting expressions of the same fundamental fracture. A person cannot stand themselves, and as a result, they either can only stand being unperceived, or they need other people to constantly perceive them to feel okay. </p></li><li><p>Watching someone reach for shiny things — not necessarily  the reaching, but the amount of hunger tangled with it— reveals how attached they are to their sense of desire and pleasure.</p></li><li><p>Look for unfounded apologies if you want to see how much someone believes in their right to exist. Look at the way they walk through a room, the way their shoulders are caved in or opened outward in relation to their ribcage, the way their eyes move to take in their surroundings, to see how much they believe in their belonging.</p></li><li><p>When I meet someone, I usually get a sense of whether they are generally happy, having a sad day, or generally sad, having a happy day. The emotional history of their life is often etched in the muscle tension in their face and their posture. </p></li><li><p>Some people are more like closed fists, others are more like open palms. Many of the driven people I have met are closed fists: warm, charming, and ready to punch through a wall at any point in time. There is a rigidity, a tunnel vision that naturally follows grasping for certain outcomes. An open palm has an expansive, receptive quality. They may still be incredibly intense and engaged with the world, but they are fluid, not forceful, in nature. </p></li><li><p>You can tell how controlling someone is by how forceful they are in conversation, how often they cut someone else off or steer the conversation towards what they want. Sometimes it is hard to see someone as controlling when what they desire is making you feel special and chosen. </p></li><li><p>&nbsp;It is easy to see when someone has a widely felt gravitational pull. Just watch where eyes congregate and return in room. </p></li><li><p>I can see when two people are close in a way that blocks their energy from the rest of the world, insulated and intimate and barring others from entering. I can also see when two people are close in a way that supports each other in being more engaged with the world. I admire the couples who are able to inhabit both states: experiencing the kind of connection that doesn’t allow outside entry, and then turning outward and drawing people in together. </p></li><li><p>I can see how much trust exists between couples, based on how men and women interact with their preferred sex. It is easy to sense wariness, someone watching their partner's face as they talk to a beautiful stranger, tension carried in their forehead and jaw, scanning for threats. It is also easy to sense complete ease and safety. It is the orientation I mentioned earlier, being an open palm. Beautiful strangers are not treated differently from anyone else. </p></li><li><p>My favorite kind of person has an elasticity in their movements. There is an openness that does not need to be announced, a curiosity that looks like turning towards all experience. They are not the loudest, but because they exhibit an unconditional acceptance of everyone, they are usually well loved. It makes sense, doesn't it? Unless there are many layers of contortions, most people love what loves them back. Not desire, not need, love — to see them wholly, with gentleness and acceptance. If you are able to do that, most people will sense it. And they will try to love you back. </p></li></div></div>]]></description>

<p><em>[Editor’s Note: I recently asked <a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/2031/the-culture-of-tech-podcast-episode-1-steve-wozniak-and-television">Steve Wozniak</a> via email about why the original Apple II did not support lowercase letters. I could have guessed the answer, but it’s always good to hear the reason straight from the source. Woz’s response was so long and detailed that I asked him if I could publish the whole thing on VC&amp;G. He said yes, so here we are. –Benj]</em></p>

<p><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/forum_contest/divider2.jpg" alt="----------"></p>

<p>In the early 1970s, I was very poor, living paycheck to paycheck. While I worked at HP, any spare change went into my digital projects that I did on my own in my apartment. I was an excellent typist. I was proficient at typing by touch using keypunches with unusual and awkward special characters — even though some used two fingers of one hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wozniak-and-jobs.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/wozniak-and-jobs.jpg" alt="Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs with an Apple I" width="250"></a>I saw a friend typing on a teletype to the six computers on the early ARPAnet. I had to have this power over distant computers too. After building many arcade games on computers, how to build it was obvious to me instantly. I’d create a video generator (as with the arcade games) and display text using a character generator chip. But I needed a keyboard.</p>
<p>I’d show up at HP every morning around 6 AM to peruse engineering magazines and journals to see what new chips and products were coming. I found an offer for a $60 keyboard modeled after the upper-case-only ASR-33 teletype.</p>
<p>That $60 for the keyboard is probably like $500 today <em>[About $333 adjusted for inflation — Benj]</em>. This $60 was the single biggest price obstacle in the entire development of the early Apple computers. I had to gulp just to come up with $60, and I think my apartment rental check bounced that month — they put me on cash payment from then on. Other keyboards you could buy back then cost around $200, which might be $1000 or more now. There just wasn’t any mass manufacturing of digital keyboards in 1974.</p>
<p>So my TV Terminal, for accessing the ARPAnet, was uppercase only.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/images/forum_contest/divider2.jpg" alt="----------"></p>

<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AP_81887390289-1000x532.jpg"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/AP_81887390289-1000x532.jpg" alt="Apple I Owned By Steve Jobs Auction Image" width="250"></a>The idea for my own computer came into my head the first day of the Homebrew Computer Club.</p>
<p>Maybe a year prior, I had looked at the 4-bit Intel 4004 microprocessor and determined that it could never be used to build the computer I wanted for myself — based on all the minicomputers that I’d designed on paper and desired since 1968-1970. But at the Homebrew Computer Club, they were talking about the 8008 and 8080 microprocessors, which I had not kept up with after my 4004 disappointment. I took home a data sheet for the 8008, based on a version of it from a Canadian company. That night, I discovered that this entire processor was capable of being a computer.</p>
<p>I already had my input and output, my TV Terminal. With that terminal, I’d type to a computer in Boston, for example, and that far-away computer, on the ARPAnet, would type back to my TV. I now saw that all I had to do was connect the microprocessor, with 4K of RAM (I’d built my tiny computer with the capability of the Altair, 5 years prior, in 1970, with my own TTL chips as the processor). 4K was the amount of RAM allowing you to type in a program on a human keyboard and run it.</p>
<p>My computer wasn’t designed from the ground up. I just added the 6502 microprocessor and 4K DRAMS (introduced that summer of 1975 and far less costly than Intel static RAMs) to have a complete computer with input and output.</p>
<p>So the uppercase keyboard was not designed as part of a computer. It already existed as my TV Terminal.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/awozjobs.png"><img src="https://www.vintagecomputing.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/awozjobs.png" alt="Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs with an Apple II" width="250"></a>I truly would have wanted lower case on a keyboard, but I was still totally cash strapped, with no spare money. After already starting a BASIC interpreter for my computer, I would have had to re-assemble all my code. But here again, I did not have the money to have an account on a timeshare service for a 6502 interpreter. The BASIC was handwritten and hand-assembled. I’d write the source code and then write the binary that an interpreter would have turned my code into. To implement a major change like lower case (keeping 6 bits per character in my syntax table instead of 5 bits) would have been a horrendous and risky job to do by hand. If I’d had a time-share assembler, it would have been quick and easy. Hence, the Apple I wound up with uppercase only.</p>
<p>I discussed the alternatives with Steve Jobs. I was for lower case, but not for money (cost). Steve had little computer experience, and he said that uppercase was just fine. We both had our own reasons for not changing it before the computers were out. Even with the later Apple II (as with the Apple I), the code was again hand-written and hand-interpreted because I had no money. All 8 kB of code in the Apple II was only written by my own hand, including the binary object code. That made it impossible to add lower case into it easily.</p>
<p>So, in the end, the basic reason for no lowercase on the Apple I and Apple II was my own lack of money. Zero checking. Zero savings.</p>

<p>Microsoft is working on adding a new Teams feature&nbsp;that will prevent users from capturing screenshots of sensitive information shared during meetings.</p>

<p>Those joining from unsupported platforms will be automatically placed in audio-only mode to protect shared content.&nbsp;The company&nbsp;plans to start rolling out this new Teams feature to Android, desktop, iOS, and web&nbsp;users worldwide in July 2025.</p>

<p>"To address the issue of unauthorized screen captures during meetings, the Prevent Screen Capture feature ensures that if a user attempts to take a screen capture, the meeting window will turn black, thereby protecting sensitive information," <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490051" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Microsoft shared</a> in a new&nbsp;Microsoft 365 roadmap entry.</p>

<p>"This feature will be available on Teams desktop applications (both Windows and Mac) and Teams mobile applications (both iOS and Android)."</p>

<p>However, it should be noted that, even if screenshots are blocked, sensitive media and information shared in Teams meetings can still be captured by taking a photo of the conversation.</p>

<p>Last month, Meta introduced a similar WhatsApp feature named "<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/whatsapps-new-advanced-chat-privacy-protects-sensitive-messages/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Advanced Chat Privacy</a>," which protects sensitive information exchanged in private chats and group conversations by blocking attempts to save shared media and export chat content.</p>

<p>Redmond will also roll out&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490050" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">town hall screen privilege management update</a>&nbsp;in Teams Rooms on Windows,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=490564" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">interactive BizChat/Copilot Studio agents</a>&nbsp;in meetings and 1-on-1 calls, and a Copilot feature to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a>&nbsp;of transcribed meetings in June.</p>

<p>Another Copilot feature to help&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/roadmap?id=488807" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">generate audio overviews</a>&nbsp;of transcribed meetings is also under development and&nbsp;will let users choose the speakers, adjust the tone, and tailor the length.</p>

<p>In January, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-teams-phishing-attack-alerts-coming-to-everyone-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">reminded Microsoft 365 admins</a>&nbsp;that its new Teams Chat brand impersonation protection feature, which alerts users when detecting phishing attacks targeting organizations with external Teams access toggled on, will be made generally available for all customers by mid-February 2025.</p>

<p>At last year's&nbsp;Enterprise Connect enterprise communications and collaboration conference, Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftteamsblog/microsoft-teams-building-a-foundation-for-the-future/4090393" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">announced</a>&nbsp;that the Teams platform had reached over 320 million monthly active users across 181 markets and 44 languages.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Thank you very much, Your Eminence. Before taking our seats, let us begin with a prayer, asking the Lord to continue to accompany this College, and above all the entire Church with this spirit, with enthusiasm, but also with deep faith. Let us pray together in Latin.</p> 
<p>Pater noster… Ave Maria…</p> 
<p>In the first part of this meeting, there will be a short talk with some reflections that I would like to share with you. But then there will be a second part, a bit like the opportunity that many of you had asked for: a sort of dialogue with the College of Cardinals to hear what advice, suggestions, proposals, concrete things, which have already been discussed in the days leading up to the Conclave.</p> 
<p>Dear Brother Cardinals,</p> 
<p>I greet all of you with gratitude for this meeting and for the days that preceded it. Days that were sad because of the loss of the Holy Father Pope Francis and demanding due to the responsibilities we confronted together, yet at the same time, in accordance with the promise Jesus himself made to us, days rich in grace and consolation in the Spirit (cf. <i>Jn</i> 14:25-27).</p> 
<p>You, dear Cardinals, are the closest collaborators of the Pope. This has proved a great comfort to me in accepting a yoke clearly far beyond my own limited powers, as it would be for any of us. Your presence reminds me that the Lord, who has entrusted me with this mission, will not leave me alone in bearing its responsibility. I know, before all else, that I can always count on his help, the help of the Lord, and through his grace and providence, on your closeness and that of so many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world who believe in God, love the Church and support the Vicar of Christ by their prayers and good works.</p> 
<p>I thank the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re – who deserves applause, at least once, if not more – whose wisdom, the fruit of a long life and many years of faithful service to the Apostolic See, has helped us greatly during this time. I thank the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell – I believe he is present today – for the important and demanding work that he has done throughout the period of the Vacant See and for the convocation of the Conclave. My thoughts also go to our brother Cardinals who, for reasons of health, were unable to be present, and I join you in embracing them in communion of affection and prayer.</p> 
<p>At this moment, both sad and joyful, providentially bathed in the light of Easter, I would like all of us to see the passing of our beloved Holy Father Pope Francis and the Conclave as a paschal event, a stage in that long exodus through which the Lord continues to guide us towards the fullness of life. In this perspective, we entrust to the “merciful Father and God of all consolation” (<i>2 Cor</i> 1:3) the soul of the late Pontiff and also the future of the Church.</p> 
<p>Beginning with Saint Peter and up to myself, his unworthy Successor, the Pope has been a humble servant of God and of his brothers and sisters, and nothing more than this. It has been clearly seen in the example of so many of my Predecessors, and most recently by Pope Francis himself, with his example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life, his abandonment to God throughout his ministry and his serene trust at the moment of his return to the Father’s house. Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith.</p> 
<p>It is the Risen Lord, present among us, who protects and guides the Church, and continues to fill her with hope through the love “poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” (<i>Rom</i> 5:5). It is up to us to be docile listeners to his voice and faithful ministers of his plan of salvation, mindful that God loves to communicate himself, not in the roar of thunder and earthquakes, but in the “whisper of a gentle breeze” (<i>1 Kings</i> 19:12) or, as some translate it, in a “sound of sheer silence.” It is this essential and important encounter to which we must guide and accompany all the holy People of God entrusted to our care.</p> 
<p>In these days, we have been able to see the beauty and feel the strength of this immense community, which with such affection and devotion has greeted and mourned its Shepherd, accompanying him with faith and prayer at the time of his final encounter with the Lord. We have seen the true grandeur of the Church, which is alive in the rich variety of her members in union with her one Head, Christ, “the shepherd and guardian” (<i>1 Peter</i> 2:25) of our souls. She is the womb from which we were born and at the same time the flock (cf. <i>Jn</i> 21:15-17), the field (cf. <i>Mk</i> 4:1-20) entrusted to us to protect and cultivate, to nourish with the sacraments of salvation and to make fruitful by our sowing the seed of the Word, so that, steadfast in one accord and enthusiastic in mission, she may press forward, like the Israelites in the desert, in the shadow of the cloud and in the light of God’s fire (cf. <i>Ex</i> 13:21).</p> 
<p>In this regard, I would like us to renew together today our complete commitment to the path that the universal Church has now followed for decades in the wake of the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm">Second Vatican Council</a>. Pope Francis masterfully and concretely set it forth in the Apostolic Exhortation <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/apost_exhortations/documents/papa-francesco_esortazione-ap_20131124_evangelii-gaudium.html">Evangelii Gaudium</a></i>, from which I would like to highlight several fundamental points: the return to the primacy of Christ in proclamation (cf. No. 11); the missionary conversion of the entire Christian community (cf. No. 9); growth in collegiality and synodality (cf. No. 33); attention to the <i>sensus fidei</i> (cf. Nos. 119-120), especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, such as popular piety (cf. No. 123); loving care for the least and the rejected (cf. No. 53); courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world in its various components and realities (cf. No. 84; Second Vatican Council, Pastoral Constitution <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html">Gaudium et Spes</a></i>, 1-2).</p> 
<p>These are evangelical principles that have always inspired and guided the life and activity of God’s Family. In these values, the merciful face of the Father has been revealed and continues to be revealed in his incarnate Son, the ultimate hope of all who sincerely seek truth, justice, peace and fraternity (cf. Benedict XVI, <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xvi_enc_20071130_spe-salvi.html">Spe Salvi</a></i>, 2; Francis, <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/bulls/documents/20240509_spes-non-confundit_bolla-giubileo2025.html">Spes Non Confundit</a></i>, 3).</p> 
<p>Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV. There are different reasons for this, but mainly because Pope Leo XIII in his historic Encyclical <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiii/en/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum.html">Rerum Novarum</a></i> addressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution. In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour.</p> 
<p>Dear brothers, I would like to conclude the first part of our meeting by making my own – and proposing to you as well – the hope that Saint Paul VI expressed at the inauguration of his Petrine Ministry in 1963: “May it pass over the whole world like a great flame of faith and love kindled in all men and women of good will. May it shed light on paths of mutual cooperation and bless humanity abundantly, now and always, with the very strength of God, without whose help nothing is valid, nothing is holy” (<a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/speeches/1963/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19630622_first-message.html">Message <i>Qui Fausto Die </i>addressed to the entire human family</a>, 22 June 1963).</p> 
<p>May these also be our sentiments, to be translated into prayer and commitment, with the Lord’s help. Thank you!</p></div></div>]]></description>
