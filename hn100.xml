  <article>
    
      <p>This is a translated version of a talk I gave at <a href="https://piwo.sh/">P.I.W.O</a> in June, with cleanups and adjustments for the blog form.</p>

<p>…that doesn't sound right. I made the slides in <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>, on a computer running <a href="https://kde.org/">KDE</a> and Linux, I use <a href="https://www.firefox.com/">Firefox</a> regularly. But maybe that's just me. What about you, are you using Free Software? Hands up! [hands go up in the audience] Of course! What nonsense, "Free Software hasn't won". Someone replaced my slides, hey conference staff!</p>
<p>**<strong>Staff:</strong>** *<em>The other folder.</em>*</p>
<p>[Browsing to a directory named "other folder", opening file called "your slides dimwit.pdf"]</p>
<p>Now, those are finally my slides.</p>
<p>Hello audience, my name is Dorota, and I'm going to talk about how</p>
<h2># Open Source has won.</h2>
<p>And that's not recent, the news has been out in 2008, and has been regularly repeated since by reputable press: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-and-open-source-have-won-get-over-it/">ZDNET</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/open-source-winning-and-now-its-time-people-win-too">Linux Journal</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/08/open-source-won-now/">Wired</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>Those press articles list a multitude of examples to prove it.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/logos.svg" alt="Logos of businesses and project mentioned in the articles above"></p>
<p>Linux, Ruby, Red Hat, uh, GitHub? Does that mean I can download GitHub and run it on my own server? Microsoft? Come on, that's some kind of a joke. Those slides are manipulated! So what else do they contain? Oh, <a href="https://geoawesome.com/open-and-closed-source-who-wins-the-race/">this quote</a> is all right:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Open source won. It’s not that an enemy has been vanquished or that proprietary software is dead, there’s not much regarding adopting open source to argue about anymore. After more than a decade of the low-cost, lean startup culture successfully developing on open source tools, it’s clearly a legitimate, mainstream option for technology tools and innovation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh, the name of the quoted person is wrong. Looks like an attack on my reputation! Anyways.</p>
<p>The point is, if we want to build something new, using Free Software is not a hindrance. And thats super important, because <a href="https://a16z.com/why-software-is-eating-the-world/">software is eating the world</a>. What does it mean? It means software keeps appearing in areas where there used to be no software before. That, in turn, means that we're slowly giving up control over more and more areas of life to those who made the software. After all, their software controls those areas of life from now on.</p>
<p>That's why it's great that there's always an alternative available, that we can select software that is free which grants control to us, and not just its manufacturer. So we have alternate <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">operating systems</a> made with <a href="https://kernel.org/">Linux</a>. There are <a href="https://www.python.org/">very</a> <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">many</a> <a href="https://llvm.org/">programming</a> <a href="https://www.swi-prolog.org/">languages</a> <a href="https://isocpp.org/">to</a> <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">choose</a> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">from</a>. We can choose one of the <a href="https://zero-k.info/">open</a> <a href="http://openalchemist.free.fr/">games</a>, or <a href="https://krita.org/">graphics</a> or <a href="https://ardour.org/">audio creation</a> software without resorting to closed software.</p>
<p>Similarly, we don't need closed software to <a href="https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware-Buddy">print in 3D</a>, or to build a <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">mobile computer</a> (also known as smartphone) or a <a href="https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime">smart watch</a>. There are graphics cards which run <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Nouveau#Firmware">completely free of closed firmware</a> (Upon asking nouveau devs, they confirmed they wrote some firmware. Nvidia Kepler from 2012 is the last model where free firmware is allowed). There are such bicycles! Pretty much everyone owns one that rides without closed software. There are also sewing machines:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/sewing.png" alt="A fully mechanical sewing machine from the '90s"></p>
<p>There are comms systems:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/doorbell.png" alt="A doorbell/intercom for 20 flats like one you might remember from the '90s"></p>
<p>There are cars, and have been for a long time:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/beetle.jpg" alt="The classic half-century-old VW Beetle had no electronics inside"> <img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/lada.jpg" alt="So did some Lada models which were not impressive when they came out in the 1980s"></p>
<p>There are hard drives:</p>
<p>[the slides go blank]</p>
<p>There are wireless headphones, TVs... [slides remain blank] wait, something's wrong. There are phones! [Slides stay mockingly blank, noise of frantic clicking.]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/aster-72.jpg" alt="A pulse-dial Aster-72 rotary phone which belongs firmly in the 20th century"></p>
<p>Crap. This isn't right.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/schemat_Aster_RWT.jpg" alt="A yellow card showing the schematic of the Aster phone"></p>
<p>Oh, now I get it! The only kind of a phone that grants us openness is an analog phone. That reminds me of the time we were building the aforementioned Librem 5. There was a problem finding the modem for it. The reason is, one company controls the necessary patents necessary to connect to cellular networks. That company can and does impose arbitrary conditions on anyone using their integrated circuits. That made it very difficult to find modems that match our needs, and at the same time any reseller is willing to sell us. The resellers worried that by passing them on to us, they could break some distribution rule and not be able to get any modems in the future.</p>
<p>So that's a no. But I know what will be open for sure.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/GNU.png" alt="The stylized gnu logo of the GNU project"></p>
<p>Richard Stallman started an important project called <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> in 1983. In one of his <a href="https://en.linuxadictos.com/stallman-y-la-impresora-el-origen-de-las-licencias-libres-de-software.html">interviews</a>, as he describes how he started the project, he mentions a certain device that his university bought, but which didn't work very well. He wanted to improve it, but no one wanted to share the device's sources with him. That was an offense! Why wouldn't anyone share the code?</p>
<p>What was that device?</p>
<p>That was a printer. Considering that the GNU project started in 1983 and that the story's from 1981, it works out to over 40 years of fighting for printer freedom. So let's reveal our open alternative.</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/Colored_pencils_chevre.jpg" alt="Colored pencils"></p>
<p>Oh come on. This cannot be. Have you ever used a printer? If you even manage to find a driver, if you even manage to connect to the printer, then it's still going to print single-sided black-and-white when you asked double-sided color. And despite having to put up with that, Free Software people still haven't gotten frustrated enough to solve the problem once and for all? Unbelievable.</p>
<p>I have a theory. People who say "Open Source has won" are only taking into account a small part of what software is out there. Take a look at this list: it's a map showing which kinds of software force you into running something closed (bold) and which have open options available (italics).</p>
<ul>
<li>Applications: *<em>Blender, Firefox, KiCAD</em>* – **<strong>Twitter, YouTube</strong>**</li>
<li>Operating System: *<em>GCC, Apache, OpenSSL</em>*</li>
<li>Kernel: *<em>Linux, Zephyr, FreeRTOS</em>*</li>
<li>Firmware: *<em><a href="https://coreboot.org/">Coreboot</a></em>* – **<strong>modem, GPU</strong>**</li>
<li>Appliances: *<em>Prusa 3D, <a href="https://github.com/airgradienthq/arduino">Airgradient</a></em>* – **<strong>washing machine, TV</strong>**</li>
</ul>
<p>What picture does this paint? Things programmers care about directly, like the OS and the kernel, are quite well covered. Whatever we need, there's an open version. Applications are also more or less fine. There's a Web browser, there's creativity software. The problem appears when you try to participate in social media. Sure, there are alternatives. But <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, or <a href="https://joinpeertube.org/">PeerTube</a> are separate networks from the closed ones, so they won't help much when trying to reach people who aren't yet using them.</p>
<p>Looking at the lower layers, like appliances or firmware, there seem to be options. But those options are limited to a couple niches, and with most things we buy, like a TV or a PC component – sorry, pal, there's simply no choice at all.</p>
<h2>## All the firmwares in the average laptop</h2>
<p>How many processors are there in a typical laptop? By "processor" I mean something that needs its own software. For example, a GPU has its own processor that needs software, or a hard drive, or a keyboard. Here's a diagram of my personal estimate of what separate components need software:</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/firmwares.png" alt="A picture of a laptop with highlighted components: camera, touch screen, touchpad, Embedded Controller, SSD, battery, HDD, RAM, WiFi+Bluetooth card, sound card, BIOS, Intel ME."></p>
<p>I estimate there are 10 to 15 separate processors on a typical laptop. Just the graphics card may host five of them.</p>
<p>What does that mean for free software? Normally, all that's open – Linux, drivers, applications – all of this is confined to the main CPU. Now imagine you want to use this operating system through some human-friendly interface, like the touch screen or the keyboard. Those are running closed software, so if you want to enter any sort of data on your average laptop, it's game over: you can't make a move without dependence on closed software.</p>
<p>Same story with the graphics card. You won't display anything without closed software. What a fail. Okay, let's ditch keyboards and displays because this is a server. But that's a fail, too: to communicate over a network card, you still need software that it's running and that hasn't been opened. Suppose that we managed to somehow solve this problem. We hit the wall anyway when we try to store data: SSDs as well as HDDs are running their own closed software. I haven't heard of a single case of open software ever running on a storage device!</p>
<p>But that's not even the worst. The peak of lameness is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170828150536/http://blog.ptsecurity.com/2017/08/disabling-intel-me.html">the processor inside the processor</a>. Have you already heard of Secure Boot? It's a piece of BIOS that is loaded onto the processor inside the main processor before the main operating system. Secure Boot allows the manufacturer choose which software the user can run. A similar system exists on Android phones to lock them to a particular system. Manufacturers of Android-based phones are not shy about restricting what the user can run on their devices.</p>
<h2>## That runs against user's freedom!</h2>
<p>User freedom exists only when the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">Four Freedoms of Software</a> are upheld:</p>
<ul>
<li>0: freedom to run the program for any purpose,</li>
<li>1: to study and change it,</li>
<li>2: to share copies of it,</li>
<li>3: to improve it and share the improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>…but those are just words. Who cares about that? This theory is only ever going to be relevant to us computer experts, right?</p>
<p>Except… could it be that you're the family's tech support expert? Does your uncle/mum/grandma come to you carrying their malfunctioning Android phone, hoping for you to make everything right again?</p>
<p>And have you ever disappointed them? Has it already happened that their phone was simply too old and unsupported to be useful any more? Have you already told someone they need to pay up to replace a phone that seems perfectly functional?</p>
<p>Sadly, that's what the Android manufacturer <a href="https://www.nextpit.com/how-tos/how-many-android-updates-manufactures-offer">support</a> <a href="https://forum.fairphone.com/t/what-kind-of-guarantee-is-there-regarding-updates/105832">timelines</a> say: typically after 4, exceptionally after 8 years, they will no longer release security updates. That makes devices too insecure to use, and turns them into e-waste.</p>
<p>What does Free Software have to do with it? I don't know, but my Lenovo laptop, 13 years since release of the hardware, the operating system is still receiving regular security updates. I suspect this has something to do with the lack of a boot loader lock and the openness of all the drivers. That's unlike Android. Even if there's no explicit lock, the drivers are so rarely open that the community rarely has the manpower to create a custom ROM for a given device.</p>
<h2>## Rug pulls</h2>
<p>The couple hundred bucks that your aunt might need to pony up to get a new phone pale in comparison to how much you need to pay for some cloud-only devices. Some cloud-enabled gadgets don't let the user choose an alternative provider for services the device requires. What happens when the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/startup-will-brick-800-emotional-support-robot-for-kids-without-refunds/">shuts down</a> the <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/210-days-after-nintendo-shut-down-the-3ds-and-wii-u-online-servers-the-last-connected-player-finally-signs-off-after-his-console-crashes-its-over/">online service</a>? Of course, the device <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/2300-magic-leap-1-headset-will-stop-working-after-2024">becomes an expensive brick</a>. Imagine someone setting your 2300 bucks on fire just like that.</p>
<p>That's still nothing compared to what some other people have to deal with. Imagine you're a farmer, and your harvest is on the field, ready to get cut and brought in. T here's a storm brewing, so you jump into the combine harvester, and start the work. Oh no! The machine broke down! Not to worry, you're a resourceful farmer and you have the necessary spare part. You install it and start the machine, except… it tells you: "Unauthorized component. Please contact customer service". Now you're in real trouble because it could take <a href="https://pirg.org/media-center/report-tractor-right-to-repair-would-save-u-s-farmers-4-2-billion/">9 months</a> for the customer service to solve the problem. You can't harvest the food worth tens of thousands of dollars, you're that much in the red. Game over, your farm is bankrupt. But that's not the end of the world, is it?</p>
<p><img src="https://dorotac.eu/posts/fosswon/pacemaker.jpg" alt="Two x-ray pictures of a human chest, with some wires and a chunky artificial shape visible"></p>
<p>This is what a pacemaker looks like. Why would I mention those in a talk about software freedom? You see, a pacemaker is a complex device which must examine and diagnose the patient continuously, in real time, in order to perform its function. Its task is to detect a dangerous condition and perform a medical procedure in response to it. It needs software to do this complicated task. But if the device isn't perfect at diagnosing, that's a big problem. I'm not a medical expert, but getting your heart shocked when it's not necessary sounds dangerous in its own right. When it runs closed software that does not grant us the freedom to modify it, we have to resort to begging the manufacturer to fix it. And when we get no freedom to study it, we can't even avoid the circumstances that make it misfire!</p>
<p>But don't take my word for it. I only know of this problem because of <a href="https://punkrocklawyer.com/">Karen Sandler</a>, whose <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/about/staff/">involvement with Free Software</a> is intertwined with this problem since the beginning.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, if we have people who have no other choice but to trust their own body to a <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bionic-eye-obsolete">piece of closed software and a single manufacturer</a>, how could we possibly say that Open Source had won?</p>
<h2>## Appliances and copyleft</h2>
<p>Are you responsible for building an appliance? I bet you're using Open Source software in it, aren't you? Then licenses like the MIT require you to include a notice about the authors of the source code together with the software you distribute. There's a whole <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/10/03/screenshotted-curl-credits/">gallery</a> of those on the curl website, ranging from cars to food processors. Are you feeling proud for releasing a device with Free Software in it? Not so quick! Can the user of your device study and modify the software you gave them? Have you actually granted them the Four Freedoms?</p>
<p>Permissive licenses <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#Expat">like the MIT license are Free Software</a>, so they let you do all that the Four Freedoms promise. But they also allow you to do another thing: to close the software again by never granting those freedoms regarding your own modifications. If that's what happened, then freedom for me, not for thee. You, the manufacturer, reaped the benefits, the user can't, sucks to be the user.</p>
<p>The responsibility to prevent this falls on us, computer experts. When we create software, we have the choice of license we want to release it under. And we should be using what's called "copyleft": it's a term that applies to licenses which prevent code once released under that license from being closed again. The most widespread copyleft license is the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">Gnu General Public License</a> (GPL), and I recommend that you all use that one.</p>
<h2>## Licenses and more</h2>
<p>Licenses are not the only thing relevant for Free Software. There are other things to fight:</p>
<ul>
<li>patents, like in the case of cellular modems,</li>
<li>hardware locks, like Android's,</li>
<li>project management.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the last point, recently Google gave <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">an amazing example</a> by restricting access to sources in development to select manufacturers. Everyone else will not get continuous updates, but only once per major release. This illustrates how much influence over the practical usability of a project management decisions have. This is not a change in licensing, and it's also not a technical change, so it's not immediately visible under those lenses.</p>
<p>Instead, it's a consequence of who's in charge. In this case, it's not a community who controls the Android project, but a for-profit corporation. At the same time, it's regular people who are on the user side of the project. Is it any wonder that the goals of a corporation and those of regular people differ? Is it any wonder that the corporation is making changes that suit it even when they don't suit the community of users? When those are the conditions under which a project is developed, it can have deep consequences, even on an architectural level.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as a point of comparison. The first statement on the web page already says "Debian is a Community of People!". The software is being developed and used by the same people. They won't make it harder to use. They provide a complete operating system, publish all the sources, and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1099130">purge anything that isn't open enough</a>. On the other hand, Android has long been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/07/googles-iron-grip-on-android-controlling-open-source-by-any-means-necessary/">replacing</a> open components by closed ones, making AOSP (the open part of android) all but <a href="https://www.esper.io/blog/aosp-missing-features-google-gms">unuseable on its own</a>.</p>
<h2>## Why?</h2>
<p>I suspect this situation has something to do with how computers and appliances have been developed historically. Computers have their roots in academia. When they were sold, they were always advertised as blank slates, general purpose devices, as opportunities to do what you choose to do with them. Not so much for appliances. Those have always had a single purpose. Except they kept getting complicated, until they entered a level of complexity where they needed to incorporate computers in order to perform their function. But they kept being manufactured as appliances, with only a handful of people being expected or allowed to exercise control over them. Incorporating computers didn't change the culture around them.</p>
<p>This is just a guess and I don't know how correct it is. For example Apple was always a computer manufacturer, but they are making computers now as if those were appliances.</p>
<h2>## What now?</h2>
<p>The responsibility is ours – computer nerds' – to make Free Software win. When we build a hardware device, we must publish the firmware sources. We must publish technical documentation – it often so happens that the device documentation needed to make open firmware is missing or incomplete (another war story from the Librem 5, camera sensors this time).</p>
<p>As users, or institutional customers, we should demand that the manufacturer provides open sources for any firmware they are shipping with their devices.</p>
<p>But there's one more way: political pressure. I expect this to be a more effective method than individual action. After all, EU managed to convince phone manufacturers to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58665809">standardize on USB-C ports for charging</a>, as well as to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/eu-repair-push-for-defective-consumer-goods">extend the warranty period</a>. Perhaps they could also force computer manufacturers to not install boot loader locks. It would fit nicely into the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/summary/copyright-and-related-rights-in-the-information-society.html">Information Society Directive</a>. It says things like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; Member States must provide legal protection against any person knowingly performing without authority any of the following acts:</p>
<ul>
<li>&gt; the removal or alteration of any electronic rights-management information;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>…oh. So instead of jailing people who put locks on devices they no longer own, it enforces the jailing of those who remove them from their own devices. Great.</p>
<p>Dear European Comission, please always have someone with a clue in the room who can explain the consequences of your ideas in a way you can understand. You can do it, already did a couple times, like above. But work on consistency, okay? Pinky promise?</p>
<p>Here are some people with a clue: <a href="https://fsfe.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> with their <a href="https://publiccode.eu/">Public Money Public Code</a> open letter, the <a href="https://repair.eu/">Right to Repair</a> movement, as well as the <a href="https://european-pirateparty.eu/">European Pirate Party</a>.</p>
<p>I recommend anyone who cares to join forces with them. But if you don't want to engage politically, there are also financial way of support. And I don't even mean (although I do encourage) donating. I mean supporting Free Software friendly manufacturers! Buy the Librem 5 from <a href="https://puri.sm/">Purism</a>, or a 3D printer from <a href="https://www.prusa3d.com/">Prusa</a>, or a smartwatch running <a href="https://www.espruino.com/Bangle.js2">Espruino</a>. You see, it's expensive to manufacture any sort of hardware. It doesn't help that the markets are already saturated with closed products. Even if open source, hackable products are superior, it will take people at large a long time to realize that this is a superpower. Free Software thrived in culture of repair and modification. But this culture has been suffocated in the wider society with closed, throwaway items, so few people recognize its benefits. That unsustainable crowding out makes another obstacle for Open Source friendly products in the current markets.</p>
<p>There's a noble exception here. What makes it even more unusual is that it comes from Google. It's Chromebooks. Google has a set of requirements that all Chromebook manufacturers must fulfill, and one of them is having a completely open BIOS, together with the Embedded Controller firmware. All Chromebooks I'm aware of run Coreboot. They still contain some closed software, notably the RAM startup software, which, I believe, is present in all laptops, but! ARM-base Chromebooks are able to run with a completely open BIOS apart from that. So if anyone wants to take care of this together with me, I have this <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/MT818x_MT819x-firmware/">NLNet project</a> to make it as easy as possible to run regular, mainline Linux on them. So please, contact me, if you're that person.</p>
<h2>## The world</h2>
<p>A short quiz: how many devices can you count around you which contain processors?</p>
<p>Some hints: TV, camera, toothbrush, oscilloscope, e-book reader, radio receiver, dishwasher, router, washing machine, vacuum cleaner, bathroom scales.</p>
<p>Now think wider. When I went to the supermarket, the vegetable section had a scales that printed labels with barcodes. They were equipped with touch screens. You bet there's a processor and a load of firmware in those. But shops are chock-full of processors in my part of the world. There are thousands of price labels in each of those stores, and they are all e-paper screens. I'm fairly sure you need software to drive those and receive wireless updates.</p>
<p>Keep going and you might realize that the software running in your car allows <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/sep/20/tesla-model-s-chinese-hack-remote-control-brakes">remote control</a>. Or <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/12/08/polish_trains_geofenced_allegation/">in your train</a>. That snafu wouldn't have occured if the railways had access to sources of the train software.</p>
<p>What about other business uses? Car diagnostic stations? Medical equipment? Accounting software?</p>
<p>Software is really eating the world, and it's closed software which is *<em>everywhere</em>* around us, without free options. What's the regular person's role in this? They give up control over entire areas of their lives to others, others who often can't be supervised or replaced.</p>
<p>You know, we messed up. There's no other way to put it. We even let closed software sneak into our own home field: computers. Sure, the interfaces are open. There's SATA, there's PCI. We can swap parts if we want to, we can run Linux there, all is fine. Except it's not, because peripherals are as important as the core, and we, software people, lost control of the peripherals of our darlings already.</p>
<h2>## Wasted potential</h2>
<p>In theory, it's possible that someone opens a piece of software regardless of the wishes of the original authors. The whole game modding scene is about that. Here's an example of someone running Tetris on a pocket camera:</p>
<p>ZX3 running Tetris with hacked firmware</p>


<p>But going against the manufacturer is just wasted work. Imagine the difference between hacking it in and modifying the official sources. The potential, things we could achieve if we didn't have to break doors that are open! So here's a silly example: I have an action camera. Due to some <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/0794343949/wto-looking-at-moves-to-remove-30-minute-limit-from-digital-cameras">stupid law</a>, the camera breaks off every recording as soon as it reaches the 30 minutes mark. Now I have 20 years of coding experience. Having source code, I could have fixed the problem and went on with my life. Another example, another camera: I am making a time lapse from my window. Every day at 10:00, I take a picture from a camera that just sits there. But this camera has no time lapse feature, so I must go there in person every time. Why can't I fix this? Of course, no source code.</p>
<h2>## Epilogue</h2>
<p>There's now a <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/open-tools/open-printer">new printer</a> project that advertises itself as open source. But if you look at the details, it's actually not. Instead, it uses a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">source-available license</a> which does not grant you Freedom 0 – you must not use the sources for commercial purposes. Better than nothing, I guess.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">
    
    














    
    <time datetime="2025-09-25T00:00:00.000Z">September 25, 2025</time>
    
    <p>Not long ago, I <a href="https://xenodium.com/introducing-acpel">introduced acp.el</a>, an Emacs lisp implementation of ACP (<a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/">Agent Client Protocol</a>), the agent protocol <a href="https://zed.dev/blog/claude-code-via-acp">developed between Zed and Google folks</a>.</p>
<p>While I've been happily accessing LLMs from my beloved text editor via <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/chatgpt-shell">chatgpt-shell</a> (a <a href="https://xenodium.com/a-tiny-upgrade-to-the-llm-model-picker">multi-model</a> package I built), I've been fairly slow on the AI agents uptake. Probably a severe case of <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/old-man-yells-at-cloud">old-man-shouts-at-cloud</a> sorta thing, but hey I want well-integrated tools in my text editor. When I heard of ACP, I knew this was the thing I was waiting for to play around with agents.</p>
<p>With an early <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> client library in place, I set out to build an Emacs-native agent integration… Today, I have an initial version of <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a> I can share.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/agent-shell.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>agent-shell</code> is a native Emacs shell, powered by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Shell-Prompts.html">comint-mode</a> (check out Mickey's <a href="https://www.masteringemacs.org/article/comint-writing-command-interpreter">comint article</a> btw). As such, we don't have to dance between char and line modes to interact with things. <code>agent-shell</code> is just a regular Emacs buffer like any other you're used to.</p>
<h2 id="agent-agnostic" tabindex="-1">Agent-agnostic</h2>
<p>Thanks to ACP, we can now build agent-agnostic experiences by simply configuring our clients to communicate with their respective agents using a common protocol. As users, we benefit from a single, consistent experience, powered by any agent of our choice.</p>
<p>Configuring different agents from <code>agent-shell</code> boils down which agent we want running in the comms process. Here's an example of Gemini CLI vs Claude Code configuration:</p>
<pre><code>(defun agent-shell-start-gemini-agent ()
  "Start an interactive Gemini CLI agent shell."
  (interactive)
  (agent-shell--start
   :new-session t
   :mode-line-name "Gemini"
   :buffer-name "Gemini"
   :shell-prompt "Gemini&gt; "
   :shell-prompt-regexp "Gemini&gt; "
   :needs-authentication t
   :authenticate-request-maker (lambda ()
                                 (acp-make-authenticate-request :method-id "gemini-api-key"))
   :client-maker (lambda ()
                   (acp-make-client :command "gemini"
                                    :command-params '("--experimental-acp")
                                    :environment-variables (list (format "GEMINI_API_KEY=%s" (agent-shell-google-key)))))))
</code></pre>
<pre><code>(defun agent-shell-start-claude-code-agent ()
  "Start an interactive Claude Code agent shell."
  (interactive)
  (agent-shell--start
   :new-session t
   :mode-line-name "Claude Code"
   :buffer-name "Claude Code"
   :shell-prompt "Claude Code&gt; "
   :shell-prompt-regexp "Claude Code&gt; "
   :client-maker (lambda ()
                   (acp-make-client :command "claude-code-acp"
                                    :environment-variables (list (format "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=%s" (agent-shell-anthropic-key)))))))
</code></pre>
<p>I've yet to try other agents. If you get another agent running, I'd love to hear about it. Maybe submit a <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell/pulls">pull request</a>?</p>
<h2 id="traffic" tabindex="-1">Traffic</h2>
<p>While I've been relying on my <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> client library, I'm still fairly new to the protocol. I often inspect traffic to see what's going on. After staring at json for far too long, I figured I may as well build some tooling around <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> to make my life easier. I added a traffic buffer for that. From <code>agent-shell</code>, you can invoke it via <code>M-x agent-shell-view-traffic</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenodium/acp.el/refs/heads/main/traffic.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="fake-agents" tabindex="-1">Fake agents</h2>
<p>Developing <code>agent-shell</code> against paid agents got expensive quickly. Not only expensive, but my edit-compile-run cycle also became boringly slow waiting for agents. While I knew I wanted some sort of fake agent to work against, I didn't want to craft the fake traffic myself. Remember that traffic buffer I showed ya? Well, I can now save that traffic to disk and replay it later. This enabled me to run problematic sessions once and quickly replay multiple times to fix things. While re-playing has its quirks and limitations, it's done the job for now.</p>
<p>You can see a Claude Code session below, followed by its replayed counterpart via fake infrastructure.</p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/claude.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/fake.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="what's-next" tabindex="-1">What's next</h2>
<p>Getting here took quite a bit of work. Having said that, it's only a start. I myself need to get more familiar with agent usage and evolve the package UX however it feels most natural within its new habitat. Lately, I've been experimenting with a quick diff buffer, driven by n/p keys, shown along the permission dialog.</p>
<pre><code>#+ATTR_HTML: :width 99%
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/diff.png"><img src="https://xenodium.github.io/images/introducing-agent-shell/diff.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>While I've implemented enough parts of the <a href="https://agentclientprotocol.com/protocol/schema">Agent Client Protocol Schema</a> to make the package useful, it's hardly complete. I've yet to fully familiarize myself with most protocol features.</p>
<h2 id="take-them-for-a-spin" tabindex="-1">Take them for a spin</h2>
<p>Both of my new Emacs packages, <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a>, are now available on GitHub. As an agent user, go straight to <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell">agent-shell</a>. If you're a package author and would like to build an ACP experience, then give <a href="https://github.com/xenodium/acp.el">acp.el</a> a try. Both packages are brand new and may have rough edges. Be sure to file bugs or feature requests as needed.</p>

<p>I've been heads down, working on these packages for some time. If you're using cloud LLM services, you're likely already paying for tokens. If you find my work useful, please consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">routing some of those coins</a> to help fund it. Maybe my tools make you more productive at work? Ask your <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">employer to support the work</a>. These packages not only take time and effort, but also cost me money. <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/xenodium">Help fund the work</a>.</p>

<div><p>Currently a one-man side project:
<a href="https://laboratory.love/" rel="nofollow">https://laboratory.love</a></p><p>Last year, PlasticList found plastic chemicals in 86% of tested foods—including 100% of baby foods they tested. Around the same time, the EU lowered its “safe” BPA limit by 20,000×, while the FDA still allows levels roughly 100× higher than Europe’s new standard.</p><p>That seemed solvable.</p><p>Laboratory.love lets you crowdfund independent lab testing of the specific products you actually buy. Think Consumer Reports × Kickstarter, but focused on detecting endocrine disruptors in your yogurt, your kid’s snacks, or whatever you’re curious about.</p><p>Find a product (or suggest one), contribute to its testing fund, and get full lab results when testing completes. If a product doesn’t reach its goal within 365 days, you’re automatically refunded. All results are published publicly.</p><p>We use the same ISO 17025-accredited methodology as PlasticList.org, testing three separate production lots per product and detecting down to parts-per-billion. The entire protocol is open.</p><p>Since last month’s “What are you working on?” post:</p><p>- 4 more products have been fully funded (now 10 total!)</p><p>- That’s 30 individual samples (we do triplicate testing on different batches) and 60 total chemical panels (two separate tests for each sample, BPA/BPS/BPF and phthalates)</p><p>- 6 results published, 4 in progress</p><p>The goal is simple: make supply chains transparent enough that cleaner ones win. When consumers have real data, markets shift.</p><p>Browse funded tests, propose your own, or just follow along:

<div><p>1. An example result is "<a href="https://laboratory.love/product/117" rel="nofollow">https://laboratory.love/product/117</a>", which is a list of chemicals and measurements.  Is there a visualization of how these levels relate to regulations and expert recommendations?  What about a visualization of how different products in the same category compare, so that consumers know which brand is supposedly "best"?  Maybe a summary rating, as stars or color-coded threat level?</p><p>2. If you find regulation-violating (or otherwise serious) levels of undesirable chemicals, do you... (a) report it to FDA; (b) initiate a class-action lawsuit; (c) short the brand's stock and then news blitz; or (d) make a Web page with the test results for people to do with it what they will?</p><p>3. Is 3 tests enough?  On the several product test results I clicked, there's often wide variation among the 3 samples.  Or would the visualization/rating tell me that all 3 numbers are unacceptably bad, whether it's 635.8 or 6728.6?</p><p>4. If I know that plastic contamination is a widespread problem, can I secretly fund testing of my competitors' products, to generate bad press for them?</p><p>5. Could this project be shut down by a lawsuit?  Could the labs be?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45562409"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45562409" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45562409&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I've become a bit addicted to online education.  I finished my first masters degree in Computer Science in July, and I started a masters in Mathematics from The Open University at the beginning of October.  I've wanted to really get into the weeds of obscure and arguably-useless math for about as long as I can remember, and I figure that getting a masters in it is as good a way to get that knowledge as any way else.</p><p>Other than that, I've been doing a lot of fixing of tech debt in my home network from the last six years.  I've admittedly kind of half-assed a lot of the work with my home router and my server and my NAS and I want these things to be done correctly. (In fairness to me, I didn't know what I was doing back when I started, and I'd like to think I know a fair bit better now).</p><p>For example, when I first built my server, I didn't know about ZFS datasets, so everything was on the main /tank mount.  This works but there are advantages to having different settings for different parts of the RAID and as such I've been dividing stuff into datasets (which has the added advantage of "defragging" because this RAID has grown by several orders of magnitude and as a result some of the initial files were fragmented).</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563787"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563787" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563787&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I am working on making ultra-low cost freeze-dried enzymes for synthetic biology.</p><p>For example, 1 PCR reaction (a common reaction used to amplify DNA) costs about $1 each, and we're doing tons every day. Since it is $1, nobody really tries to do anything about it - even if you do 20 PCRs in one day, eh it's not that expensive vs everything else you're doing in lab. But that calculus changes once you start scaling up with robots, and that's where I want to be.</p><p>Approximately $30 of culture media can produce &gt;10,000,000 reactions worth of PCR enzyme, but you need the right strain and the right equipment. So, I'm producing the strain and I have the equipment! I'm working on automating the QC (usually very expensive if done by hand) and lyophilizing for super simple logistics.</p><p>My idea is that every day you can just put a tube on your robot and it can do however many PCR reactions you need that day, and when the next day, you just throw it out! Bring the price from $1 each to $0.01 + greatly simplify logistics!</p><p>Of course, you can't really make that much money off of this... but will still be fun and impactful :)</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563282"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563282" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563282&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>As a bio hobbyist, this is fantastic!  I don't do enough volume of PCR to think of it as expensive, but your use case of high-volume/automatic sounds fantastic! (And so many other types of reagents and equipment are very expensive).</p><p>Some things that would be cool</p><pre><code>  - Along your lines: In general, cheap automated setups for PCR and gels
  - Cheap/automatic quantifiable gels. E.g. without needing a kV supply capillary, expensive QPCR machines etc.
  - Cheaper enzymes in general
  - More options for -80 freezers
  - Cheaper/more automated DNA quantification. I got a v1 Quibit which gets the job done, but new ones are very expensive, and reagent costs add up.
  - Cheaper shaking incubator options. You can get cheap shakers and baters, but not cheap combined ones... which you need for pretty much everything. Placing one in the other can work, but is sub-optimal due to size and power-cord considerations.
  - More centrifuges that can do 10kG... this is the minimum for many protocols.
  - Ability to buy pure ethanol without outrageous prices or hazardous shipping fees.</code></pre><p>
- Not sure if this is feasible but... reasonable cost machines to synthesize oglios?</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45562322"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563779"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563086"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563559"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563457"><td></td></tr><tr id="45562405"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45562405" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45562405&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I wish you good luck.</p><p>This might be a naive question which you've probably been asked plenty of times before so I'm sorry of I'm being tedious here.</p><p>Is it really worth the effort and expense to have a real radio station these days? Wouldn't an online stream be just as effective if it was promoted well locally?</p><p>A few years ago a friend who was very much involved in a local community group which I was also somewhat interested in asked me if I wanted to help build a low power FM station. He asked me because I know something about radio since I was into ham radio etc.</p><p>I was skeptical that it was worth the effort. The nerdy part of me would have enjoyed doing it but I couldn't help thinking that an online stream would probably reach as many people without the hassle and expensive of a transmitter, antenna etc.</p><p>I know it's a toss up. Every car has an FM radio. Not everyone is going to have a phone plugged in to Android Auto or Apple Car Play and have a good data plan and have a solid connection.</p><p>I also pointed out that the technical effort is probably the small part compared to producing interesting content.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563654"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="2"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="80"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563654" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563654&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>I have a lot of thoughts about this!</p><p>1. Radio is COOL. As a fellow ham I think you would agree with me on this one so I'll leave it at that.</p><p>2. Internet streaming gives you wider but far less localized audience. We will have an internet stream, but being radio first shifts the focus to local community and local content.</p><p>3. Internet streaming and radio have related but not entirely overlapping histories and contexts which impacts how people produce and consume their content. I love the traditional formats of radio and they are often completely missing in online radio which IMO models itself more often on mixtape and club DJ culture.</p><p>4. AI slop is ruining the world. I have this belief that as AI slop further conquers the internet we are going to get to a place where nobody trusts internet content. People will seek out novelty and authenticity (sort of how LLMs do lol) and I think there will be a return to local content and community.</p><p>5. Commercial radio sucks. The LPFM system is a wonderful opportunity to create a strong, community driven alternative to corporate media.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45561677"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45561677" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45561677&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I built <a href="https://invoicepad.app/" rel="nofollow">https://invoicepad.app</a> which is a free, completely in-browser tool for creating invoices, estimates, and quotes. Yes, similar apps have been posted here before, but none were built the way I envisioned, so I made my own. The key difference: all invoice data is stored in the URL hash, not the querystring. This is important because querystrings are sent to the server with every request, while hashes stay local to your browser. This means I can never see your invoice data, unlike other similar apps. The workflow is simple: use your browser's bookmark manager as your invoice filing system. Or if you want to keep it offline, just copy and paste invoice URLs into a text document for storage. I’ve also included helpful features like saved profiles to save on repeated data input. The next step is to finish working on a browser extension (v1 is being tested) to make bookmarking, editing, and saving changes even easier, that is if I ever stop being distracted by other side projects.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563706"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563706" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563706&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I'm working on Plaid / Perplexity for business data.</p><p>The basic idea is that integrating business data into a B2B app or AI agent process is a pain. On one side there's web data providers (Clearbit, Apollo, ZoomInfo) then on the other, 150 year old legacy providers based on government data (D&amp;B, Factset, Moody's, etc). You'd be surprised to learn how much manual work is still happening - teams of people just manually researching business entities all day.</p><p>At a high level, we're building out a series of composable deep research APIs. It's built on a business graph powered by integrations to global government registrars and a realtime web search index. Our government data index is 265M records so far.</p><p>We're still pretty early and working with enterprise design partners for finance and compliance use cases.

<div><p>Hi HN, I am working on Circuitscript, a language based on python to describe electronic schematics: <a href="https://circuitscript.net/" rel="nofollow">https://circuitscript.net/</a>. A basic IDE (called the Bench) to try Circuitscript is available online: <a href="https://bench.circuitscript.net/" rel="nofollow">https://bench.circuitscript.net/</a></p><p>Since the last month, I have created a complete schematic with Circuitscript, exported the netlist to pcbnew and designed the PCB. The boards have been produced and currently waiting for them to be delivered to verify that it works. Quite excited since this will be the first design ever produced with Circuitscript as the schematic capture tool!</p><p>The motivation for creating Circuitscript is to describe schematics in terms of code rather than graphical UIs after using different CAD packages extensively (Allegro, Altium, KiCAD) in the past. I wanted to spend more time thinking about the schematic design itself rather than fiddling around with GUIs.</p><p>The main language goals are to be easy to write and reason, generated graphical schematics should be displayed according to how the designer wishes so (because this is also part of the design process) and to encourage code reuse.</p><p>Please check it out and I look forward to your feedback, especially from electronics designers/hobbyists. Thanks!</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45563294"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563294" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563294&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

    - Anonymous AI chat via a privacy proxy (provider sees our server, not your IP or account info)
    - End‑to‑end encrypted history, keys derived from password and never leave your device
    - Pay‑as‑you‑go; switch models mid‑chat (OpenAI now; Claude, Gemini and others planned)
    - Practical UX: sort chats into folders, Markdown, copyable code blocks, mobile‑friendly
  - Notes/limits:
    - Not self‑hosted: prompts go to third‑party APIs
    - If you include identifying info, upstream sees it
    - Prompts take a bit long sometimes, because reasoning is set to "medium" for now. Plan to make this adjustable in the future.
  - Looking for feedback:
    - What do you need to trust this? Open source? Independent audit?
    - Gaps in the threat model I'm missing
    - Which UI features and AI models you'd want next
    - Any UX rough edges (esp. mobile)

<div><p>Now that I can finally test on hardware, I completely rewrote input handling. I can now support original NES controllers, but also SNES and the Power Pad dance mat, for anyone crazy enough to try that. The hardest part was working around a particularly nasty hardware bug: if you try to read the input ports on even cycles while one of the sound channels is playing, the data becomes corrupted. Perform the exact same read on an odd cycle and it works every time.</p><p>The solution? Have the cartridge keep track of CPU parity (there's no simple way to do this with just the CPU), then check that, skip one cycle if needed... and very carefully cycle time the rest of the routine, making sure that your reads land on safe cycles, and your writes land in places that won't throw off the alignment.</p><p>But it works! It's quite reliable on every console revision I've thrown it at so far.

<div><p>While working on Shelvica, a personal library management service and reading tracker, I realized I needed a source of data for book information, and none of the solutions available provided all the data I needed. One might provide the series, the other might provide genres, and yet another might provide a cover with good dimensions, but none provided everything.</p><p>So I started working on Librario, an ISBN database that fetches information from several other services, such as Hardcover.app, Google Books, and ISBNDB, merges that information, and return something more complete than using them alone. It also saves that information in the database for future lookups.</p><p>You can see an example response here[1]. Pricing information for books is missing right now because I need to finish the extractor for those, genres need some work[2], and having a 5 months old baby make development a tad slow, but the service is almost ready for a preview.</p><p>The algorithm to decide what to merge is the hardest part, in my opinion, and very basic right now. It's based on a priority and score system for now, where different extractors have different priorities, and different fields have different scores. Eventually, I wanna try doing something with machine learning instead.</p><p>I'd also like to add book summaries to the data somehow, but I haven't figured out a way to do this legally yet. For books in the public domain I could feed the entire book to an LLM and ask them to write a spoiler-free summary of the book, but for other books, that'd land me in legal trouble.</p><p>Oh, and related books, and things of the sort. But I'd like to do that based on the information stored in the database itself instead of external sources, so it's something for the future.</p><p>Last time I posted about Shelvica some people showed interest in Librario instead, so I decided to make it something I can sell instead of just a service I use in Shelvica[3], hence why I'm focusing more on it these past two weeks.</p><p>[1]: <a href="https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/de80132b8f167f4503c31187cf7acc1c2881a79b" rel="nofollow">https://paste.sr.ht/~jamesponddotco/de80132b8f167f4503c31187...</a></p><p>[2]: In the example you'll see genres such as "English" and "Fiction In English", which is mostly noise. Also things like "Humor", "Humorous", and "Humorous Fiction" for the same book.</p><p>[3]: Which is nice, cause that way there are two possible sources of income for the project.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="45562926"><td></td></tr><tr id="45563151"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_45563151" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=45563151&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D45561428"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Some argue that even if the current AI boom leads to an overbuild, it might not be a bad thing – just as the dotcom bubble left behind the internet infrastructure that powered later decades of growth.</p>



<p>It’s a tempting comparison, but the parallels only go so far.</p>



<p>The dotcom era’s overbuild created durable, open infrastructure – fibre networks and interconnects built on open standards like TCP/IP and HTTP. Those systems had multi-decade lifespans and could be reused for whatever came next. Much of the fibre laid in the 1990s still carries traffic today, upgraded simply by swapping out the electronics at each end. That overinvestment became the backbone of broadband, cloud computing, and the modern web.</p>



<div><p>Most of today’s AI investment, by contrast, is flowing into <strong>proprietary, vertically integrated systems</strong> rather than open, general-purpose infrastructure. Most of the money is being spent on incredibly expensive <strong>GPUs that have a 1-3 year lifespan</strong> due to becoming obsolete quickly and wearing out under constant, high-intensity use. These chips aren’t general-purpose compute engines; they’re <strong>purpose-built for training and running generative AI models</strong>, tuned to the specific architectures and software stacks of a few major vendors such as Nvidia, Google, and Amazon.</p><p>These chips live inside <strong>purpose-built AI data centres</strong> – engineered for extreme power density, advanced cooling, and specialised networking. Unlike the general-purpose facilities of the early cloud era, these sites are tightly coupled to the hardware and software of whoever built them. Together, they form a closed ecosystem optimised for scale but hard to repurpose.</p></div>



<p>That’s why, if the AI bubble bursts, we could just be left with <strong>a pile of short-lived, highly specialised silicon and silent cathedrals of compute – monuments from a bygone era</strong>.</p>



<h3>The possible upside</h3>



<p>Still, there’s a more positive scenario.</p>



<p>If investment outruns demand, surplus capacity could push prices down, just as the post-dotcom bandwidth glut did in the early 2000s. Cheap access to this kind of compute might open the door for new experimentation – not just in generative AI, but in other high-compute domains such as simulation, scientific research, and data-intensive analytics. Even if the hardware is optimised for GenAI, falling prices could still make large-scale computation more accessible overall. A second-hand market in AI hardware could emerge, spreading access to powerful compute much more widely.</p>



<p>The supporting infrastructure – power grid upgrades, networking, and edge facilities – will hopefully remain useful regardless. And even if some systems are stranded, the talent, tooling, and operational experience built during the boom will persist, as it did after the dotcom crash.</p>



<h3>Without openness, the benefits stay locked up</h3>



<p>The internet’s long-term value came not just from cheap capacity, but from <strong>open standards and universal access</strong>. Protocols like TCP/IP and HTTP meant anyone could build on the same foundations, without permission or platform lock-in. That openness turned surplus infrastructure into a shared public platform, unlocking decades of innovation far beyond what the original investors imagined.</p>



<p>The AI ecosystem is the opposite: powerful but closed. Its compute, models, and APIs are owned and controlled by a handful of vendors, each defining their own stack and terms of access. Even if hardware becomes cheap, it won’t automatically become open. Without shared standards or interoperability, any overbuild risks remaining a <strong>private surplus</strong> rather than a <strong>public good</strong>.</p>



<p>So the AI boom may not leave behind another decades-long backbone like the internet’s fibre networks. But it could still seed innovation if the industry finds ways to open up what it’s building – turning today’s private infrastructure into tomorrow’s shared platform.</p>

<p dir="auto">Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are the central and indispensable component of Internet security. They comprise a set of technologies that connect geographically dispersed, heterogeneous networks through encrypted tunnels, creating the impression of a homogenous private network on the public shared physical medium.</p>
<p dir="auto">

</p>
<p dir="auto">With traditional solutions (such as OpenVPN / IPSec) starting to run out of steam, Wireguard is increasingly coming to the forefront as a modern, secure data tunneling and encryption method, one that's also easier to manage than the incumbents. Both software and hardware implementations of Wireguard already exist. However, the software performance is far below the speed of wire. Existing hardware approaches are both prohibitively expensive and based on proprietary, closed-source IP blocks and tools.<br></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The intent of this project is to bridge these gaps with an FPGA open-source implementation of Wireguard, written in SystemVerilog HDL.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">A Glimpse into History</h2><a id="user-content-a-glimpse-into-history" aria-label="Permalink: A Glimpse into History" href="#a-glimpse-into-history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We have contributed to the <strong>Blackwire</strong> project, which is a 100Gbps hardware implementation of Wireguard switch based on AMD/Xilinx-proprietary AlveoU50 PC-accelerator card (SmartNIC form-factor), and implementable only with proprietary Vivado toolchain.</p>
<p dir="auto">While working on the <em>Blackwire</em>, we have touched multiple sections, and focused on the novel algorithm for <a href="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/blob/main/0.doc/Wireguard/Scalable-Balanced-Pipelined-IPv6-Lookup.pdf"><em>Balanced Binary Tree Search</em></a> of IP tables. However, the <em>Blackwire</em> hardware platform is expensive and priced out of reach of most educational institutions. Its gateware is written in SpinalHDL, a nice and powerfull but a niche HDL, which has not taken roots in the industry. While <em>Blackwire</em> is now released to open-source, that decision came from their financial hardship -- It was originaly meant for sale. Moreover, the company behind it is subject to disputes and obligations that bring into question the legality of ownership over the codebase they "donated" to the open source community.</p>

<p dir="auto"><strong>Board bring up. In-depth review of Wireguard ecosystem and prior art. Design Blueprint</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">While the board we're using is low cost, it is also not particularly known in the open-source community. We certainly don’t have prior experience with it. In this opening take we will build a solid foundation for efficient project execution. Good preparation is crucial for a smooth run. We thus seek to first <em><code>understand and document what we will be designing: SOC Architecture, Datapath Microarchitecture, Hardware/Software Partitioning, DV and Validation Strategy</code></em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Getting a good feel for our Fmax is also a goal of this take. Artix-7 does not support High-Performance (HP) I/O. Consequently, we cannot push its I/O beyond 600MHz, nor its core logic beyond 100 MHz.</p>

<p dir="auto">Since the WireGuard node essentially functions as an IP router with WireGuard protocol support, we have decided to design the system according to a two-layer architecture: a control plane responsible for managing IP routing processes and executing the WireGuard protocol (managing remote peers, sessions, and keys), and a data plane that will perform IP routing and cryptography processes at wire speed. The control plane will be implemented as software running on a soft CPU, while the data plane will be fully implemented in RTL on an FPGA.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/blob/main/0.doc/Wireguard/wireguard-fpga-muxed-Architecture-HW-SW-Partitioning.webp"><img src="https://github.com/chili-chips-ba/wireguard-fpga/raw/main/0.doc/Wireguard/wireguard-fpga-muxed-Architecture-HW-SW-Partitioning.webp" alt="HWSWPartitioning"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">In the HW/SW partitioning diagram, we can observe two types of network traffic: control traffic, which originates from the control plane and goes toward the external network (and vice versa), and data traffic, which arrives from the external network and, after processing in the data plane, returns to the external network. Specifically, control traffic represents WireGuard protocol handshake messages, while data traffic consists of end-user traffic, either encrypted or in plaintext, depending on the perspective.</p>

<p dir="auto">The hardware architecture essentially follows the HW/SW partitioning and consists of two domains: a soft CPU for the control plane and RTL for the data plane.</p>
<p dir="auto">The soft CPU is equipped with a Boot ROM and a DDR3 SDRAM controller for interfacing with off-chip memory. External memory is exclusively used for control plane processes and does not store packets. The connection between the control and data planes is established through a CSR-based HAL.</p>
<p dir="auto">The data plane consists of several IP cores, including data plane engine (DPE) and supporting components, which are listed and explained in the direction of network traffic propagation:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><em>PHY Controller</em> - initial configuration of Realtek PHYs and monitoring link activity (link up/down events)</li>
<li><em>1G MAC</em> - execution of the 1G Ethernet protocol (framing, flow control, FCS, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Rx FIFOs</em> - clock domain crossing, bus width conversion, and store &amp; forward packet handling</li>
<li><em>Per-Packet Round Robin Multiplexer</em> - servicing Rx FIFOs on a per-packet basis using a round-robin algorithm</li>
<li><em>Header Parser</em> - extraction of WireGuard-related information from packet headers (IP addresses, UDP ports, WireGuard message type, peer ID, etc.)</li>
<li><em>Wireguard/UDP Packet Disassembler</em> - decapsulation of the payload from the Wireguard data packet for decryption of tunneled traffic</li>
<li><em>ChaCha20-Poly1305 Decryptor</em> - decryption and authentication of tunneled traffic</li>
<li><em>IP Lookup Engine</em> - routing/forwarding table lookup, mapping packets to the appropriate WireGuard peer, and making packet accept/reject decisions</li>
<li><em>ChaCha20-Poly1305 Encryptor</em> - encryption and authentication of traffic to be tunneled</li>
<li><em>Wireguard/UDP Packet Assembler</em> - encapsulation of the encrypted packet into a WireGuard data packet for tunneling to the remote peer</li>
<li><em>Per-Packet Demultiplexer</em> - forwarding packets to Tx FIFOs based on packet type and destination</li>

In January, music journalist Liz Pelly released Mood Machine, a critical history arguing the streaming company has ruined the industry and turned listeners into “passive, uninspired consumers”.

Though she is not a musician, Dukich describes herself, along with her friend and art gallery worker Manasa Karthikeyan, as “really into sound”.</p><p>She and Karthikeyan decided to start similar conversations. “Spotify is enmeshed in how we engage with music,” Dukich says. “We thought it would be great to talk about our relationship to streaming – what it means to actually take our files off and learn how to do that together.” Death to Spotify was born.</p><p>The goal, in short, was “down with algorithmic listening, down with royalty theft, down with AI-generated music”.</p><p>Karthikeyan says the responsibility of quitting Spotify lies as much with listeners as artists. “You have to accept that you won’t have instant access to everything,” she says. “That makes you think harder about what you support.”</p><p>But will either musicians or listeners actually have the nerve to actually boycott the app longterm?</p><p>Several famous musicians have pulled their catalogues from Spotify with big, headline-grabbing announcements over the years, only to quietly come crawling back to the platform after some time. One of the app’s most popular artists, Taylor Swift, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/09/shaken-it-off-taylor-swift-ends-spotify-spat" data-link-name="in body link">boycotted</a> the service for three years in protest of its unfair payment practices but returned in 2017. Radiohead’s frontman. Thom Yorke, removed some his solo projects for the same reason in 2013, calling Spotify “the last desperate fart of a dying corpse”; he later put them back.</p><p>Neil Young and Joni Mitchell left the app in 2022, citing the company’s exclusive deal with anti-vax podcast host Joe Rogan; both Canadian singer-songwriters contracted polio as children in the 1950s. They, too, later restored their catalogues on Spotify.</p><p>Eric Drott, a professor of music at the University of Texas at Austin, says the new wave of boycotts feels different. “These acts are less famous. For years, artists knew streaming wouldn’t make them rich but needed the visibility. Now there’s so much music out there, people are questioning whether it’s doing much for them.”</p><p>Will Anderson, frontman of Hotline TNT, says there’s “a 0% chance” his band will return. “It doesn’t make sense for true music lovers to be on there,” he says. “Spotify’s end game is for you not to think about what’s playing.” When the band sold their new record Raspberry Moon directly through Bandcamp and a 24-hour Twitch stream, they sold hundreds of copies and “generated thousands of dollars”.</p><figure id="1b2ee962-a974-4dc7-b814-4b4c715bbc7b" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Two people pose for a photo outside in the dark" src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f377d2b9936a3a00daa203f1dfcab1643406a86/0_0_7360_4912/master/7360.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.9891304347826" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Manasa Karthikeyan (left) and Stephanie Dukich.</span> Photograph: Eva Tuff</figcaption></figure><p>Others such as pop-rock songwriter Caroline Rose are experimenting too.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<a id="top_ref"></a>

<p>This post is about an important, but also scary, prompt injection discovery that leads to full system compromise of the developer’s machine in <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53773">GitHub Copilot and VS Code</a>.</p>
<p><strong>It is achieved by placing Copilot into YOLO mode by modifying the project’s <code>settings.json</code> file.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/episode12-yt.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/episode12-yt.png" alt="vscode episode 18"></a></p>
<p>As described a few days ago with <a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/amp-agents-that-modify-system-configuration-and-escape/">Amp</a>, a vulnerability pattern in agents that might be overlooked is that if an agent can write to files and modify its own configuration or update security-relevant settings it can lead to remote code execution. This is not uncommon and is an area to always look for when performing a security review.</p>
<h2 id="background-research">Background Research</h2>
<p>When looking at VS Code and GitHub Copilot Agent Mode I noticed a strange behavior… it can create and write to files in the workspace without user approval.</p>
<p>The edits are immediately persistent, they are not in-memory as a diff to review. The modifications are written to disk right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/agents-that-can.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/agents-that-can.png" alt="vscode agents that can modify their own settings"></a></p>
<p>It’s one of these things that as a red teamer you know is probably not good… so I was looking if this could be used to escalate privileges and execute code.</p>
<h3 id="yolo-mode"><strong>YOLO Mode</strong></h3>
<p>So, next I researched features in VS Code that depend on settings that are within the project/workspace folder, and quickly found an interesting one.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/vscode-documentation-settings-json.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/vscode-documentation-settings-json.png" alt="vscode-exp-yolo-mode"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that in the <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> file one can add the following line:</p>
<p><code>"chat.tools.autoApprove": true</code></p>
<p><strong>This will put GitHub Copilot in YOLO mode.</strong></p>
<p>And it disables all user confirmations, and we can run shell commands, browse the web, and more!</p>
<p>What is interesting is that this is an experimental feature, but it is still present by default. I did not download a special version or set my VS Code overall into an experimental mode.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it works on Windows, macOS and also Linux.</p>
<h2 id="exploit-chain-explained">Exploit Chain Explained</h2>
<p>The proof-of-concept exploit chain to hijack Copilot and escalate privileges is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The attack starts with a prompt injection planted in a source code file, web page, GitHub issue, tool call response, or other content… The payload can also use invisible text as instructions.</li>
<li>The prompt injection first adds the line <strong>“chat.tools.autoApprove”: true,</strong> to the <code>~/.vscode/settings.json</code> file. Folder and file will be created if they don’t exist yet.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Copilot immediately enters YOLO mode!</strong></li>
<li>Attack runs a Terminal command. <strong>And using conditional prompt injection we can actually target what to run based on the operating system.</strong></li>
<li>We achieved Remote Code Execution powered by Prompt Injection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a screenshot that shows the demo file with the prompt injection, the developer interacting with the file on the right side in the chat box, and the calculator popping up!</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/copilot-chat-result.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/copilot-chat-result.png" alt="vscode-e2e-calc"></a></p>
<p>Of course any other means of prompt injection delivery, like web or data coming back from an MCP server is an attack angle. I just used it inside the source code file because it’s easiest to test with.</p>
<h2 id="video-walkthrough">Video Walkthrough</h2>
<h3 id="short-demos">Short Demos</h3>
<p>Here is a demonstration video that shows the code execution on Windows.</p>

<p>Here is a longer form video explaining the discovery and exploit in detail:</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Qzqgqxp5ho" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


  

<p><strong>AI that can set its own permissions and configuration settings is wild!</strong></p>
<h2 id="joining-the-workstation-to-a-botnet---zombais">Joining the Workstation to a Botnet - ZombAIs</h2>
<p>Of course, this means we can join the developer’s machine to a botnet as a <strong>ZombAI</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, for fun we can modified the <code>settings.json</code> file to switch VS Code into a <code>Red</code> color scheme and similar things.</p>
<p>It doesn’t end here though! This also means we can build an actual AI virus that attaches to files and propagates as developers download and interact with infected files.</p>
<p>Last but not least, to demonstrate that we have full control of the developer’s host, we show that Copilot can be hijacked to download malware, and join a remote command and control server.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/github-agent-e2e-zombai.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2025/github-agent-e2e-zombai.png" alt="vscode-zombai-deployment"></a></p>
<p>This means the door is open for malware, ransomware, info stealers, etc.</p>
<p>Scary stuff.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-ai-virus">Building an AI Virus</h2>
<p>When seeing this, one will notice that this basically allows the creation of a virus. An attacker can embed instructions and once they gain code execution, additional malware can compromise other Git projects (and RAG sources) to embed the malicious instructions, and commit the changes or even force push them upstream.</p>
<p>This can lead to further spread as other developers unknowingly propagate the infected code.</p>
<p><strong>Finally, we also need to talk about invisible instructions!</strong></p>
<h2 id="using-invisible-instructions">Using Invisible Instructions</h2>
<p>One might say that it would be quickly discovered if instructions are embedded as comments. So in order to make it a bit more interesting, I went ahead and created an invisible payload that achieves the attack chain, but is not visible to users. This was not as reliable, but it still worked:</p>
<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqW3eL8RpQc" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>


  

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the demo here with invisible instructions worked multiple times for me, using invisible instructions often leads to the exploit being very unreliable, and is also commonly also refused by the model and there is also typically a visual indicator that VS Code shows about Unicode characters. However, attacks (and models) get better over time. It’s also worth highlighting that not all models are vulnerable to such invisible prompt injection attacks.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations-and-fix">Recommendations and Fix</h2>
<p>There are actually more attack angles then just the YOLO mode example I shared. When Microsoft asked me if there is any more info I have, I had looked a bit more and noticed there are other problematic places, for instance <code>.vscode/tasks.json</code> that the AI can write to, or adding fake malicious MCP servers, etc which can lead to code execution. And the AI can reconfigure the user interface and configuration settings of the project.</p>
<p><strong>Recently I noticed that developers often use multiple agents, so there is also the threat of overwriting other agent configuration files (allow-list bash commands, add MCP servers…), as they are commonly in the project folder as well.</strong></p>
<p>Ideally, the AI would not be able to modify files without a human first approving it. Many other editors do show the diff, which then can be approved by the developer.</p>
<h2 id="responsible-disclosure">Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>After reporting the vulnerability on June 29, 2025 Microsoft confirmed the repro and asked a few follow up questions. A few weeks later MSRC pointed out that it is an issue they were already tracking, and that it will be patched by August. With the August Patch Tuesday release this is now fixed.</p>
<p>Shout out to <a href="https://x.com/marver">Markus Vervier</a> from <a href="https://persistent-security.net/">Persistent Security </a> who has also identified and reported this vulnerability to Microsoft. You can find their write-up <a href="https://www.persistent-security.net/post/part-iii-vscode-copilot-wormable-command-execution-via-prompt-injection">here</a>. And also a shout out to <a href="https://x.com/Ari_MaccariTA">Ari Marzuk</a> who seems to also have discovered it in parallel.</p>
<p>Thanks to the members of the MSRC and product team for the help in getting it mitigated.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is another example of how an AI agent might not stay in its box! By modifying its own environment GitHub Copilot can escalate privileges and execute code to compromise the developer’s machine. It’s a not uncommon design flaw in agentic systems as I have discovered.</p>
<p>Keep looking out for such design flaws, these should be easily caught during threat modeling.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <p>In one of his stand-up sets, comedian David Cross <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DMIoqZOO5sF/?hl=en">rejects all political commentary</a> that tries to answer the question, “What would America’s Founding Fathers think if they were alive today?” </p>

<p>For Cross, it is pointless to speculate about the present-day views of men who could not have imagined cotton candy, let alone the machine that makes it. </p>

<p>“What’s a machine? What’s a machine???” he screams in their collective voice, recoiling from the sorcery of the state fair.</p>

<p>The first time I saw this bit, something odd happened. Having just read the 1776 political pamphlet “Common Sense,” I could hear its author, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.lifeofthomaspain00lint/?st=gallery">one of America’s founders</a>, laughing louder than anybody. </p>

<p>That would be Thomas Paine, the man credited with turning the American Revolution from a complicated Colonial fracas into a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/10/16/the-sharpened-quill">titanic struggle for the soul of liberty itself</a>. </p>

<p>If Cross is skeptical that anything 250 years old still holds up, Paine, were he alive today, could probably name one thing: skepticism. Ways of thinking and being do not grow out of the ground; we make them ourselves, then hand them down as best we can. Paine would smile to see his favorite heirloom, the skeptical worldview, still intact. </p>

<p>Saying “no” – especially to those in power – is an <a href="https://iep.utm.edu/american-enlightenment-thought/">underrated American pastime</a>, and Paine was its Babe Ruth. If you plan on joining No Kings rallies and have yet to find a slogan for your sign, Paine’s got you covered: “In America, the law is king!” “No King! No Tyranny!” “Monarchy hath poisoned the republic.” </p>

<p>I could go on. Because he did. </p>

<h2>Birth of a revolutionary</h2>

<p>Where did all this anti-monarchical fire come from? Originally, from a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Paine">small town in Norfolk, England, in 1737</a>. Turning from his father’s trade of corset-making, Paine tried his hand at business, <a href="https://www.laits.utexas.edu/gov310/CF/Paine_Sense/index.html">met and impressed Benjamin Franklin in London</a>, sailed to America, and there found his true metier as a pamphleteer and radical.  </p>

<p>Using simple yet incandescent prose, Paine <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery">renounced, repudiated and ridiculed</a> at a clip seldom witnessed in print before or since. <a href="https://archive.org/details/PaineRightsOfMan/mode/2up">Hereditary privilege, colonialism</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcmassbookdig.ageofreason00pain_0/?st=gallery">the supernatural</a>: no, no, no. </p>

<p>But what Paine made his name lambasting – what he knocked out of the park with almost steroidal force – <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/gdcscd.00538951171/?st=gallery">were kings</a>. All of them, from the figures of ancient legend and Scripture to those who warmed England’s throne during his lifetime. </p>

<p>“<a href="https://loveman.sdsu.edu/docs/1776ThomasPaine.pdf">Common Sense,” his first major work</a>, was an urgent wake-up call to every light-sleeping lover of liberty within earshot. In that pamphlet, Paine labels kingship “the most prosperous invention the Devil ever set on foot for the promotion of idolatry.” He never minced words; he wanted the right people to choke on them.  </p>

<h2>‘Simple facts, plain arguments’</h2>

<p>Exactly what was Paine’s problem with kings? </p>

<p>The same problem you’ll have, “Common Sense” promises, when you examine the evidence.</p>

<p>This is partly the secret of Paine’s rhetorical power: It’s hard to imagine any wordsmith demanding more vigorously that you not take his word for it. </p>

<p>Paine was a student of history, and history is chock-full of receipts. It shows that abuses of kingly power extend back to the “early ages of monarchy,” when some “principal ruffian” first took power, and “it was very easy, after the lapse of a few generations, to trump up some superstitious tale, conveniently timed … to cram hereditary right down the throats of the vulgar.” </p>

<p>Since that time, says Paine, even those fortunate enough to live under benevolent rule have seldom been more than one generation away from yet another dreadful monarch. </p>

<p>“One of the strongest NATURAL proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings, is, that nature disapproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule by giving mankind an ASS FOR A LION.” What a tweet this would have made, caps and all.</p>

<h2>Bring the Paine</h2>

<p>The only thing Paine liked less than monarchical rule was its enablers, anyone who relinquished their freedom willingly to an aspiring tyrant.</p>

<p>This is not only wrong, Paine insists, but against nature, since all of us are created equal. </p>

<p>But even that’s not the worst part. Those who sacrifice their own freedom on the altar of monarchy also sacrifice that of future generations. Their “unwise, unjust, unnatural compact might (perhaps) in the next succession put them under the government of a rogue or a fool.” Ouch.</p>

<p>“Most wise men,” Paine adds, “in their private sentiments, have ever treated hereditary right with contempt; yet it is one of those evils, which when once established is not easily removed; many submit from fear, others from superstition, and the more powerful part shares with the king the plunder of the rest.” </p>

<p><a href="https://www.govexec.com/transition/2025/04/project-2025-wanted-hobble-federal-workforce-doge-has-hastily-done-and-more/404390/">Federal worker firings</a>, <a href="https://theconversation.com/abcs-and-cbss-settlements-with-trump-are-a-dangerous-step-toward-the-commander-in-chief-becoming-the-editor-in-chief-261006">court settlements</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/series/g-s1-91413/government-shutdown-2025">a government shutdown</a>. Paine would loathe how right the U.S. is proving him.</p>

<p>Besides criticizing both tradition and manipulative elites for their role in abetting monarchs, Paine’s writing gestures toward a more widely accessible sense of false freedom that comes with getting what you want from whoever happens to wear the crown. </p>

<p>This kind of pleasure obscures a painful reality: that the tyrant can strike as well as stroke. </p>

<p>The problem of unchecked power is not nearly counterbalanced by any number of indulgences the wielder of that power deigns to bestow. Freedom, Paine insists, is not transactional; whatever price you name, you’re getting fleeced.   </p>

<p>Or, to put it his way: “O ye that love mankind! Ye that dare oppose, not only the tyranny, but the tyrant, stand forth!”</p>

All dog owners provided written informed consent for their participation.</p><h4 id="Sec6">Subjects</h4><p>One hundred twenty-six dog-owner teams were recruited via advertisements on social media. In the first call, any play-motivated dog was welcome to participate. In a second call, we specifically sought dogs showing ‘excessive’ motivation for toy play.</p><p>Twenty-one of the 126 tested dogs were excluded from the analysis as they were (1) outside the target age range (&lt; 1 year or &gt; 10 years old; <i>N</i> = 9), (2) did not complete the test due to fatigue (<i>N</i> = 1), (3) did not play at all or were too fearful for pulse measurements (<i>N</i> = 7), or (4) due to disturbances during the test (e.g. owners bringing young children along, <i>N</i> = 4).

Eighty-two owners (72 women and 10 men) participated in the study.</p><h4 id="Sec7">Experimental set-up</h4><p>Behaviour tests took place in an experimental room (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0#Fig1">1</a>), measuring 5.22&nbsp;m x 3.36&nbsp;m. A wooden partition wall divided the room into two parts so that the effective testing space was 3.60&nbsp;m x 3.36&nbsp;m. The room was furnished with two chairs and several shelves on the walls. One of the chairs was placed in front of the wooden partition wall (facing the entrance door), and the other was placed at a 90° angle against the wall to the left. In front of both chairs, a taped line marked a one-meter distance from the chairs. During the habituation phase, the opaque box in which a toy or food was enclosed during several subtests (hereafter, unsolvable task box) was placed next to the experimenter’s chair.</p><p>Four video cameras (IB8377-H; 4 MP, 30 fps, H.264, WDR Pro, IR, PoE, IP66, 2.8–12&nbsp;mm) were placed in the room, and recordings were made using the recorder system (ND9441P NVR, 16-CH, 4HDD, H.265, HDMI/VGA, 16x PoE).</p><div data-test="figure" data-container-section="figure" id="figure-1" data-title="Fig. 1"><figure><figcaption><b id="Fig1" data-test="figure-caption-text">Fig. 1</b></figcaption><div><div><a data-test="img-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="image" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0/figures/1" rel="nofollow"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-18636-0/MediaObjects/41598_2025_18636_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp"><img aria-describedby="Fig1" src="https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41598-025-18636-0/MediaObjects/41598_2025_18636_Fig1_HTML.png" alt="figure 1" loading="lazy" width="685" height="292"></picture></a></div><p>Experimental room with the experimenter and owner in the starting position.</p></div><p><a data-test="article-link" data-track="click" data-track-label="button" data-track-action="view figure" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0/figures/1" data-track-dest="link:Figure1 Full size image" aria-label="Full size image figure 1" rel="nofollow"><span>Full size image</span></a></p></figure></div><h4 id="Sec8">Methods</h4><p>The test battery consisted of 14 subtests assessing various aspects of toy motivation in dogs. Play behaviour per se cannot be used to infer addictive-like behaviour, which is characterised primarily by reactions when the reward is unavailable; therefore, only subtests relevant to exploring behavioural addiction criteria are described in detail hereafter. The complete description of the play motivation test is available under: <a href="https://figshare.com/s/dfd6d12d922f7543b96c">https://figshare.com/s/dfd6d12d922f7543b96c</a>.</p><h5 id="Sec9">Procedure</h5>
                      <h3 id="FPar1">Room habituation</h3>
                      <p>After the owner and the dog had entered the test room, the dog was unleashed, and a 3-minute habituation phase commenced (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0#Fig1">1</a>). Meanwhile, the owner and the experimenter were seated on their allocated chairs, and the experimenter explained the test procedure. The owner signed the consent form. The owners were instructed to interact with the dog only when asked to perform one of the subtests and not to use food during testing unless absolutely necessary (such as exchanging food for a toy if the dog was unwilling to relinquish it).</p>
                    
                      <h3 id="FPar2">Choosing the toy</h3>
                      <p>After the habituation phase, the experimenter retrieved a box containing various commercial dog toys of different sizes and textures, with and without squeakers, etc., from the adjacent storage room. Only toys that might be associated with food enrichment were excluded. The owner was asked to select three toys (one ball, one tug toy and one plush toy) which they thought the dog would like the most. If the owner had brought the dog’s favourite toy from home, this toy was used in the subsequent preference test along with two other toys. </p>
                      <p>After removing the toy box from the room, the experimenter returned to the test room. The owner recalled the dog and sat down on their chair, holding the dog behind the Line marking the 1&nbsp;m distance from the chair. Opposite the dog at the front of the room, the experimenter placed the three toys on the floor in a row, 40&nbsp;cm apart. After the experimenter had returned to her chair, the owner released the dog, who could now explore and play with the toys for 30&nbsp;s. The two people present did not interact with the dog during this time. The toy the dog spent the most time interacting with was used for subsequent testing. Forty-five dogs selected a ball, nine selected a tug toy, 39 selected a plush toy, and 12 selected a hybrid toy (plush ball: N = 3; tug with a ball: N = 6; plush tug: N = 3).&nbsp;On rare occasions, the dog did not show interest in any of the toys. In this case, the owner was asked to choose the type of toy the dog was usually most interested in at home. The chosen toy was used throughout the experiment, and the remaining two toys were placed on the shelf out of reach and sight of the dog. If the preferred toy was not a tug toy, the tug toy was used in subtests where the owner or experimenter played tug-of-war with the dog.</p>

Applicable sub-criteria were rated for each minute of the test, and for analysis, each sub-criterion was assigned a score between 0 and 2 points, as detailed in Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0#Tab2">2</a>. The points from all the subtests, including the cool-down period, were added to yield the AB-T score. The maximum possible value of the AB-T score was 120 points. A cut-off point for addictive-like behaviour was defined by a data range split divided into two halves. Dogs scoring equal to or above the mid-point (44.2 points)&nbsp;are referred to as dogs showing a high tendency for addictive-like behaviour or high-AB dogs.</p><p>Dogs scoring less than 44.2 points are referred to as low-AB dogs (dogs with a low tendency for addictive-like behaviour). The sub-criteria included in the Addictive-like Behaviour Test score (as detailed in Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0#Tab2">2</a>) were selected as they were assumed to be relatively independent of the level of obedience and training. Dogs might have been trained to drop a toy on a cue and to exert impulse control and refrain from jumping towards the toy in the experimenter’s hand; therefore, these variables were not included in the AB-T score. However, behaviours such as staring at the toy or pacing are believed to be less subject to training and were included.</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-2"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab2" data-test="table-caption">Table 2 Variables included in the AB-T score and representation of the scoring system.</b></figcaption><p><a data-test="table-link" data-track="click" data-track-action="view table" data-track-label="button" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0/tables/2" aria-label="Full size table 2"><span>Full size table</span></a></p></figure></div><h4 id="Sec15">Presence/absence of behavioural addiction criteria</h4><p>Separately from the AB-T variables, in each subtest, the addiction criteria Salience, Craving, Mood modification, and Lack of self-control were rated each minute as present or absent based on the occurrence of pre-defined behaviours. For instance, Salience was inferred from searching for a toy although there was an »attractive alternative« (food, owner inviting the dog to play). Craving was based on the dog focusing mainly on the toy (&gt; 50%) and medium to high arousal directed at the inaccessible toy (inferred from behaviours such as panting, restlessness, and high muscle tension). We further coded behaviours that are usually characteristic of high arousal in some dogs, e.g., pacing, jumping towards the toy, and vocalising (see Table&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="table anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-18636-0#Tab3">3</a>). If at least one of the pre-defined behaviours was expressed, the respective addiction criterion was coded as present. Tolerance, Withdrawal symptoms and Risk of relapse after abstinence could not be tested in the setting of the play motivation test since they develop over time.</p><p>For each subtest, a summary score for each of the four addiction criteria was computed by summing up the points for each minute of the subtest.</p><div data-test="inline-table" data-container-section="table" id="table-3"><figure><figcaption><b id="Tab3" data-test="table-caption">Table 3 Behavioural addiction (BA) criteria coded as present or absent (1/0) for each subtest.

Contrary to the prediction, mood modification (when given access to a toy) did not differ between high and low-AB dogs. In retrospect, however, this lack of difference between the two groups strengthens our argument that we were measuring a phenotype beyond mere enjoyment of play. Still, despite the significant differences between high- and low-AB dogs in the other investigated addiction criteria, Salience, Craving and Loss of Self Control, there was generally high variation between individuals.</p><p>In line with the predictions, high-AB dogs showed higher durations of focusing on and trying to access an inaccessible toy than low-AB dogs, often prioritising attempting to access the toy over eating or interacting with the owner. Thus, there was general agreement between the three alternative methods of coding the data (detailed behaviour score, addiction criteria, and quantitative coding), indicating internal consistency.</p><p>The external validity of the behaviour test was demonstrated by significant associations of the AB-T score with 18 out of 19 questions from the addictive-like behaviour questionnaire filled in by the dogs’ owners, intended to measure addictive-like behaviour in everyday life. Nonetheless, although significant, the effect sizes were relatively low, indicating that no single question would have predictive value for assessing a tendency for addictive-like behaviour in dogs.</p><p>In studies using animal models of substance addiction, one way to differentiate an addiction from drug use that occurs due to lack of choice is to present the subject with a choice between the addictive substance and other highly desirable stimuli. If an individual continues to take the drug at the expense of these other options (such as consumption of a food reward), this points to the possibility of addictive-like behaviour<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 77" title="Ahmed, S.

However, this subtest was not a good measure of addictive-like behaviour: Time spent interacting with the toy while the dog was alone did not differ significantly between high-AB and low-AB dogs. For welfare reasons, we decided against exposing the dogs to more severe stressors; however, it cannot be ruled out that this subtest was not “aversive” enough. The dog was left alone for only 30 seconds, and the subtest took place in the middle of the test when the dogs were already habituated to the test room. It is also possible that individual differences in subjects’ separation distress, independent of play motivation, affected the results. Additionally, there was no clear contingency between interacting with the toy and the ‘adverse’ outcome (owner leaving). Future studies could potentially enhance the design by providing the dog with an explicit choice, such as by placing the toy in a separate room, away from the owner and the experimenter. This could help determine whether the dog is willing to risk being alone in an unusual or new environment when it normally prefers the safety of being near its owner. Such a design would better reflect the conflict between competing motivations (social security vs. reward seeking) and could offer a more valid test of the criterion of persistence under adversity.</p><p>Still, the importance of continued efforts to engage in the behaviour despite adverse consequences was demonstrated in the questionnaire, where one of the highest associations with the AB-T score was found with the question, “My dog will continue to play with a ball/toy despite adverse consequences”. This suggests that some dogs may fulfil the criterion of continuing the addictive-like behaviour despite adverse consequences in real life, even if this could not be demonstrated in the behaviour test.</p><p>A critical factor in addiction is the propensity to attribute incentive salience to classically conditioned cues predicting rewards<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 87" title="Flagel, S.

As no gold standard exists, the study is exploratory, and our categorisation of dogs into high and low addictive-like behaviour groups, determined by a data range split, was somewhat arbitrary.

Owners may unintentionally project their perceptions or expectations onto their dogs’ behaviours, potentially leading to discrepancies between reported and observed behaviours in behavioural test. This is particularly relevant in cases where owners have multiple dogs, as they are likely to compare their pets to one another, influencing their assessment, such as by underestimating or overestimating certain behaviours.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been using Helix as my editor to develop on remote servers for quite some time now.</p><p>There are a lot of emerging supply-chain attacks, and I simply don't like the idea of installing tens of plugins to Vim/Neovim to make the editor usable.</p><p>To make the switch from Neovim easier, I had to make some changes to the configuration. I want to share them to save you some time, because discovering them is not straightforward.</p><h2>Tmux setup</h2><p>I use tmux as a terminal multiplexer.</p><p>One thing that I miss from Neovim setup is a good file manager and TUI for git. I rarely use a file manager, but when I need to, I usually want to move a bunch of selected files quickly. Unfortunately, Helix does not support file editing in the explorer. You can only view them.</p><p>To overcome it, I added new keybindings to my tmux config:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span># Yazi related</span>

<span>set</span><span> </span>-ga<span> </span>update-environment<span> </span>TERM

</code></pre></div><p>When I hit one of the keys, a new pop-up window opens.</p><ul><li><code>prefix - y</code> - opens <code>yazi</code> file manager</li><li><code>prefix - g</code> - opens <code>lazygit</code></li><li><code>prefix - e</code> - opens Helix editor with tmux output history.</li></ul><p>The default prefix for tmux is <code>Ctrl + b</code>, but I'm using <code>Ctrl + \</code>.</p><p>The last binding is useful when you want to work with terminal output in your editor. I use it to search the history using regexes or copy selected output quickly. For example, I use it quite a lot to copy output from <code>clickhouse</code> client that outputs SQL results in CSV or JSON to the terminal. Although it can output it to a file, that's an extra step, since I usually only need to copy-paste the output to Slack. This can be done via mouse, but painful with tmux setup, since you need to scroll the buffer when the output does not fit in one screen.</p><p>The <code>yazi</code> and <code>lazygit</code> tools are usually opened on top of the Helix Editor.</p><p><img src="https://rushter.com/static/uploads/img/2025/yazi.png"></p><h2>Vim bindings</h2><p>I'm pretty used to Helix keybinds now, but there are still some bindings that I ported from vim:</p><div><pre><span></span><code><span>[keys.select]</span>

Discovering them took me some time.</p><p>In my opinion, the most useful are: file reloading, soft wrap toggle, git undo, and git blame.</p><p>Here is a full list of my custom bindings:</p><ul><li><code>space - e - w</code> - Write current buffer to file.</li><li><code>space - e - c</code> - Close current buffer.</li><li><code>space - e - x</code> - Close other buffers. This is useful when you have tens of buffers open.</li><li><code>space - e - l</code> - Toggle inlay type hints.

This is very useful, since Helix does not support auto-reloading right now. When a file gets changes externally or when I commit changes, I press this keybinding to update the gutters and sync file changes.</li><li><code>space - f - x</code> - Undo git change at the current cursor.</li><li><code>space - f - w</code> - Show git blame for the current line.</li></ul><div><pre><span></span><code><span>[keys.normal.space]</span>

</p>

<p>Inside the "Remind me again in" label are the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 Week</li>
<li>30 days</li>
</ul>

<p>And when I select one option, what does "No thanks" do? Does it dismiss the box entirely and I never have to see it? Or does it validate the reminder schedule? What if I just don't want OneDrive? Microsoft has embedded it so deep into Windows that there are no easy ways of getting rid of it. I would understand if they had asked me when I set up my machine the first time, but why every single time?</p>

<p>This is the illusion of choice. It is "Get it now" or "Get it later". What I'm looking for is the "Get it never option!"</p>

<p>Dark patterns at their finest.</p>

            <p>European nations have generally been more progressive in adopting open source solutions for government operations. Sure, regressive proposals like the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/E-10-2025-003250_EN.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com">EU Chat Control</a> bill make headlines, but there's genuine progress happening too.</p><p>The German state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schleswig-Holstein?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Schleswig-Holstein</a> is back in the news for its open source efforts. This time, it's their email system that's undergone a complete transformation.</p><h2 id="microsoft-booted-out-again">Microsoft Booted Out, Again</h2><p>Schleswig-Holstein has <a href="https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/landesregierung/ministerien-behoerden/I/_startseite/Artikel2025/IV/251006_ox-umstellung-abschluss?ref=news.itsfoss.com">successfully migrated</a> (<em>in Deutsch</em>) its entire state administration email system from Microsoft Exchange and Outlook to open source alternatives, <a href="https://www.open-xchange.com/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Open-Xchange</a> and <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Thunderbird</a>. The German state completed the transition on October 2, 2025, after a six-month process.</p><p>The <strong>migration affected around 30,000 employees</strong> across various government departments. This includes the State Chancellery, ministries, judiciary, state police, and other state authorities. Over <strong>40,000 mailboxes</strong> containing more than <strong>100 million emails and calendar entries</strong> were moved to the new system.</p><p>The state has adopted Open-Xchange as its email server solution and Thunderbird as the email client.</p><p>Of course, the transition wasn't without challenges. Digitization Minister <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dirk-schr%C3%B6dter-012866226/?ref=news.itsfoss.com">Dirk Schrödter</a> previously acknowledged <a href="https://www.heise.de/en/news/Open-source-migration-Schleswig-Holstein-s-digital-minister-admits-problems-10667872.html?ref=news.itsfoss.com">problems during migration</a> to open source software, including downtime and delays in email traffic. Despite these hurdles, this particular move has now been completed successfully.</p><p>Plus, this switch fits into Schleswig-Holstein's broader open source strategy that has been in development for several years. The state <a href="https://news.itsfoss.com/german-state-ditches-microsoft/">began rolling out LibreOffice</a> as its standard office software last year, gradually replacing Microsoft Office across all state computers.</p><p>Dirk also emphasized that:</p><blockquote>We are real pioneers. We can't fall back on the experience of others –, there is hardly a comparable project of this magnitude anywhere in the world. <p>In future, we will be able to use our experience from data analysis to monitoring in the data centre to help others and support them when they embark on the path that we are currently the first to take.</p></blockquote><div><p>📋</p><p>The above-mentioned quote was translated from Deutsch (German).</p></div><h3 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h3><p>Well, <strong>I like what I see here</strong>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><span><p>Long COVID (LC) impacts one in five children after an acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. Typical LC symptoms include fatigue, brain fog, pain, and shortness of breath, which can significantly impact individuals and society. Moreover, LC may impair school performance and have long-term health and development consequences. However, the diagnosis of LC is often imprecise and cumbersome, delaying appropriate care. To address the LC diagnosis challenges, we focused on fibrinaloid clots (microclots), recently proposed as contributing to LC’s underlying mechanisms. We overcame the limitations of current microclot assessment methods, which are qualitative, by developing a microfluidic device to quantify the number of microclots in patient blood samples.  We found significantly higher microclot levels in samples from pediatric LC patients than from healthy children. We evaluated the diagnostic power of the device in a cohort of 45 LC patients and 14 healthy pediatric donors. We estimated a 94% accuracy for the microclot count using the devices, significantly higher than the traditional counting of microclots on slides (66% accuracy). Intriguingly, we found the highest microclot counts in samples from patients with persistent SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the blood. Further studies will evaluate the utility of the assay as a screening test for Long COVID in larger populations and for assessing treatment responses.</p></span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>It is unlikely that you will ever happen upon an editor who will argue that <b>Wikipedia cannot claim that the Earth is not flat</b>. But you may indeed encounter some who will strenuously maintain that a particular "breakthrough", or a "notable" or "controversial" idea, belief, or theory deserves more consideration than it has received in the academic world. Using the <a href="#Historical_note">Flat Earth example (below)</a> as a metaphor, this essay will examine ten types of arguments commonly used by advocates of fringe concepts and advise the neutrally-minded editor or administrator on how to defuse them.
</p>
<meta property="mw:PageProp/toc">

<p>It is the stated goal of Wikipedia to mirror the current consensus of mainstream scholarship – in the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOT" title="Wikipedia:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, "accepted knowledge". Self-evidently, the mainstream view of what is <i>accepted</i> knowledge in a discipline has the largest following and as such the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">due weight</a> in the literature. The encyclopedia does not act as an advocate for, or passionately promote, pioneering minority theories that are currently controversial (i.e <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOAPBOX" title="Wikipedia:SOAPBOX">soapboxing</a>), even if there is a slim chance beliefs on the margin may eventually gain wide consensus (as happened with the proposals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_Earth" title="Spherical Earth">round Earth</a> in archaic periods and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift" title="Continental drift">continental drift</a> before the mechanism of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics" title="Plate tectonics">plate tectonics</a>, two classic examples of cutting edge views once deemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fringe" title="Wikipedia:Fringe">fringe</a> theories that turned out to be justified). Wikipedia acknowledges diverse viewpoints on contemporary controversies, but represents them in proportion to their prevalence (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:UNDUE" title="Wikipedia:UNDUE">due weight</a>) among serious scholars and reporters with reputations of responsibility and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RELIABLE" title="Wikipedia:RELIABLE">reliability</a>. Wikipedia may in some cases limit its mention of theories understood to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRINGE" title="Wikipedia:FRINGE">fringe</a> to specific articles about those theories, and remove their mention from other articles, per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ONEWAY" title="Wikipedia:ONEWAY">one way</a> principle.
</p><p>In summary, Wikipedia is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Soapbox" title="Wikipedia:Soapbox">soapbox</a> for people to advocate pet points of view, nor is Wikipedia in the business of adjudicating which pet points of view have a potential for subsequent wide acceptance in the future. Some marginal theories are <i>fringe science</i> and some are <i>pseudo-science</i>, but Wikipedia is not in the business of calling the shots as to where these stand except where reliable sources clarify those differences. Thus, Wikipedia is academically conservative, as is fitting for a standard reference work.

<p>The threshold for including material in Wikipedia is that it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable</a>, not merely that we think it is true. That is, readers must be able to check that the material has already been published by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" title="Wikipedia:RS">reliable source</a>. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. Verifiability is one of Wikipedia's core content policies.
</p><p>Therefore, Wikipedia is not worried <i>per se</i> about whether <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth" title="Flat Earth">the theory that the Earth is flat</a> is true. There must be current, reliable and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:IS" title="Wikipedia:IS">independent</a> sources substantiating claims that the Earth is flat. But there are no such sources<sup id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> that are current (almost no scientists have thought the Earth was flat since about the fourth century BC), that are reliable (reliable sources are reviewed for accuracy), or independent (a journal published by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Flat_Earth_Research_Society" title="International Flat Earth Research Society">Flat Earth Society</a> would not be independent.<sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>)
</p><p>If Wikipedia had been available around the sixth century BC, it would have reported the view that the Earth is flat as a fact <i>without qualification</i>. It would have also reported the views of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eratosthenes" title="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> (who correctly determined the Earth's circumference in 240 BC) either as controversial or a fringe view. Similarly if available in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo" title="Galileo">Galileo</a>'s time, it would have reported the view that the Sun goes round the Earth as a fact, and if Galileo had been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicipaedia" title="Vicipaedia">Vicipaedia</a> editor, his view would have been rejected as "originale investigationis". Of course, if there is a popularly held or notable view that the Earth is flat, Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Flat_Earth_Research_Society" title="International Flat Earth Research Society">reports</a> this view. But it does not report it as true. It reports only on what its adherents believe, the history of the view, and its notable or prominent adherents. Wikipedia is inherently a non-innovative reference work: it stifles creativity and free thought, which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1066_and_All_That" title="1066 and All That">a Good Thing</a>.

<p>Occasionally, civic-minded Wikipedia editors must act to mitigate, redesign, and sometimes destroy the offerings of users who think that a particular 'breakthrough' or 'notable' or 'controversial' idea or theory deserves more consideration than it has received in the academic world. Since Wikipedia is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" title="Open source">open project</a> that "anyone can edit", good editors don't take such encounters personally. They do not automatically view supporters of fringe theories as "the enemy". They know that sometimes these fallacies are propagated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor" title="Hanlon's razor">not out of malice, but ignorance</a>. Humans are fallible creatures, and there are many more ways to be wrong than right. Science is stodgy, typically not glamorous, and entails hard work. 
</p><p>By contrast, speculation on "amazing new ideas" is stimulating, easy, and fun. It's more exciting to see yourself as a re-discoverer of ancient truths or in the vanguard of a revolutionary scientific breakthrough. Belonging to a small club with a particular belief can be very fulfilling. The world would be a more exciting place if there were malevolent aliens abducting humans, if dead people could send us messages, if exotic plants were able to miraculously cure all disease, if free energy were readily available to anyone, or if our dreams could foretell the future. In addition, popular culture can often confuse the general public with uncritical or credulous presentations of such concepts on the internet, in books, radio talk shows, TV, news, and films.

These policies, <i>correctly understood</i> and <i>correctly used</i>, will successfully exclude non-notable or fringe views.  But many dedicated fringe advocates are familiar with these policies, and have become expert at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_the_system" title="Gaming the system">gaming them</a> or even using them against neutrally-minded but inexpert editors.  The latter often find their efforts subverted at every step by advocates who revert war over edits, frivolously request citations for obvious or well known information, argue endlessly about the neutral-point-of-view policy and particularly try to undermine the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" title="Wikipedia:DUE">undue weight clause</a>.

Additionally, by continually engaging fringe advocates in endless argument, you run the risk of turning Wikipedia into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND" title="Wikipedia:BATTLEGROUND">battleground</a> or a debating society. At the present time, Wikipedia does not have an effective means to address superficially polite but tendentious, long-term, fringe advocacy. Some contend that this is a main flaw of Wikipedia; that unlike conventional encyclopedias, fanatics can always get their way if they stay around long enough and make enough edits and reversions.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> In this sense, Wikipedia's '<a rel="nofollow" href="http://thetyee.ca/Mediacheck/2006/12/22/Citizendium/">commitment to amateurism</a>' does not always work for the best interests of the project.

<p>Arguments commonly used by fringe advocates to support inclusion of marginal viewpoints against official policies fall into a small number of easily recognizable categories. Here are the top ten approaches that might be used by our allegorical Flat Earth advocate to argue that Wikipedia cannot claim "The Earth is not flat":

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>Your bias against the Earth being flat is too strong to be objective.</li>
<li>Your arguments against the flat Earth theory so resemble the arguments of editor X that you must be their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry">sockpuppet</a>.</li>
<li>The flat Earth article is being degraded by those who don't like the flat Earth theory.</li>
<li>Ignoring users with differing opinions does nothing to help the further development of this page.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Personalisation is easily the most common form of attack on neutrally-minded editors.  Personalisation is ignoring the basis for inclusion altogether, and making the argument personal.  For example, they argue that an editor is biased towards the mainstream, or that editors are ganging up because their arguments are so similar (even though they would be similar – the main argument against the Earth being flat is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topography" title="Topography">topographical</a>, and it is hard to argue against it without repeating the argument).  Or they may claim that to disagree with an editor with a fringe agenda is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility" title="Wikipedia:Civility">uncivil</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_personal_attacks" title="Wikipedia:No personal attacks">personal attack</a>, a violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Do_not_bite_the_newcomers" title="Wikipedia:Do not bite the newcomers">Do not bite the newcomers</a> or a violation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Assume good faith</a>.  It may even be claimed that sources that disagree with the fringe point of view cannot be used if they reflect poorly on any living people who are proponents of the fringe point of view (such as critical book reviews, etc).
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Ignore any personal attack altogether – and particularly <i>do not</i> make a personal attack yourself, however tempting it may be.  Also try to ignore the arguments and reasons used by mainstream science itself.  Your opponents will love this and turn the talk page into a battlefield of competing claims and counterclaims.  Simply stick to the principles: if mainstream science holds that the Earth is round, and there are reliable sources establishing this as a fact, that is sufficient.

<li>Since established scientists attended a flat-Earth conference, it follows they take the theory seriously.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>After you have insisted on the use of reliable sources, supporters of the marginal view will then try to exploit the definition of 'reliable source'.  They will argue for the inclusion of material of dubious reliability; for example, using commentary from partisan think-tanks rather than from the scientific literature. Occasionally, they will discover that they can get more attention if they make appeals to authority by presenting supporters who have academic credentials. Typical pseudoscience sources include:
</p>
<ul><li>Dedicated websites (normally registered under a .com or .org – rarely under .edu though there are occasions where this may be possible)</li>
<li>Dedicated periodicals</li>
<li>Self-published sources</li>
<li>Publications made outside the typical scientific presses</li>
<li>In-house journals (The <i>Flat Earth Institute's Journal</i> not to be confused with academic journals)</li>
<li>Occasional peer-reviewed articles – often in more obscure journals</li></ul>
<p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>The best sources to use when describing fringe theories or determining their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N" title="Wikipedia:N">notability</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WEIGHT" title="Wikipedia:WEIGHT">prominence</a> are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">independent reliable sources</a>. It's impossible to write a balanced article or describe a fringe theory in an objective way if the sources being used have a stake in promoting a specific fringe theory. Independent sources are also necessary to determine the relationship of a fringe theory to mainstream scholarly discourse. And arguments for inclusion of fringe theories based on a proponent's credentials alone are unwarranted. Attempts to insert language that showcases a proponent's academic degrees or honorification should be treated as promotionalism.

</p>
<ul><li>You must not say 'the Earth is not flat' but 'according to critics of the flat Earth theory, the Earth is not flat'.</li>
<li>There should be no criticism of the flat Earth theory in the introduction to the article. There is already criticism of the theory in the article, section 94.</li>
<li>So what if the article on flat Earth theory is 250k, and the round Earth article only 8k? The answer is not to fix the balance by writing less about the flat Earth, that only makes Wikipedia worse, but to add more information about the Earth being round.</li>
<li>Is this an encyclopedia for academics or for the general public?</li>
<li>Criticism of the flat Earth theory should be balanced by criticism of the round Earth theory.</li>
<li>The article lead should begin with a pure definition. Criticism should come second, e.g.:<i>"<b>Flat Earth</b> refers to the Earth's flat shape. Skeptics say the Earth is round."</i></li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Even when supporters of fringe viewpoints recognise the mainstream view as mainstream and established, and agree that Wikipedia may state the mainstream view without qualification, they will still challenge the relative prominence accorded to the mainstream over the fringe viewpoint, and make all sorts of arguments about balance.  It is often seriously claimed that the "N" in NPOV (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>) means that no negative or critical or mainstream material can appear at all in the article, since it is not neutral, or that Wikipedia is not for advocacy, and so advocates of 'scientific points of view' should not overstate their case.
</p><p>It is claimed that the reader will not understand the idea unless it is described without criticism, since Wikipedia is an encyclopedia for the general public, not a technical journal.  Reversing this argument, they will state that readers are smart enough to know that fringe ideas are nonsense without including any negative or critical material or sources. They will propose that negative material be forked off into another article, or relegated into a "criticism ghetto" or criticism section or removed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lead_section" title="Wikipedia:Lead section">Lead section</a>. They may argue that one must always state the idea first before criticizing it, or that any sources that disagree with the fringe point of view cannot be used since they violate the Neutral point of view.
</p><p>They may insist that a statement by an advocate of a fringe theory saying they "do not agree that it is a fringe theory" must be included in the article text. They may claim that any critical or negative material cannot appear in an article since it is biased. Or that any negative or critical material is unusable since it is just opinion and not fact. Some of them will even claim that there are no facts, arguing that if a fringe minority, not present in any reliable sources, disagrees with a widely accepted fact, it violates Neutral point of view to state it as a fact in the article. They may demand that every statement of fact should be attributed, no matter how universally accepted.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Wikipedia's neutrality is often misunderstood as giving equal validity to mainstream and fringe views. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTNEUTRAL" title="Wikipedia:NOTNEUTRAL">But it actually gives the most weight and validity to the mainstream view, as cited in high quality academic sources</a>. The fact that fringe theory promoters do not think their theory is fringe is a given. Every pseudoscience advocate strenuously objects to their avocation being called pseudoscience, it's an unremarkable detail (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:MANDY" title="Wikipedia:MANDY">WP:MANDY</a>), and unless these objections are notable in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">WP:FRIND</a> sources, they don't belong in the article. At the root of many of these arguments are intentional (or unintentional) misinterpretations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">Neutral point of view</a>, particularly undue weight, although certain kinds of deliberate <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pettifogger" title="wiktionary:pettifogger">pettifogging</a> can also be a sign of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Gaming_the_system" title="Wikipedia:Gaming the system">gaming the system</a>.

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The flat Earth theory has been marginalised by the scientific establishment in order to protect its interests.</li>
<li>Any scientist who tried to study flat Earth theory would lose his research funding. Dissent is being suppressed by the scientific establishment.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>Rosencrantz was tremendously rude about scientists who claimed the Earth was round. If the scientific establishment has marginalized him this is not really surprising.</li>
<li>As a professional astronomer you have a clear conflict of interest.</li>
<li>X, Y and Z are hard-line skeptics about flat-Earthism. They often publish in skeptics magazines and take a hard line with any approach to any theory which is not empirically verified.</li>
<li>The scientific establishment (peer-reviewed journals, universities) are trying to suppress the Truth about flat Earth theory; they refuse to allow flat Earth papers at conferences and will not publish flat Earth research.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>The next tactic is to appeal to your ideas about free speech and distrust of censorship and the establishment. All theories that are not generally accepted have a part of the theory devoted to explaining why this is.  Fringe theories are no exception.  They will claim that the <i>scientific establishment</i> is afraid of being proved wrong, and hence is trying to suppress the truth. This is a classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory" title="Conspiracy theory">conspiracy theory</a>. Their theory is not accepted because the black suits in the Scientific Establishment are not concerned about the pursuit of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth" title="Truth">truth</a>, but are much more concerned about not rocking the boat in order to protect their vested interests. The round-earth theorists have the backing of the major media who also have vested interests which they must protect. This explains why the discoveries of 'edges' round the Earth into which planes have gone missing, reports of travelers who have looked into the abyss, are receiving no coverage whatsoever by the major newspapers or the major TV networks.
</p><p>Thus, it is claimed that trying to balance positive content with negative content for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:DUE" title="Wikipedia:DUE">due weight</a> is censorship. It is claimed that there is a conspiracy against the fringe position and anyone who opposes an uncritical article about the fringe position is in on the conspiracy, has been bought off, is breaking the rules of Wikipedia, is just plain evil, etc.
</p><p>It is claimed that any source that has not written articles that are supportive and uncritical of fringe positions are not suitable as tertiary sources. For example, recently at a controversial article, it was once argued 'Actually, those really shouldn't be used as sources on this topic because (to my knowledge) they haven't written anything pro-X, and hence really can't be considered third party.'

<ul><li>X's paper on 'scientific fallacies' contains only passing reference to the 'flat Earth fallacy'. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV" title="Wikipedia:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> says "Even with well-sourced material ... if you use it out of context or to advance a position that is not directly and explicitly supported by the source used, you as an editor are engaging in original research."</li>

<li>There is no reliable source for the statement that 'flat-Earthism has entirely been ignored by reliable sources'.</li>
<li>The statement 'there is no scientific consensus for the flat-Earth view' has no scientific consensus.</li>
<li>There has been no serious study of whether the Earth is flat since 1493.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Therefore we cannot claim in Wikipedia that Earth is not flat, only that a study in 1493 came to this conclusion.</li>

<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>We move to the most <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermonuclear_weapon" title="Thermonuclear weapon">powerful weapon</a> in the fringe armoury: the argument from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_onus" title="Reverse onus">reversed burden of proof</a>.  Instead of them having to prove that their view is supported by reliable and independent sources, they will shift the burden of proof over to you, so you have to prove either that their view is <i>not supported</i>, or even that it is <i>refuted</i> by reliable and independent sources.  This is difficult for two reasons.  First, it is always difficult to prove a negative existential statement (which is in effect a claim about everything there is).  Second, because science generally ignores pseudoscience, it is often very difficult to find reliable sources that describe some pseudoscientific view as pseudoscientific.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>This argument is often difficult to address. However, you should always recognise the shifting of the burden for what it is, the second that ball comes thundering down the court at 80 mph.  Slam it back.  <i>Insist that the burden is theirs</i>.
</p>
<dl><dd>"When two or more theories are in competition, it is common for one of them to be treated as the established position – the default option, as it were – and the others to be treated as challengers. A challenging theory is normally expected to bear the burden or onus of proof. In other words, advocates of the challenging theory are expected to provide highly convincing evidence and arguments before the theory can be taken seriously. To use a different metaphor, it is assumed that the established theory has jumped over a very high hurdle to gain its leading position and that any challenger must jump over an equally high hurdle before being in contention for the remainder of the race."<sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></dd></dl>
<p>Also, in such cases it is legitimate to source from non-promotional descriptions of pseudoscience that can only be obtained from second- and third-party sources.

<ul><li>The statement 'The Earth is round' has reliable sources in scientific literature. The statement 'If the X is round, X is not flat' is a valid inference that can be sourced from any reliable logic textbook.

<p>You have kept the marginal and fringe viewpoint at bay for some months or years.  But now they have got wise, and expert in the ways of Wikipedia.  They have read the policies carefully, and have worked out the various loopholes in it, and the endless games they can play with it.
</p><p>They now claim that only the proponents of the FRINGE position understand NPOV or NOR or RS, not the experienced editors with tens of thousands of edits, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FA" title="Wikipedia:FA">FAs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GA" title="Wikipedia:GA">GAs</a> to their credit.  They will 'wikilawyer' to try to redefine a FRINGE position as nonFRINGE, or the mainstream position as the FRINGE position instead. They will attempt to use mainly primary sources, and to reject secondary and tertiary sources, or to redefine the preferences for secondary and tertiary sources in policy.
</p><p>Worst of all, it is now many months since you tidied up the article.  You have no inherent interest in the Flat Earth theory, and you have moved on to another area of pseudoscience (let's say the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_geocentrism" title="Modern geocentrism">Geocentric theory</a>).  But the Flat Earth supporters are interested in nothing else than their pet theory.  They will come back when you are gone and revert when you do not notice. The arguments that you successfully rebutted and dismissed, sometimes with extensive references, will be repeated over and over and over, sometimes just with a cut and paste approach. Sometimes they will be presented by the same person dozens and dozens of times over days and weeks and months.  They will try to add information that is (at best) peripherally relevant on the grounds that 'it is verifiable, so it should be in'.  They repeatedly use the talk page for soapboxing, or to re-raise the same issues that have already been discussed numerous times.  They hang around forever wearing down more serious editors and become expert in an odd kind of way on their niche POV.
</p><p>They will make a series of silly and time-wasting requests for comment, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">mediation</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration">arbitration</a> again to try to wear you down. They will add <sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> tags repeatedly to well-known material, or material that is fully referenced on wikilinked articles that discuss that point in more detail. Assorted templates branding the article are thrown on the article repeatedly, such as the claim that an NPOV dispute is going on, when it is more accurate to describe the discussion as revolving around some editor's idiosyncratic interpretation of NPOV to satisfy their own personal agenda. Accusations that a group editing the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OWN" title="Wikipedia:OWN">own</a> the article since they will not change the consensus to satisfy one malcontent are common.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>If you are unable to discourage a fringe advocate from willfully and knowingly misusing policy you might seek support from the community via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Mediation" title="Wikipedia:Mediation">mediation</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration">arbitration</a>. However, many fringe advocates thrive on the increased attention and actually welcome these forums as a soapbox from which to further argue their viewpoint. Finding themselves in the spotlight, it is not unusual for dedicated fringe advocates to suddenly disavow any former or present interest/connection with the subject of their advocacy ("Gosh, I don't believe the Earth is flat, I'm just here to uphold NPOV") and profess that they are only fighting "for the good of Wikipedia". The risks of continued involvement with disputes that escalate to this level should be carefully considered, especially if accompanied by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive_Compulsive_Disorder" title="Obsessive Compulsive Disorder">obsessive/compulsive</a> behavior.
</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The flat Earth theory is not amenable to scientific approaches and methods.</li>
<li>Flat-earth theorists are pragmatic. They are not interested in what is 'true', they are interested in 'what works'.</li>
<li>Rosencrantz never claimed nor explicitly stated that the Flat Earth Theory is a 'science'.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Another way of evading NPOV is to avoid the requirement for reliable sourcing altogether.  They will claim that the view in question is simply not amenable to scientific treatment.  Source X was from a scientific journal, it attempted to address the Flat Earth theory in a way that science could deal with it.  But Flat Earth theory is not amenable to scientific treatment.  Source X misunderstood what the theory was really saying.  The Flat Earth theory is not something that is really a 'fact' in the scientific sense.  (See the archived talk pages of the article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming" title="Neuro-linguistic programming">Neuro-linguistic programming</a> for endless repetitions and varieties of this argument).
</p><p>Or they claim that writing material using facts in the same context as in reliable sources violates NPOV since they are following a "narrative", and we must instead choose facts which no source describes as relevant to allow our readers to decide which "narrative" should be chosen.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Stick to your guns. This is merely a philosophically naive means of evading justification and substantiation.  All theories make claims of some sort, otherwise they would not have 'proponents' (a proponent literally 'puts forward' a certain view that is susceptible of truth or falsity).  The Flat Earth theory claims that the Earth is flat, not round.  That is a statement with a binary truth-value.  And it is capable of confirmation or refutation, it is verifiable.  For example, topography (measuring the distances between defined points on the Earth's surface) shows the shape of the Earth. Therefore, the theory is amenable to scientific treatment.

<li>Scientist X was not trained in flat Earth theory, and therefore could not make an expert judgment.</li>

<li>You haven't read any of Rosencrantz' work.</li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Special pleading is when the advocates of a fringe viewpoint argue that you have no expertise in the theory (which may, they argue, take years to fully master).  You do not understand the theory, and therefore you cannot make your claims.  Another version of this argument is to claim there are many different types of the theory, and that while version X and version Y are clearly nonsense, the most recent version Z (which of course you have never heard of) is scientifically impeccable.  They may even claim there is no such 'version' of the theory, and that you are attacking a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man" title="Straw man">straw man</a>.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>The only people qualified enough to understand flat Earth theory are those who just happen to support flat Earth theory? Ridiculous. Advocates, promoters, and self proclaimed "flat Earth theory experts" are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">independent, objective sources</a> of fact about whether or not the Earth is flat, or whether or not flat Earth theory is valid. Also bear in mind that any "new and improved" versions of flat Earth theory must be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTE" title="Wikipedia:NOTE">notable</a> enough to have attracted review and comment by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:FRIND" title="Wikipedia:FRIND">independent, objective sources</a>.
</p>

<p><b>Examples</b>
</p>
<ul><li>The flat Earth theory is clearly controversial. This is proof that scientists take it seriously.</li>
<li>The more controversial or fringe a subject, the less the article should tell the reader what to believe. The reader should be allowed to make up his/her own mind concerning the subject. e.g.: <i>"Flat Earthism is a highly controversial subject, and its scientific validity is often questioned."</i></li></ul>
<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>Although supporters of the marginal view cannot overcome Wikipedia policies, they will try to distort and alter an article's language in a way that represents their view as less marginal.  The most well-known and often-used tactic is to claim that their viewpoint is 'controversial', as though there were a minority but substantial view held by serious scientists or academics, actively engaged by the mainstream, and which is reported as controversial by reliable sources.
</p><p>They will try to exploit equivocation in the description of pseudoscience. For example, instead of simply stating: "the Flat Earth theory violates the known laws of geometry", a proponent may argue for the equivocal statement: "<i>some</i> geometers claim that the Flat Earth theory violates the known laws of geometry", perhaps adding "but there is considerable <i>controversy</i> over the matter."

</div>
<p>Pseudoscience should not be described on its own terms. The goal of writing an article on pseudoscience should be to present the ideas that are most commonly seen in relation to that pseudoscientific idea. This means that when writing an article on pseudoscience, popularity of ideas is a major rationale for inclusion or exclusion. Obscure iterations of pseudoscience should be eliminated, even if so-called "experts" in the subject believe such ideas to be of the utmost importance. The best way to write an article on pseudoscience is to approach it from the perspective of what topics are most prevalent in the popular culture about the subject.
</p><p>All claims that are made about observable reality which are directly contradicted by mainstream science must be represented as such. Per the rules of reliable sourcing and not unduly weighting fringe opinions, an article about a mainstream topic should marginalize all related pseudoscience topics relative to the prominence seen in secondary and tertiary sources about the mainstream topic. A pseudoscientific topic should not be mentioned in an article about a mainstream topic unless there are independent mainstream sources that connect the topics. For example, there are plenty of mainstream sources which describe how astronomy is not astrology, and so a decent article on the former may mention the latter. However, there are no mainstream sources about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity" title="Special relativity">special relativity</a> which also mention <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodynamics" title="Autodynamics">autodynamics</a>, and so a decent article on the former should not mention the latter. This approach is outlined in the guideline <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ONEWAY" title="Wikipedia:ONEWAY">WP:ONEWAY</a>.
</p><p>If it is deemed necessary to exclude pseudoscience from a certain article, there should not even be a link through a see also section. Often pseudoscience articles must link to science articles. Rarely will science articles link to pseudoscience articles. That is the principle of one-way linking.

<p><b>How to recognise</b>
</p><p>The last weapon in the pseudoscience arsenal is something you cannot deny: parts of the theory may be true.  Proponents will ignore the many bogus and patently untrue claims of the theory, and perhaps not even mention them in the article, but will go on at length about the parts of the theory that are true.  Often these are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platitude" title="Platitude">platitudinous</a>, or are statements that are better and more clearly covered in reliable sources.  Worse, they will cite reliable sources which make these true claims, but which do not mention the fringe theory, <i>as though they supported the theory</i>.
</p><p><b>How to reply</b>
</p><p>Rosencrantz may have said that the sky is blue and grass is green but he most likely isn't considered an authority or reliable source for such information. Attention to such details is only warranted if there is significant third-party coverage of them.
</p>

<p>By the 1950s historians had established that in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">High Middle Ages</a> the educated classes had recovered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greeks" title="Ancient Greeks">ancient Greeks</a>' discovery that the world is a sphere, even though their world-view was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric" title="Geocentric">geocentric</a>, and that the notion that Columbus's voyage was to prove the world round is a piece of fiction introduced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving" title="Washington Irving">Washington Irving</a>. (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_the_Flat_Earth" title="Myth of the Flat Earth">Myth of the Flat Earth</a>.) Although it was presumed before Copernicus that the Earth was the centre of the Universe, with the Sun revolving around it, we now know that the educated classes still understood the Earth to be a sphere with gravity acting towards its centre, contrary to the widespread 19th-century assumption that most mediaeval people believed it to be flat. (For example, the final two cantos of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dante_Alighieri" title="Dante Alighieri">Dante Alighieri</a>'s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inferno_(Dante)" title="Inferno (Dante)">Inferno</a></i> assume a spherical Earth.) However, this essay uses the flat Earth as a metaphor for explaining Wikipedia policy, not to describe any authentic historical controversy.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://danybittel.ch/macro.html">https://danybittel.ch/macro.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45556952">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	  

<div><p>
A Gaussian splat is essentially a bunch of blurry ellipsoids. Each one has a view-dependent color, using a process similar to training an AI model, you can optimize until it converges to the photos you feed in. The result is a sort of 3D photograph that can be viewed freely from any angle.
</p><p>
Captivated by this possibility, I wanted to create splats of macro subjects. The hairy, fuzzy textures and complex structures of insects make them a perfect fit for this technique.
</p><p>
In theory, creating a splat is as simple as filming the object from all sides. Unfortunately, the extremely shallow depth of field in macro photography completely throws this process off. If you feed unsharp photos into it, the resulting model will contain unsharp areas as well. </p><p>
Thankfully, there’s a common technique in macro photography called focus stacking, where multiple images taken from the same angle but with slightly different focal points are combined into one fully sharp photo. A single stack usually contains anywhere from 50 to 500 images. Since I needed to photograph the subject from many angles, I optimized the process to use as few photos per stack as possible and settled on 16. I shot at a small aperture of f/18 to maximize depth of field. The diffraction introduced by this setup can be minimized later in post.
</p><p>
To capture the specimen from all angles, covering a bit more than half a hemisphere, I mounted the insect on a rotary disk and tilted the camera up and down on a boom arm. A script rotated the disk by fixed increments, and each focus stack was captured using a WeMacro automated focus rail. The vertical angle was adjusted manually (only eight times), so it wasn’t a big issue. In total, I captured 111 perspectives. A full session of 1776 photos took about four hours. The main bottleneck is my Nikon D810, which isn’t built for such continuous shooting, it slows down to one frame every one or two seconds once the buffer fills up. I used a Tamron 90mm lens with a 20mm extension and shot in DX (cropped sensor) mode. Shorter lenses would change the perspective too much between focus areas, making image alignment impossible.
</p><p>
After batch focus-stacking all the photos, I ended up with 111 fully sharp images. The camera positions could then be reconstructed in <a href="https://colmap.github.io/">COLMAP</a>. I performed some color correction and background masking before feeding the data into training with <a href="https://www.jawset.com/">Postshot</a>. Out comes the splat, requiring only minimal retouching to remove the mounting.

      <p>This post could’ve been titled “Nostr vs ATProto”, but that really isn’t what I wanted to do here. While I will be comparing and contrasting them a lot, and that’s kind of even the point of writing this, I didn’t want to really pit the two against each other at all, and especially not with the title. I also want to try avoiding commenting on the differences between the communities that have formed on the protocols and their apps, although I definitely will be looking at the philosophical differences between the two a lot - also kind of the point of writing this. This also isn’t a super deep technical post, though it assumes familiarity with technical concepts. I also might come back to edit parts of it and add more later.</p>
<p>You can read and leave comments on this post <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shreyanjain.net/post/3kwl2m5te7e2t">here</a> on Bluesky, or <a href="https://snort.social/nevent1qqsqfeuezj38syyppscdpu0c0zwermxlnztm24akusu2qrm7xmz05cqppemhxue69uhkummn9ekx7mp0qgs0srw78gjffynj2gd762vc67r24kc70dssm048sp2e74g5tnkfregrqsqqqqqpxzjc9q">here</a> on Nostr, or even <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@shreyan/112736354421439903">here</a> on Mastodon.</p>
<p>So I wrote a paragraph mostly about what this post isn’t about, with a little bit about what I will talk about in it, but I haven’t really explained what this post <em>is</em>, or <em>why</em> I’m writing it. Honestly, I’m not completely sure of the first one yet either; I’m figuring that out as I write it. The paragraph at the top are really serving as guidelines for myself as I write this.</p>
<p>However, I <em>can</em> explain how this post came to be. It started with a showerthought (I was literally in the shower) about how similar ATProto and Nostr really are. This thought came to me after ruminating on ATProto Relays and Nostr Relays, and thinking about how my favorite feature of Nostr Relays (spoiler: it’s filtering) could be added to ATProto Relays, and why you would want to do that. More broadly, this made me think that the two protocols are similar enough that they are likely to slowly converge over time as they learn from each other.</p>
<p>A direct result of those thoughts (after getting out of the shower, of course) was to search the internet for a good comparison of Nostr and ATProto. A direct result of my failure to find any was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shreyanjain.net/post/3kml7zbrx2a24">this Bluesky skoot</a> (There’s a lot of good replies and thoughts in that thread as well—you probably want to read it before continuing with this post). A direct result of my skooting that was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jabsco.cia.fyi/post/3kmlaqrjdj42k">this reply</a>. Before, I’d been tentatively considering writing a purely technical comparison after not finding any, but that reply really set the stage for deciding what I wanted to do in this post.</p>
<p>So, to start, let’s look at…</p>
<h2 id="how-we-got-here">How we got here</h2>
<h3 id="a-caged-bird">A Caged Bird</h3>
<h4 id="or-twitter">or, Twitter</h4>
<p>Twitter here could, in theory, be replaced here by just “Centralized Social Media”, but really it was Twitter that got us here. Both ATProto and Nostr exist because of Twitter - the AT Protocol very directly so, Nostr as a response to “censorship” (real or perceived) on Twitter. ATProto is the result of Bluesky’s original mission - to <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">build a decentralized protocol Twitter could adopt</a>. Post-Elon, who knows if that will ever happen, but, well, that is how it started.</p>
<p>Twitter sprang into existence in 2007, as a small, SMS-based service that allowed people to post short status updates - tweets, as they became known. Who knows if it was the first of its kind? Well, it certainly became the most popular. It really was the service that was able to popularize the concept of microblogging. It developed a multitude of subcultures, each with their own unique characteristics, often intersecting with each other in fascinating, unpredictable places and ways. And while Twitter certainly never became as popular as some of its big tech companions, it may have had the greatest cultural impact - it was one of the only places in existence where an average person (you!!) could, say, ratio a presidential candidate or give interesting new details on a story to some famous journalist (I don’t know, I just made those up). Some have said it was the first “global town square”.</p>
<p>Over the years of Twitter’s existence, lots of <em>things</em> happened to Twitter. Moderation issues including Donald Trump, authoritarian governments around the world, all sorts of mini community wars and harassment, etc. Twitter, as beautiful as it was, well… kind of sucked, and people drew many different (not mutually exclusive and often overlapping!!) conclusions about why. Some, like Christopher Bouzy of Spoutible, concluded that the platform’s moderation simply wasn’t enough for what the platform had become, and people needed a smaller, more closed space with stricter moderation policies. Others concluded that a global-scale social network is simply an inherently bad idea and people should stick to smaller, more tight-knit communities. But one of the most popular conclusions was that something as important as Twitter - whether you considered it a “global town square” or a place to make connections with your community or Whatever Else - simply could not and should not be controlled by a single corporation. Indeed, this was the conclusion that Twitter themselves came to! This is the conclusion that both ATProto and Nostr are founded upon - the idea of a move from closed, centralized, corporate-owned social platforms to a world of open, decentralized social protocols.</p>
<p>But ATProto and Nostr don’t exist in a vacuum. They weren’t the only ones to come to this conclusion. They weren’t even the first. And that brings us to…</p>
<h3 id="the-mastodon-in-the-room">The Mastodon in the Room</h3>
<h4 id="or-activitypub-and-the-fediverse">or, ActivityPub and the Fediverse</h4>
<p>⚠️ I am not an expert on ActivityPub. Take everything in this section with a grain of salt. If I get something wrong, please correct me. ⚠️</p>
<p>ActivityPub is kind of a big deal in the decentralized social protocols world. It’s not the first, either - it would be extremely hard to really <em>find</em> a first. But it is, at least for now, the largest, and realistically is about to become a lot larger, at least if Meta Threads federates with it.</p>
<p>It’s also got an entirely different philosophy to either Nostr <em>or</em> ATProto - while both of the latter are based on a more individualistic approach to decentralization, ActivityPub opted for a more collectivist approach, one that favors tight-knit communities over a global network (that hasn’t stopped people from trying to build global networks with it, though.)</p>
<p>(Side-note: I should also mention that whether the Fediverse should focus on smaller communities or mass-interconnection has been a debate even within the Fediverse since right about the beginning, which a lot of the differing viewpoints around this topic <a href="https://evanp.me/2023/12/26/big-fedi-small-fedi/">explained brilliantly by Evan Podromou</a>. Since Small Fedi seems to be the dominant philosophy shaping the current Fediverse, I’ve mostly focused on Small Fedi when talking about ActivityPub here.)</p>
<p>There are many different server implementations of the ActivityPub Spec, each adding their own unique flair to the ecosystem. The most popular of these implementations is Mastodon. ActivityPub is also, like I said above, kind of a big deal in the decentralized social protocols world. Almost everyone working on decentralized protocols after ActivityPub has been forced to acknowledge its existence, draw comparisons to it, and often been bridged to it. In fact, when Jack Dorsey fired off his famous tweet thread announcing Bluesky, he was <em>definitely</em> aware of ActivityPub, given that in a <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204952252747661312?s=20">reply to a reply to that thread</a>, he stated “ActivityPub is great.”</p>
<p>Because ActivityPub uses a federation model centered around small community servers, it has a lot of the benefits of centralized social media. For example, it makes it relatively easy to support private content, since it’s a push-based protocol - only those whose inboxes you push content to can view it (there’s also an “Everyone” option that makes your content fetchable, I think). This is also why the Fediverse has things like Follow <em>Requests</em>, server-to-server DMs (though your instance admin can view them - ActivityPub kind of assumes you trust them), and real blocks that mostly work.</p>
<p>However, many of the more collectivist choices made in ActivityPub were concluded to not be conductive to a “decentralized Twitter”, and both ATProto and Nostr exist in large part because of this. In fact, both ATProto and Nostr strayed from ActivityPub for the same reasons - identity is extremely tied to your initial server. There are good reasons for this, given that ActivityPub is largely used by smaller communities who federate with each other, but it does have an important consequence:</p>
<p>Your data is not really portable. You can move accounts to another server, and if your old server is well-behaved it can add a redirect to your new account, which will help automatically transfer your old social connections over to your new account, but this doesn’t include any of your data <em>except</em> your follows and followers, and falls apart if your old server goes offline, is adversarial to you or your current server, or in basically any situation where you can’t get that redirect.</p>
<p>There are many other philosophical differences between the ActivityPub camp and the Nostr and ATProto camp, but this one is the most important one, at least in my opinion - both ATProto and Nostr have sections explaining “Why not just go with ActivityPub?” that state this as their primary reason. Both ATProto and Nostr have real account portability by design.</p>
<p>Both of these protocols don’t have much in common with ActivityPub, so I won’t talk about ActivityPub too much here. But there is <em>one</em> older protocol that both of them extensively draw inspiration from…</p>
<h3 id="secure-scuttlebutt">Secure Scuttlebutt</h3>
<p>This is where things start to get pretty interesting. In 2014, a New Zealand programmer named Dominic Tarr was living on a sailboat. As you might assume, such a life includes little internet, and when it comes, in sporadic bursts. Centralized social media, like Twitter, wants you to be connected at all times, scrolling your feed and looking at ads. Tarr didn’t want that. The result? He designed a protocol designed for offline-first, intentional, slow communication, free from Big Tech. Its name? Secure Scuttlebutt.</p>
<p>Scuttlebutt uses an append-only log of cryptographically signed messages. Your identity is an Ed25519 keypair and is pretty much tied to a single device. One consequence of this is that, as the Scuttlebutt developer docs themselves acknowledge, “If a user loses their secret key or has it stolen, they will need to generate a new identity, and tell people to use their new one instead.”</p>
<p>Because it’s an append-only log, every message must contain a reference to the previous message - a bit like a blockchain. That also means that deletes are straight-up impossible. This is also not necessarily a bad thing, just a trade-off.</p>
<p>Scuttlebutt started as a purely peer-to-peer protocol, using a gossip model - in fact, that’s where its name comes from; in sailor-slang, scuttlebutt means “water-cooler gossip”. The first popular Scuttlebutt client was an app called Patchwork, authored by Paul Frazee (keep this guy in mind, he’s gonna be important later), and initially the protocol and client often evolved together, adapting to each other’s needs.</p>
<p>By default, when you add to your append-only log, that addition only exists on your device; but the next time you connect to a peer running a Scuttlebutt client, your two clients will sync with each others’ logs, and then verify them against each others’ public keys. And to verify the newest part of a Scuttlebutt log, you need the whole log - this ensures that if someone gets part of your content, they get all of it.</p>
<p>But you don’t just sync each others’ content - your clients sync all the logs they have locally. That’s why it’s called the gossip model - once you put out a post, as long as you’re connected to a few peers every once in a while, your post will spread as fast as gossip to the friends of your friends. It usually takes time for that information to spread to everywhere, which keeps the pace of Scuttlebutt life somewhat slow and relaxed, with the most active communities being, again, small and tight-knit. Scuttlebutt is definitely not a global social network. The gossip model was driven by the social graph, allowing users to sync with others based on who they follow and who their connections follow. This mechanism relied on cloud bot users, known as “pubs,” acting as connectors and community hubs.</p>
<p>Scuttlebutt syncing took time due to the necessity of syncing all activity. Pubs played a crucial role in facilitating connectivity within the network, ensuring that users could discover others either by sharing a pub or by following users who were connected to them.</p>
<p>Scuttlebutt’s evolution was influenced by the desire for decentralized communication, distinct from the centralized nature of platforms like Twitter. It offered an alternative for those seeking intentional, offline-first communication free from the constraints of Big Tech. While initially designed for smaller, tight-knit communities, the ideas and learnings from Scuttlebutt inspired later attempts to build decentralized networks suitable for global networking.</p>
<p>So, now the stage is mostly set. Twitter was the first “global town square”, a social network connecting people and ideas worldwide - but not without a myriad of problems, which many concluded were due to its centralized nature. ActivityPub and Scuttlebutt (and others) experimented with decentralizing the social world, mostly with a focus on smaller communities, though as they evolved people tried to make them more suitable for global networking. Neither of them would prove viable for global social networks, but the learnings from them would help develop the next generation of social protocols.</p>
<h3 id="freeing-the-bird">Freeing the Bird</h3>
<h4 id="or-where-atproto-and-nostr-came-from">or, where ATProto and Nostr came from</h4>
<p>All of this is important background for understanding the motivation behind these two protocols. Twitter started it all by showing us what microblogging at scale - a “global town square” - looks like. It showed us how many problems there are with it, and to some, that the only way to fix them is to remove corporate control. ActivityPub and Scuttlebutt showed us two very different ways of doing so, each with their own major benefits and major drawbacks. But there’s still a long way to go from these experiments, which were largely paving the way in the late 2010s, to where we are now, almost halfway into the third decade of the 21st century. To fill in these gaps, we can start towards the end of the second decade of the 21st century.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just people outside Twitter who were aware of the multitude of issues with Twitter - of course Twitter noticed them too. Twitter had started as a much more open company than it was at this point in December of 2019 - over the years, they’d taken, for a variety of reasons, a more centralized path, facing investor pressure for returns, and other such things. Twitter knew that, in the words of founder then-CEO Jack Dorsey, “centralized enforcement of global policy to address abuse and misleading information is unlikely to scale over the long-term without placing far too much burden on people.” Jack and the rest of Twitter drew the same conclusion as ActivityPub and Scuttlebutt had before - corporate control of social media was simply bad for everyone. Twitter was a company full of people who realized the service was just in a shitty position no matter how you looked at it, and who were doing everything in their power to keep things healthy despite it all - and they saw a way out: to build on, or build, an open protocol for a global social network. And for all the reasons we talked about before, about ActivityPub and Scuttlebutt, neither of those protocols were up to the task.</p>
<p>So the Bluesky initiative began. The early history of the project is much better documented <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/2-28-2022-how-it-started">elsewhere</a>, but one of the most interesting things to come out of it at this early stage was an <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdFrru4PyHzXGZztEPnYToBR3QovD7fkC1HSyty22LzfD">ecosystem review of existing decentralized protocols</a>. It was authored by a Zcash developer named Jay Graber, who would go on to become CEO of Bluesky. It included contributions from several notable people in the decentralization space, including Christine Lemmer-Webber, co-author of the ActivityPub spec, Paul Frazee of Patchwork (and at the time now working on Beaker Browser and Dat), Whyrusleeping from IPFS, and Rabble of early Twitter (at the time working on planetary.social, a Scuttlebutt client). It lays out the state of numerous decentralized protocols, including ActivityPub and Scuttlebutt, and explains how user discovery, moderation, etc works in each of them.</p>
<p>At the end of all this ecosystem review, Bluesky concluded that none of these existing protocols was really suitable for their goal - a decentralized protocol Twitter, a global social network, could run on. So they decided to create their own - ATProto - and incorporated into a Public Benefit LLC to help achieve this goal. And when their <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/2-31-2022-initial-bluesky-team">initial team</a> was hired, it included none other than Paul Frazee of Patchwork, in addition to <a href="https://x.com/bluesky/status/1509578371079888914?s=20">Aaron Goldman, a former security engineer at Twitter</a>, and Daniel Holmgren, an engineer with experience building on IPFS.</p>
<p>Now, while all of this was happening, a Bitcoin enthusiast under the pseudonym Fiatjaf was working on his own little thing. His idea was a non-peer-to-peer reimagining of Scuttlebutt and what it would take to make a similar protocol usable on a global scale. And on November 7th, 2020, the first <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nostr/commit/6158017db0b12686218113232fff175a45953e2f">basic working code</a> for his idea of “Relays” quietly slipped onto the scene. Nostr’s <a href="https://fiatjaf.com/nostr.html">initial description</a> even cites Scuttlebutt as an inspiration - the main design differences between the two (at a high level) are that Nostr moves from a p2p network, with pubs as an afterthought, to a purely client-relay model, and that Nostr events are all separate units that do not form a chain.</p>
<p>His motivation for creating this protocol was, somewhat similarly to Bluesky, problems with Twitter. Bluesky was motivated by the idea that content moderation at scale is impossible to do well, and centralizing it in the hands of a single company was a bad idea. Nostr, meanwhile, views moderation itself as an enemy - as censorship that the protocol should be resistant to. While in reality, even Nostr has ultimately ended up exploring different forms of communal moderation, the primary motivation behind Nostr’s design choices is an idea of extremely high censorship resistance. This implies that the design, rather than optimizing for consistency, should optimize for availability - if someone wants to see your content, they should be guaranteed to be able to get it from somewhere. The protocol design is pretty conducive to this.</p>
<p>Both of these efforts were toiling away in the darkness, waiting for their moment in order to replace centralized social media with a decentralized future. Then in late 2022, something remarkable happened. Centralized social media fell prey to one of its prime weaknesses, right where everyone could see, thanks to one very famous billionaire. Elon Musk payed 44 billion dollars for Twitter, released the so-called “Twitter Files”, and Jack Dorsey, who had earlier kicked off the Bluesky initiative with 13 million dollars, put out a little manifesto in response, titled <em><a href="https://pastebin.com/HnBUM33b">a native internet protocol for social media</a></em>. Within a few hours, someone responded pointing him to the Nostr protocol, and he grew very interested, soon giving fiatjaf 14 Bitcoin to help fund Nostr development. A few months later, Bluesky launched their reference app for the AT Protocol. About a year later, <a href="https://www.piratewires.com/p/interview-with-jack-dorsey-mike-solana">Jack Dorsey left the Bluesky board</a>, having chosen to focus on Nostr instead, as it aligned with his “free-speech-Bitcoin-vibes” ethos better. This was despite the fact that ATProto basically does everything he wants in a decentralized social protocol, but he prefers the more Bitcoin-y community of Nostr.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s how we got here. Now we’ve arrived, back in the present. Let’s look at…</p>
<h2 id="where-we-are">Where we are</h2>
<p>Both Nostr and ATProto follow a similar pattern: adapting peer-to-peer data models to work in a client-server model (that isn’t quite federation). The peer-to-peer world had to deal with a unique problem: because there were no servers, there was no canonical source for data where you could go to verify its integrity. Thanks to the wonders of modern cryptography, efforts like Scuttlebutt, IPFS, and Dat all were able to use <em>self-certifying</em> data structures that could be verified independently of any third-party authority. A good example of this is a <a href="https://youtu.be/3giNelTfeAk" title="Merkle Trees - Tara Vancil">Merkle Tree</a>, which is a data structure that ATProto also uses (be sure to watch that video, it’s very good and explains well <em>why</em> peer-to-peer networks need this).</p>
<p>As it turned out, these data structures and their benefits would help solve many of the problems the <em>federated</em> world faces. Specifically, the federated world, while no longer reliant on a <em>single</em> central server, often ends up simply shifting this reliance to smaller centralized servers that are the <em>only</em> canonical source for user data. When done correctly, applying peer-to-peer data models to the server would reduce this reliance and make data more independent of servers, while also allowing the big-world networking that only servers can achieve.</p>
<p>This sounds like a perfect solution, but it’s worth mentioning that it does have some important tradeoffs compared to a pure federation approach like ActivityPub’s. For example, while deletes are still possible on both protocols (though rather difficult on Nostr, which you might be able to piece together why), if someone has your data saved from before your deletion, it is much easier to prove that you said it and hold it up as yours than it is on a protocol that doesn’t have you cryptographically sign everything. And since both protocols heavily optimize for public content, things like Direct Messaging become much more difficult - in fact, on Nostr, DMs are public like everything else (their content is encrypted so no one else can read them). In general, trying to keep data <em>private</em> becomes extremely difficult; these protocols have delivery models which both center around the same self-certifying data being replicated in many places so anyone who wants it can get at it. With this, things like blocking other users become basically impossible, since there’s no canonical source to restrict content from.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at a few different protocol building blocks and how each protocol handles them.</p>
<h3 id="identity">Identity</h3>
<p>Identity in networks is a difficult problem. Ideally, you want identifiers to be human-meaningful - for example, a Twitter handle. If I see the Twitter handle <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a>, I can be fairly sure that that’s Jack Dorsey. You also want them to be secure - only <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a> should be able to create a post that says it’s from <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a>, and I shouldn’t easily be able to take over the account <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a> without gaining access to some kind of key. And you probably also want them to be decentralized, so that <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a> isn’t beholden to anyone else to hold his identity, and can move around.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not easy to have all three of these nice properties - Secure, Human-Meaningful, and Decentralized - at once. Almost every system which tries to have all three has to end up compromising on one of them. This trilemna is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko%27s_triangle">Zooko’s Triangle</a>. As examples:</p>
<p>Twitter usernames are secure - I can’t just put out a tweet that looks like it’s from <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a> - and human-meaningful - a guy with the handle <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a> is probably named Jack. But they’re obviously not decentralized - they are all reliant on Twitter’s servers, and it’s Twitter who decides that <a href="https://micro.blog/jack">@jack</a> points to Jack Dorsey’s account. If they, say, wanted to rebrand to X, and someone was using the <a href="https://micro.blog/x">@x</a> handle, Twitter could easily take it from them and make their own handle <a href="https://micro.blog/X">@X</a>.</p>
<p>Scuttlebutt, meanwhile, has identity that’s decentralized - it’s just your private key, essentially a random number - and your public key, the part other people can see. It’s also secure - I need to actually have your private key to pretend to be you. But a public key, which is also just a number (derived from your private key), is not very human meaningful.</p>
<p>If you’re familiar with ActivityPub, you might argue that ActivityPub usernames are all three. This isn’t really true - ActivityPub usernames behave like Twitter usernames, except instead of just one big central Twitter server deciding what username points to what, this is handled in smaller centralized servers which federate with each other.</p>
<p>Nostr and ATProto also experience this problem, and they both share a few views around identity, listed out here so each one corresponds to a side of Zooko’s Triangle:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your identity should not be permanently tied to a single server - Decentralization</li>
<li>Your data should be cryptographically verifiable as coming from your identity - Security</li>
<li>There are two “layers” of identity - a permanent computer-oriented one and a changeable human-friendly one - Human-Meaningful.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even with these similarities, how that really plays out in both protocols looks extremely different. The idea that your data is cryptographically verifiable as <em>yours</em> implies a keypair somewhere. In Nostr, that’s exactly it - your identity is just a secp256k1 keypair. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p>That sounds very much like the permanent computer-oriented layer of identity. So the human-friendly identity is handled by a Nostr event of the profile type - this contains stuff like your bio, display name, and avatar. There’s also <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/05.md">NIP-05</a>, which allows using the .well-known/nostr.json path on a domain to get email-style usernames, like <code>jack@cash.app</code> - and this includes a special case, <code>_@domain</code>, that gets treated by clients as just <code>@domain</code>. When you <code>@mention</code> someone in a Nostr note, it’s just <code>@&lt;their public key&gt;</code>, which clients then simply display as their display names. Notably, having either a display name or even a real NIP-05 username is completely optional under Nostr, and your public key really is your identity.</p>
<p>This looks like mostly a success, at least in terms of taking those views and treating them as criteria. Nostr actually takes the first point - identity should not be permanently tied to a single server - and goes slightly further: in Nostr’s model, where your identity really is <em>just</em> your keypair, no servers are involved in identity at all. Why would you want that? A major benefit of this approach is that if any of the servers involved in the system goes down or is no longer friendly with you, your identity doesn’t even need to be “recovered” - it’s just there, the same as before. This works well with the Nostr Relay model, which we’ll discuss in the next section.</p>
<p>The <em>drawbacks</em> of this approach are the same as Scuttlebutt. Thanks to the relay model, your identity is no longer tied to a single client on a single device - you can easily move around, between relays, between clients, between devices. This, by itself, for most people, is a good thing, but it comes with an entirely different kind of problem:</p>
<p>Managing a cryptographic keypair is simply not very user-friendly. You simply can’t expect most people to write it down and keep it in a safe place or even take the time to understand what it means. People expect username-password systems, and sure, newer technology like passkeys is actually more secure and potentially easier - but that comes with actual benefits over username-password for most people! Managing a keypair is not only unfriendly, it’s incredibly risky. Since the entirety of your identity is your keypair, and to sign in to Nostr clients is to give them your private key - well, you can probably see where this is going. And again, since your identity is just your keypair, just like with Scuttlebutt, if an attacker gets a hold of your private key, that identity is <em>gone</em>. No longer yours. There’s no-one you can go to for help, no-one who can recover that account, no password reset link.</p>
<p>That sounds very negative, but it is worth noting that at least for web Nostr clients, there is a (relatively) <em>good</em> solution to the sign-in problem - <a href="https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/07.md">NIP-07</a>. In the NIP-07 world, you <em>don’t</em> give every client your private key - you give it once to a browser extension, and then every time a web client wants to do something on your behalf, instead of directly using your private key to sign messages etc, it delegates that to your trusted extension. This is a lot better than giving your private key out to every client that has some cool new feature you want to try. Of course, this doesn’t help with recoverability - if you lose your private key, whether to your memory or to an attacker, it’s still gone. There are attempts to solve this, too, which I’ll talk about in “Where we’re going” because it has interesting future implications.</p>
<p>ATProto looks at things a little differently. Because of the aforementioned difficulties involved with users managing their own private keys, Bluesky chose to have your signing keypair live on a server - your Personal Data Server, or PDS. Your PDS is responsible for serving your Data Repository to other services on the network, and serves as more-or-less the canonical source for your content. However, your Repository is fully self-certifiable (that means someone can check whether or not you created the content in a copy of your Repo without needing a third party to verify), and so is not permanently tied to your PDS. This is because your PDS is <em>not</em> the canonical source for your identity - but your identity is also not something as small as a keypair here, and does not live entirely client side.</p>
<p>Instead, ATProto uses their own homegrown DID (Decentralized IDentifiers, W3C spec with the aim of helping, well, decentralize identity) method called did:plc, for PLaCeholder. Why is it named “placeholder”? Well, because as of now, it’s centralized. That’s right, the supposedly “Decentralized” Identifier is centralized - and Bluesky actively doesn’t want it to be that way. did:plc was initially intended to be a placeholder until a decentralized method was able to meet their requirements - “a strongly consistent, highly available, recoverable, and cryptographically secure method with fast and cheap propagation of updates”. did:plc has all of these at one major cost - it’s centralized. However, the data in a did:plc is self-certifying (you don’t need to trust/rely on plc.directory to <em>verify</em> the information), so it’s conceivable for it to become more decentralized in the future. (You can also use a did:web, which removes this centralization but forces you to manage everything yourself and relies permanently on your control of a web host on a domain, thus removing most of PLC’s benefits. This is pretty niche, so I won’t talk about it in detail here.)</p>
<p>A did:plc: contains two public keys - your rotation key and your signing key. This signing key is the aforementioned key that the PDS uses to sign your data. The rotation key is important because it manages your did:plc: and thus is needed to sign updates to your DID document, such as when migrating PDSes. The canonical source for your current PDS, valid signing key, handle, and rotation keys (which can also be rotated) are all your DID document. In this way, a DID serves as a “Theseus Identity”, an idea Aaron Goldman laid out well in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z04RGWgHzvU&amp;list=PLXOcdqnFkrN8KWmcoFjYyGaW1XxDEeWJu&amp;index=10&amp;pp=iAQB">this YouTube video</a>.</p>
<p>The canonical source of your identity is your DID doc, and all the information in it, i.e. your handle and current PDS must be a two-way connection - your handle is a domain with a dns txt record or ./well-known/atproto-did that must point to your DID, providing two way verification, and whatever PDS your DID document points to must actually have your account on it. Meanwhile, the PDS handles data, and implements a standard, user-friendly login system, and signs your updates with your key on the server side.</p>
<p>Here, there was a trade-off between principles of security, recoverability, and user-friendliness, and a principle of max-decentralization - low-friction identity, with no centralizing points of control at all, extreme takeover resistance. Notice that</p>
<p>Where ATProto chooses user-friendliness, Nostr chooses max-decentralization. This is a trend that repeats in many other parts of each protocol’s design, as we’ll see.</p>
<h3 id="data">Data</h3>
<p>In the traditional federated world of protocols like ActivityPub, there had never been much of an emphasis on data, and the formats and structures it’s stored in. The federated world thought much more about how servers should <em>communicate</em> messages rather than how they should <em>store</em> data - this difference is <a href="https://bnewbold.net/2022/atproto_thoughts/">laid out</a> well by Bryan Newbold, who incidentally now works on protocol design at Bluesky. This emphasis on communication standards rather than data standards is a big part of why there’s no standard “fediverse repo” that you can transfer between servers, and other such problems in the federated world.</p>
<p>The peer-to-peer world, as we looked at earlier, couldn’t afford to define pure transport protocols - they had to design standardized data structures that were self-certifying and self-contained. An example of such a data structure is a blockchain, and indeed, the peer-to-peer community and the blockchain community learned much more from each other than either of them and federation did from each other.</p>
<p>This was the status quo until ATProto and Nostr came along and broke the mold by bringing these self-certifying data structures into the client-server world. They both use asymmetric cryptography to make this data self-certifying, but the similarities basically end there.</p>
<p>In the Nostr model, servers are <em>dumb</em>. They have basically one job - transmit data. There’s only one kind of server in Nostr - a Relay, and a Relay does only three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Receive data to store</li>
<li>Return that data when asked for it</li>
<li>Provide a continuous stream of the data being placed on that Relay</li>
</ol>
<p>Notably, Relays <em>store</em> data. Data is <em>placed</em> on Relays. All this data is <em>created</em> on the <em>client-side</em>. Relays don’t manage identity or any of that. Your keys live with your client, and it’s your client who signs your <code>events</code> (a piece of data in Nostr terminology.) When you fetch data from a Relay, it comes back with signatures and all - which, guess what, your client verifies. Your client almost operates under the assumption that Relays will try to do weird stuff, people will submit fake events, etc - and so Nostr removed the requirement of trust, by making clients verify everything themselves. A trade-off!</p>
<p>Nostr, by optimizing for censorship resistance, needs to remove as much rigidity from its design as possible. Data needs to be cheap to create and transmit and store. So Nostr events all exist as individual units following a fixed JSON format with a strict signing convention. Unlike Scuttlebutt, these events don’t need to form a chain - they are purely self-contained. Like your identity, there’s no canonical source for them either - by design, you’re supposed to be able to get them from pretty much any relay that has them. When you <em>create</em> the event, your client signs it and then just publishes it to as many relays as possible, from where it will circulate into other Relays, consuming clients will republish them, etc. Because they are signed against your public and are fully self-contained, it’s trivial to verify them too, removing the necessity of trust in the Relay you get the event from.</p>
<p>ATProto data is also very portable, but it is slightly more rigid than Nostr data is. Instead of using these one-off events which are fully self-certifying, ATProto stores your data as records in what it calls a repo. These records live under a collection like <code>app.bsky.feed.post</code> and are given an <code>rkey</code> (record key). Together, this forms a URI for any given record that looks like <code>at://did/collection/rkey</code>. Importantly, records are mutable, unlike nostr events, and the contents an at:// uri points to may change. However, all the <em>commits</em> to your repo, which contain changes like record creation, editing, and deletion, are content-addressed using a CID, and these <em>are</em> immutable, and are all signed using your repo’s <em>signing key</em> (the one from your DID doc, remember?) Your commits can also optionally form a chain if you want, but when they don’t, deletes are easier. (If all of that flew over your head, don’t worry. All you need to know is that ATProto allows deletes and edits, while Nostr can’t.) Because your data all lives in this repo, unlike Nostr, ATProto actually has a canonical source for your data.</p>
<p>There’s also a single place where your repo <em>lives</em>, instead of being scattered as a bunch of events across Relays like in Nostr. Your repo lives in your Personal Data Server - as the name implies, a PDS is designed to store your personal data. While Nostr Relays are dumb pipes, PDSes are more like a user agent, which really performs almost all actions on the user’s behalf. It’s responsible for signing and storing commits to your repo and wrapping them in a nice API that’s easy for clients to use.</p>
<p>Actually, we should probably take a minute just to talk about deletes and edits. When I said Nostr <em>can’t</em> allow deletes and edits, that wasn’t completely true: Nostr <em>does</em> have a way to request deletes from Relays, which <em>most</em> but not all Relays support, but the real trouble is figuring out what a delete even means (and edits are straight-up impossible since Nostr event IDs are fully content-addressed). Nostr’s model is fundamentally based on an idea of events flowing from the creator into Relays, which then flow into other people’s clients, which cache them and republish them to other Relays, and so on. An event <em>doesn’t have a location</em> to be deleted from - it could be (and in Nostr’s model, should be!) anywhere and everywhere.</p>
<p>In ATProto, your repo actually has a place where it lived - your PDS, as specified in your DID doc. And at:// uris are mutable, so a commit can actually change the content it points to. Deletes remove content from your repo - although anybody who has a copy of your content pre-delete will still have it and can very easily cryptographically prove that it’s <em>your</em> content.</p>
<h3 id="trust">Trust</h3>
<p>Nostr and ATProto have relatively similar approaches to trust, though with some important differences. Nostr trusts nobody, and is built accordingly, with clients verifying <em>everything</em> themselves. ATProto assumes you trust <em>somebody</em>, but lets you choose whom you trust, and provides the mechanisms needed to verify that trust is placed correctly (although this could be improved).</p>
<p>Nostr, as mentioned earlier, was designed to basically eliminate the necessity of trust in the first place. Because everything is verified client-side, and essentially functions as a bunch of self-authenticated units of data traveling between relays and clients, there really is no one to trust. Relays can choose not to carry content, but other relays might have them instead. However, the fact that all data moves as individual units means that it would be harder to spot if only certain events are available.</p>
<p>Since every user is assumed to be pointing their client at more than one relay, it doesn’t really matter if <em>one</em> relay chooses not to carry someone’s content; there’s a high likelihood another one is. If many relays agree to hide something from the network, then it won’t show up, but that’s pretty unlikely to happen. As for trusting the authenticity of the content delivered by the relay, because it’s cryptographically verifiable as coming from the attached pubkey, any shenanigans will be spotted quickly. And verifying a pubkey’s identity is done by attaching it to a trusted NIP-05, i.e. @jack@cash.app or <a href="http://jb55.com/">@jb55.com</a>.</p>
<p>ATProto isn’t that different, all things considered, but there’s multiple other hops between the source of data and the client you view it in. Each ATProto PDS puts out a cryptographically verifiable stream of commits being pushed to repos on the PDS, carrying every bit of data to the subscribers, called the firehose. Because there are a lot of PDSes, an optimization also called a Relay was introduced, which basically aggregates PDS firehoses into its own giant firehose. In a way, this Relay could be considered its own centralization point where bad untrustworthy things could happen, but once more than one Relay exists this should be less of a problem. At the Relay and PDS, everything is cryptographically verifiable, and as a bonus because of ATProto’s repo structure, you can tell if you’re not getting the whole picture.</p>
<p>After the Relay, things get a bit murkier, because as an optimization ATProto applications use something called the AppView. The AppView reads in the firehose from the Relay constantly and pieces it together into fully hydrated and speedy APIs which make clients’ lives much easier. The thing about the AppView is that it’s basically centralized, and though it’s not super difficult to spot inconsistencies between what the AppView gives you and the true state of the network, the AppView doesn’t even provide the cryptographic signatures that were passed into it, making its trustworthiness a bit murky at some unknown time in the future, at which point other contenders will hopefully exist to replace it, based on analysis of which one is more trustworthy by comparing the data each AppView gives you with what actually exists on the Relay and PDSes.</p>
<h3 id="privacy">Privacy</h3>
<p>Everything is completely public on both protocols and in fact being actively broadcasted to loads of consumers, not just sitting around waiting to be stepped on and found. Nothing you do is really hideable from anyone.</p>
<p>However, at least on ATProto, there have been attempts to add some semblance of privacy to the network. For example, there are AppView-enforced blocks, but they can be bypassed very easily. There is also a setting which asks the client to not show your posts to logged-out users, but this is superficial at best, since only some clients really follow it anyways, and the “official” popular client does so it does kind of work. But overall these measures both run a risk of making people feel like their posts and other activity are hidden and safe, lulling them into acting with less precaution than they should, especially since there is a lack of user awareness around the all-public nature of data on the network.</p>
<p>No such attempts have been made on Nostr. This is on the one hand unfortunate, but on the other hand possibly better since it is more honest about the true nature of how public everything is on the network.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>Due to the Bluesky devs’ past experiences with developing on peer-to-peer and federated protocols, many of them felt burnt by a Scuttlebutt-and-Nostr-style approach to development, where specifications were loose and implementations varied wildly. Because of these past experiences, Bluesky chose to go with a slightly more slow, intentional, and centralized development model. The protocol is mostly developed within Bluesky the company, though often adapts to the needs and feedback from the wider ATProto developer community, and community members often contribute to both the protocol and the clients. The rollout of core features like federation and stackable moderation has also been much more slow on ATProto than similar features in Nostr implementations, because in general Bluesky prefers to take their time and “get it right” and standardized before letting things out into the wild. Also, despite the existence of third-party clients, the “official” Bluesky app and service is still the most popular one by a huge margin, due to its being the default (and basically only) inroad into the protocol and ecosystem. There are other up-and-coming AT Protocol projects that <em>aren’t</em> just Twitter clones, like WhiteWind for blogging, but overall the ecosystem remains sparse compared to Nostr.</p>
<p>Nostr, meanwhile, takes the same approach as these previous projects - the protocol itself just exists, very small, letting anyone expand on it. When an extension wants to become standardized, it’s reviewed by a small team including fiatjaf and a few others, and becomes part of the NIPs repository (Nostr Implementation Possibilities). This is basically classic BDFL open-source. However, clients and relays are free to try their own wild things without being “official” NIPs, and any NIP proposal must be adopted by a few clients and relays before it can be considered for “official” status. So it’s a much wilder, freer ecosystem so far.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<p>One of the places where ATProto and Nostr differ greatly is their model for building applications.</p>
<p>ATProto takes the AppView approach. An AppView is basically a service that reads in the firehose of all the public data on the network, and indexes it into hydrated “views” as an API which clients then use. AppViews are pretty resource-intensive to run and functionally centralized in nature. If you want to make a new ATProto app, you first design your schemas for content in a DSL called Lexicon. Then you make a client that can start publishing your record type, and retrieving and displaying it. For the retrieval and displaying, you create an AppView which monitors the firehose for your record types and indexes them into hydrated views, which your client can then fetch from and display nicely and neatly. This is, for example, how the Bluesky app can show a list of users who liked a post; because instead of the client having to crawl the entire network itself and figure out which likes are for the post you just viewed and then get the DID and fetch each of that user’s profiles and whether or not you’re following them by checking your own repo, and whether or not they’re following you by looking all over their follow lists, the client just makes one HTTP request and makes the result human-readable. Nice and fast. Of course, the relief that comes to the client means a lot of responsibility is thrusted onto the AppView, which becomes very resource-intensive to run.</p>
<p>The first steps to the Nostr model look similar at first, but rapidly diverge. With Nostr, you also start with defining event kinds, and then creating a client which can publish them, and then adding fetching and displaying. The key difference is in how events are fetched. With ATProto, you write an AppView to do the heavy lifting; with Nostr, the heavy lifting is shared between the Relay and the Client. When defining your event kinds, you make sure to also define how to use the “tags” field for that event kind, which is an array of key-value pairs with single letter keys which are indexed by the relays the events are sent to. Basically, if you want to do any kind of linking between events, or inserting any kind of indexable data, that’s where you want to do it.</p>
<p>Then for the fetching of the data, we use Nostr’s filtering system. With Nostr, there are two kinds of communication between the client and the relays; publishing events, which pushes the signed client-created event into the relay’s data store, and subscription. Subscription is the interesting part we’re looking at here.</p>
<p>Nostr clients can request a subscription to a stream of events from the relays they’re connected to, and this stream subscription can have filters attached. A filter is fully specified using the following attributes, all optional:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "ids": &lt;a list of event ids&gt;,
  "authors": &lt;a list of lowercase pubkeys, the pubkey of an event must be one of these&gt;,
  "kinds": &lt;a list of a kind numbers&gt;,
  "#&lt;single-letter (a-zA-Z)&gt;": &lt;a list of tag values, for #e — a list of event ids, for #p — a list of pubkeys, etc.&gt;,
  "since": &lt;an integer unix timestamp in seconds, events must be newer than this to pass&gt;,
  "until": &lt;an integer unix timestamp in seconds, events must be older than this to pass&gt;,
  "limit": &lt;maximum number of events relays SHOULD return in the initial query&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>By adding multiple filters, you can get all the events matching <em>any</em> of the filters. By adding multiple attributes to a single filter, you add multiple conditions that all have to be fulfilled for events to make it through that filter. Filters are expressly <em>the</em> mechanism for fetching content, since subscriptions are supposed to start by backfilling everything that meets the criteria, and then pushing any new events that meet the filters’ requirements to the client.</p>
<p>By studying the filter specification, it’s clear that basically every behavior of ATProto AppViews can be recreated through filters on the client-side, knowing how tags allow extensibility as well. There’s an obvious cost though: clients must be very complex and do a lot of work themselves, and for big events duplicating a lot of effort that could be handled by something akin to an AppView. The benefit of this is that it is very generic and means that any relay can generally be used for any functionality since everything you need is baked into the core protocol, and the speed of development is basically only constrained by the client, and not an AppView. And by not spending any resources on building a giant indexer yourself, you basically shift the cost onto the Relays instead. It’s another example of the more “bazaar” philosophy of Nostr compared to a more “cathedral” approach from ATProto.</p>
<p>So, all in all, this gives a pretty good picture of where the two protocols are now. But exciting things are on the horizon for both. We’re heading into uncharted territory…</p>
<h2 id="where-were-going">Where we’re going</h2>
<p>When Jack Dorsey wrote <em>a native internet protocol for social media</em>, he wrote that “<em>As far as the free and open social media protocol goes, there are many competing projects: @bluesky is one with the AT Protocol, nostr another, Mastodon yet another, Matrix yet another…and there will be many more. One will have a chance at becoming a standard like HTTP or SMTP.</em>”</p>
<p>That’s one way of thinking about it, as a competition for the final spot of “the standard for social”. But as you’ve probably noticed from reading this post up to here, I don’t really agree with this viewpoint. ATProto, Nostr, ActivityPub, Scuttlebutt, Matrix, IPFS, Dat, Holepunch, and others all share similar goals, yet have vastly different perspectives about how to accomplish them. Maybe these different perspectives will all lose! Maybe, as Jack says, one of them will win, becoming a standard that everyone adopts. Or maybe they will all learn from each other and slowly begin to converge. And it’s not hard to make the case that that last possibility will happen for at least two of these protocols - of course, Nostr and ATProto. In fact, that’s already happening.</p>
<h3 id="convergence">Convergence</h3>
<p>Because a lot of core ideas in the protocols were already very similar, they can quite easily borrow ideas from each other in order to improve themselves. By making nearly opposite compromises, they now face roughly opposite problems as well - but often, the other protocol already has a solution waiting for them. So first let’s look at some of the ways Nostr is becoming more like ATProto.</p>
<p>First, the idea of keys in a server, instead of purely client-side. As mentioned earlier, one of the dangers of Nostr keys is that by giving them to lots of random clients you try, they might accidentally end up in the hands of bad actors. One of the solutions to this was NIP-07 browser extensions; another one is the idea of an NSecBunker, for <strong>N</strong>ostr <strong>Sec</strong>ret Key <strong>Bunker</strong>. The idea is that this is a server, similar to a PDS, which holds your Nostr private key, and when your client wants to sign an event, it makes a request to your NSecBunker to sign that event using your private key, which stays safe in your Bunker. These requests usually are authenticated using measures like OAuth. It allows Nostr to bring back at least one part of the user experience people are familiar with.</p>
<p>Another idea that Nostr is ending up trying is something similar to AppViews. This is particularly divisive within the community, with many feeling that only the relay-based filtering mechanisms should be used to build clients. But because this is often inefficient, clients like Primal have begun doing their own pre-indexing of many users and posts in order to improve their UX. Unfortunately, Primal’s is proprietary, and only Primal can interact with it, due to the lack of any built-in support for AppView-style services in the Nostr protocol, vs. ATProto’s numerous mechanisms to provide explicit support for this use case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some Nostr ideas are naturally going to the ATProto world as well. The idea of keys directly owned by the users has long been floated, and at this point developers can get control of their did:plc and its rotationKeys (fun fact: I set one of my plc rotationKeys to my Nostr pubkey). Unfortunately no nice UI exists for this yet. And as for signing keys, with commits that could be pushed to a PDS instead of made there, that would rely on a PDS supporting this use case. No PDS implementation currently supports this, but there is <a href="https://github.com/ovnanova/hexpds">one in development</a> which hopes to at some point ;)</p>
<p>Another idea which I hope to see adopted in the ATProto world is something similar to Nostr’s filters model. While the AppView model is nice for production apps, something like Nostr filters could help a lot early in development to just play with an idea and try it out. And it could help those with concerns about the trustworthiness of AppViews quickly verify it against certain queries. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pfrazee.com/post/3kw6jquvdgl2c">You can do a shocking amount with backlinks</a> alone.</p>
<p>Of course, the slow convergence of both protocols isn’t the only way the divide between them is being bridged…</p>
<h3 id="bridging">Bridging</h3>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://fed.brid.gy/">Bridgy Fed</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/05/bluesky-and-mastodon-users-can-now-talk-to-each-other-with-bridgy-fed/">started bridging the Fediverse and the ATmosphere</a>with each other. For a while, services like <a href="https://mostr.pub/">Mostr</a>have been bridging the Fediverse and Nostr with each other. Now, if you visit the Mostr homepage and scroll down, you can probably see where this is going…</p>
<p>Soon after Bridgy Fed started bridging the Fediverse and the ATmosphere, Nostr users experimented with this to bridge between Nostr and Bluesky. Very much an indirect hack, but also a glimpse at the future.</p>
<p>One of the most important promises of decentralized social media was that no matter what service you signed up on and post on, you would be able to see content from and interact with anyone, no matter which service <em>they</em> used either. Now, all this would work, if every service signed on to the same decentralized social protocol. However, instead, we have many, and none of them show much of a sign of becoming <em>the</em> singular standard for social media. Instead of Jack’s vision of <em>one</em> winner, bridges offer a vision of a world where every protocol can win, and it <em>truly</em> won’t matter which <em>protocol</em> your service uses, either.</p>
<p>While the bridging I talked about above was very indirect, Bridgy Fed itself may soon have native Nostr support. Soon all three major decentralized protocols may be able to talk to each other, and easily too.</p>
<hr>
<p>So. Let’s recap what we’ve been through in this post so far. In the beginning, there was Twitter. Twitter’s problems caused them to look to decentralization as a way to make social media more fair. This caused many new decentralized protocols to emerge, taking inspiration from older ones. Of these new protocols, two of them, Nostr and ATProto, evolved in similar directions, yet unaware of each other made many opposite compromises. And now they are evolving back towards each other, converging in potentially very interesting ways, with bridging offering to make social media not just platform- but protocol-agnostic.</p>
<p>The future is looking good for decentralized social media.</p>

In <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/"><code>pyproject.toml</code></a> there's <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies"><code>project.dependencies</code></a> for dependencies you always need for your code to run, <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#dependencies-optional-dependencies"><code>project.optional-dependencies</code></a> (aka extras), for when you want to offer your users the option to install additional dependencies, and then there's <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-groups/"><code>dependency-groups</code></a> for dependencies that are not meant for end-users (e.g. listing your test dependencies).</p><p>But letting users control what is (not) installed isn't the end of things. There's also the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/dependency-specifiers/"><em>specifiers</em></a> you can add to any of your listed dependencies. They allow you to not only restrict what versions of things you want (i.e. setting a lower-bound and <strong>not</strong> setting an upper-bound if you can help it), but also when the dependency actually applies (e.g. is it specific to Windows?).</p><p>Put that all together and you end up with a graph of dependencies who edges dictate whether a dependency applies on some platform. If you manage to write it all out then you have <em>multi-use</em> lock files which are portable across platforms and whatever options the installing users selects, compared to <em>single-use</em> lock files that have a specific applicability due to only supporting a single platform and set of input dependencies.</p><p>Oh, and even getting the complete list of dependencies in either case is an NP-complete problem.</p><p>And it make makes things "interesting", I also wanted the file format to be written by software but readable by people, secure by default, fast to install, and allow the <em>locker</em> which write the lock file to be different from the <em>installer</em> that performs the install (and either be written in a language other than Python).</p><p>In the end, it all worked out (luckily); you can read the spec for all the nitty-gritty details about <code>pylock.toml</code> or <a href="https://youtu.be/MMVVboVL5eU?si=_aoKRKmK59HaZTpy">watch the keynote</a> where I go through the spec. But it sure did take a while to get to this point.</p><h2 id="why-it-took-over-4-years">Why it took (over) 4 years</h2><p>I'm not sure if this qualifies as the longest single project I have ever taken on for Python (rewriting the import system might still hold that record for me), but it definitely felt the most intense over a prolonged period of time.</p><p>The oldest record I have that I was thinking about this problem is a tweet from Feb 2019:</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/lock-file-format-idea-on-Twitter.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="912" height="771" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/lock-file-format-idea-on-Twitter.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/lock-file-format-idea-on-Twitter.png 912w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h2 id="2019">2019</h2><p>That year there were 106 posts on discuss.python.org about a <code>requirements.txt</code> v2 proposal. It didn't come to any specific conclusion that I can recall, but it at least got the conversation started.</p><h2 id="2020">2020</h2><p>The next year, the conversation continued and generated 43 posts. I was personally busy with <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a> and the <code>[project]</code> table in <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p><h2 id="2021">2021</h2><p>In January of 2021 Tzu-Ping Chung, Pradyun Gedam, and myself began researching how other language ecosystems did lock files. It culminated in us writing <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/">PEP 665</a> and posting it in July. That led to 359 posts that year.</p><p>The goal of PEP 665 was a very secure lock file which partially achieved that goal by only supporting wheels. With no source trees or sdists to contend with, it meant installation didn't involve executing a build back-end which can be slow, be indeterminate, and a security risk simply due to running more code. We wrote the PEP with the idea that any source trees or sdists would be built into wheels out-of-band so you could then lock against those wheels.</p><h2 id="2022">2022</h2><p>In the end, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-665-take-2-a-file-format-to-list-python-dependencies-for-reproducibility-of-an-application/11736/141">PEP 665 was rejected</a> in January of 2022, generating 106 posts on the subject both before and after the rejection. It turns out enough people had workflows dependent on sdists that they balked at having the added step of building wheels out-of-band. There was also some desire to also lock the build back-end dependencies.</p><h2 id="2023">2023</h2><p>After the failure of PEP 665, I decided to try to tackle the problem again entirely on my own. I didn't want to drag other poor souls into this again and I thought that being opinionated might make things a bit easier (compromising to please everyone can lead to bad outcomes when a spec if large and complicated like I knew this would be).</p><p>I also knew I was going to need a proof-of-concept. That meant I needed code that could get metadata from an index server, resolve all the dependencies some set of projects needed (at least from a wheel), and at least know what I would install on any given platform. Unfortunately a lot of that didn't exist as some library on PyPI, so I had to write a bunch of it myself. Luckily I had already started the journey before with my <a href="https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender">mousebender</a> project, but that only covered the metadata from an index server. I still needed to be able to read <code>MEtADATA</code> files from a wheel and do the resolution. The former Donald Stufft had taken a stab at and which I picked up and completed, leading to <a href="https://packaging.pypa.io/en/stable/metadata.html"><code>packaging.metadata</code></a>. I then used <a href="https://pypi.org/project/resolvelib/">resolvelib</a> to create a resolver.</p><p>As such there were only 54 posts about lock files that were general discussion. The key outcome there was trying to lock for build back-ends confused people too much, and so I dropped that feature request from my thinking.</p><h2 id="2024">2024</h2><p>Come 2024, I was getting enough pieces together to actually have a proof-of-concept. And then <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> came out in February. That complicated things a bit as it did/planned to do things I had planned to help entice people to care about lock files. I also knew I couldn't keep up with the folks at <a href="https://astral.sh/">Astral</a> as I didn't get to work on this full-time as a job (although I did get a lot more time starting in September of 2024).</p><p>I also became a parent in April which initially gave me a chunk of time (babies for the first couple of months sleep a lot, so if gives you a bit of time). And so in July I posted the first draft of <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0751/">PEP 751</a>. It was based on <code>pdm.lock</code> (which itself is based on <code>poetry.lock</code>). It covered sdists and wheels and was multi-use, all by recording the projects to install as a set which made installation fast.</p><p>But uv's popularity was growing and they had extra needs that <a href="https://pdm-project.org/">PDM</a> and <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a>– the other major participants in the PEP discussions --didn't. And do I wrote another draft where I pivoted from a set of projects to a graph of projects. But otherwise the original feature set was all there.</p><p>And then <a href="https://hynek.me/">Hynek</a> came by with what seemed like an innocuous request about making the version of a listed project optional instead of required (which was done because the <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/core-metadata/#version">version</a> is required in <code>PKG-INFO</code> in sdists and <code>METADATA</code> in wheels).</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/hynek-post.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="763" height="164" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/hynek-post.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/hynek-post.png 763w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Unfortunately the back-and-forth on that was enough to cause the Astral folks to want to scale the whole project back all the way to the <code>requirements.txt</code> v2 solution.</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/charlie-backtracks.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="709" height="113" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/charlie-backtracks.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/charlie-backtracks.png 709w"></figure><p>While I understood their reasoning and motivation, I would be lying if I said it wasn't disappointing. I felt we were extremely close up to that point in reaching an agreement on the PEP, and then having to walk back so much work and features did not exactly make me happy.</p><p>This was covered by 974 posts on discuss.python.org.</p><h2 id="2025">2025</h2><p>But to get consensus among uv, Poetry, and PDM, I did a third draft of PEP 751. This went back to the set of projects to install, but was single-use only. I also became extremely stringent with timelines on when people could provide feedback as well as what would be required to add/remove anything. At this point I was fighting burn-out on this subject and my own wife had grown tired of the subject and seeing me feel dejected every time there was a setback. And so I set a deadline of the end of March to get things done, even if I had to drop features to make it happen.</p><p>And in February I thought we had reached and agreement on this third draft. But then Frost Ming, the maintainer of PDM, asked why did we drop multi-use lock files when they thought the opposition wasn't that strong?</p><figure><img src="https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/frost-disappointed.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="770" height="161" srcset="https://snarky.ca/content/images/size/w600/2025/10/frost-disappointed.png 600w, https://snarky.ca/content/images/2025/10/frost-disappointed.png 770w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>And so, with another 150 posts and some very strict deadlines for feedback, we managed to bring back multi-use lock files and get PEP 751 accepted-- with no changes! -- on March 31.</p><h2 id="2-peps-and-6-years-later">2 PEPs and 6 years later ...</h2><p>If you add in some ancillary discussions, the total number of posts on the subject of lock files since 2019 comes to over 1.8K. But as I write this post, less than 7 months since PEP 751 was accepted, PDM has already been updated to allow users to opt into using <code>pylock.toml</code> over <code>pdm.lock</code> (which shows that the lock file format works and meets the needs of at least one of the three key projects I tried to make happy). Uv and pip also have some form of support.</p><p>I will say, though, that I think I'm done with major packaging projects (work has also had me move on from working on packaging since April, so any time at this point would be my free time, which is scant when you have a toddler). Between <code>pyproject.toml</code> and <code>pylock.toml</code>, I'm ready to move on to the next area of Python where I think I could be the most useful.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div fs-richtext-element="rich-text"><p>At Together AI, the AI&nbsp;Native Cloud, we’re obsessed with performance. Making large language models faster, cheaper, and more efficient is not a one-trick problem — it requires optimizing along multiple axes. That is the philosophy behind <strong>Together Turbo</strong>, our suite of inference innovations that draw from research in algorithms, architectures, and modeling recipes. We’re excited to introduce the AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System (ATLAS), the first speculator of its kind that gives automatic performance improvements without any manual tuning.</p><p>ATLAS offers a new way of doing speculative decoding — one that dynamically improves at runtime — and it fits seamlessly alongside our other Turbo techniques like the proprietary <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/fastest-inference-for-deepseek-r1-0528-with-nvidia-hgx-b200" data-wf-native-id-path="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbb" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbb">Together Turbo Speculator</a> or <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/customized-speculative-decoding" data-wf-native-id-path="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbe" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="0d7c609d-fee6-590e-78bc-954662bdbdbe">Custom Speculators</a>. But why create an adaptive-learning speculator system?</p><p>Standard speculators are trained for general workloads. Custom speculators are trained on your specific data, but only for a specific snapshot in time. However, as the workload evolves (codebase grows, traffic patterns shift, request distributions change), even highly customized speculators can fall behind. In contrast, ATLAS evolves automatically with usage, learning from both historical patterns and live traffic to continuously align with the target model’s behaviors in real time. This means the more you use our inference service, the better ATLAS will perform!&nbsp;</p><p>Built on top of Together Turbo Speculator, ATLAS reaches up to 500 TPS on <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/deepseek-v3-1/providers#output-speed" data-wf-native-id-path="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df816" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df816">DeepSeek-V3.1</a> and up to 460 TPS on <a href="https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/kimi-k2-0905/providers#output-speed" data-wf-native-id-path="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df819" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="d7282ffd-cf58-89e7-1f7f-7aa66b1df819">Kimi-K2</a> in a fully adapted scenario — 2.65x faster than standard decoding, outperforming even specialized hardware like Groq (Figure 1). </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e6f5c39323d811dc587281_Self-Adaptive%20Spec%20-%20DS%20V3.1%20and%20Kimi-k2-v6.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 1: We show the decoding speed on NVIDIA HGX B200 with our Turbo speculator and the adaptive-learning speculator system for DeepSeek-V3.1 (top) KIMI-K2-0905 (bottom) with Arena Hard traffic.1</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>1. Speculative Decoding</strong></h2><p>Speculative decoding is one of the most powerful levers for accelerating inference.<sup>2</sup> Instead of having the target model generate every token step by step, a faster <strong>speculator </strong>(also known as the <strong>draft model</strong>)<strong> </strong>proposes multiple tokens ahead, and the target model <em>verifies</em> them in parallel in a single forward pass. The verification process ensures that the quality of the output matches the distribution of non-speculative decoding, while achieving speedups by accepting many tokens at a time.</p><p>The overall speed is influenced by the acceptance rate $α$ (i.e., how often the target model agrees with the drafted tokens from the speculator) and the relative latency $c$ of the draft versus the target. Typically, larger speculators with more parameters yield higher acceptance rates due to their higher capacity but are slower to generate draft tokens. Progress therefore comes from both sides: aligning draft and target models to increase $α$ (training objectives, data, and algorithms) and designing draft models/kernels that keep $c$ low while maintaining $α$ (sparsity, quantization, lightweight &amp; kernel-efficient architectures). The sweet spot is where a high $α$ meets a low $c$, minimizing end-to-end latency. </p><div>

Figure 2: Interactive speedup calculator for speculative decoding. Different optimization techniques influence acceptance rate or draft latency, creating a complex optimization space to maximize speedup. The optimal lookahead (γ) itself varies with model configuration – strong speculators (high α, low c) continue gaining from longer lookaheads (γ = 5+), while weaker configurations (low α, high c) plateau early (γ = 3-4).
</figcaption></p><p>‍</p><p>At Together AI, the Turbo team has developed high-performance speculators that have achieved <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/fastest-inference-for-deepseek-r1-0528-with-nvidia-hgx-b200" data-wf-native-id-path="4e513b19-1d7f-c529-35b1-05004c16ac2f" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="4e513b19-1d7f-c529-35b1-05004c16ac2f"><strong>the world’s fastest decoding speeds on NVIDIA Blackwell</strong></a> by drawing on advances across architecture, sparsity, algorithms, post-training recipes, and data [1-9]. We’ve built a <strong>speculator design and selection framework</strong> that determines the optimal speculator architecture (width/depth, lookahead, sparsity/quantization, KV reuse) and a <strong>scalable training system</strong> that brings up speculators for the largest and most challenging open-source targets quickly and reproducibly (e.g., DeepSeek-V3.1 and Kimi-K2). For instance, while Kimi ships without a ready-to-use speculator, we can train and deploy one rapidly and take Kimi from ~150 TPS out of the box to 270+ TPS on the same hardware and batch settings, while preserving target-model quality (see Figure 1, yellow bars).<strong> </strong>This pipeline powers Turbo Speculators that deliver state-of-the-art decoding latency, and it sets the stage for what comes next: <strong>an Adaptive-Learning Speculator System </strong>that adjusts token drafting to the workload in real time.</p><h2><strong>2. Introducing Turbo’s Adaptive-Learning Speculator System</strong></h2><p>At Together AI, we power a broad range of inference workloads. But today’s speculative decoding methods are constrained to using a <strong>static</strong> speculator, trained on a fixed dataset. Once deployed, the speculator cannot adapt, leading to degrading performance if the input distribution evolves. This problem is particularly pronounced in serverless, multi-tenant environments, where input diversity is sky-high. New users continuously arrive, and bring with them unique workloads that the fixed speculator may not have seen during training. Furthermore, these speculators typically use a <em>fixed lookahead</em>, predicting the same number of tokens regardless of the speculator’s confidence. Put simply, <em>a static speculator cannot keep up</em>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e5f97cde692a7dd4e66daf_Adaptive-Learning%20Speculator%20System%20Design.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 3: Two speculators—one static, one adaptive—work with a confidence-aware controller that selects between them and adjusts lookahead for optimal accuracy and speed.</figcaption></figure><p>To address these limitations, we designed the<strong> Adaptive-Learning Speculative System </strong>with two cooperating speculators, as shown in Figure 3:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>A heavyweight <em>static</em> speculator</strong> trained on a broad corpus that provides strong, general speculation.</li><li><strong>A lightweight <em>adaptive</em> speculator</strong> that allows for rapid, low-overhead updates from real-time traffic, specializing on-the-fly to emerging domains.</li><li>A <strong>confidence-aware controller that</strong> chooses which speculator to trust at each step and what speculation lookahead to use, using longer speculations when the speculator has high confidence.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Efficiency Guardrail via Static Speculator. </strong>The static Turbo Speculator serves as an always-on speed floor: it is trained on a broad corpus and remains stable across workloads, so TPS does not collapse when traffic shifts or the adaptive path is cold. In ATLAS, we use it to jump-start speed and provide a fail-safe fallback—if confidence drops or drift is detected, the controller shortens lookahead or routes back to the static path to preserve latency while the adaptive speculator relearns.</p><p><strong>Customized Speculator vs. Adaptive-Learning</strong>.<strong> </strong>We know from our previous studies that a <a href="https://www.together.ai/blog/customized-speculative-decoding" data-wf-native-id-path="7d9d3fc9-ab60-48db-3a39-d2349c45db72" data-wf-ao-click-engagement-tracking="true" data-wf-element-id="7d9d3fc9-ab60-48db-3a39-d2349c45db72">customized speculator</a> trained on samples from real traffic that mirror expected usage delivers an additional speed boost. The Adaptive-Learning Speculator enables us to be even more customized in real time. For instance, during a vibe-coding session, the adaptive system can specialize a lightweight speculator for the relevant code files being edited and not seen during training, further increasing the acceptance rate and decoding speed. This kind of on-the-fly specialization is hard to achieve with static speculators.</p><p><strong>Accelerating RL Training</strong>. Reinforcement learning (RL) alternates between two phases: (1) a rollout phase, where the current policy generates trajectories and receives rewards, and (2) an update phase, where we use the rewards to update the policy. In practice, rollouts are often the bottleneck, accounting for roughly 70% of total wall-clock time<sup>3</sup>. In general, because the policy distribution shifts throughout training, static speculators quickly fall out of alignment with the target policy, resulting in sub-optimal throughput.<sup>4</sup> ATLAS addresses this by adapting online to the evolving policy and the specific RL domain, maintaining alignment and reducing the overall rollout time. The domain-specific, iterative nature of RL further enables rapid adaptation, yielding sustained and growing speedups. As shown in Figure 4, applying ATLAS to the RL-MATH pipeline produces increasing speedups as training progresses.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e5cccee6c757846d59aed8_acceptance-rate-during-RL-training-3.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 4: We train Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M on DeepScaler subsets using ATLAS for RL on NVIDIA Hopper H100 GPUs. The acceptance rate rises from below 10% to above 80% over 1.4k training steps, resulting in a more than 60% reduction for overall training time without changing RL training algorithm.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Built as part of the Turbo optimization suite. </strong>The Adaptive-Learning Speculator System is a core component of the broader Turbo optimization suite, where each layer of optimization compounds the benefits of the others. As illustrated in Figure 5, performance progressively improves through near-lossless quantization (calibrated to preserve quality), the Turbo Speculator, and finally the Adaptive-Learning Speculator System. Additional optimizations in the suite include TurboBoost-TTFT (not shown) for reducing time-to-first-token latency, further contributing to end-to-end acceleration.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/650c3b59079d92475f37b68f/68e6f5e6a8a424ecee85949a_Together%20Turbo%20Optimization%20Suite-v5.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Figure 5: Performance gains across the Together Turbo Optimization Suite, showing progressive speed improvements from vanilla FP8 DeepSeek baseline (105 TPS) to the Adaptive-Learning Speculator System (501 TPS). The experiment is based on NVIDIA HGX B200 with batch-size 1, as detailed in Figure 1.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Extreme Peak Efficiency</strong>. When the input distribution is narrow and outputs closely echo previously seen tokens, the adaptive system specializes quickly. In this scenario, the controller becomes confident in utilizing more tokens from the lightweight speculator and lengthens lookahead tokens. This yields consistently higher TPS than static or one-off custom speculators can maintain. As shown in Figures 1 and 5, once fully adapted to Arena-Hard traffic, DeepSeek achieves up to 500 tokens per second for batch size 1 on 4 B200 GPUs, delivering a 400% speedup over the FP8 baseline (improvement from 105 TPS to 501 TPS).</p><p>{{custom-cta-1}}</p><h2><strong>Build the Future of Efficient AI</strong></h2><p>In parallel to making models smarter and more capable, advancements in inference efficiency are just as transformative – because intelligence only matters when you can deliver it swiftly, cost-effectively, and at scale.

Speculative decoding is typically not beneficial in pure throughput- or compute-bound settings, where GPUs are fully saturated. However, in reinforcement learning (RL) training, the situation can be different. Agent RL training often operates with small batch sizes and CPU-driven environment steps, where each agent waits for model outputs to do the next action. In this regime, endpoint latency (tokens per second per request) becomes the bottleneck. This makes speculative decoding highly applicable for RL training, if there is a suitable and high performant speculator. Faster decoding pipeline can improve CPU utilization and overall sample throughput.&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><p>[1] Medusa: Simple LLM Inference Acceleration Framework with Multiple Decoding Heads</p><p>[2] SpecExec: Massively Parallel Speculative Decoding for Interactive LLM Inference on Consumer Devices</p><p>[3] Ladder-Residual: Parallelism-Aware Architecture for Accelerating Large Model Inference with Communication Overlapping&nbsp;</p><p>[4] TEAL: Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Model</p><p>[5] The Mamba in the Llama: Distilling and Accelerating Hybrid Models</p><p>[6] SEQUOIA: Scalable and Robust Speculative Decoding</p><p>[7] Mixture-of-Agents Alignment: Harnessing the Collective Intelligence of Open-Source LLMs to Improve Post-Training</p><p>[8] Boosting DeepSeek-R1’s Speed with Customized Speculative Decoding</p><p>[9] DeepSWE: Training a Fully Open-sourced, State-of-the-Art Coding Agent by Scaling RL </p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Apple <a href="https://www.anildash.com/2025/09/09/how-tim-cook-sold-out-steve-jobs/">bent the knee</a> for months, leaving many commentators to ask why. But the reasons are not mysterious: Apple <em>wants</em> things that only the government can provide, things that will defend and extend its power to extract rents, rather than innovate. Namely, selective exemption from tariffs and an end to the spectre of pro-competition regulation that might bring real browser choice in the US, the EU, and around the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/apples-antitrust-playbook/">Over the past few weeks,</a> Tim Apple got a lot what he paid for,<sup><a href="#fn-bonus-treats-1" id="fnref-bonus-treats-1">1</a></sup> with the full weight of the US foreign and industrial policy apparatus <a href="https://on.ft.com/4h8bcXt">threatening the EU over <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> enforcement.</a> This has been part of a full-court press from Cupertino. Apple <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250925-apple-asks-eu-to-scrap-landmark-digital-competition-law">simultaneously threatened the EU</a> while rolling out <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damiengeradin_can-small-tech-survive-the-digital-markets-activity-7376973488991137792-M_kG">fresh astroturf for pliant regulators to recline on.</a> This is loud, coordinated, and calculated. But calculated to achieve <em>what</em>? Why is the <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> such a threat to Apple?</p>
<p>Interoperability.</p>
<p>The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> holds the power to unlock true, safe, interoperability via the web. It's core terms <em>require</em> that Apple facilitate real browser engine choice, and <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/owa-at-the-eu-parliament-dma-working-group/#browser-engines-and-the-dma">Apple is all but refusing,</a> playing games to prevent powerful and safe iOS browsers and the powerful web applications they facilitate. Web applications <a href="https://infrequently.org/2024/01/the-web-is-the-app-store/">that can challenge the App Store.</a></p>
<p>Unlike tariffs, which present a threat to short-term profits through higher costs and suppression of upgrades in the near term, interoperability is a larger and more insidious boogeyman for Apple. It could change <em>everything</em>.</p>
<h2 id="who's-afraid-of-the-big-bad-web%3F" tabindex="-1"><a href="#who's-afraid-of-the-big-bad-web%3F">Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Web?</a></h2>
<p>Apple's profits are less and less attributable to innovation as <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/14629/apple-services-revenue/?srsltid=AfmBOooHzmlC-KPd9ujiOzEs1lHlaFUDUIsOEC8ODn32ops-5dUK73s_">“services” revenue swells Cupertino's coffers out of all proportion to iPhone sales volume.</a> “Services” is code for rent extraction from captive users and developers. If they could acquire and make safe apps outside the App Store, Apple wouldn't be able to take 30% from an outlandishly large fraction of the digital ecosystem's wealthiest players.</p>
<p>Apple understands browser choice is a threat to its <em>rentier</em> model. The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> holds the potential for developers to finally access the safe, open, and interoperable web technologies that power most desktop computing today. This is a <em>particular</em> threat to Apple, because its class-leading hardware is perfectly suited to running web applications. This helps to explain why Apple simultaneously demands control over all browser technology on iOS while <a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/">delaying</a>, <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/history-of-safari-show-stoppers/">constantly breaking</a> foundational <a href="https://webventures.rejh.nl/blog/2024/web-push-ios-one-year/">web APIs</a>, and <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/cupertinos-comforting-myths/">gaslighting developers about Apple's unwillingness to solve pressing problems.</a></p>
<p>Keeping capable, stable, high-quality browsers away from iOS is necessary to maintain the App Store's monopoly on the features every app needs. Keeping other software distribution mechanisms from offering those features at a lower price is a hard requirement for Cupertino's extractive business model. The web (in particular, <a href="https://infrequently.org/2015/06/progressive-apps-escaping-tabs-without-losing-our-soul/"><abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr></a>) present a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Unlike alternative app stores that let developers decouple distributing proprietary apps from Apple's App Store, <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> free developers from building for each OS at all, allowing them to deliver apps though a zero-cost cost platform that builds on standardised APIs. For small developers, this is transformative, and it's why late-stage Apple cannot abide laws that create commercial fairness and enable safe, secure, pro-user alternatives.</p>
<h2 id="dots-unconnected" tabindex="-1"><a href="#dots-unconnected">Dots Unconnected</a></h2>
<p>This is what Apple is mortgaging its brand (or, if you prefer, soul) to prevent: a world where users have a real choice in browsers.</p>
<p>Horrors.</p>
<p>Apple is loaning its monopoly on iOS software to <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">yet another</a> authoritarian regime without a fight, painting a stark contrast: when profits are on the line, Cupertino will gaslight democratic regulators and defy pro-user laws with all the $1600/hr lawyers Harvard can graduate. And when it needs a transactional authoritarian's help to make that happen, temporarily<sup><a href="#fn-it-hopes-2" id="fnref-it-hopes-2">2</a></sup> loaning out Apple's godlike power over iOS devices to censor clearly protected speech isn't too much to ask. Struggle for thee, but not for me.</p>
<p>The kicker is that the only alternative for affected users and developers is Apple's web apps implementation; the same platform Cupertino serially knee-caps to deflect competition with its high-tax offerings.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say the tech press is letting democracy down by failing to connect the dots. Why is Apple capitulating? Because Apple <em>wants things</em> from the government. What are those things? We should be deep into that debate, but our <em>reportage</em> and editorial classes cannot seem to grasp that A precedes B. The obvious answers are also the right ones: selective protection from tariffs, defanged prosecution by the DOJ, and an umbrella from the EU's democratic, pro-competition regulation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism">The Verge tiptoed <em>ever so close</em> to getting it,</a> quoting <a href="https://wileyhodges.substack.com/p/my-email-to-tim-cook?r=qlwt">letters that former Apple executives sent the company:</a><sup><a href="#fn-servile-frames-3" id="fnref-servile-frames-3">3</a></sup></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to believe that Apple were unequivocally ‘the good guys,’” Hodges writes. “I passionately advocated for people to understand Apple as being on the side of its users above all else. I now feel like I must question that.”</p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism" taget="_blank">— Wiley Hodges,<br>"The Verge"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>This is a clue; a lead that a more thoughtful press and tech commentariat could use to evaluate the frames the parties deploy to their own benefit.</p>
<h2 id="%22who-should-rule%3F%22" tabindex="-1"><a href="#%22who-should-rule%3F%22"><em>"Who should rule?"</em></a></h2>
<p>The tech press is failing to grasp the moral stakes of API access. Again and again they flunk at connecting boring questions of who can write and distribute programs that use particular capabilities of phones to urgent issues of power over publication and control of devices. By declining to join these threads, they allow the unearned and increasingly indefensible power of mobile OS vendors to proliferate. The urgent question is how that power can be attenuated, or as Poppper put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must ask whether…we should not prepare for the worst leaders, and hope for the best. But this leads to a new approach to the problem of politics, for it forces us to replace the question: <strong>"Who should rule?"</strong> by the new question: <strong>"How can we so organize political institutions that bad or incompetent rulers can be prevented from doing too much damage?"</strong></p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.59272/page/n135/mode/1up" taget="_blank">— Karl Popper,<br>"The Open Society and Its Enemies"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>But the tech press does not ask these questions.</p>
<p>Instead of questioning why Apple's OS is so fundamentally insecure that an App Store is necessary, they accept the ever-false idea that iOS has been relatively secure <em>because</em> of the App Store.</p>
<p>Instead of confronting Apple with the reality that it used the App Store to hand out privacy-invading APIs in undisciplined ways to unscrupulous actors, it congratulates Cupertino on the next episode of our <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/08/apple-vs-fb-kayfabe/">nightly kayfabe.</a> The links between Apple's monopoly on sensitive APIs and the growth of monopolies in adjacent sectors are rarely, if ever, questioned. Far too often, the tech press accepts the narrative structure of Apple's marketing, satisfying pangs of journalistic conscience with largely ineffectual discussions about specific features that will not upset the power balance.</p>
<p>Nowhere, e.g., in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/795248/former-apple-exec-iceblock-removal-criticism">The Verge's coverage of these letters</a> is there a discussion about alternatives to the App Store. Only a few outlets ever press Apple on its suppression of web apps, including failure to add <abbr title="Progressive Web App">PWA</abbr> install banners and essential capabilities. It's not an <em>Apple vs. Google</em> horse-race story, and so discussion of power distribution doesn't get coverage.</p>
<p>Settling for occasionally embarrassing Apple into partially reversing its most visibly egregious actions is ethically and morally stunted. Accepting the frame of <em>"who should rule?"</em> that Cupertino reflexively deploys is toxic to any hope of worthwhile technology because it creates and celebrates the idea of kings, leaving us supine relative to the mega-corps in our phones.</p>
<p>This is, in a word, childish.</p>
<p>Adults understand that things are complicated, that even the best intentioned folks get things wrong, or can go astray in larger ways. We build institutions and technologies to protect ourselves and those we love from the worst impacts of those events, and those institutions <em>always</em> model struggles over power and authority. And if we are lucky enough to build well, we build balanced systems that attenuate any attempts at over authoritarianism.</p>
<p>In other words, the exact opposite of Apple's infantilising and authoritarian world view.</p>
<p>Instead of debating which wealthy vassals might be more virtuous than the current rulers, we should instead focus on attenuating the power of these monarchical, centralising actors. The <abbr title="The EU's Digital Markets Act">DMA</abbr> is doing this, creating the conditions for interoperability, and through interoperability, competition. Apple know it, and <em>that's</em> why they're willing to pawn their own dignity, along with the rights of fellow Americans, to snuff out the threat.</p>
<p>These are not minor points. Apple has <em>power</em>, and that power comes from its effective monopoly on the APIs that make applications possible on the most important computing platform of our adult lives.</p>
<p>Protecting this power has become an end unto itself, curdling the pro-social narratives Apple takes pains to identify itself with. Any reporter that bothers to do <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/balancing-security-and-fair-competition/">what a scrappy band of web developers have done</a> — to actually <em>read</em> the self-contradictory tosh Apple flings at regulators and legislators around the world — would have been better prepared for this moment. They would be able to pattern match; to see that twisting words to defend the indefensible isn't somehow alien to Apple. It's not even unusual.</p>
<p>But The Verge, 404, and even Wired are declining to connect the dots. If our luminaries can't or won't dig in, what hope do less thoughtful publications with wider audiences have?</p>
<p>Apple's power and profits have made it an enemy of democracy and civic rights at home and abroad. A mealy-mouthed tech press that cannot see or say the obvious is worse than useless; it is an ally in Apple's attempts to obfuscate.</p>
<p>The most important story about smartphones for at least the past decade has been <a href="https://infrequently.org/series/browser-choice-must-matter/">Cupertino's suppression of the web,</a> because that is a true threat to the App Store, and Apple's power flows from <a href="https://infrequently.org/2025/09/apples-crimes-against-the-internet-community/#apple's-unique-monopoly">the monopolies</a> it braids together. As Cory Doctorow observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple's story – the story of all centralized, authoritarian technology – is that you have to trade freedom for security. If you want technology that Just Works(TM), you need to give up on the idea of being able to override the manufacturer's decisions. It's always prix-fixe, never a la carte.</p>
<p>This is a kind of vulgar Thatcherism, a high-tech version of her maxim that "there is no alternative." Decomposing the iPhone into its constituent parts – thoughtful, well-tested technology; total control by a single vendor – is posed as a logical impossibility, like a demand for water that's not wet</p>
<p><span>        <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/28/works-well/#fails-well" taget="_blank">— Cory Doctorow,<br>"Plenty of room at the bottom (of the tech stack)"</a>      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<h2 id="the-price-of-high-modernism-is-dignity" tabindex="-1"><a href="#the-price-of-high-modernism-is-dignity">The Price of High Modernism is Dignity</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/10/06/rogue-capitalism/#orphaned-syrian-refugees-need-not-apply">Doctorow's piece</a> on these outrages is a must-read, as it does what so many in the tech press fail to attempt: connecting patterns of behaviour over time and geography to make sense of Apple's capitulation. It also burrows into the rot at the heart of the App Store: the claim that anybody should have as much power as Apple has arrogated to itself.</p>
<p>We can see clearly now that this micro-authoritarian structure is easily swayed by macro-authoritarians, and bends easily to those demands. As James C. Scott <a href="https://home.uchicago.edu/csunstei/moreisless.html">discusses</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe that many of the most tragic episodes of state development in the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries originate in a particularly pernicious combination of three elements. The first is the aspiration to the administrative ordering of nature and society, an aspiration that we have already seen at work in scientific forestry, but one raised to a far more comprehensive and ambitious level. “High modernism” seems an appropriate term for this aspiration. As a faith, it was shared by many across a wide spectrum of political ideologies. Its main carriers and exponents were the avant-garde among engineers, planners, technocrats, high-level administrators, architects, scientists, and visionaries.</p>
<p>If one were to imagine a pantheon or Hall of Fame of high-modernist figures, it would almost certainly include such names as Henri Comte de Saint-Simon, Le Corbusier, Walther Rathenau, Robert McNamara, Robert Moses, Jean Monnet, the Shah of Iran, David Lilienthal, Vladimir I. Lenin, Leon Trotsky, and Julius Nyerere. They envisioned a sweeping, rational engineering of all aspects of social life in order to improve the human condition.</p>
<p><span>        — James C. Scott,<br>"Seeing Like A State"      </span>    </p></blockquote>
<p>This is also Apple's vision for the iPhone; an unshakeable belief in its own rightness and transformative power for good. Never mind all the folks that get hurt along the way, it is good <em>because Apple does it</em>. There is no claim more central to the mythos of Apple's marketing wing, and no deception more empowering to abusers of power.<sup><a href="#fn-self-deception-4" id="fnref-self-deception-4">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Apple claims to stand for open societies, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_purpose_of_a_system_is_what_it_does"><abbr title="the Purpose Of the System Is What It Does">POSIWID</abbr></a> shows that to be a lie. It is not just corrupted, but itself has become corrupting; a corrosive influence on the day-to-day activities and right necessary to engage in democracy and the rule-of-law.</p>
<p>Apple's Le Corbusierian addiction to control has not pushed it into an alliance with those resisting oppression, but into open revolt against efforts that would make the iPhone an asset for citizens exercising their legitimate rights to aid the powerless. It scuttles and undermines open technologies that would aid dissidents. It bends the knee to tyranny <em>because</em> unchecked power helps Cupertino stave off competition, preserving (it thinks) a space for its own messianic vision of technology to lift others out of perdition.</p>
<p>If the consequences were not so dire, it would be tragically funny.</p>
<p>Let's hope our tech press find their nerve, and a copy of <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691210841/the-open-society-and-its-enemies?srsltid=AfmBOopVprr3l-dLq6nmTTkWDK_rxxVEMN3_FgaZa5135_Qjfrp4UpgY"><em>“The Open Society and Its Enemies,"</em></a> before we lose the ability to laugh.</p>
<h2 id="endnote%3A-let's-talk-about-google" tabindex="-1"><a href="#endnote%3A-let's-talk-about-google">Endnote: Let's Talk About Google</a></h2>
<p>I spent a dozen and change years at Google, and my greatest disappointment in leadership over those years was the way the founders coddled the Android team's similarly authoritarian vision.</p>
<p>For the price of a prominent search box on every phone,<sup><a href="#fn-green-thumb-power-5" id="fnref-green-thumb-power-5">5</a></sup> the senior leadership (including Sundar) were willing to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/09/in-court-filing-google-concedes-the-open-web-is-in-rapid-decline/">sow the seeds of the web's obsolescence,</a> handing untold power to Andy Rubin's team of Java zealots. It was no secret that they sought to displace the web as the primary way for users to experience computing, substituting proprietary APIs for open platforms along the way.</p>
<p>With the growth of Android, Play grew in influence, thanks growing revenue and a need to cover for Android's original sins,<sup><a href="#fn-rotten-to-the-roots-6" id="fnref-rotten-to-the-roots-6">6</a></sup> leading to a series of subtler, but no less effective, tactics that dovetailed with Apple's suppression of the web on iOS. The <a href="https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/layout/webapps/trusted-web-activities">back doors</a> and <a href="https://www.pwabuilder.com/">exotic hoops</a> developers must jump through to gain distribution for interoperable apps remains a scandal.</p>
<p>But more than talking about Google and what it has done, we should talk about how we <em>talk about</em> Google. In specific, how the lofty goals of its Search origins were undercut by those anti-social, anti-user failures in Android and Play.</p>
<p>It's no surprise that Google is <a href="https://open-web-advocacy.org/blog/google-must-share-the-ability-to-install-web-apps-in-android/">playing disingenuous games</a> around providing access to competitors regarding web apps on Android, while simultaneously pushing to expand its control over app distribution. The Play team covet what Apple have, and far from exhibiting any self-awareness of their own culpability, are <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/01/fulu/#i-am-altering-the-deal">content to discredit</a> whatever brand reputation Google may have left so long as it can expand its ability to tax software.</p>
<p>And nobody can claim that power is <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/following-apple-google-pulls-ice-spotting-app-red-dot-from-play-store/">being used for good.</a></p>
<p>Google is not creating moral distance between itself and Apple, or seeking to help developers build <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> to steer around the easily-censored channels it markets, and totally coincidentally, taxes.<sup><a href="#fn-knock-off-objectionability-7" id="fnref-knock-off-objectionability-7">7</a></sup> Google is Apple's collaborator in capitulation. A dark moral void, trotting out the same, tired tactic of hiding behind Apple's skirt whenever questions about the centralising and authoritarian tendencies of App Store monopolies crop up. For 15 years, Android has been content to pen 1-pagers for knock-off versions of whatever Apple shipped last year, including authoritarian-friendly acquiescence.</p>
<p>Play is now the primary software acquisition channel for most users around the world, and that should cause our tech press to <em>intensify</em> scrutiny of these actions, but that's not how Silicon Valley's wealth-pilled technorati think, talk, or write. The Bay Area's moral universe extends the wall of the privilege bubble, and we don't talk about the consequences of enshittified, trickle-down tech, or even bother to look hard at it. That would require using Android and…like…ew.</p>
<p>Far from brave truth-telling, the tech press we have today treats the tech the other half (ok, 80%) use as a curio; a destination to gawp at on safari, rather than a geography whose residents are just as worthy of dignity and respect as any other. And that's how Google is getting away with shocking acts of despicable cowardice, but with a fraction of the negative coverage.</p>
<p>And that's a scandal, too.</p>

  <ol><li id="fn-bonus-treats-1"><p>Does anyone doubt that Tim Apple's wishlist didn't also include a slap-on-the-wrist conclusion to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-apple-monopolizing-smartphone-markets"><em>US vs. Apple</em></a>?</p>
<p>And can anyone safely claim that, under an administration as nakedly corrupt as Donald Trump's, Apple couldn't buy off the DOJ? And what might the going rate for such policy pliability be?</p>
<p>That we have to ask says everything. <a href="#fnref-bonus-treats-1">⇐</a></p>

<li id="fn-it-hopes-2"><p>It hopes. <a href="#fnref-it-hopes-2">⇐</a></p>

<li id="fn-servile-frames-3"><p>I don't know Wiley Hodges, but the tone of <a href="https://wileyhodges.substack.com/p/my-email-to-tim-cook?r=qlwt">his letter</a> is everything I expect from Apple employees attempting to convince their (now ex-)bosses of anything: over-the-top praise combined with overt appeals to the brand as the thing of value. At times it verges on hagiography. Again, this is how I understand Apple to discuss Apple to Apple, not just the outside world. I have no doubt that this sort of sickly sweet presentation is absolutely necessary for even moderate criticism to be legible when directed up the chain. Autocracies are not given to debate, and Apple is nothing if not autocratic.</p>
<p>His <a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/175654914">follow-up post is more open and honest,</a> and that's commendable. You quickly grasp that he's struggling with some level of deprogramming now that he's on the outside and can only extend the benefit of the doubt towards FruitCo as far as the available evidence allows. Like the rest of us, he's discovering that Apple is demanding far more trust than its actions can justify. He's rightly disappointed that Apple isn't living up to the implications <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">of its stated ideals,</a> and that the stated justifications seem uncomfortably <em>ad hoc</em>, if not self-serving.</p>
<p>This discomfort stems from the difference between principle and PR.</p>
<p>Principles construct tests with which we must wrestle. Marketing creates frames that cast one party as an unambiguous hero. I've often joked that Apple is a marketing firm with an engineering side gig, and this is never more obvious than in the stark differences between <em>communicated</em> choices and <em>revealed</em> outcomes.</p>
<p>No large western company exerts deeper control over its image, prying deep into the personal lives of its employees in domineering ways to protect its own image from (often legitimate) critique that might undermine the message of the day. Every Apple employeed not named "Tim" submits to an authoritarian regime all day, every day. It's no wonder that the demands of power come so easily to the firm. All of this is done to maintain the control that allows Marketing to cast Apple's image in a light that makes it the obvious answer to <em>"who should rule?"</em></p>
<p>But as we know, that question is itself the problem.</p>
<p>Reading these posts, I really feel for the guy, and wish him luck in convincing Apple to change course. If (as seems likely) it does not, I would encourage him to re-read that same <a href="https://www.apple.com/compliance/pdfs/Apple-Human-Rights-Policy.pdf">Human Rights Policy</a> again and then ask: "<em>is this document a statement of principle or is it marketing?</em>" <a href="#fnref-servile-frames-3">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-self-deception-4"><p>The cultish belief that <em>"it is good because we do it"</em> is first and foremost a self-deception. It's so much easier to project confidence in this preposterous proposition when the messenger themselves is a convert.</p>
<p>The belief that <em>"we should rule"</em> is only possible to sustain among thoughtful people once the question <em>"who should rule?"</em> is deeply engrained. No wonder, then, that the firm works so dang hard to market its singular virtue to the internal, captive audience. <a href="#fnref-self-deception-4">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-green-thumb-power-5"><p>Control over search entry points is the purest commercial analogue in Android to green/blue messages on iOS. Both work to dig moats around commodity services, erecting barriers to switching away from the OS's provider, and both have been fantastically successful in tamping down competition. <a href="#fnref-green-thumb-power-5">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-rotten-to-the-roots-6"><p>It will never cease to be a scandal that Android's singular success metric in the Andy Rubin years was “activations.” The idea that more handsets running Android was success is a direct parallel to Zuckerberg-brain fantasies about “connection” is somehow an unalloyed good.</p>
<p>These are facially infantile metrics, but Google management allowed it to continue well past the sell-by date, with predictably horrendous consequences for user privacy and security. Play, and specifically the hot-potato of "GMS Core" (a.k.a., "Play Services") were tasked with covering for the perenially out of date OSes running on client devices. That situation is scarcely better today. At last check, the ecosystem remains desperately fragemented, with huge numbers of users on outdated and fundamentally insecure releases. Google has gone so far as to remove these statistics from it's public documentation site to avoid the press asking uncomfortable qeustions. Insecurity in service of growth is Android's most lasting legacy.</p>
<p>Like Apple, Andy Rubin saw the web as a threat to his growth ambitions, working to undermine it as a competitor at every step. Some day the full story of how <abbr title="Progressive Web Apps">PWAs</abbr> came to be will be told, but suffice to say, Android's rabid accolytes within the company did everything they could to prevent them, and when that was no longer possible, to slow their spread. <a href="#fnref-rotten-to-the-roots-6">⇐</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn-knock-off-objectionability-7"><p>Don't worry, though, Play doesn't tax developers <em>as</em> much as Apple. So Google are the good guys. Right?</p>
<p>Right? <a href="#fnref-knock-off-objectionability-7">⇐</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">Israeli spyware maker <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NSO Group</a> has confirmed to TechCrunch that a U.S. investment group has acquired the company. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO spokesperson Oded Hershowitz&nbsp;told TechCrunch on Friday that “an American investment group has invested tens of millions of dollars in the company and has acquired controlling ownership.”&nbsp;</p>







<p>Confirmation of the deal came soon after Israeli tech news website <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1jgvmitgx#google_vignette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Calcalist reported</a> Friday that a group led by Hollywood producer Robert Simonds agreed to purchase the surveillance tech maker in a deal valued in the tens of millions of dollars. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hershowitz declined to specify the amount invested, as well as who the investors are. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“This investment does not mean that the company is moving out of Israeli regulatory or operational control,” said Hershowitz. “The company’s headquarters and core operations remain in Israel. It continues to be fully supervised and regulated by the relevant Israeli authorities, including the Ministry of Defense and the Israeli regulatory framework.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>(After sending the messages, Hershowitz declared his comments “off the record,” which requires both parties to agree to the terms in advance. TechCrunch is publishing the responses as there was no agreement made.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2023, <a href="http://theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/14/nso-group-spyware-pegasus-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Guardian reported</a> that Simonds and an associate, through their investment firm, were exploring making a bid to take control of NSO. The deal never materialized.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calcalist reported that as part of the new deal with Simonds, NSO’s co-founder and executive chairman Omri Lavie’s involvement with the spyware maker will end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lavie did not immediately comment when contacted by TechCrunch. Neither Simonds nor his Hollywood company STX Entertainment responded to our request for comment, either.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-from-a-u-s-ban-to-u-s-ownership-nbsp">From a U.S. ban to U.S. ownership&nbsp;</h2>

<p>NSO Group has been mired in controversy since its very beginning.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Researchers at the digital rights group from the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, and others, <a href="https://github.com/GranittHQ/data-pegasus-victims/blob/main/data-pegasus-victims.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have for years documented dozens of cases</a> where NSO’s government customers targeted and hacked journalists, dissidents, and human rights defenders in Hungary, India, Mexico, Morocco, Poland, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, among others. &nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO has long claimed that its spyware is designed to not target U.S. phone numbers, likely to avoid hurting its chances to enter the U.S. market. But the company <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/03/27/spyware-diplomats-us-pegasus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was caught in 2021</a> targeting about a dozen U.S. government officials abroad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soon after, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/us-bans-trade-with-security-firm-nso-group-over-pegasus-spyware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the U.S. Commerce Department banned</a> American companies from trading with NSO by putting the spyware maker on the U.S. Entities List. Since then, NSO has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/20/nso-group-pegasus-trump-eo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tried to get off the U.S. government’s blocklist,</a> as recently as May 2025, with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-the-vogel-group-lobbying-trump-administration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the help of a lobbying firm</a> tied to the Trump administration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab who has helped investigate abuses of NSO’s spyware for a decade, told TechCrunch he is concerned about the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“NSO is a company with a long history of going against American interests and supporting the hacking of American officials. In what world can such a person be trusted to properly oversee a company like NSO Group?” said Scott-Railton, referring to Simonds. &nbsp;</p>

<p>“Going further, my real concern is that NSO has strenuously tried to enter the United States and sell their product to American police forces in U.S. cities.&nbsp;This dictator tech does not belong anywhere near Americans, or our constitutionally protect[ed] rights or freedoms.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>NSO’s ownership has exchanged hands before. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally founded by Niv Karmi,&nbsp;Shalev Hulio, and Omri Lavie,&nbsp;NSO Group was <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2020/12/01/this-spy-tool-can-find-you-with-just-a-telephone-number-and-25-countries-own-it-warn-researchers/?sh=7d4b92b6331e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired</a> by U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014. Lavie and Hulio <a href="https://www.nsogroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NSO_Group_Acquired_by_its_Management_Feb142019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">retook control of the company</a> in 2019 with help from European private equity firm Novalpina. Then, in 2021, the&nbsp;California-based Berkeley Research Group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2021/jul/31/nso-group-israeli-spyware-company-berkeley-research-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took over management</a> of the fund. In 2023, Lavie <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/01/one-of-nso-groups-founders-emerges-as-new-majority-owner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">retook control</a> of NSO as majority owner. &nbsp;</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <h2 id="what-is-pipelining-in-postgres">What is pipelining in Postgres?</h2>

<p>Pipelining is a client-side feature supported by the network protocol
that basically consists of
not waiting for the results of previously sent queries before sending the next.
This increases the throughput in two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The client, network and server can work in parallel. For instance,
the network may transmit the results of the (N-1)th query while the
server executes the Nth query and the client sends the (N+1)th query,
all this at the same time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The network is better utilized because successive queries can be
grouped in the same network packets, resulting in less packets
overall.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pipelining is possible since version 7.4 (released in 2003), which introduced
the extended query protocol. But it’s only since 2021, with PostgreSQL 14,
that it can be used through libpq, the client-side C library.
Since then, some libpq-based drivers like <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/advanced/pipeline.html">psycopg3</a> have started to support it.</p>

<p>With <strong>PostgreSQL 18</strong>, released last week, <code>psql</code>, the command line client
comes equipped with commands to use pipelining in SQL scripts, making it
even more accessible.
While this addition is not part of the highlighted features of that release,
it can provide huge gains in query throughput, as we’re going to see in a simple
test.</p>

<h2 id="psql-commands">psql commands</h2>

<p>The pipeline is started with <code>\startpipeline</code>, and in the most simple case, followed
by the SQL queries and ended with <code>\endpipeline</code>.
If intermediate results are needed, we can use <code>\syncpipeline</code> to force a 
synchronisation point and <code>\getresults</code> to fetch all results up to that point.
Also, starting a pipeline creates an implicit transaction. If a query fails,
all the changes since the start (or before the last synchronization point) will
be rolled back.</p>

<p>If you know about the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html#APP-PSQL-META-COMMAND-SEMICOLON"><code>\;</code> syntax</a> to group several queries in the same request, there are similarities between this technique and pipelining: they’re both used to reduce server round-trips and have the same semantics with regard to transactions. In a way, pipelining is the evolution in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-EXT-QUERY">extended query protocol</a> of what multi-statement queries (<code>\;</code> in psql) are in the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol-flow.html#PROTOCOL-FLOW-SIMPLE-QUERY">simple query protocol</a>.</p>

<h2 id="performance-test">Performance test</h2>

<p>Let’s do a simple test where data from devices are imported
with <code>INSERT ... ON CONFLICT</code> queries. Same-device same-date does update the row,
otherwise it inserts a new row.
Note that if we wanted to unconditionally append all rows,
<code>COPY</code> would be preferable and pipelining not necessary, which is why
the more sophisticated insert-or-update is chosen for that test.</p>

<p>The following bash code imports the (random) data, with or without the pipelining
depending on a parameter.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function </span>import_data
<span>{</span>
  <span>local </span><span>count</span><span>=</span><span>$1</span>  <span># how many rows?</span>
  <span>local </span><span>pipeline</span><span>=</span><span>$2</span> <span># 1 or 0</span>
  <span>local </span><span>now_ts</span><span>=</span><span>$(</span><span>date</span> +%s<span>)</span>

  <span>(</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>'PREPARE s AS insert into events(device, recorded_at, measure)
values($1, to_timestamp($2), $3) on conflict(device,recorded_at) do update set measure=excluded.measure;'</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>"BEGIN;"</span>
    <span>[[</span> <span>$pipeline</span> <span>=</span> 1 <span>]]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>startpipeline"</span>

    <span>done</span>
    <span>[[</span> <span>$pipeline</span> <span>=</span> 1 <span>]]</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"</span><span>\\</span><span>endpipeline"</span>

  <span>)</span> | <span>$psql</span> <span>-q</span> <span>-v</span> <span>ON_ERROR_STOP</span><span>=</span>1
<span>}</span>

<p>Let’s try this with batches of 100, 1000, 5000, 10000, 50000, 100000 rows, with and
without pipelining, and compare how fast these batches are processed.</p>

<p>Also, since the network speed matters a lot here, let’s try with three
typical kinds of network connections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>localhost (ping time ~ 0.04ms): client and server are on the same host.</li>
  <li>LAN (ping time ~ 1ms): client and server are separated only by an Ethernet 1GB/s switch.</li>
  <li>WAN (ping time ~ 4ms): the server is reached through a public Internet connection.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, each case is run 5 times and we keep only the median time of the runs.</p>

<p><img src="https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/assets/img/pipeline-psql-localhost-graph.png" alt="graph localhost"></p>

<p>On the same host, the pipeline acceleration ranges from 1.5x for the smallest batch size, up to 5x.</p>

<p><img src="https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/assets/img/pipeline-psql-lan-graph.png" alt="graph LAN"></p>

<p>On a local network connection, the smallest batch size is accelerated by 2.6x, and it goes up to 42x with the bigger sizes.</p>

<p><img src="https://postgresql.verite.pro/blog/assets/img/pipeline-psql-wan-graph.png" alt="psql WAN"></p>

<p>On the slowest network, it’s even more impressive. The acceleration is between 5.4x and 71x !</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>These accelerations show how under-utilized the network is when we
send batches of small queries without pipelining: the network packets
are like 50 seater buses that ride with only one passenger.</p>

<p>In our example, all we have to do to optimize on that front
is to add a pair of <code>\startpipeline</code> and <code>\endpipeline</code>.
That’s because our queries do not depend on the results of previous queries
of the same batch, except in the sense that if one fails, the entire batch fails.</p>

<p>Without pipelining, we could still optimize our test by adding many
rows to the <code>VALUES</code> clauses for each query instead of one row per
query. But it’s not easy to find the sweet spot for how many data rows
there needs to be per query, and large queries with thousands of parameters
are not the nicest to handle on the server side.
Also, if the client-side logic is more complicated, for instance
conditionally targeting several tables, running simple statements in
a pipeline while using row-by-row logic might be much easier.</p>

<p>The pipelining meta-commands were added in psql version 18, but they do not
require PostgreSQL 18 on the server side. For those interested in this feature
who can’t upgrade their server soon, you can still upgrade to the latest
version of psql: it’s backward-compatible as much as possible.</p>
