<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>During 2023, OSI and many others across the Open Source communities spent a great deal of time and energy engaging with the various co-legislators of the European Union (EU) concerning the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA). Together with a revision to Europe’s Product Liability Directive (PLD), the CRA will bring  the responsibilities of product liability to software for the first time.</p>



<p>In the light of <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/study-about-impact-open-source-software-and-hardware-technological-independence-competitiveness-and">the EU’s own research</a> showing the huge impact of Open Source on Europe’s economy, the authors of these legislative instruments sought to ensure that the lifecycle of Open Source software was impacted as little as possible. Indeed, at FOSDEM 2023 the authors of the CRA and PLD said as much in their first-of-a-kind <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/cyber_resilience/">main track appearance</a>. But when we all looked at the details, community members found that was not as true as we hoped. As <a href="https://blog.opensource.org/the-ultimate-list-of-reactions-to-the-cyber-resilience-act/">a range of organizations explained</a>, the CRA was likely to be an <a href="https://blog.opensource.org/what-is-the-cyber-resilience-act-and-why-its-important-for-open-source/">existential threat</a> to Open Source development, because instead of placing all the compliance requirements of the CRA on companies deploying Open Source software for profit, the obligations as written potentially fell on developers and Open Source foundations.</p>


<h3 id="reactions-to-the-final-text"><strong>Reactions To The Final Text</strong></h3>


<p>Many OSI Affiliates engaged with the European Commission, European Parliament and European Council during 2023. With the welcome coordination of Open Forum Europe, a group met regularly to keep track of progress explaining the issues. Many of us also committed time and travel to meet in-person. As a result of all this effort from so many people, the <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-17000-2023-INIT/EN/pdf">final text of the CRA</a> mitigated pretty much all the risks we had identified to individual developers and to Open Source foundations. As the Python Software Foundation said in <a href="https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/01/CRA-update.html">their update</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…the final text demonstrates a crisper understanding of how open source software works and the value it provides to the overall ecosystem of software development.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the Eclipse Foundation <a href="https://eclipse-foundation.blog/2023/12/19/good-news-on-the-cyber-resilience-act/">wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The revised legislation has vastly improved its exclusion of open source projects, communities, foundations, and their development and package distribution platforms. It also creates a new form of economic actor, the “open source steward,” which acknowledges the role played by foundations and platforms in the open source ecosystem.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the Apache Software Foundation <a href="https://sandbox-pad.webm.ink/code/inner.html?ver=5.3.0-1701422242874">said</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So, all in all, this is mostly good news for volunteers who run and innovate with open source software. Or, more accurately, much better than most of us could have imagined at the end of last summer.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This time last year OSI <a href="https://blog.opensource.org/what-is-the-cyber-resilience-act-and-why-its-important-for-open-source/">recommended</a> that the CRA:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…exclude all activities prior to commercial deployment of the software and … clearly ensure that responsibility for CE marks does not rest with any actor who is not a direct commercial beneficiary of deployment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That recommendation has been accepted and implemented, and the OSI is very grateful to the various experts who took the time to listen.</p>


<h3 id="osi-observations"><strong>OSI Observations</strong></h3>


<p>While it’s all much better, and while the burden placed on individuals and charities is minimal, there are still challenges ahead. For example, the concerns that the Debian project <a href="https://bits.debian.org/2023/12/debian-statement-cyber-resillience-act.md.html">articulated</a> give cause for thought. With Open Source projects exempted from the requirement to place a CE certification mark on their software, downstream users will need to pay careful attention to their responsibilities under the CRA as well as to their liabilities to consumers under the PLD.</p>



<p>In particular, “digital artisans” using Open Source software at small scale – the main concern of Debian – will need guidance from the European Commission. While the experts we have met have all said that using an Open Source software distribution as part of a commercial activity is unlikely to require CE marking of the distribution itself, the interpretation of the key phrase “making available on the market” will need careful clarification. OSI encourages the Commission to seek expert advice from the Open Source communities as they did last year, and not to rely on outsourced consultants alone in preparing this advice.</p>


<h3 id="fosdem-2024"><strong>FOSDEM 2024</strong></h3>


<p>There is also the question of how future engagement by legislators should proceed. The effort made by developers and Open Source foundations in 2023 is not sustainable, and the Commission needs to <a href="https://blog.opensource.org/modern-eu-policies-need-the-voices-of-the-fourth-sector/">accommodate the Fourth Sector</a> in future deliberations. To get this started, a group of us who have engaged during 2023 got together to organize a unique set of <a href="https://md.softwarefreedom.net/s/FOSDEM24">workshops at FOSDEM 2024 on Sunday February 4</a>. If you want your voice heard, come along to one of the workshops!</p>

      <section itemprop="text">
        
        <p>I recently discovered [<a href="https://matan-h.com/google-has-a-secret-browser-hidden-inside-the-settings/">another</a>] secret browser that is inside Google Play Services. The uniqueness of this browser is that it is accessible by a link. That means, it not only bypasses the “normal” google parental control, it also bypasses the “lock-down” mode (the “lock-down” mode is the “your device has been locked” screen in parental control). I also discovered a similar method which can be used to bypass the <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9455138">Android screen pinning</a> feature from the Contacts app
<img src="https://matan-h.com/assets/images/todepond-gms.png" alt="Todepond video in google play services app"></p>

</figcaption>

<h2 id="how-to-get-there">How to get there?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Enter the Contacts app - using the “emergency call” button after the normal unlock of the phone. (assuming you not are reading this blog in lock-down mode, you can just open the normal Contacts app).</li>
  <li>Edit existing contact (or add new contact), then edit it, and scroll until “More fields” and click on it.</li>
  <li>In the “Website” field enter this website: “https://gds.google.com/gmsdrops”.</li>
  <li>Save the contact, then click on the link.</li>
  <li>You should now see “Your Android device just got better” (it’s a Google lie 🙂). Click “Show me”.</li>
  <li>Click “Learn more”. If you don’t have that, click “next” until you have it.</li>
  <li>Now you are in the browser. Resize it by moving it up. Click the hamburger menu, then click the big “Google Help” text.</li>
  <li>Click the hamburger menu again. This time just click “Google”.</li>
  <li>You may or may not be already signed in to this browser. If you are signed in, you can log out from Google. It does not affect your Chrome browser.
There you have it. A full untraceable browser inside the parental lock-down mode!</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-does-it-work">Why does it work?</h2>
<p>In lock-down mode, google “locks” all apps (including the android launcher and parts of the system) apart from “Google Play Services” (which is used to display the popup message and enforce restrictions) and the Contacts app (for phone).
As last time, It’s still the fault of the same app: <code>Google play services</code>. 
<code>https://gds.google.com/gmsdrops</code> is a deeplink to the Android “what’s new”. (you can also open it from here, and if your browser forwards deeplinks you probably get a message asking you if you want to continue to external app/google play).
While parental control doesn’t allow you to open deeplinks, it does allow the Contacts app to do so. When you click on the website field of a Contact, it’s the Contact app which opens the link. So it’s not blocked.</p>

<h2 id="screen-pinning-bypass">Screen pinning bypass</h2>
<p>android (11+) has an <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9455138">Android screen pinning</a> feature, which basically make it possible to give your phone to someone, open on a specific app, and prevent the user to move to another without your permission. I haven’t done research on that, but I believe the most popular use-case is when you give your phone to someone to make a phone call.
This time we cannot use the same link as before, as screen-pinning prevents opening new apps, and the previous link opens the “Google Play Services” app.
But we can use another deeplink which is managed by the same app: <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/">Google Podcast</a>. It’s possible because this deeplink is opened as a popup window instead of a full app.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add website to contact in the same way as before. Enter the website “https://podcasts.google.com”</li>
  <li>Click the link when the app is pinned.</li>
  <li>You should now see the Google podcasts popup window. Click on the big icon of your Google account, then click “Content policies”. 
Now you are in the default browser. The exact place where you should not be when someone gives you their phone to call. For breakthrough use the same instructions as before:</li>
  <li>Click the hamburger menu, then click the big “Google Help” text.</li>
  <li>Click the hamburger menu again. This time just click “Google”.
You got it. A complete bypass.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="google-response">Google Response</h2>
<p>I reported it to Google, as two different cases : one for parental control bypass, and another one for android screen pinning bypass.
They merged the parental one into the screen pinning bypass one, then they managed to “forget” about the duplicate cases.
This is the response I’ve on the screen bypassing case (because of course screen bypassing and parental controls <strong>is intended</strong> to be bypassed):
<img src="https://matan-h.com/assets/images/google-android-screenpin-intended.png" alt="Android screen pinning bypass is the intended behavior"></p>
<figcaption>
Google answer : Android screen pinning bypassing is the intended behavior
</figcaption>

<p>and this confusing response about the duplication:
<img src="https://matan-h.com/assets/images/google-was-not-a-duplicate.png" alt="confusing google response about duplicate issues"></p>
<figcaption>
  <p>Its not a duplicate. the issue was closed as duplicate of <em>potentially</em> another issue. It’s a seperate rewards program, and not our problem.</p>
</figcaption>
<hr>

<p>I hope you enjoy your secret untraceable browser.</p>

    <img src="https://christianselig.com/2024/02/introducing-juno/hero.jpeg" alt="Apple Vision Pro view of a living room with a floating window showing an iJustine video with the Juno app icon floating above it" loading="lazy">

<p>YouTube is probably one of the parts of the internet I consume the most, so I was more than a little sad when YouTube announced that they don’t have plans to build a visionOS app, and disabled the option to load the iPad app. This leaves you with Safari, and the website is okay, but definitely doesn’t feel like a visionOS app. Couple that with visionOS not having the option to add websites to your Home Screen, and YouTube isn’t that convenient on visionOS by default.</p>
<p>Then I remembered for years my old app, Apollo, played back YouTube videos submitted to Reddit pretty well, and I developed a pretty good understanding of how YouTube worked. That sparked the idea to reuse some of Apollo’s code there and build a little YouTube client of my own for visionOS, and after a mad week of coding “Juno for YouTube” is born.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work-technically">How does it work… technically?</h2>



    <img src="https://christianselig.com/2024/02/introducing-juno/cleo.jpeg" alt="Cleo Abram video where she's hanging out with a Boston Dynamics robot" loading="lazy">

<p>YouTube has a few different APIs.</p>
<p>They have a “Data API” for fetching information (thumbnail, duration, etc.) for a video, that requires an API key, auditing, and you can only call so many times a day. This API doesn’t actually get you the video to play or anything, it’s purely for metadata, and for uploading.</p>
<p>They have private/internal APIs that they get grumpy at you for using because you can circumvent ads. The goal with this app was to not make Google grumpy.</p>
<p>Lastly, they have an <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">embed API</a> that’s pretty powerful, and is what I used in Apollo and now Juno. There’s no API keys, or limits to how many times a day you can call it, as it literally just loads the video in a webview, and provides JavaScript methods to interact with the video, such as pause, play, speed up, etc. It’s really nice, you can play YouTube videos back, and YouTube still gets to show ads (if the user doesn’t have YouTube Premium) and whatnot so no one is grumpy.</p>
<p>This means you can build a fully native visionOS UI that then using JavaScript interacts with the underlying YouTube player, so you get the best of both worlds. Juno even supports detecting aspect ratios of the videos and will resize the window automatically, so ultra-wide 21:9 movie trailers are respected, as are nostalgic 4:3 uploads.</p>
<p>The one downside is that occasionally you’ll get a creator who disabled playback for YouTube embeds. This is rare, especially with videos made in the last few years, but for those Juno will auto-detect that and just load up the normal video website page rather than the fancy player.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-the-browsing-itself">What about the browsing itself?</h2>



    <img src="https://christianselig.com/2024/02/introducing-juno/search.jpeg" alt="Searching 'Apple Vision Pro' in Juno, showing search results for day one reviews with a website feel combined with visionOS aesthetics" loading="lazy">

<p>At its core, Juno uses the YouTube website itself. No, not scraped. It presents the website as you would load it, but similar to how browser extensions work, it tweaks the theming of the site through CSS and JavaScript.</p>
<p>That results in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweaking backgrounds so the beautiful glassy look of visionOS shows through. As the great <a href="https://twitter.com/settern/status/1752789654787752044">Serenity Caldwell once said</a>, “<em>Opaque windows can feel heavy and constricting, especially at large sizes. Whenever possible, prefer the glass material (which pulls light from people’s surroundings).</em>”</li>
<li>Increasing contrast so items are properly visible</li>
<li>Making buttons like the button to view your subscriptions native UI, and then loading the relevant portions of the website accordingly</li>
<li>You get your full recommendations, subscriptions and whatnot, just as you would on the normal YouTube site or app</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a lot of work tweaking the CSS to get the YouTube website to something that felt comfortable and at home on visionOS, but I’m really happy with how it turned out. Does it feel like a <em>perfectly</em> native visionOS app? Well no, but it’s a heck of a lot nicer than the website, and to be fair Google apps normally do their own thing rather than use iOS system UI, so not sure we’ll ever fully see that. :)</p>
<h2 id="does-it-block-ads">Does it block ads?</h2>
<p>It doesn’t, I don’t think Google would like that, but if you have YouTube Premium you won’t see ads, just like the website. Honestly, YouTube Premium is like one of the most essential subscriptions for me, it’s so handy to never worry about ads <em>and</em> it’s pretty cool in that it also supports the creators <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDsJJRNXjYI&amp;t=897s">substantially more</a> than if you watched ads. So I dunno, if you can afford an expensive Apple Vision Pro, I’d really consider treating yourself to YouTube Premium!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful translucent visionOS interface</li>
<li>Automatic aspect ratio detection</li>
<li>Speed up or slow down video</li>
<li>Native controls for video playback</li>
<li>Pinch-drag anywhere to scrub through video (an Apollo classic)</li>
<li>Double-pinch either side of the video to jump forward or back 10 seconds in time</li>
<li>Quick launch YouTube from Home Screen</li>
<li>Dim your surroundings to focus on the video</li>
<li>View your recommendations, subscriptions, playlists, etc.</li>
<li>Resizable (while maintaining correct aspect ratio)</li>
<li>Automatic quality selection, should scale up or down based on the size of your window all the way to 4K</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features-im-looking-into">Features I’m looking into</h2>
<p>This was a bit of a mad dash to get finished in time for the Apple Vision Pro launch, so I’m hoping to add some more things with time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to see comments (I mean, they’re useful sometimes…)</li>
<li>Maybe select quality directly if interest is there</li>
<li>Caption controls (couldn’t quite get this working in time for 1.0)</li>
<li>More immersive environments</li>
<li>Multiview for multiple videos</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s more you’d like to see, let me know!</p>
<h2 id="can-i-give-feedback">Can I give feedback?</h2>
<p>Yes please, I’d love that! I’ve only been able to develop this in the simulator, which obviously has its limitations, so once I get my hands on a device this Friday I’ll probably have a lot of thoughts on things I want to improve as well. That also means there will probably be some bugs here and there too. But I’d love to hear your experience and feedback with the app, so feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://mastodon.social/@christianselig/">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/christianselig/">Twitter</a>!</p>
<h2 id="check-it-out">Check it out!</h2>
<p>It’s available on the App Store for $5! A fun URL to find it is <a href="https://juno.vision/">juno.vision</a> No subscriptions or in-app purchases, just a one-time paid up front app like it’s 2008. I considered making it free, or like a buck, but it’s a premium platform, and I think paying a few bucks for a good app is something we should encourage if we want more developers building for this platform.</p>
<p>I think the result is a really comfy way to browse YouTube on visionOS, and having a way to quickly launch YouTube right from your Home Screen is super convenient.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to doing more with it, and cheers to <a href="https://matthewskiles.com/">Matthew Skiles</a> for designing the icon! He actually made some beautiful alternate icons as well, but those apparently <a href="https://mastodon.social/@christianselig/111851919905815611">aren’t supported in visionOS 1.0</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/fcc_ai_robocall/">https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/fcc_ai_robocall/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39224249">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>The FCC wants to make AI-powered robocalls illegal and has warned of a rising wave of scams from voice-cloning technology.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Jessica Rosenworcel, boss of America's communications watchdog, said machine-learning software could potentially convince people to do things like donating money to fraudulent causes.</p>
<p>It's one thing for humans to con other humans, it's another for computers to imitate celebrities and others while spam-calling people at an industrial scale to swindle them with convincing lures.</p>

    

<p>Last month, New Hampshire residents received a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/23/robocaller_biden_new_hampshire/">fake call</a> mimicking President Joe Biden's voice telling them to not vote in the state's Presidential primary election in an attempt to disrupt results.</p>

        


        

<p>"AI-generated voice cloning and images are already sowing confusion by tricking consumers into thinking scams and frauds are legitimate. No matter what celebrity or politician you favor, or what your relationship is with your kin when they call for help, it is possible we could all be a target of these faked calls," Rosenworcel <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-make-ai-voice-generated-robocalls-illegal">said</a> this week.</p>
<p>"That's why the FCC is taking steps to recognize this emerging technology as illegal under existing law, giving our partners at State Attorneys General offices across the country new tools they can use to crack down on these scams and protect consumers."</p>

        

<p>The agency believes the use of AI voice cloning technology in robocall scams should be criminalized under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Current laws require telemarketers to have explicit consent from consumers before they can make automated calls using "an artificial or prerecorded" voice. Rosenworcel believes the same rules should apply for AI-generated robo-calls too.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/16/us_fcc_ai/">FCC probes rise of AI robocall armies</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/court_sentences_two_to_41/">Robocall scammers sentenced in US after netting $1.2M via India-based call centers</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/16/ftc_xcast_illegal_robocalls/">FTC sues VoIP provider over 'billions of illegal robocalls'</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/22/fcc_robocalls_fine/">FCC calls for mega $300 million fine for massive US robocall campaign</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Lawmakers also want to tackle the issue. House Rep Frank Pallone, Jr (D-NJ) this week <a href="https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/media/press-releases/pallone-introduces-comprehensive-legislation-curb-onslaught-annoying-and" rel="nofollow">introduced</a> a bill, called the Do Not Disturb Act, that would require telemarketers to disclose whether AI has been used to automatically craft a message used in a text message or phone call.</p>
<p>Penalties would apply if telemarketers impersonate someone. Pallone said that his draft legislation closes loopholes and expands robocall rules to cover text messages and the use of AI.</p>
<p>Government officials across the US support the FCC's ideas. Last month, Pennsylvania's Attorney General Michelle Henry wrote a letter <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-01-16-Reply-Comment-of-State-AGs-FCC-AI-NOI.pdf" rel="nofollow">[PDF]</a> to the FCC and said that AI-generated voices should be classified as artificial voices, meaning that the TCPA should already protect against robocall scams made using voice cloning technologies. The letter was signed by 25 attorneys general from other states.</p>
<p>"Technology is advancing and expanding, seemingly, by the minute, and we must ensure these new developments are not used to prey upon, deceive, or manipulate consumers," Henry <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/ag-henry-leads-26-states-in-urging-federal-authorities-to-restrict-usage-of-artificial-intelligence-in-marketing-phone-calls/" rel="nofollow">said</a>.</p>

        

<p>"This new technology cannot be used as a loophole to barrage consumers with illegal calls. I commend the partners in this bipartisan coalition for seeing the potential harm AI can present to consumers already overwhelmed by robocalls and text communications." ®</p>

  <section><p>The Food and Drug Administration says 561 deaths have been reported in connection to recalled Philips devices to treat obstructive sleep apnea and other breathing disorders.</p><p>The FDA said that since April 2021 it has received more than 116,000 medical device reports of foam breaking down in Philips CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machines and BiPAP sleep therapy devices.

<p>Following Garry Tan’s seemingly <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/garry-tan-death-wish-sf-supervisors/">alcohol-fueled rant</a> over the weekend, in which he wrote on social media that seven progressive San Francisco supervisors should “die slow,” tech workers in San Francisco had a few choice words for the Y Combinator CEO: “shameful,” “really dumb,” “very stupid.”</p>



<p>Tan “should not have done any of that. He should go for a while. He should not represent tech anymore,” said Kevin Baragona, co-founder and CEO of DeepAI, a text and image generator.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s shameful,” added a Y Combinator alumnus who, like others, declined to be named for fear of professional retaliation. He has been checking the Y Combinator internal Slack and monitoring their daily email updates, but there has been “no communication” from the company, he said.</p>




<p>“If the CEO of Boeing or Coca-Cola said, ‘I hope Joe Biden dies a slow death,’ someone would be like, ‘Oh, whoops, that wasn’t supposed to happen,’” he said. “It would be a PR nightmare, and yet there has been no acknowledgment.”</p>



<p>On Y Combinator’s message board, Hacker News, which is owned by the company but open to the public, the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39205676">topic</a> generated hundreds of comments debating the wisdom of the purportedly drunken tirade, and whether Tan should now step down.</p>



<p>“This kind of behavior shouldn’t be acceptable for the head of a respectable corporation … He should resign or be dismissed, and YC should replace him with a responsible adult,” read one comment. “This isn’t a minor offense, it is grotesque. If he remains, it reflects very badly on YC.”</p>



<p>“I’m a YC alum,” began another, “I don’t have a problem with tech leaders holding political positions, nor do I have a problem with them making personal donations based on those opinions. Quietly.”</p>

<p>Some in tech, however, said the incident was a “manufactured crisis,” and that city supervisors were running with the incident to score political points.</p>




<p>“Do I think that it’s really dumb for the supervisors to be filing restraining orders or police reports against Garry Tan? I mean, come on, dude. Do they really expect that Garry Tan will hire some dudes to drive by and shoot them?” asked another tech founder. “No, of course not.”</p>



<p>Even those less who were less critical of the rant wondered about Tan’s judgment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I look at this as a drunken error, so I wouldn’t cancel him, personally,” added Stephen Gibson, founder of an early-stage AI startup, while acknowledging that it was “poor judgment.”</p>



<p>Y Combinator has not responded to multiple requests for comment on the incident — even after Tan’s online tirade begat very real-world consequences: On Tuesday, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/y-combinator-ceo-garry-tans-online-rant-spurs-threat-to-supe-police-reports/">three of the supervisors</a> named in his posts received identical threatening postcards at their homes, wishing harm to them and their families.&nbsp;</p>

I wish a slow and painful death for you and your loved ones&quot; on letters sent to three city supervisors on Tuesday."><figcaption>The letter received Tuesday by Supervisors Aaron Peskin, Dean Preston and Myrna Melgar, reading “Garry Tan is right! I wish a slow and painful death for you and your loved ones.”</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“Garry Tan is right!” read the postcards addressed to Supervisors Aaron Peskin, Dean Preston and Myrna Melgar. “I wish a slow and painful death for you and your loved ones.”</p>




<p>The postcards, bearing Tan’s face, were addressed to each supervisor individually. The postcards concluded with a note: “This mail was sent to communicate a political opinion. No threats were intended.”</p>



<p>The San Francisco Police Department said Wednesday it is investigating the mailers. District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, whom Tan has hosted at his Mission District home, said she would recuse herself from any potential case involving Tan and refer it to the California attorney general, to avoid a conflict of interest.</p>



<p>Tan, for his part, apologized over the weekend, noting that his post was a reference to a Tupac Shakur lyric. He initially brushed off the comments as a joke, before taking the incident more seriously: “There is no place, no excuse and no reason for this type of speech,” he wrote hours after the initial post. He has yet to acknowledge the letters sent to the supervisors’ homes.</p>



<h2 id="h-joke-or-not-tan-s-tweet-emerged-from-genuine-rage"><strong>Joke or not, Tan’s tweet emerged from genuine rage</strong></h2>



<p>The supervisors named by Tan have responded quickly to the tirade: <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2024/01/y-combinator-ceo-garry-tans-online-rant-spurs-threat-to-supe-police-reports/">They have filed police reports</a> and consulted with the City Attorney’s Office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least two supervisorial candidates whom Tan has supported, Marjan Philhour and Trevor Chandler, said they do not condone Tan’s language.</p>



<p>Deva Hazarika, another San Francisco tech founder, said that Tan’s statements were “a dumb thing to tweet, especially for a prominent figure, but lots of people have made ill-advised tweets after a couple too many drinks.”</p>



<p>And, Hazarika <a href="https://x.com/devahaz/status/1752534251541766556?s=20">said</a> later, the subsequent threats were the fault of whomever sent the anonymous mailer — not Tan. “If idiots grab onto that as some sort of rationale for threats or harassment, I think that’s on them, not him.”</p>



<p>Tan and Y Combinator may not be household names, but they hold an outsized prominence in San Francisco and Silicon Valley: From his perch atop Y Combinator — the most sought-after incubator for startups, a virtual golden ticket for founders — Tan oversees hundreds of companies annually poised to become multi-billion dollar successes.</p>



<p>DoorDash, Cruise, Reddit, Coinbase and thousands of others have gone through the program, companies now collectively worth a combined $600 billion, <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/">according to Y Combinator</a>.</p>



<p>Tan has also used his position to <a href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/05/11/were-going-to-win-garry-tan-implores-tech-leaders-to-get-involved-in-sf-politics/">entreat</a> tech workers and executives in San Francisco to involve themselves in local politics. He is a firebrand among anti-progressive political forces in the city, underwriting campaigns and groups aimed at dislodging progressive supervisors from their seats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He frequently lambasts the progressive “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&amp;q=(political%20OR%20machine)%20(from%3Agarrytan)&amp;src=typed_query">political machine</a>” and calls for retaking San Francisco from what he labels leftist excess. He employs partisan and apocalyptic language, calling opponents “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(cronies)%20(from%3Agarrytan)&amp;src=spelling_expansion_revert_click">cronies</a>,” “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(corrupt)%20(from%3Agarrytan)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">corrupt</a>” or “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(doom%20OR%20loop%20OR%20accelerationist)%20(from%3Agarrytan)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">doom loop accelerationists</a>,” and claiming they want to “<a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1716576951127953754?s=20">destroy public safety</a>” and “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(ruin)%20(from%3Agarrytan)&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=top">ruin</a>” or “<a href="https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&amp;q=(destroy)%20(from%3Agarrytan)&amp;src=typed_query">destroy</a>” the city.</p>

<p>He is also a fount of misinformation, <a href="https://missionlocal.org/2023/09/critics-sf-police-commission-get-facts-wrong/">misunderstanding how the city’s police commission functions</a>, for instance, or <a href="https://x.com/garrytan/status/1669127692950835201?s=20">claiming</a> that “the mayor can’t fire people.”</p>



<p>So even though Tan claimed the tirade was a joke, it fell well within his characteristic hostility.</p>



<p>“We weren’t born yesterday, we know this is all-consuming to you, this wasn’t just a joke,” said the Y Combinator alumnus. “He is just sort of trying to laugh it away and claim that he is a Twitter troll, and it’s like, no, you’re not, don’t dismiss years of your consistent attacks, don’t try to wash it all away.”</p>



<h2 id="h-despite-the-anger-many-agree-with-tan-s-politics"><strong>Despite the anger, many agree with Tan’s politics</strong></h2>



<p>If Tan were not the face of the San Francisco tech community, then whom? Baragona mentioned Emmett Shear, the co-founder of streaming platform Twitch, whom he finds “very reasonable.”</p>



<p>But, he added that he generally agrees with Tan’s views, which he described. “Garry Tan was basically in favor of making San Francisco safer, building more housing and moderate politics. I think these are good things.”</p>



<p>“I think that tech leaders and business leaders have a responsibility to cities and or to their communities to serve them both, either through politics or any other way … but making a statement like that, I think Tan probably has more to learn about the politics side of things. You can’t just be spouting off like that,” said Gibson.</p>



<p>Several others agreed that Tan “genuinely cares deeply” about the city, but is approaching politics in a naive fashion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anthony Jancso, founder of the group Accelerate SF, said he was “surprised” to read Tan’s post but that Tan “deserves more credit for the work that he’s doing … to set San Francisco up as the best city in the world.”</p>



<p>Added Evan Conrad, co-founder of <a href="https://twitter.com/sfcompute">San Francisco Compute</a>: “Garry Tan is broadly a good person who genuinely cares deeply about San Francisco.”</p>



<p>The tech worker who asked to remain nameless talked about the fix Tan has created. “They’re making a bigger deal out of this. They’re trying to create some kind of political enemy for everybody to hate. I think it’s stoking a little bit more hate and resentment towards tech people … I’m a little annoyed that Garry Tan’s giving them the ammunition to do that.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
    <p>The Vulkan® Working Group at Khronos® has developed a set of video format decode and encode extensions, collectively referred to as "Vulkan Video." Today, with the release of Vulkan <strong>1.3.277</strong>, the Working Group is proud to announce the new <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_av1.html">Decode AV1 video extension</a>. Similar to the Vulkan project in its goals, AV1 is a royalty-free open standard for video compression developed by the <a href="https://aomedia.org/">Alliance for Open Media</a> (AOM) delivering industry-leading performance and quality. The result of broad industry collaboration and support, the Decode AV1 extension is a major milestone that builds on the foundation of Vulkan Video to bring cross-platform portable and performant AV1 decode to engines and applications everywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The figure below shows the released Vulkan Video extensions and some of the extensions under development.</p>


<figure><img src="https://www.khronos.org/assets/uploads/blogs/2024-blog-vulkan-video-extensions.jpg" alt="">Figure 1. Vulkan Video extensions</figure>


<p>Details about the new Decode AV1 functionality can be found in the extension <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Docs/blob/main/proposals/VK_KHR_video_decode_av1.adoc">proposal document</a> and <a href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/man/html/VK_KHR_video_decode_av1.html">specification</a>.</p>
<p>Vulkan drivers supporting both Decode AV1 and the recently released Encode H.264/H.265 extensions are already available, including: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NVIDIA</strong>: Windows and Linux <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/vulkan-driver">beta drivers</a> support Decode AV1 today, with an imminent&nbsp; production driver that will add Decode AV1 to already shipping H.264/H.265 Encode support.</li>
<li><strong>AMD</strong>: Windows <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-vulkan">beta driver</a> for Encode H.264/H.265 and Decode AV1.</li>
<li><strong>Intel</strong>: Windows driver coming soon.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is strong open-source community adoption of Vulkan Video, including decode and encode support in the <a href="https://blogs.igalia.com/vjaquez/vulkan-video-status/">GStreamer</a> and <a href="https://lynne.ee/tag/vulkan.html">FFmpeg</a> multimedia frameworks, as well as the <a href="https://airlied.blogspot.com/">RADV/ANVs</a> open-source Vulkan driver for Intel and AMD GPUs. </p>
<p>NVIDIA’s open source Vulkan Video sample is also being updated to illustrate the use of the <a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_video_samples/tree/video-encode-h264-265-alpha">Encode H.264/H.265 </a>and the <a href="https://github.com/nvpro-samples/vk_video_samples/tree/video-decode-av1-beta">Decode AV1</a> extensions.</p>
<p>The open-source community has been deeply involved in the development of the Vulkan Video Decode AV1 extension, starting with the initial Mesa extension proposal from Dave Airlie and Lynne Iribarren, and including key contributions from Igalia for conformance test development, and detailed feedback from Collabora on the extension design. The experienced support and guidance from RasterGrid for specification and validation layer development was also essential. The Vulkan Video Decode AV1 extension is a true testament to the strong industry collaboration fostered by Khronos, and the Vulkan Working Group is grateful for all its members’ hard work and contributions to reach this important milestone for the Vulkan Video ecosystem!</p>
<h2>Vulkan Video Support in the Vulkan SDK</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home">Vulkan SDK</a> <strong>1.3.275.0</strong> now integrates all the components necessary for developers to easily use the Vulkan Video Encode H.264/H.265 and maintenance1 extensions <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-encode">released in Dec 2023</a>, and the video core and decode H.264/H.265 extensions <a href="https://www.khronos.org/blog/khronos-finalizes-vulkan-video-extensions-for-accelerated-h.264-and-h.265-decode">released in Dec 2022</a>. An upcoming SDK release will add support for the Decode AV1 extension.</p>
<p>The Vulkan validation layers, API headers, and API registry now include support for:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Industry Support for Vulkan Video</h2>
<p>“AMD is proud to continue collaborating with industry leaders to complete the standardization of video acceleration support in Vulkan®. The finalization of encode H.264/H.265 and decode AV1 extensions marks a significant milestone, and we’re even more excited about future codec and feature extensions,” said <strong>Andrej Zdravkovic, senior vice president and chief software officer at AMD</strong>. “We look forward to supporting end-users with an upcoming release of an AMD Software: Adrenaline Edition™ driver supporting optimized Vulkan Video for AMD RDNA™ architecture-based products and solutions.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Furthering support for AV1, a state-of-the-art, open video compression format, aligns with Collabora's mission to accelerate the adoption of open technologies," said <strong>Nicolas Dufresne, principal software engineer at Collabora</strong>. "We are delighted to have had the opportunity to leverage our deep experience enabling embedded hardware codecs on Linux to help the Vulkan Working Group bring this new extension to life."</p>
<p>“We have been eagerly awaiting the ratification of the Vulkan Video encode extensions as they will pave the way to the definition of the Vulkan Safety Critical variant. Congratulations to all that have made this a reality. We are extremely encouraged to be part of the growth and evolution of the Vulkan ecosystem, and we as a collective have come a long way. Furthermore, we at CoreAVI are extremely excited to further empower safety critical systems with the addition of Vulkan Video,” said<strong> Dan Joncas, chief sales and marketing officer, CoreAVI</strong>.</p>
<p>“Over the course of 2023, Igalia has been working in collaboration with the vendors, and exceptional individuals from the wider community, on the delivery of the latest Vulkan Video extensions. As always at Igalia, we pay particular attention to the wider FOSS adoption of our work. We believe strongly in the approach taken by these new extensions for adding more flexibility and portability in video processing across the industry. To aid in the FOSS adoption of these new extensions, we have developed the <strong>GStreamer</strong> framework support for Vulkan Video, worked on the development and maintenance of the Vulkan <strong>Mesa</strong> drivers for Intel and AMD, and assisted in ensuring the <strong>Vulkan conformance tests</strong>have a good standard of coverage to ensure the implementations and specification are in unison. We look forward to continuing this work going into 2024 and beyond,” said <strong>Samuel Iglesias, director of GPU driver development, Igalia</strong>.</p>
<p>“We work closely with the Vulkan Working Group to drive more open standards that will benefit users at large. The ratification of the Vulkan Video extension for AV1 decode acceleration will set the stage for next-generation visual computing experiences,” said <strong>Vivian Lien, vice president Client Graphics and AI group at Intel</strong>. “By delivering dedicated AV1 hardware capabilities in our products, we aim to empower developers to build immersive applications across platforms and in the near future all Intel® Arc™ Graphics products will fully support hardware AV1 video decoding through the new Vulkan Video extension.”</p>
<p>“AV1 represents the final product of years of work to develop a royalty-free video codec. The open-source community was amongst the first to embrace it, by creating <strong>dav1d</strong>, the fastest software decoder implementation, and now, by offering support for multi-platform hardware decoding via the new extension,” said <strong>Lynne Iribarren, Khronos member and FFmpeg developer.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“AV1 support is one of the main reasons I wanted to get involved in Vulkan video, having a royalty-free video codec available across vendors and platforms will go a long way to making AV1 a baseline for future Linux desktop use cases. I welcome Khronos ratification of the work started as a vendor extension in the Mesa project,” said <strong>Dave Airlie, Mesa developer and Linux Kernel maintainer</strong>.</p>
<p>“NVIDIA is proud to continue to drive innovation with the Vulkan Working Group. By being one of the first to support Vulkan-based H.264, H.265 encoding and AV1 decoding, we are expanding video API support for Vulkan developers. We look forward to feedback from our developers and partners to advance our GPUs’ video capabilities, including Vulkan Video, and to enable applications to take advantage of the latest video technologies,” said <strong>Bob Pette, vice president of enterprise platforms, NVIDIA</strong>.</p>
<p>"RasterGrid is delighted to continue the journey with the Vulkan Working Group in enabling efficient access to hardware-accelerated video coding through Vulkan Video," said <strong>Daniel Rakos, CEO, RasterGrid.</strong> "We are happy to see our work on the extension specifications and Validation Layer support finally landing in the hands of the developer community, and looking forward to helping the Vulkan Video TSG expand the support for royalty-free video codecs in the API."</p>

<h3>from the <i>we-stand-by-our-reporting</i> dept</h3>

<p>Back in December, we wrote about Appin. We were not writing about the reports (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-crime/a-confession-exposes-indias-secret-hacking-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of which there have been many</a>) that the organization that started as a sort of cybersecurity training school, but morphed into a kind of “hack-for-hire” scheme was involved in all sorts of nefarious activity. Rather we wrote about their (ab)use of the Indian court system <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/07/indian-court-orders-reuters-to-take-down-investigative-report-regarding-a-hack-for-hire-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to order Reuters to remove a big, detailed, investigative report</a> on the company.</p>
<p>The history of Appin, and reporting on its involvement in hacking schemes, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/delhi-firm-with-mod-as-client-is-linked-to-pak-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">goes back a over a decade</a>. Reports of Appin trying to hide and suppress such stories is a bit shorter but are abundant. And Appin has, at times, been quite successful, especially in trying to remove the name of the guy regularly accused of being behind Appin, Rajat Khare. See this <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/-project-merciless---how-qatar-spied-on-the-world-of-football-in-switzerland/48022952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SwissInfo report on how Qatar “spied on the world of football,”</a> which was forced to remove Khare’s name while leaving in Appin’s.</p>

</div>
<p>Or how about the Bureau of Investigative Journalism story published in 2022, <a href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inside the Global Hack-for-Hire Industry</a>. An <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221105180814/https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier version</a> of that report names Khare. In April of 2023, the article was updated, and all mentions of Khare disappeared. There are many more examples as well.</p>
<p>Back in December, the Daily Beast finally had an article entitled “<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/who-is-killing-all-these-stories-about-rajat-khare-controversial-tech-mogul">Who is Killing all These Stories About a Controversial Tech Mogul?</a>” highlighting how stories about Khare and Appin have a noticeable history of suddenly disappearing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In a move that has press freedom campaigners troubled, </em><strong><em>Rajat Khare</em></strong><em>, co-founder of Appin, an India-based tech company, has used a variety of law firms in a number of different jurisdictions to threaten these U.S., British, Swiss, Indian, and French-language media organizations.</em></p>
<p><em>On Nov. 16, Reuters </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231117025741/https:/www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hackers-appin/"><em><u>published a special investigation</u></em></a><em> under the headline “How an Indian startup hacked the world,” detailing how Appin allegedly became a “hack for hire powerhouse that stole secrets from executives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the globe”—a claim that Khare strongly denies. Khare retained the powerhouse “</em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/metoo-media-assassins-clare-locke-still-repping-russian-oligarchs"><em><u>media assassin</u></em></a><em>” firm Clare Locke LLP, </em><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/60-minutes-boss-hired-law-firm-over-metoo-story"><em><u>which boasts on its website</u></em></a><em> about “killing stories,” to send Reuters several legal threats over the past year about the story, according to two people familiar with the matter.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the removal of the Reuters story, which at least involved an actual court order, others appeared to be bullied into submission as well. Perhaps most shockingly, Lawfare (who, of anyone, should understand how ridiculous this is) <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-hack-for-hire-industry-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-when-theft-doesn't-work-troll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">redacted their version of the story</a> about Reuters pulling down its article, saying that they did so after receiving “a letter notifying us that the Reuters story summarized in this article had been taken down pursuant to court order in response to allegations that it is false and defamatory. The letter demanded that we retract this post as well.” And they did so, despite no legal basis:</p>
<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/82d57951-02e4-40ac-978b-b3482120cdad-RackMultipart20240131-115-nb6a8i.png?ssl=1" alt="Image" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
</div>
<p>Unsurprisingly, we also received similar demands. We received multiple emails claiming to represent “Association of Appin Training Centers” legal department, and claiming (falsely) that by quoting the Reuters article (which we did not even do) we were also liable for violating the court order. Similar demands were also sent to our CDN provider, our domain registrar, and the domain registry.</p>
<p>The only thing we quoted from Reuters was their announcement about the removal — not from the original article. The other parts we quoted were from SentinelOne, the security research firm that Reuters used to analyze the data. At the time we wrote the article, SentinelOne’s report remained online (it, too, has since been removed “in light of a pending court order … out of an abundance of caution”).</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, all these attempts to pull down and hide the content appears to be causing a bit of a Streisand Effect. Beyond the Daily Beast article calling out the campaign, the website Distributed Denial of Secrets decided to <a href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">republish the Reuters piece</a> as part of its new “Greenhouse” project, noting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In response to the unacceptable censorship by Appin and the Indian courts, Distributed Denial of Secrets is launching a new initiative to combat censorship: the Greenhouse Project. The Greenhouse Project continues DDoSecrets’ mission of ensuring the free transmission of data in the public interest by making the ‘publisher of last resort’ concept <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1255175.1255274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>proposed by George Buchanan in 2007</u></a> a reality. By ensuring the reporting and source files are preserved, the Greenhouse Project <a href="https://theintercept.com/2023/04/11/los-angeles-lawsuit-lapd-headshots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>builds on previous efforts</u></a> creating a “warming effect” to reverse the chilling effects of censorship.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://freedom.press/news/global-censorship-campaign-raises-alarms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Freedom of the Press Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/01/19/india-judge-reuters-story-00136339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Politico</a>, and<a href="https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/qa_emma_best_ddosecrets.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Columbia Journalism Review</a> have all run stories on Appin’s attempt to silence reporters. And, of course, all of this just keeps bringing more and more attention to the underlying claims about Khare and Appin. If Khare disputes those claims he could respond to them and refute them directly. Instead, he appears to be continuing a campaign of legal threats and dubious legal filings to seek to scare off reporters.</p>
<p>A few weeks back, we found out that our friends at Muckrock, the operators of DocumentCloud, had also received similar threats regarding documents hosted on that site.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, EFF sent a letter to the Association of Appin Training Centers, on behalf of both us and Muckrock, pointing out that the arguments they made in their letters to both of us did not appear to match what was <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24399471/co.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the actual court filing</a>, which (1) does not clearly establish that the articles were defamatory based on the full evidence and a complete defense by Reuters, and (2) very clearly only apply to Reuters and Google. Furthermore, the letter points out that we are protected by the First Amendment, and any move to enforce a foreign order that violates the First Amendment would be barred under <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/part-VI/chapter-181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the SPEECH Act</a>.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/feb/01/global-censorship-appin-reuters/">Muckrock’s article about this here</a>. Andy Greenberg, at Wired, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/appin-training-centers-lawsuits-censorship/">also has a story about this</a>.</p>
<p>This kind of censorial bullying may work on other publications, but Techdirt believes that (1) important stories, especially around surveillance and hacking, deserve to be read and (2) it’s vitally important to <strong>call it out publicly</strong> when operations like Appin seek to silence reporting, especially when it’s done through abusing the legal process to silence and intimidate journalists and news organizations.</p>
<p>We want to thank David Greene and Aaron Mackey at EFF for their help with this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To the Association of Appin Training Centers:</em></p>
<p><em>We represent and write on behalf of Techdirt and MuckRock Foundation (which runs the DocumentCloud hosting services), each of which received correspondence from you making certain assertions about the legal significance of an interim court order in the matter of Vinay Pandey v. Raphael Satter &amp; Ors. Please direct any future correspondence about this matter to us.</em></p>
<p><em>We are concerned with two issues you raise in your correspondence.</em></p>
<p><em>First, you refer to the Reuters article as containing defamatory materials as determined by the court. However, the court’s order by its very terms is an interim order, that the defendants’ evidence has not yet been considered, and that a final determination of the defamatory character of the article has not been made. The order itself states ‘this is only a prima-facie opinion and the defendants shall have sufficient opportunity to express their views through reply, contest in the main suit etc. and the final decision shall be taken subsequently.</em></p>
<p><em>Second, you assert that reporting by others of the disputed statements made in the Reuters article ‘which itself is a violation of an Indian Court Order, thereby making you also liable under Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.’ But, again by its plain terms, the court’s interim order applies only to Reuters and to Google. The order does not require any other person or entity to depublish their articles or other pertinent materials. And the order does not address its effect on those outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts. The order is in no way the global takedown order your correspondence represents it to be. Moreover, both Techdirt and MuckRock Foundation are U.S. entities. Thus, even if the court’s order could apply beyond the parties named within it, it will be unenforceable in U.S. courts to the extent it and Indian defamation law is inconsistent with the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and 47 U.S.C. § 230, pursuant to the SPEECH Act, 28 U.S.C. § 4102. Since the First Amendment would not permit an interim depublication order in a defamation case, the Pandey order is unenforceable.</em></p>
<p><em>If you disagree, please provide us with legal authority so we can assess those arguments. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we will assume that you concede that the order binds only Reuters and Google and that you will cease asserting otherwise to our clients or to anyone else.</em><br><em>———————————————————–</em><br><em>David Greene<br>Civil Liberties Director/Senior Staff Attorney<br>Electronic Frontier Foundation</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Hacker-for-hire firms like <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nso-group-lobbying-israel-hamas-war/">NSO Group</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/hacking-team-breach-shows-global-spying-firm-run-amok/">Hacking Team</a> have become notorious for enabling their customers to spy on vulnerable members of civil society. But as far back as a decade ago in India, a startup called Appin Technology and its subsidiaries allegedly played a similar cyber-mercenary role while attracting far less attention. Over the past two years, a collection of people with direct and indirect links to that company have been working to keep it that way, using a campaign of legal threats to silence publishers and anyone else reporting on Appin Technology’s alleged hacking past. Now, a loose coalition of anti-censorship voices is working to make that strategy backfire.</p><p>For months, lawyers and executives with ties to Appin Technology and to a newer organization that shares part of its name, called the Association of Appin Training Centers, have used lawsuits and legal threats to carry out an aggressive censorship campaign across the globe. These efforts have demanded that more than a dozen publications amend or fully remove references to the original Appin Technology’s alleged illegal hacking or, in some cases, mentions of that company’s cofounder, Rajat Khare. Most prominently, a lawsuit against Reuters brought by the Association of Appin Training Centers resulted in a stunning order from a Delhi court: It demanded that Reuters take down its article based on a blockbuster investigation into Appin Technology that had <a data-offer-url="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored&quot;}" href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" rel="noopener" target="_blank">detailed its alleged targeting and spying</a> on opposition leaders, corporate competitors, lawyers, and wealthy individuals on behalf of customers worldwide. Reuters “temporarily” removed its article in compliance with that injunction and is fighting the order in Indian court.</p><p>As Appin Training Centers has sought to enforce that same order against a slew of other news outlets, however, resistance is building. Earlier this week, the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) sent a response—published <a data-offer-url="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/feb/01/global-censorship-appin-reuters/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/feb/01/global-censorship-appin-reuters/&quot;}" href="https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2024/feb/01/global-censorship-appin-reuters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>—pushing back against Appin Training Centers’ legal threats on behalf of media organizations caught in this crossfire, including the tech blog Techdirt and the investigative news nonprofit MuckRock.</p><p>No media outlet has claimed that Appin Training Centers—a group that describes itself as an educational firm run in part by former franchisees of the original Appin Technology, which reportedly ceased its alleged hacking operations more than a decade ago—has been involved in any illegal hacking. In December, however, Appin Training Centers sent emails to Techdirt and MuckRock demanding they too take down all content related to allegations that Appin Technology previously engaged in widespread cyberspying operations, citing the court order against Reuters.</p><p>Techdirt, Appin Training Centers argued, fell under that injunction by <a data-offer-url="https://www.techdirt.com/company/appin/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/company/appin/&quot;}" href="https://www.techdirt.com/company/appin/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">writing about Reuters' story</a> and the takedown order targeting it. So had MuckRock, the plaintiffs claimed, which <a data-offer-url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches&quot;}" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches" rel="noopener" target="_blank">hosted some of the documents that Reuters had cited</a> in its story and uploaded to MuckRock's DocumentCloud service. In the response sent on their behalf, the EFF states that the two media organizations are refusing to comply, arguing that the Indian court's injunction “is in no way the global takedown order your correspondence represents it to be.” It also cites an American law called the SPEECH Act that deems any foreign court’s libel ruling that violates the First Amendment unenforceable in the US.</p><p>“It's not a good state for a free press when one company can, around the world, disappear news articles,” Michael Morisy, the CEO and cofounder of MuckRock, tells WIRED. “That's something that fundamentally we need to push back against.”</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Techdirt founder Mike Masnick says that, beyond defeating the censorship of the Appin Technology story, he hopes their public response to that censorship effort will ultimately bring even more attention to the group’s past. In fact, 19 years ago, Masnick coined the term <a data-offer-url="https://www.techdirt.com/2005/01/05/since-when-is-it-illegal-to-just-mention-a-trademark-online/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.techdirt.com/2005/01/05/since-when-is-it-illegal-to-just-mention-a-trademark-online/&quot;}" href="https://www.techdirt.com/2005/01/05/since-when-is-it-illegal-to-just-mention-a-trademark-online/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“the Streisand effect</a>” to describe a situation in which someone's attempt to hide information results in its broader exposure—exactly the situation he hopes to help create in this case. “The suppression of accurate reporting is problematic,” says Masnick. “When it happens, it deserves to be called out, and there should be more attention paid to those trying to silence it.”</p><p>The anti-secrecy nonprofit Distributed Denial of Secrets (DDoSecrets) has also joined the effort to spark that Streisand Effect, <a data-offer-url="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored&quot;}" href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“uncensoring” Reuters' story on the original Appin Technology</a> as part of a new initiative it calls the Greenhouse Project. DDoSecrets cofounder Emma Best says the name comes from its intention to foster a “warming effect”—the opposite of the “chilling effect” used to describe the self-censorship created by legal threats. “It sends a signal to would-be censors, telling them that their success may be fleeting and limited,” Best says. “And it assures other journalists that their work can survive.”</p><p>Neither Appin Training Centers nor Rajat Khare responded to WIRED's request for comment, nor did Reuters.</p><p>The fight to expose the original Appin Technology’s alleged hacking history began to reach a head in November of 2022, when the Association for Appin Training Centers sued Reuters based only on its reporters’ unsolicited messages to Appin Training Centers’ employees and students. The company’s legal complaint, filed in India’s judicial system, accused Reuters not only of defamation, but “mental harassment, stalking, sexual misconduct and trauma.”</p><p>Nearly a full year later, Reuters nonetheless published its article, “<a data-offer-url="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored&quot;}" href="https://ddosecrets.com/wiki/Appin_Uncensored" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How an Indian Startup Hacked the World.</a>” The judge in the case initially sided with Appin Training Centers, writing that the article could have a “devastating effect on the general students population of India.” He quickly ordered an injunction stating that Appin Training Centers can demand Reuters take down their claims about Appin Technology.</p><p>That ruling has preceded any legal arguments over the truth of Reuters’ reporting, which the news agency has promised to bring up in an appeal. In fact, Reuters wrote that it based its story on interviews with dozens of Appin Technology's former staff and hundreds of alleged targets, as well as thousands of its internal documents. Those files include Appin Technology's <a data-offer-url="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches#document/p19/a2237798" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches#document/p19/a2237798&quot;}" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23457852-2007-appin-presentations-and-pitches#document/p19/a2237798" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marketing pitch documents</a> that remain publicly available on DocumentCloud thanks to MuckRock, and appear to show the company explicitly offering to hack targets on behalf of clients via “phishing,” “social engineering,” “trojan” infections, and even discussing specific cases when clients hired them for hacking operations.</p><p>Appin Training Centers, for its part, argues that it’s merely a collection of educational institutions whose brand has been tarnished by Reuters’ reporting. Reuters has responded in a legal filing arguing that Appin Training Centers was created “solely for purposes of this lawsuit, with ulterior motive,” and pointed out, through an exhibit attached to a court filing, that it was incorporated only months <em>after</em> it named itself as the plaintiff suing Reuters.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Even so, a little more than two weeks after publishing its investigation into Appin Technology, on December 5, Reuters complied with the Indian court's injunction, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hackers-appin/">removing its story</a>. Soon, in a kind of domino effect of censorship, others began to take down their own reports about Appin Technology after receiving legal threats based on the same injunction.

The Internet Archive deleted its copy of the Reuters article. The legal news site Lawfare and cybersecurity news podcast Risky Biz both published analyses based on the article; Risky Biz <a data-offer-url="https://risky.biz/SRB58/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://risky.biz/SRB58/&quot;}" href="https://risky.biz/SRB58/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took its podcast episode down</a>, and Lawfare <a data-offer-url="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-hack-for-hire-industry-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-when-theft-doesn't-work-troll" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-hack-for-hire-industry-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-when-theft-doesn't-work-troll&quot;}" href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-hack-for-hire-industry-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-when-theft-doesn't-work-troll" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overwrote every part of its piece that referred to Appin Technology with Xs</a>. WIRED, too, removed a summary of Reuters' article in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cybersecurity-industry-fbi-ransomware/">news roundup</a> after receiving Appin Training Centers' threat.</p><p>Aside from the injunction that Appin Training Centers has used to demand publishers censor their stories, Appin cofounder Rajat Khare has separately sent legal threats to another collection of news outlets based on a court order he obtained in Switzerland. Two Swiss publications have publicly noted that they responded to court orders by removing Khare’s name from stories about alleged hacking. Others have removed Khare’s name or removed the articles altogether without a public explanation, including the <a data-offer-url="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry&quot;}" href="https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2022-11-05/inside-the-global-hack-for-hire-industry" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, the UK’s <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/caught-on-camera-confessions-of-the-hackers-for-hire-2hgn3kmnh"><em>Sunday Times</em></a>, several Swiss and French news outlets, and eight Indian ones.</p><p>“This is an organization throwing everything against the wall, trying to make as many allegations in as many venues as possible in the hopes that something, somewhere sticks,” says one person at a media outlet that has received multiple legal threats from people connected to Appin Technology, who declined to be named due to the legal risks of speaking out. “Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. Unfortunately, in India, it’s worked.”</p><p>Even before the EFF, Techdirt, MuckRock, and DDoSecrets began to push back against that censorship, some had immediately resisted it. <em>The New Yorker</em>, for instance, had mentioned a subsidiary of Appin Technology and Rajat Khare in a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-crime/a-confession-exposes-indias-secret-hacking-industry">feature about India's hacker-for-hire industry</a> in June of last year. It was sued by Appin Training Centers, but has kept its piece online while the lawsuit proceeds. (<em>The New Yorker</em> and WIRED are both published by Condé Nast.) Ronald Deibert, a well-known security researcher and founder of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, a group that focuses on exposing hackers who target members of civil society, had also <a data-offer-url="https://deibert.citizenlab.ca/2023/11/jail-time-for-private-detective/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://deibert.citizenlab.ca/2023/11/jail-time-for-private-detective/&quot;}" href="https://deibert.citizenlab.ca/2023/11/jail-time-for-private-detective/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">mentioned Appin Technology in a blog post</a>. Deibert received and refused Appin Training Centers' takedown threat, posting a screenshot of its email to his X feed in December along with his <a data-offer-url="https://twitter.com/RonDeibert/status/1738225377326288977" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/RonDeibert/status/1738225377326288977&quot;}" href="https://twitter.com/RonDeibert/status/1738225377326288977" rel="noopener" target="_blank">response</a>: seven middle-finger emojis.</p><p>As the backlash to the censorship of reporting on Appin Technology's alleged hacking snowballs, however, it may now be going beyond a few cases where Appin Training Centers’ and Rajat Khare’s censorship attempts have failed, says Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation, who has <a data-offer-url="https://freedom.press/news/global-censorship-campaign-raises-alarms/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://freedom.press/news/global-censorship-campaign-raises-alarms/&quot;}" href="https://freedom.press/news/global-censorship-campaign-raises-alarms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">written about the censorship campaign</a>. Instead, it may be backfiring, he says, particularly for Appin Technology cofounder Rajat Khare. “It does seem like a sort of dubious strategy to be stirring this up now, and I do wonder if he is starting to regret that given the coverage it's getting,” says Stern. “You could easily see that it'll do more reputational harm than good for Khare and for Appin.”</p><p>MuckRock's Morisy says that attention is exactly the intention of his move, along with Techdirt and the EFF, to put a spotlight on the legal threats they've received. “It’s leveraging the Streisand effect to an extent. But also just finding ways to push back,” says Morisy. “There needs to be a cost for groups that are trying to silence journalists.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post"><article><p>02/01/2024</p><section><p>11 min read</p><div><p>On Thanksgiving Day, November 23, 2023, Cloudflare detected a threat actor on our self-hosted Atlassian server. Our security team immediately began an investigation, cut off the threat actor’s access, and on Sunday, November 26, we brought in CrowdStrike’s Forensic team to perform their own independent analysis.</p><p>Yesterday, CrowdStrike completed its investigation, and we are publishing this blog post to talk about the details of this security incident.</p><p>We want to emphasize to our customers that no Cloudflare customer data or systems were impacted by this event. Because of our access controls, firewall rules, and use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools, the threat actor’s ability to move laterally was limited. No services were implicated, and no changes were made to our global network systems or configuration. This is the promise of a Zero Trust architecture: it’s like bulkheads in a ship where a compromise in one system is limited from compromising the whole organization.</p><p>From November 14 to 17, a threat actor did reconnaissance and then accessed our internal wiki (which uses Atlassian Confluence) and our bug database (Atlassian Jira). On November 20 and 21, we saw additional access indicating they may have come back to test access to ensure they had connectivity.</p><p>They then returned on November 22 and established persistent access to our Atlassian server using ScriptRunner for Jira, gained access to our source code management system (which uses Atlassian Bitbucket), and tried, unsuccessfully, to access a console server that had access to the data center that Cloudflare had not yet put into production in São Paulo, Brazil.</p><p>They did this by using one access token and three service account credentials that had been taken, and that we failed to rotate, after the <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-mitigated-yet-another-okta-compromise">Okta compromise of October 2023</a>. All threat actor access and connections were terminated on November 24 and CrowdStrike has confirmed that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44.</p><p><em>(Throughout this blog post all dates and times are UTC.)</em></p><p>Even though we understand the operational impact of the incident to be extremely limited, we took this incident very seriously because a threat actor had used stolen credentials to get access to our Atlassian server and accessed some documentation and a limited amount of source code. Based on our collaboration with colleagues in the industry and government, we believe that this attack was performed by a nation state attacker with the goal of obtaining persistent and widespread access to Cloudflare’s global network.</p><h3 id="%E2%80%9Ccode-red%E2%80%9D-remediation-and-hardening-effort">“Code Red” Remediation and Hardening Effort</h3><p>On November 24, after the threat actor was removed from our environment, our security team pulled in all the people they needed across the company to investigate the intrusion and ensure that the threat actor had been completely denied access to our systems, and to ensure we understood the full extent of what they accessed or tried to access.</p><p>Then, from November 27, we redirected the efforts of a large part of the Cloudflare technical staff (inside and outside the security team) to work on a single project dubbed “Code Red”. The focus was strengthening, validating, and remediating any control in our environment to ensure we are secure against future intrusion and to validate that the threat actor could not gain access to our environment. Additionally, we continued to investigate every system, account and log to make sure the threat actor did not have persistent access and that we fully understood what systems they had touched and which they had attempted to access.</p><p>CrowdStrike performed an independent assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s activity, including a search for any evidence that they still persisted in our systems. CrowdStrike’s investigation provided helpful corroboration and support for our investigation, but did not bring to light any activities that we had missed. This blog post outlines in detail everything we and CrowdStrike uncovered about the activity of the threat actor.</p><p>The only production systems the threat actor could access using the stolen credentials was our Atlassian environment. Analyzing the wiki pages they accessed, bug database issues, and source code repositories, it appears they were looking for information about the architecture, security, and management of our global network; no doubt with an eye on gaining a deeper foothold. Because of that, we decided a huge effort was needed to further harden our security protocols to prevent the threat actor from being able to get that foothold had we overlooked something from our log files.</p><p>Our aim was to prevent the attacker from using the technical information about the operations of our network as a way to get back in. Even though we believed, and later confirmed, the attacker had limited access, we undertook a comprehensive effort to rotate every production credential (more than 5,000 individual credentials), physically segment test and staging systems, performed forensic triages on 4,893 systems, reimaged and rebooted every machine in our global network including all the systems the threat actor accessed and all Atlassian products (Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket).</p><p>The threat actor also attempted to access a console server in our new, and not yet in production, data center in São Paulo. All attempts to gain access were unsuccessful. To ensure these systems are 100% secure, equipment in the Brazil data center was returned to the manufacturers. The manufacturers’ forensic teams examined all of our systems to ensure that no access or persistence was gained. Nothing was found, but we replaced the hardware anyway.</p><p>We also looked for software packages that hadn’t been updated, user accounts that might have been created, and unused active employee accounts; we went searching for secrets that might have been left in Jira tickets or source code, examined and deleted all HAR files uploaded to the wiki in case they contained tokens of any sort. Whenever in doubt, we assumed the worst and made changes to ensure anything the threat actor was able to access would no longer be in use and therefore no longer be valuable to them.</p><p>Every member of the team was encouraged to point out areas the threat actor might have touched, so we could examine log files and determine the extent of the threat actor’s access. By including such a large number of people across the company, we aimed to leave no stone unturned looking for evidence of access or changes that needed to be made to improve security.</p><p>The immediate “Code Red” effort ended on January 5, but work continues across the company around credential management, software hardening, vulnerability management, additional alerting, and more.</p><h3 id="attack-timeline">Attack timeline</h3><p>The attack started in October with the compromise of Okta, but the threat actor only began targeting our systems using those credentials from the Okta compromise in mid-November.</p><p>The following timeline shows the major events:</p><h3 id="october-18okta-compromise">October 18 - Okta compromise</h3><p>We’ve <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-mitigated-yet-another-okta-compromise">written about this before</a> but, in summary, we were (for the second time) the victim of a compromise of Okta’s systems which resulted in a threat actor gaining access to a set of credentials. These credentials were meant to all be rotated.</p><p>Unfortunately, we failed to rotate one service token and three service accounts (out of thousands) of credentials that were leaked during the Okta compromise.</p><p>One was a Moveworks service token that granted remote access into our Atlassian system. The second credential was a service account used by the SaaS-based Smartsheet application that had administrative access to our Atlassian Jira instance, the third account was a Bitbucket service account which was used to access our source code management system, and the fourth was an AWS environment that had no access to the global network and no customer or sensitive data.</p><p>The one service token and three accounts were not rotated because mistakenly it was believed they were unused. This was incorrect and was how the threat actor first got into our systems and gained persistence to our Atlassian products. Note that this was in no way an error on the part of AWS, Moveworks or Smartsheet. These were merely credentials which we failed to rotate.</p><h3 id="november-14-092249threat-actor-starts-probing">November 14 09:22:49 - threat actor starts probing</h3><p>Our logs show that the threat actor started probing and performing reconnaissance of our systems beginning on November 14, looking for a way to use the credentials and what systems were accessible. They attempted to log into our Okta instance and were denied access. They attempted access to the Cloudflare Dashboard and were denied access.</p><p>Additionally, the threat actor accessed an AWS environment that is used to power the Cloudflare Apps marketplace. This environment was segmented with no access to global network or customer data. The service account to access this environment was revoked, and we validated the integrity of the environment.</p><h3 id="november-15-162838threat-actor-gains-access-to-atlassian-services">November 15 16:28:38 - threat actor gains access to Atlassian services</h3><p>The threat actor successfully accessed Atlassian Jira and Confluence on November 15 using the Moveworks service token to authenticate through our gateway, and then they used the Smartsheet service account to gain access to the Atlassian suite. The next day they began looking for information about the configuration and management of our global network, and accessed various Jira tickets.</p><p>The threat actor searched the wiki for things like remote access, secret, client-secret, openconnect, cloudflared, and token. They accessed 36 Jira tickets (out of a total of 2,059,357 tickets) and 202 wiki pages (out of a total of 194,100 pages).</p><p>The threat actor accessed Jira tickets about vulnerability management, secret rotation, MFA bypass, network access, and even our response to the Okta incident itself.</p><p>The wiki searches and pages accessed suggest the threat actor was very interested in all aspects of access to our systems: password resets, remote access, configuration, our use of Salt, but they did not target customer data or customer configurations.</p><h3 id="november-16-143637threat-actor-creates-an-atlassian-user-account">November 16 14:36:37 - threat actor creates an Atlassian user account</h3><p>The threat actor used the Smartsheet credential to create an Atlassian account that looked like a normal Cloudflare user. They added this user to a number of groups within Atlassian so that they’d have persistent access to the Atlassian environment should the Smartsheet service account be removed.</p><h3 id="november-17-143352-to-november-20-092653threat-actor-takes-a-break-from-accessing-cloudflare-systems">November 17 14:33:52 to November 20 09:26:53 - threat actor takes a break from accessing Cloudflare systems</h3><p>During this period, the attacker took a break from accessing our systems (apart from apparently briefly testing that they still had access) and returned just before Thanksgiving.</p><h3 id="november-22-141822threat-actor-gains-persistence">November 22 14:18:22 - threat actor gains persistence</h3><p>Since the Smartsheet service account had administrative access to Atlassian Jira, the threat actor was able to install the Sliver Adversary Emulation Framework, which is a widely used tool and framework that red teams and attackers use to enable “C2” (command and control), connectivity gaining persistent and stealthy access to a computer on which it is installed. Sliver was installed using the ScriptRunner for Jira plugin.</p><p>This allowed them continuous access to the Atlassian server, and they used this to attempt lateral movement. With this access the Threat Actor attempted to gain access to a non-production console server in our São Paulo, Brazil data center due to a non-enforced ACL. The access was denied, and they were not able to access any of the global network.</p><p>Over the next day, the threat actor viewed 120 code repositories (out of a total of 11,904 repositories). Of the 120, the threat actor used the Atlassian Bitbucket git archive feature on 76 repositories to download them to the Atlassian server, and even though we were not able to confirm whether or not they had been exfiltrated, we decided to treat them as having been exfiltrated.</p><p>The 76 source code repositories were almost all related to how backups work, how the global network is configured and managed, how identity works at Cloudflare, remote access, and our use of Terraform and Kubernetes. A small number of the repositories contained encrypted secrets which were rotated immediately even though they were strongly encrypted themselves.</p><p>We focused particularly on these 76 source code repositories to look for embedded secrets, (secrets stored in the code were rotated), vulnerabilities and ways in which an attacker could use them to mount a subsequent attack. This work was done as a priority by engineering teams across the company as part of “Code Red”.</p><p>As a SaaS company, we’ve long believed that our source code itself is not as precious as the source code of software companies that distribute software to end users. In fact, we’ve open sourced a large amount of our source code and speak openly through our blog about algorithms and techniques we use. So our focus was not on someone having access to the source code, but whether that source code contained embedded secrets (such as a key or token) and vulnerabilities.</p><h3 id="november-23discovery-and-threat-actor-access-termination-begins">November 23 - Discovery and threat actor access termination begins</h3><p>Our security team was alerted to the threat actor’s presence at 16:00 and deactivated the Smartsheet service account 35 minutes later. 48 minutes later the user account created by the threat actor was found and deactivated. Here’s the detailed timeline for the major actions taken to block the threat actor once the first alert was raised.</p><p>15:58 - The threat actor adds the Smartsheet service account to an administrator group.<br>16:00 - Automated alert about the change at 15:58 to our security team.<br>16:12 - Cloudflare SOC starts investigating the alert.<br>16:35 - Smartsheet service account deactivated by Cloudflare SOC.<br>17:23 - The threat actor-created Atlassian user account is found and deactivated.<br>17:43 - Internal Cloudflare incident declared.<br>21:31 - Firewall rules put in place to block the threat actor’s known IP addresses.</p><h3 id="november-24sliver-removed-all-threat-actor-access-terminated">November 24 - Sliver removed; all threat actor access terminated</h3><p>10:44 - Last known threat actor activity.<br>11:59 - Sliver removed.</p><p>Throughout this timeline, the threat actor tried to access a myriad of other systems at Cloudflare but failed because of our access controls, firewall rules, and use of hard security keys enforced using our own Zero Trust tools.</p><p>To be clear, we saw no evidence whatsoever that the threat actor got access to our global network, data centers, SSL keys, customer databases or configuration information, Cloudflare Workers deployed by us or customers, AI models, network infrastructure, or any of our datastores like Workers KV, R2 or Quicksilver. Their access was limited to the Atlassian suite and the server on which our Atlassian runs.</p><p>A large part of our “Code Red” effort was understanding what the threat actor got access to and what they tried to access. By looking at logging across systems we were able to track attempted access to our internal metrics, network configuration, build system, alerting systems, and release management system. Based on our review, none of their attempts to access these systems were successful. Independently, CrowdStrike performed an assessment of the scope and extent of the threat actor’s activity, which did not bring to light activities that we had missed and concluded that the last evidence of threat activity was on November 24 at 10:44.</p><p>We are confident that between our investigation and CrowdStrike’s, we fully understand the threat actor’s actions and that they were limited to the systems on which we saw their activity.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>This was a security incident involving a sophisticated actor, likely a nation-state, who operated in a thoughtful and methodical manner. The efforts we have taken to ensure that the ongoing impact of the incident was limited and that we are well-prepared to fend off any sophisticated attacks in the future. This required the efforts of a significant number of Cloudflare’s engineering staff, and, for over a month, this was the highest priority at Cloudflare. The entire Cloudflare team worked to ensure that our systems were secure, the threat actor’s access was understood, to remediate immediate priorities (such as mass credential rotation), and to build a plan of long-running work to improve our overall security based on areas for improvement discovered during this process.</p><p>I am incredibly grateful to everyone at Cloudflare who responded quickly over the Thanksgiving holiday to conduct an initial analysis and lock out of the threat actor and all those who contributed to this effort. It would be impossible to name everyone involved, but their long hours and dedicated work made it possible to undertake an essential review and change of Cloudflare’s security while keeping our global network running and our customers’ service running.</p><p>We are grateful to CrowdStrike for having been available immediately to conduct an independent assessment. Now that their final report is complete, we are confident in our internal analysis and remediation of the intrusion and are making this blog post available.</p><p><strong>IOCs</strong><br>Below are the Indications of Compromise (IOCs) that we saw from this threat actor. We are publishing them so that other organizations, and especially those that may have been impacted by the Okta breach, can search their logs to confirm the same threat actor did not access their systems.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html-->

				<p>Abstract</p>
<p>We present a sub-terahertz (THz) wireless link using photonics-based ultra-low phase noise transmitter and receiver. The maximum data rate achieved below hard-decision forward error correction (HD-FEC) threshold by using on-line signal processing was 240 Gbit/s with 64 quadrature amplitude modulation (64QAM) at a single carrier frequency of 275 GHz. We also demonstrate successful 20-m transmission at a data rate of over-200 Gbit/s data rate. This is the highest single-channel performance ever reported with sub-THz wireless communications to the best of our knowledge.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><b><i>Artificial Intelligence and Peace</i></b></p> 
 
<p>At the beginning of the New Year, a time of grace which the Lord gives to each one of us, I would like to address God’s People, the various nations, heads of state and government, the leaders of the different religions and civil society, and all the men and women of our time, in order to offer my fervent good wishes for peace.</p> 
<p>1. <i>The progress of science and technology as a path to peace</i></p> 
<p>Sacred Scripture attests that God bestowed his Spirit upon human beings so that they might have “skill and understanding and knowledge in every craft” (<i>Ex</i> 35:31). Human intelligence is an expression of the dignity with which we have been endowed by the Creator, who made us in his own image and likeness (cf. <i>Gen</i> 1:26), and enabled us to respond consciously and freely to his love. In a particular way, science and technology manifest this fundamentally relational quality of human intelligence; they are brilliant products of its creative potential.</p> 
<p>In its Pastoral Constitution <i><a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_const_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html">Gaudium et Spes</a></i>, the <a href="https://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/index.htm">Second Vatican Council</a> restated this truth, declaring that “through its labours and its native endowments, humanity has ceaselessly sought to better its life”. <a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> When human beings, “with the aid of technology”, endeavour to make “the earth a dwelling worthy of the whole human family”, <a name="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> they carry out God’s plan and cooperate with his will to perfect creation and bring about peace among peoples. Progress in science and technology, insofar as it contributes to greater order in human society and greater fraternal communion and freedom, thus leads to the betterment of humanity and the transformation of the world.</p> 
<p>We rightly rejoice and give thanks for the impressive achievements of science and technology, as a result of which countless ills that formerly plagued human life and caused great suffering have been remedied. At the same time, techno-scientific advances, by making it possible to exercise hitherto unprecedented control over reality, are placing in human hands a vast array of options, including some that may pose a risk to our survival and endanger our common home. <a name="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3">[3]</a></p> 
<p>The remarkable advances in new information technologies, particularly in the digital sphere, thus offer exciting opportunities and grave risks, with serious implications for the pursuit of justice and harmony among peoples. Any number of urgent questions need to be asked. What will be the consequences, in the medium and long term, of these new digital technologies? And what impact will they have on individual lives and on societies, on international stability and peace?</p> 
<p>2. <i>The future of artificial intelligence: between promise and risk</i></p> 
<p>Progress in information technology and the development of digital technologies in recent decades have already begun to effect profound transformations in global society and its various dynamics. New digital tools are even now changing the face of communications, public administration, education, consumption, personal interactions and countless other aspects of our daily lives.</p> 
<p>Moreover, from the digital footprints spread throughout the Internet, technologies employing a variety of<b> </b>algorithms can extract data that enable them to control mental and relational habits for commercial or political purposes, often without our knowledge, thus limiting our conscious exercise of freedom of choice. In a space like the Web, marked by information overload, they can structure the flow of data according to criteria of selection that are not always perceived by the user.</p> 
<p>We need to remember that scientific research and technological innovations are not disembodied and “neutral”, <a name="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> but subject to cultural influences. As fully human activities, the directions they take reflect choices conditioned by personal, social and cultural values in any given age. The same must be said of the results they produce: precisely as the fruit of specifically human ways of approaching the world around us, the latter always have an ethical dimension, closely linked to decisions made by those who design their experimentation and direct their production towards particular objectives.</p> 
<p>This is also the case with forms of artificial intelligence. To date, there is no single definition of artificial intelligence in the world of science and technology. The term itself, which by now has entered into everyday parlance, embraces a variety of sciences, theories and techniques aimed at making machines reproduce or imitate in their functioning the cognitive abilities of human beings. To speak in the plural of “forms of intelligence” can help to emphasize above all the unbridgeable gap between such systems, however amazing and powerful, and the human person: in the end, they are merely “fragmentary”, in the sense that they can only imitate or reproduce certain functions of human intelligence. The use of the plural likewise brings out the fact that these devices greatly differ among themselves and that they should always be regarded as “socio-technical systems”. For the impact of any artificial intelligence device – regardless of its underlying technology – depends not only on its technical design, but also on the aims and interests of its owners and developers, and on the situations in which it will be employed.</p> 
<p>Artificial intelligence, then, ought to be understood as a galaxy of different realities. We cannot presume a priori that its development will make a beneficial contribution to the future of humanity and to peace among peoples. That positive outcome will only be achieved if we show ourselves capable of acting responsibly and respect such fundamental human values as “inclusion, transparency, security, equity, privacy and reliability”. <a name="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5">[5]</a></p> 
<p>Nor is it sufficient simply to presume a commitment on the part of those who design algorithms and digital technologies to act ethically and responsibly. There is a need to strengthen or, if necessary, to establish bodies charged with examining the ethical issues arising in this field and protecting the rights of those who employ forms of artificial intelligence or are affected by them. <a name="_ftnref6" href="#_ftn6">[6]</a></p> 
<p>The immense expansion of technology thus needs to be accompanied by an appropriate formation in responsibility for its future development. Freedom and peaceful coexistence are threatened whenever human beings yield to the temptation to selfishness, self-interest, the desire for profit and the thirst for power. We thus have a duty to broaden our gaze and to direct techno-scientific research towards the pursuit of peace and the common good, in the service of the integral development of individuals and communities. <a name="_ftnref7" href="#_ftn7">[7]</a></p> 
<p>The inherent dignity of each human being and the fraternity that binds us together as members of the one human family must undergird the development of new technologies and serve as indisputable criteria for evaluating them before they are employed, so that digital progress can occur with due respect for justice and contribute to the cause of peace. Technological developments that do not lead to an improvement in the quality of life of all humanity, but on the contrary aggravate inequalities and conflicts, can never count as true progress. <a name="_ftnref8" href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p> 
<p>Artificial intelligence will become increasingly important. The challenges it poses are technical, but also anthropological, educational, social and political. It promises, for instance, liberation from drudgery, more efficient manufacturing, easier transport and more ready markets, as well as a revolution in processes of accumulating, organizing and confirming data. We need to be aware of the rapid transformations now taking place and to manage them in ways that safeguard fundamental human rights and respect the institutions and laws that promote integral human development. Artificial intelligence ought to serve our best human potential and our highest aspirations, not compete with them.</p> 
<p>3. <i>The technology of the future: machines that “learn” by themselves</i></p> 
<p>In its multiple forms, artificial intelligence based on machine learning techniques, while still in its pioneering phases, is already introducing considerable changes to the fabric of societies and exerting a profound influence on cultures, societal behaviours and peacebuilding.</p> 
<p>Developments such as machine learning or deep learning, raise questions that transcend the realms of technology and engineering, and have to do with the deeper understanding of the meaning of human life, the construction of knowledge, and the capacity of the mind to attain truth.</p> 
<p>The ability of certain devices to produce syntactically and semantically coherent texts, for example, is no guarantee of their reliability. They are said to “hallucinate”, that is, to create statements that at first glance appear plausible but are unfounded or betray biases. This poses a serious problem when artificial intelligence is deployed in campaigns of disinformation that spread false news and lead to a growing distrust of the communications media. Privacy, data ownership and intellectual property are other areas where these technologies engender grave risks. To which we can add other negative consequences of the misuse of these technologies, such as discrimination, interference in elections, the rise of a surveillance society, digital exclusion and the exacerbation of an individualism increasingly disconnected from society. All these factors risk fueling conflicts and hindering peace.</p> 
<p>4. <i>The sense of limit in the technocratic paradigm</i></p> 
<p>Our world is too vast, varied and complex ever to be fully known and categorized. The human mind can never exhaust its richness, even with the aid of the most advanced algorithms. Such algorithms do not offer guaranteed predictions of the future, but only statistical approximations. Not everything can be predicted, not everything can be calculated; in the end, “realities are greater than ideas”. <a name="_ftnref9" href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> <sup><sup>[]</sup></sup> No matter how prodigious our calculating power may be, there will always be an inaccessible residue that evades any attempt at quantification.</p> 
<p>In addition, the vast amount of data analyzed by artificial intelligences is in itself no guarantee of impartiality. When algorithms extrapolate information, they always run the risk of distortion, replicating the injustices and prejudices of the environments where they originate. The faster and more complex they become, the more difficult it proves to understand why they produced a particular result.</p> 
<p>“Intelligent” machines may perform the tasks assigned to them with ever greater efficiency, but the purpose and the meaning of their operations will continue to be determined or enabled by human beings possessed of their own universe of values. There is a risk that the criteria behind certain decisions will become less clear, responsibility for those decisions concealed, and producers enabled to evade their obligation to act for the benefit of the community. In some sense, this is favoured by the technocratic system, which allies the economy with technology and privileges the criterion of efficiency, tending to ignore anything unrelated to its immediate interests. <a name="_ftnref10" href="#_ftn10">[10]</a></p> 
<p>This should lead us to reflect on something frequently overlooked in our current technocratic and efficiency-oriented mentality, as it is decisive for personal and social development: the “sense of limit”. Human beings are, by definition, mortal; by proposing to overcome every limit through technology, in an obsessive desire to control everything, we risk losing control over ourselves; in the quest for an absolute freedom, we risk falling into the spiral of a “technological dictatorship”. Recognizing and accepting our limits as creatures is an indispensable condition for reaching, or better, welcoming fulfilment as a gift. In the ideological context of a technocratic paradigm inspired by a Promethean presumption of self-sufficiency, inequalities could grow out of proportion, knowledge and wealth accumulate in the hands of a few, and grave risks ensue for democratic societies and peaceful coexistence. <a name="_ftnref11" href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>5.<i> Burning issues for ethics</i></p> 
<p>In the future, the reliability of an applicant for a mortgage, the suitability of an individual for a job, the possibility of recidivism on the part of a convicted person, or the right to receive political asylum or social assistance could be determined by artificial intelligence systems. The lack of different levels of mediation that these systems introduce is particularly exposed to forms of bias and discrimination: systemic errors can easily multiply, producing not only injustices in individual cases but also, due to the domino effect, real forms of social inequality.</p> 
<p>At times too, forms of artificial intelligence seem capable of influencing individuals’ decisions by operating through pre-determined options associated with stimuli and dissuasions, or by operating through a system of regulating people’s choices based on information design. These forms of manipulation or social control require careful attention and oversight, and imply a clear legal responsibility on the part of their producers, their deployers, and government authorities.</p> 
<p>Reliance on automatic processes that categorize individuals, for instance, by the pervasive use of surveillance or the adoption of social credit systems, could likewise have profound repercussions on the social fabric by establishing a ranking among citizens. These artificial processes of categorization could lead also to power conflicts, since they concern not only virtual users but real people. Fundamental respect for human dignity demands that we refuse to allow the uniqueness of the person to be identified with a set of data. Algorithms must not be allowed to determine how we understand human rights, to set aside the essential human values of compassion, mercy and forgiveness, or to eliminate the possibility of an individual changing and leaving his or her past behind.</p> 
<p>Nor can we fail to consider, in this context, the impact of new technologies on the workplace. Jobs that were once the sole domain of human labour are rapidly being taken over by industrial applications of artificial intelligence. Here too, there is the substantial risk of disproportionate benefit for the few at the price of the impoverishment of many. Respect for the dignity of labourers and the importance of employment for the economic well-being of individuals, families, and societies, for job security and just wages, ought to be a high priority for the international community as these forms of technology penetrate more deeply into our workplaces.</p> 
<p>6.<i> Shall we turn swords into ploughshares?</i></p> 
<p>In these days, as we look at the world around us, there can be no escaping serious ethical questions related to the armaments sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ability to conduct military operations through remote control systems has led to a lessened perception of the devastation caused by those weapon systems and the burden of responsibility for their use, resulting in an even more cold and detached approach to the immense tragedy of war. Research on emerging technologies in the area of so-called Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems, including the weaponization of artificial intelligence, is a cause for grave ethical concern. Autonomous weapon systems can never be morally responsible subjects. The unique human capacity for moral judgment and ethical decision-making is more than a complex collection of algorithms, and that capacity cannot be reduced to programming a machine, which as “intelligent” as it may be, remains a machine. For this reason, it is imperative to ensure adequate, meaningful and consistent human oversight of weapon systems.</p> 
<p>Nor can we ignore the possibility of sophisticated weapons ending up in the wrong hands, facilitating, for instance, terrorist attacks or interventions aimed at destabilizing the institutions of legitimate systems of government. In a word, the world has no need of new technologies that contribute to the unjust development of commerce and the weapons trade and consequently end up promoting the folly of war. By so doing, not only intelligence but the human heart itself would risk becoming ever more “artificial”. The most advanced technological applications should not be employed to facilitate the violent resolution of conflicts, but rather to pave the way for peace.</p> 
<p>On a more positive note, if artificial intelligence were used to promote integral human development, it could introduce important innovations in agriculture, education and culture, an improved level of life for entire nations and peoples, and the growth of human fraternity and social friendship. In the end, the way we use it to include the least of our brothers and sisters, the vulnerable and those most in need, will be the true measure of our humanity.</p> 
<p>An authentically humane outlook and the desire for a better future for our world surely indicates the need for a cross-disciplinary dialogue aimed at an ethical development of algorithms – an algor-ethics – in which values will shape the directions taken by new technologies. <a name="_ftnref12" href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Ethical considerations should also be taken into account from the very beginning of research, and continue through the phases of experimentation, design, production, distribution and marketing. This is the approach of ethics by design, and it is one in which educational institutions and decision-makers have an essential role to play.</p> 
<p>7. <i>Challenges for education</i></p> 
<p>The development of a technology that respects and serves human dignity has clear ramifications for our educational institutions and the world of culture. By multiplying the possibilities of communication, digital technologies have allowed us to encounter one another in new ways. Yet there remains a need for sustained reflection on the kinds of relationships to which they are steering us. Our young people are growing up in cultural environments pervaded by technology, and this cannot but challenge our methods of teaching, education and training.</p> 
<p>Education in the use of forms of artificial intelligence should aim above all at promoting critical thinking. Users of all ages, but especially the young, need to develop a discerning approach to the use of data and content collected on the web or produced by artificial intelligence systems. Schools,<b></b> universities and scientific societies are challenged to help students and professionals to grasp the social and ethical aspects of the development and uses of technology.</p> 
<p>Training in the use of new means of communication should also take account not only of disinformation, “fake news”, but also the disturbing recrudescence of “certain ancestral fears… that have been able to hide and spread behind new technologies”. <a name="_ftnref13" href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> Sadly, we once more find ourselves having to combat “the temptation to build a culture of walls, to raise walls… in order to prevent an encounter with other cultures and other peoples”, <a name="_ftnref14" href="#_ftn14">[14]</a> and the development of a peaceful and fraternal coexistence.</p> 
<p>8. <i>Challenges for the development of international<b> </b>law</i></p> 
<p>The global scale of artificial intelligence makes it clear that, alongside the responsibility of sovereign states to regulate its use internally, international organizations can play a decisive role in reaching multilateral agreements and coordinating their application and enforcement. <a name="_ftnref15" href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> In this regard, I urge the global community of nations to work together in order to adopt a binding international treaty that regulates the development and use of artificial intelligence in its many forms. The goal of regulation, naturally, should not only be the prevention of harmful practices but also the encouragement of best practices, by stimulating new and creative approaches and encouraging individual or group initiatives. <a name="_ftnref16" href="#_ftn16">[16]</a></p> 
<p>In the quest for normative models that can provide ethical guidance to developers of digital technologies, it is indispensable to identify the human values that should undergird the efforts of societies to formulate, adopt and enforce much-needed regulatory frameworks. The work of drafting ethical guidelines for producing forms of artificial intelligence can hardly prescind from the consideration of deeper issues regarding the meaning of human existence, the protection of fundamental human rights and the pursuit of justice and peace. This process of ethical and juridical discernment can prove a precious opportunity for shared reflection on the role that technology should play in our individual and communal lives, and how its use can contribute to the creation of a more equitable and humane world. For this reason, in debates about the regulation of artificial intelligence, the voices of all stakeholders should be taken into account, including the poor, the powerless and others who often go unheard in global decision-making processes.</p> 
<p>* * *</p> 
<p>I hope that the foregoing reflection will encourage efforts to ensure that progress in developing forms of artificial intelligence will ultimately serve the cause of human fraternity and peace. It is not the responsibility of a few but of the entire human family. For peace is the fruit of relationships that recognize and welcome others in their inalienable dignity, and of cooperation and commitment in seeking the integral development of all individuals and peoples.</p> 
<p>It is my prayer at the start of the New Year that the rapid development of forms of artificial intelligence will not increase cases of inequality and injustice all too present in today’s world, but will help put an end to wars and conflicts, and alleviate many forms of suffering that afflict our human family. May Christian believers, followers of various religions and men and women of good will work together in harmony to embrace the opportunities and confront the challenges posed by the digital revolution and thus hand on to future generations a world of greater solidarity, justice and peace.</p>

                <p>The web is amazing. It makes collaborating, learning, and connecting easy for billions of people, because it’s intentionally designed to run on radically different devices.</p>
<p>It’s your job as a web developer to ensure your project works in every browser and for every user — and that can be hard to do. It’s a far easier undertaking when browsers have identical implementations of the web technology you use.</p>
<p>Identical implementations are accomplished through the web standards process, where people collaborate together to write extremely detailed technical documents that define each new web technology — right down to how website bugs should work.</p>
<p>One way to check and see if browsers follow the web standards is through automated testing. There are several shared repositories of such tests, including <a href="https://web-platform-tests.org/">Web Platform Tests</a>. WPT contains over 1.8&nbsp;million tests, of which over 95% pass in all of the major browsers.</p>
<h2><a name="the-interop-project"></a>The Interop Project</h2>
<p>The Interop project aims to improve interoperability by encouraging browser engine teams to look deeper into specific focus areas. Now, for a third year, Apple, <a href="https://bocoup.com/blog/interop-2024">Bocoup</a>, <a href="https://web.dev/blog/interop-2024">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.igalia.com/2024/interop-2024-launches.html">Igalia</a>, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2024/02/01/microsoft-edge-and-interop-2024/">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2024/02/announcing-interop-2024/">Mozilla</a> pooled our collective expertise and selected a specific subset of automated tests for 2024.</p>
<p>Some of the technologies chosen have been around for a long time. Other areas are brand new. By selecting some of the highest priority features that developers have avoided for years because of their bugs, we can get them to a place where they can finally be relied on. And by selecting exciting new technology, we can ensure it’s interoperable from the beginning.</p>
<p>To better understand where interoperability is going in the future, let’s first take a look at the impact of Interop 2023.</p>
<h2><a name="interop-2023"></a>Interop 2023</h2>
<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13706/interop-2023/">Interop 2023</a> was even more of an overwhelming success than <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/12288/working-together-on-interop-2022/">Interop 2022</a>. In January 2023, 48%&nbsp;of the chosen tests passed in all three of the major browser engines (in those shipped to users: Chrome and Firefox for desktop Linux, and Safari on macOS Monterey). A year later, that pass rate rose to 95% (in Chrome Dev and Firefox Nightly for desktop Linux, and Safari Technology Preview on macOS Ventura).</p>

The “Interop” line, in dark green, shows the percentage of tests that passed in all three — Chrome Dev, Firefox Nightly, and Safari Technology Preview.</figcaption></figure>
<p>What did Interop 2023 accomplish?</p>
<ul>
<li>It ensured that all browsers have full support for P3 color, seven years after it started shipping. </li>
<li>Form controls now support vertical writing modes, for the first time in the web’s history. </li>
<li>CSS  <code>border-image</code> now works as originally intended. </li>
<li>Subgrid, Container Queries, <code>:has()</code>, Motion Path, CSS Math Functions, <code>inert</code> and <code>@property</code> are now supported in every modern browser. </li>
<li>Improved Web APIs include Offscreen Canvas, Modules in Web Workers, Import Maps, Import Assertions, and JavaScript Modules. </li>
<li>The entire Media Queries 4 specification is now supported everywhere, with easier to use syntax. </li>
<li>Web Components got a boost with <code>adoptedStyleSheets</code>, <code>ElementInternals</code>, Form-Associated Custom Elements, and the basic behavior of Shadow DOM and Custom Elements. </li>
<li>Useful CSS pseudo-classes can now be relied on, with consistent cross-browser support for <code>:nth-child()</code>, <code>:nth-last-child()</code>, <code>:modal</code>, <code>:user-valid</code>, and <code>:user-invalid</code>. </li>
<li>Feature queries now have new support for detecting font features. </li>
<li>Font Palettes provide robust support for color fonts. </li>
<li>Significant progress made improving CSS Masking, HTML Forms, Pointer and Mouse Events, Scrolling, Transforms, URL, WebCodecs, and a bucket of bugs causing web compat issues. </li>
<li><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13706/interop-2023/#focus-areas">And more</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope this work gives you a renewed sense of confidence to use these technologies. If you found any of them hard-to-use in the past, give them another try.</p>
<p>Interop 2023 had twenty-six focus areas, twenty of which are being retired as a success. Work will continue on Custom Properties, Pointer and Mouse Events, URL, and a new grouping called “Layout” — consisting of Flexbox, Grid, and Subgrid.</p>
<h2><a name="interop-2024"></a>Interop 2024</h2>
<p>Now, we are doing it all again for 2024. Ninety-six focus area proposals were submitted for consideration. Ultimately, sixteen were chosen. Grouping some of the new proposals together, and continuing some of the work from 2023, gives Interop 2024 a total of seventeen focus areas.</p>

</a></ul><h3><a href="#url"></a><a name="accessibility"></a>Accessibility</h3>
<p>Interop 2023 included an Accessibility Investigation project. Led by Apple’s accessibility team, the group worked diligently to create new accessibility testing infrastructure for WPT, and write over <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/?label=master&amp;label=experimental&amp;aligned&amp;q=label%3Aaccessibility">1300 new accessibility tests</a>. These tests have now been included in Interop 2024 as a focus area, encouraging browsers to increase their support.</p>
<p>The majority of new accessibility tests cover <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/">WAI-ARIA</a>, in particular, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/aria/#roles">the Roles Model</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/accname/">Accessible Name and Description Computation</a> (AccName). Together, these provide a consistent mechanism for conveying the purpose or intent of an element so assistive technology users understand what it is and what they can do with it.</p>
<p>Other new accessibility tests cover how those technologies are incorporated into host languages. For example, the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html-aam/">HTML Accessibility API Mappings specification (HTML-AAM)</a> defines the default accessibility semantics of HTML elements, along with related rules for how browsers work with features like the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element and image <code>alt</code> text. (See the <a href="https://wpt.fyi/results/html-aam/roles.html?label=master&amp;label=experimental&amp;aligned&amp;q=label%3Aaccessibility">html-aam/roles WPT tests</a> as an example.)</p>
<p>Another new set of tests cover the accessibility of <code>display: contents</code>. This display mode in CSS provides a useful mechanism for removing the box around content — helpful when wanting to adjust the parent/child/grandchild relationships of content for the purposes of Flexbox or Grid. But it was off limits for use for years, because of the <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-display-contents">lack of accessibility in early implementations</a>. Removing the box on an item completely removed all the contents of that box from the accessibility tree. Sighted users could still see the child content, but many users of assistive technology experienced it completely disappearing. Most of these problems have been fixed in browsers, but not all, not for every situation. These new tests are the next step toward full accessibility and interoperability.</p>
<p>By including these new Accessibility tests in Interop 2024, the hope is to fix every issue in all browsers. We want it to be easier for developers to create accessible sites and make the web better for everyone, including people with disabilities.</p>
<h3><a name="css-nesting"></a>CSS Nesting</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting/Using_CSS_nesting">CSS Nesting</a> is a focus area for Interop 2024 to ensure any differences are ironed out, and to provide you with the confidence to use it. The ability to nest CSS <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-nesting">shipped in all four major browsers</a> in 2023 — first in Chrome, Edge, and Safari in April/May. And then in Firefox in August.</p>
<p>The web standard changed slightly between May and August, relaxing the original requirement that every nested selector start with a symbol. Developers can now simply write <code>article</code>, rather than needing to use  <code>&amp; article</code>.</p>
<p>All of the implementations have since been updated, but there are still small bits that could benefit from attention to interoperability, especially as the final complex details of how Nesting works are settled in the CSS Working Group. Most of Safari’s test failures, for example, are about how nested CSS <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/9509">interacts</a> with the Shadow DOM via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:host"><code>:host</code></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="custom-properties"></a>Custom Properties</h3>
<p>The <code>@property</code> at-rule started <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_property">shipping in browsers</a> over the last few years. As part of Interop 2023, the Custom Properties focus area rose from 4% of tests passing in all stable browsers to 7.6% passing — with 90.7% passing in all of the preview browsers. Firefox is the last browser to add support, which is currently in progress in Firefox Nightly. Since this work isn’t done yet, the focus area is being continued in 2024.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@property"><code>@property</code></a>, developers can declare CSS custom properties in a fashion similar to how browser engines define CSS properties — specifying its syntax, inheritance behavior, and initial value.</p>
<pre><code>@property --size {
  syntax: "&lt;length&gt;";
  inherits: false;
  initial-value: 0px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This allows you to do things in CSS that were impossible before, like animating gradients or certain parts of transforms.</p>
<h3><a name="declarative-shadow-dom"></a>Declarative Shadow DOM</h3>
<p><a href="https://webkit.org/blog/13851/declarative-shadow-dom/">Declarative Shadow DOM</a> is a declarative API that lets you create reusable widgets and components by using only HTML — no JavaScript is necessary. It’s been <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Declarative%20Shadow%20DOM">supported</a> in Safari 16.4 since March 2023, and in Chrome 90 since April 2021. Firefox has an implementation in Firefox Nightly.</p>
<p>Declarative Shadow DOM was one of the often-asked-for features in the <a href="https://stateofhtml.com/en-US">State of HTML 2023</a> survey, so it was chosen to be part of Interop 2024 to ensure it becomes interoperable across all browsers.</p>
<h3><a name="font-size-adjust"></a>Font size adjust</h3>
<p>The <code>font-size-adjust</code> property is a great example of the usefulness of placing attention on older technology. Firefox first <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=font-size-adjust">implemented</a> font size adjust in 2008, but it was rarely used or even discussed by web designers and developers. The early spec evolved over time, adding support for more languages through the two-value syntax, and becoming easier to use with the <code>from-font</code> value.</p>
<p>The WebKit team implemented the basic version in Safari 16.4 and added the updates in September’s Safari 17.0. Mozilla updated their implementation in Firefox 118, also in September 2023. Both Safari and Firefox now pass 100% of all tests. Chrome began an experimental implementation in 2015, but has yet to ship it. Now with Interop 2024, it’s likely every browser will gain complete support.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust">Font size adjust</a> provides a simple way to conform all the fonts used in a string of text to be the same visual size — so every character in <code>1.4rem</code>-sized text, for example, has the same x-height — or cap height, <code>ch</code> width, <code>ic</code> width, or <code>ic</code> height. The two value syntax allows you to choose which measurement to conform.</p>
<p>This property is especially useful when you are mixing code with regular text, or mixing multiple languages together, and the different fonts within the same sentence have different sizes. With font size adjust you can avoid weirdly-big letters. No more fussing with font metrics to find a magic number that makes them all look the same size.</p>

<h3><a name="https-urls-for-websocket"></a>HTTPS URLs for WebSocket</h3>
<p>A quirky aspect of the WebSocket API is that you need to use non-HTTP(S) schemes: <code>ws:</code> (insecure) and <code>wss:</code>. As the URLs function otherwise identically to HTTP(S) URLs, this makes the API a bit frustrating to deal with. Based on web developer feedback the WebKit team decided to address this last year by making the API support HTTP(S) URLs as well. We shipped support in Safari 17.0.</p>
<p>This means that instead of writing:</p>
<pre><code>function webSocketHandle(path) {
  const url = new URL(path, location);
  url.protocol = location.protocol === "https:" ? "wss:" : "ws:";
  return new WebSocket(url);
}
// ...
const ws = webSocketHandle(path);
</code></pre>
<p>You can now write the much more ergonomic:</p>
<pre><code>const ws = new WebSocket(path);
</code></pre>
<p>By bringing this to Interop 2024, we hope other browsers will adopt it as well, making it universally available for web developers.</p>
<h3><a name="indexeddb"></a>IndexedDB</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API">IndexedDB</a> is an API that provides powerful ways to store data client-side, in an object-oriented database. It started shipping in browsers in 2011, and over the years the web standard has kept evolving. Both version 2 and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">version 3</a> are supported by all major browsers. Version 2 is fully interoperable, but version 3 needs a bit of attention to bring up the quality of implementations. Being part of Interop 2024 will help ensure implementations are completed and aligned.</p>
<h3><a name="layout"></a>Layout</h3>
<p>CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout">Grid</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout/Basic_concepts_of_flexbox">Flexbox</a> were both included in the original Interop project in 2021. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Subgrid">Subgrid</a> was added in Interop 2023. While all three layout methods are now in great shape, they still aren’t quite perfect. The tests for these three areas are now being combined into one Focus Area called Layout. Work will continue to ensure complex edge cases are more interoperable. Meanwhile, developers should absolutely feel confident using these three technologies, since all browsers have solid support for <a href="https://caniuse.com/flexbox">Flexbox</a>, <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-grid">Grid</a>, and now <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid">Subgrid</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="pointer-and-mouse-events"></a>Pointer and Mouse Events</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events">Pointer events</a> are DOM events that are fired for a pointing device. They create a single DOM event model to handle pointing input devices such as a mouse, pen/stylus, or touch with one or more fingers. This API first started <a href="https://caniuse.com/pointer">shipping</a> in browsers in 2012, and landed everywhere by 2019, but still had rocky interoperability.</p>
<p>In 2022, the Interop team launched an Investigation Project to look deeper into the current state of Pointer and Mouse Events, in an effort to clarify consensus and write tests that captured the state of that consensus. For Interop 2023, those tests enabled Pointer and Mouse Events to be a Focus Area, where the test pass rate was part of the Interop 2023 dashboard and score. Over the year, Pointer and Mouse Events rose from a test pass rate of 34% to 81% — the most significant progress of any area.</p>
<p>While passing 81% of tests is a significant improvement, there is more work to do, therefore Pointer and Mouse Events will continue to be a Focus Area for 2024.</p>
<h3><a name="popover"></a>Popover</h3>
<p>The new <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover"><code>popover</code></a> attribute in HTML provides a built-into-the-browser way to have an element pop into view on the top layer of a page. If you are creating an overlay over the entire web page, the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog"><code>dialog</code></a> element is the best option. But when you want to turn any other element into a popup message, user interface, or other kind of content that appears and disappears, the <code>popover</code> element provides a framework to do it.</p>
<p>Support for <code>popover</code> shipped in Chrome 114 and Safari 17.0 in 2023. Firefox currently has support in progress in Firefox Nightly. Being part of Interop 2024 will ensure this highly desired feature has a fantastic start.</p>
<h3><a name="relative-color-syntax"></a>Relative Color Syntax</h3>
<p>Relative Color Syntax is a new way to define colors in CSS that allows you do so while referring to another color. You can, for instance, lighten or darken an existing color by a certain amount. You can take a color variable, adjust the saturation, and assign the new color to a second variable. Relative Color Syntax can be especially powerful when creating a design system.</p>
<figure>
<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23.png" alt="a still from the WWDC session teach how relative color syntax works" width="2970" height="1672" srcset="https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23.png 2970w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-300x169.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-1024x576.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-768x432.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-1536x865.png 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/relative-color-syntax-from-WWDC23-2048x1153.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2970px) 100vw, 2970px"><figcaption>Learn more about Relative Color Syntax by watching <i><a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10121/?time=623">What’s new in CSS</a></i> from WWDC23. </figcaption></figure>
<p>Safari 16.4 was the first browser to ship support, in March 2023. Chrome 119 and Edge 119 shipped support in Oct and Nov 2023. Currently, none of the implementations have support for using <code>currentcolor</code> with Relative Color Syntax.</p>
<p>The Relative Color Syntax focus area for Interop 2024 doesn’t test overall support of Relative Color Syntax. It’s narrowly focused on whether or not <code>currentcolor</code> is supported, and includes tests of out-of-gamut behavior — checking to see what happens on displays that don’t have support for P3 color. Inclusion in Interop 2024 will help these final bits get done.</p>
<h3><a name="requestvideoframecallback"></a>requestVideoFrameCallback</h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element provides powerful functionality for putting video on the web. But often, developers want and need to do more. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement"><code>HTMLVideoElement</code></a> interface provides special properties and methods for manipulating video objects in JavaScript. And one of those methods is <code>requestVideoFrameCallback()</code>. It lets you perform per-video-frame operations on video in an efficient manner — operations like video processing or analysis, painting to canvas, and synchronization with audio sources.</p>
<p><a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_htmlvideoelement_requestvideoframecallback">Supported</a> since Chrome 83 and Safari 15.4, inclusion in Interop 2024 will help browsers complete and polish our implementations.</p>
<h3><a name="scrollbar-styling"></a>Scrollbar styling</h3>
<p>The scrollbar styling focus area includes two CSS properties that can be used to style scrollbars. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-width"><code>scrollbar-width</code></a> property provides three values: <code>auto</code>, <code>thin</code>, and <code>none</code>. The <code>auto</code> value is the default width; <code>thin</code> provides a thinner scrollbar; and <code>none</code> hides the scrollbar while still allowing content to scroll. Firefox 64 <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_scrollbar-width">implemented</a> support in December 2018, and it just shipped in Chrome 121 and Edge 121.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter"><code>scrollbar-gutter</code></a> property lets you reserve space for the scrollbar, so the layout is the same whether or not a scrollbar is present. The <code>scrollbar-gutter: stable</code> rule lets you tell the browser to reserve space for a scrollbar, even when a scrollbar isn’t there. This can prevent layout shifts from happening between states where scrollbars are needed or not needed. It <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_scrollbar-gutter">shipped</a> in Chrome 94, Edge 94 and Firefox 97, in 2021–22.</p>
<p>Safari has the most work to do to complete this Focus Area. Chrome and Firefox already pass 100% of the tests. Ironically, it was <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/363/styling-scrollbars/">Safari who first provided</a> the ability to style scrollbars with nine pseudo-elements, <code>::-webkit-scrollbar-*</code>, <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=%3A%3A-webkit-scrollbar">back in 2009</a>. However that approach to styling scrollbars never became an official CSS web standard. The CSS Working Group instead <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-scrollbars/#out-of-scope">opted</a> for a far simpler approach.</p>
<h3><a name="starting-style-and-transition-behavior"></a>@starting-style and transition-behavior</h3>
<p>This Focus Area brings attention to two new features for controlling animation. <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_at-rules_starting-style">Both</a> <a href="https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_transition-behavior">shipped</a> in Chrome 117 and Edge 177 in Sept 2023.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@starting-style"><code>@starting-style</code></a> rule in CSS lets you define starting values for a particular element. This is needed when the element is about to go through a transition. It also provides a way for transitioning in or out of <code>display:none</code>.</p>
<pre><code>.alert {
  transition: background-color 2s;
  background-color: green;
  @starting-style {
    background-color: transparent;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>background-color</code> will transition from transparent to green when the element is appended to the document.</p>
<p>Previously, only animations could animate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties#discrete">discretely-animatable</a> properties. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior"><code>transition-behavior</code></a> property in CSS expands that capability to CSS transitions, paving the way for transitioning the <code>display</code> property when showing or hiding elements.</p>
<h3><a name="text-directionality"></a>Text Directionality</h3>
<p>The direction in which text flows is a vital aspect of typesetting on the web. Some languages flow from left-to-right, while others flow from <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-scripts">right-to-left</a>. One of the many bits of technology supporting <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/articlelist#direction">text direction</a> is the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/dir"><code>dir</code> attribute</a>. It lets you specifically mark any HTML element with the direction: <code>left</code>, <code>right</code>, or <code>auto</code> — where <code>auto</code> asks the browser to guess from the first letter. The interaction of directionality and shadow trees was not well-defined until recently. Now that it’s been addressed at a standards level, adding it to Interop 2024 helps us ensure implementations align as well.</p>
<h3><a name="text-wrap-balance"></a>text-wrap: balance</h3>
<p>Web designers have long wished for a way to prevent very short or one-word lines of text — often known as widows or orphans. Since the advent of responsive web design and the lack of control over the width of columns, this desire has gotten even more challenging. The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-wrap"><code>text-wrap</code></a> property provides you with multiple options for telling the browser how to wrap text with different methods for calculating line breaks for specific use cases.</p>
<p>The <code>text-wrap: balance</code> rule is a great solution for headlines. It balances a few lines of text so that each line has about the same amount of text as the others. It <a href="https://caniuse.com/css-text-wrap-balance">shipped</a> in Chrome 114 and Firefox 121, and is implemented in Safari Technology Preview.</p>
<p>Interop 2024 also includes tests of how <code>text-wrap-mode</code>, <code>text-wrap-style</code>, and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space-collapse"><code>white-space-collapse</code></a> behave. The CSS Working Group recently changed to how these longhands interact with each other, so support is currently uneven between browsers. Interop 2024 will help ensure all browser engines update to the latest web standards.</p>
<h3><a name="url"></a>URL</h3>
<p>URLs are one of the most fundamental parts of the web. Without them, the web would not exist. But like many things invented very early in the history of the web, support has yet to be fully interoperable. To improve this, the WHATWG wrote the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/">URL Living Standard</a> packed with details on exactly how URLs should work. The tests supporting this web standard were a focus area for Interop 2023, improving the pass rate from 77% to 85%. To ensure interoperability, the work in this area will continue in 2024.</p>
<p>Safari is proud to lead the pack, passing 99.7% of the tests. Improvements in other browsers will help ensure websites work correctly everywhere.</p>
<h2><a name="the-2024-investigation-projects"></a>The 2024 Investigation projects</h2>
<p>Interop 2024 also includes three investigation areas. These are “homework projects” for the Interop team to work on. All three this year are about writing and making it possible to run more tests — Accessibility Testing, Mobile Testing, and WebAssembly Testing. The Mobile Testing investigation project aims to complete the infrastructure needed at WPT to be able to test browsers on mobile operating systems, potentially to include those scores on the Interop project dashboard in the future.</p>
<p>While two of the three investigations are projects continuing from last year, they all are starting 2024 at zero percent done. Each team involved will set new goals for this year, and the dashboard will report progress on those goals.</p>
<h2><a name="track-the-progress"></a>Track the progress</h2>
<p>Keep up with the progress of Interop 2024 throughout the year, on the <a href="https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024">Interop 2024 dashboard</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="our-commitment"></a>Our Commitment</h2>
<p>We continue to believe that interoperability is one of the fundamental pillars that makes the web such a success. Our efforts in Interop 2022 and 2023 demonstrate how deeply we care about the web. We are excited to again collaborate with our colleagues in seizing this opportunity help the web work better for everyone.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/sat-supercompilation.html">https://hirrolot.github.io/posts/sat-supercompilation.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39218173">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><a href="#supercompilation-by-example"><h2 id="supercompilation-by-example">Supercompilation by example</h2></a><p>Supercompilation is a deep program transformation technique due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentin_Turchin">V. F. Turchin</a>,
a prominent computer scientist, cybernetician, physicist, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_dissidents">Soviet
dissident</a>.</p><p>He described the concept as follows <a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>A supercompiler is a program transformer of a certain type. The usual
way of thinking about program transformation is in terms of some set of
rules which preserve the functional meaning of the program, and a
step-by-step application of these rules to the initial program. … The
concept of a supercompiler is a product of cybernetic thinking. A
program is seen as a machine. To make sense of it, one must observe its
operation. So a supercompiler does not transform the program by steps;
it controls and observes (SUPERvises) the running of the machine that is
represented by the program; let us call this machine M<sub>1</sub>. In
observing the operation of M<sub>1</sub>, the supercompiler COMPILES a
program which describes the activities of M<sub>1</sub>, but it makes
shortcuts and whatever clever tricks it knows in order to produce the
same effect as M<sub>1</sub>, but faster. The goal of the supercompiler
is to make the definition of this program (machine) M<sub>2</sub>
self-sufficient. When this is acheived, it outputs M<sub>2</sub> in some
intermediate language L<sup>sup</sup> and simply throws away the
(unchanged) machine M<sub>1</sub>.</p>
</blockquote><p>A supercompiler is interesting not only as a program transformer but
also as a very general philosophical concept:</p><blockquote>
<p>The supercompiler concept comes close to the way humans think and
make science. We do not think in terms of rules of formal logic. We
create mental and linguistic models of the reality we observe. How do we
do that? We observe phenomena, generalize observations, and try to
construct a self-sufficient model in terms of these generalizations.
This is also what the supercompiler does. … A supercompiler would run
M<sub>1</sub>, in a general form, with unknown values of variables, and
create a graph of states and transitions between possible configurations
of the computing system. … To make it finite, the supercompiler performs
the operation of generalization on the system configurations in such a
manner that it finally comes to a set of generalized configurations,
called <em>basic</em>, in terms of which the behavior of the system can
be expressed. Thus the new program becomes a self-sufficient model of
the old one.</p>
</blockquote><p>Since the above explanations are hard to comprehend at first sight, I
will try to illustrate supercompilation <em>by example</em>.</p><p>Let the object language of supercompilation be a simple first-order
functional language called <em>SLL</em>, which stands for <em>Simple
Lazy Language</em>. It consists of:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Variables:</strong> just regular symbolic identifiers.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Constructors:</strong> symbolic identifiers that wrap their
arguments of arbitrary structure.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <code>Foo(a, b, c)</code>,
<code>Bar(a, Foo(a), c)</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>F-functions:</strong> <em>indifferent</em> functions that
just transform their arguments.
<ul>
<li>Examples:
<ul>
<li><code>foo(a, b, c) = Foo(a, b, Bar(c));</code></li>
<li><code>bar(a, b, c) = foo(Bar(a), b, c);</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>G-functions:</strong> <em>curious</em> functions that
pattern-match on their first argument.
<ul>
<li>Examples: see below.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Suppose that natural numbers are represented as <code>Z</code>,
<code>S(Z)</code>, <code>S(S(Z))</code>, and so on <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.
Then, we can define addition as the following g-function (from <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>):</p><div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>add(Z, y) = y;</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2"></a>add(S(x), y) = S(add(x, y));</span></code></pre></div><p>A supercompiler’s input is a pair of an expression and program, the
latter being a set of definitions of f- and g-functions. This pair is
usually called a <em>task</em>.</p><p>Let the task for a hypothetic supercompiler be the expression
<code>add(S(Z), S(S(Z)))</code> together with the definition of
<code>add</code> above. In this case, the work of a supercompiler is as
simple as sequential reduction of the initial expression to the target
expression <code>S(S(S(Z)))</code>, according to the rules of
<code>add</code>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-1-2.png" width="400px"></p><p>However, to think of a supercompiler as of a mere expression
evaluator is a grave mistake. Let us consider what happens when it
encounters a <em>variable</em> that does not stand for some concrete
expression. For example, let the task be <code>add(S(S(Z)), b)</code>
with the same definition of <code>add</code>, where <code>b</code> is
understood as “any” expression:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-2-b.png" width="400px"></p><p>It <em>just</em> works!</p><p>A supercompiler saw the variable <code>b</code> when trying to reduce
<code>S(S(add(Z, b)))</code>, and then it just substituted
<code>y</code> (from the rule <code>add(Z, y)</code>) for this
<code>b</code>. After that, supercompilation has stopped because the
actual expression for <code>b</code> is unknown at this point. As a
result, we got <code>S(S(b))</code>, which is equivalent to the initial
expression.</p><p>Now consider what happens if there is a need to
<em>pattern-match</em> on an unknown variable. In this case, we cannot
just proceed with “direct” computation since there are several
possibilities of the form the variable may take. Suppose that the task
is <code>add(a, 2)</code> <a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> with the same function
<code>add</code>. What a supercompiler does is that it <em>analyze</em>
the expression <code>add(a, 2)</code> according to all the possibilities
of <code>a</code>, which are either <code>Z</code> or
<code>S(v1)</code>, where <code>v1</code> is some fresh variable
identifier. The situation looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-a-2.png" width="600px"></p><p>A supercompiler has built an (incomplete) <em>process tree</em> that
describes the execution of <code>add(a, 2)</code> in a general sense. In
the first branch, <code>a</code> is substituted for <code>Z</code>
according to the first rule of <code>add</code>; in the second branch,
<code>a</code> is substituted for <code>S(v1)</code> according to the
second rule of <code>add</code>. The resulting two nodes are labelled
with expressions that resulted in reducing a particular substitution of
the parent expression.</p><p>However, the supercompilation is not complete yet: there is still a
node labelled as <code>S(add(v1, 2))</code>. A supercompiler decides to
<em>decompose</em> it, meaning to move <code>add(v1, 2)</code> out of
<code>S(...)</code> in the following way:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-a-2-decompose.png" width="600px"></p><p>After that, if we proceed with supercompiling
<code>add(v1, 2)</code>, we will eventually arrive at the initial
expression <code>add(a, 2)</code>. This is because the expressions
<code>add(v1, 2)</code> and <code>add(a, 2)</code> are <em>alpha
equivalent</em>, meaning that they only differ in the names of
variables. A supercompiler should be smart enough to detect this
situation of alpha equivalence and, instead of continuing infinite
supercompilation, just draw a back arrow from <code>add(v1, 2)</code> to
the initial node as depicted below:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/add-a-2-loop.png" width="600px"></p><p>Hooray, the supercompilation of <code>add(a, 2)</code> is now
complete!</p><p>What is left is to perform <em>residualization</em> – the process of
converting a process tree to an SLL task, a <em>self-sufficient
model</em> of the initial program. Every node in the graph (except for
leaf nodes) is transformed into a function whose parameters are the set
of free variables from the node expression; each function is given a
unique name. For example, if we see the node <code>add(a, 2)</code>
pointing to <code>2</code> and <code>S(add(v1, 2))</code>, we must
generate a new g-function of the following form:</p><div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a>g1(Z) = ...;</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = ...;</span></code></pre></div><p>We can complete the first branch by inserting <code>2</code> in place
of <code>...</code>:</p><div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = ...;</span></code></pre></div><p>Since the second branch leads to a node that decomposes a
constructor, we generate a new f-function and call it inside
<code>S</code>:</p><div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = S(f1(v1));</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>f1(v1) = ...;</span></code></pre></div><p>According to the graph, the body of <code>f1</code> should be
<code>add(v1, 2)</code>, but since now <code>add</code> stands for
<code>g1</code>, the body will be <code>g1(v1)</code>:</p><div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = S(f1(v1));</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>f1(v1) = g1(v1);</span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>f1</code> is redundant, we can inline it as follows:</p><div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a>g1(Z) = 2;</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a>g1(S(v1)) = S(g1(v1));</span></code></pre></div><p>This is the final residual <em>program</em>; the residual
<em>expression</em> will be <code>g1(a)</code>, since <code>a</code> is
the only free variable from the initial expression. As you can see, the
definition of <code>g1</code> is simpler than the original function
<code>add</code> in the sense that it accepts only one argument; the
second argument has been specialized to <code>2</code> during
supercompilation.</p><p>Perhaps a more interesting example would be specializing an
interpreter to a concrete program, obtaining a compiled “executable”. In
the partial computation literature, this is called the <em>first
Futamura projection</em> <a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p><p>Consider the following interpreter <code>eq</code> (also from <a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>):</p><div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a>eq(Z, y) = eqZ(y);</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>eq(S(x), y) = eqS(y, x);</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>eqZ(Z) = True;</span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>eqZ(S(x)) = False;</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a>eqS(Z, x) = False;</span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>eqS(S(y), x) = eq(x, y);</span></code></pre></div><p>which compares two Peano numbers for equality, resulting in either
<code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p><p>Now consider the expression <code>eq(S(S(Z)), x)</code> with the
above definition of <code>eq</code>; supercompilation will produce the
following residual program:</p><div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><a href="#cb8-1"></a>eqZ3(Z) = True;</span>
<span id="cb8-2"><a href="#cb8-2"></a>eqZ3(S(v)) = False;</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><a href="#cb8-3"></a>eqS2(Z) = False;</span>
<span id="cb8-4"><a href="#cb8-4"></a>eqS2(S(v)) = eqZ3(v);</span>
<span id="cb8-5"><a href="#cb8-5"></a>eqS1(Z) = False;</span>
<span id="cb8-6"><a href="#cb8-6"></a>eqS1(S(v)) = eqS2(v);</span></code></pre></div><p>together with the residual expression <code>eqS1(x)</code>. In a
sense, we have obtained a compiled version of <code>eq</code>
specialized to <code>S(S(Z))</code>, because <code>eqS1</code>
pattern-matches only on an unknown variable <code>x</code> instead of
the known “program” <code>S(S(Z))</code>.</p><p>However, supercompilation is inherently more powerful than classical
partial evaluation. In Turchin’s own words <a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>:</p><blockquote>
<p>Although supercompilation includes partial evaluation, it does not
reduce to it. Supercompilation can lead to a very deep structural
transformation of the original program; it can improve the program even
if all the actual parameters in the function calls are variable. The
supercompilation process aims at the reduction of redundancy in the
original program, but this redundancy does not necessarily come from
fixed values of variables; it can result from nested loops, repeated
variables, and so on.</p>
</blockquote><p>That being said, a <a href="https://twitter.com/hirrolot/status/1741049231656280289">sufficiently
smart supercompiler</a> can transform a two-pass list mapping into a
single-pass algorithm, essentially performing <em>list fusion</em>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/list-fusion.jpeg"></p><p>A similar example can be found in <em>“Rethinking

elimination</h2></a><p>Not let us consider how SAT can be reduced to the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead-code_elimination">dead code
elimination</a>.</p><p>Consider a language whose expressions are:</p><ul>
<li><code>If (x, m, n)</code>, where <code>x</code> is a variable,
<code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are expressions.</li>
<li><code>T</code> and <code>F</code>, which are constants.</li>
</ul><p>This language is enough to encode any SAT problem. We can encode each
clause in the formula as follows (in pseudocode):</p><div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><a href="#cb9-1"></a>OR(x, ...) = If (x, T, ...);</span>
<span id="cb9-2"><a href="#cb9-2"></a>OR(NOT x, ...) = If (x, ..., T);</span></code></pre></div><p>Then <code>OR(x, OR(y, OR(NOT z, F)))</code> would correspond to “x
OR y OR NOT z”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-x-y-not-z.png" width="550px"></p><p>Now consider the encoding of a conjunction of clauses <a href="#fn16" id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>:</p><div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1"></a>AND(If(x, m, n), ...) = If(x, AND(m, ...), AND(n, ...));</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2"></a>AND(T, ...) = ...;</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3"></a>AND(F, ...) = F;</span></code></pre></div><p>Then <code>AND(OR(x, F), AND(OR(NOT y, F), T))</code> would
correspond to “x AND NOT y”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/x-and-not-y.png" width="550px"></p><p>Is the formula satisfiable? Yes, because we can assign <code>x</code>
to <code>T</code> and <code>y</code> to <code>F</code>.</p><p>Now consider the formula
<code>AND(OR(x, F), AND(OR(NOT x, F), T))</code>, which is equivalent to
“x AND NOT x”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/x-and-not-x.png" width="550px"></p><p>Is the formula satisfiable? To figure out, let us remove <em>dead
paths</em> from the formula:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-x-f-f.png" width="550px"></p><p>We have replaced the lower <code>if x</code> node with its first
child <code>F</code> because <code>x</code> was already assigned
<code>T</code> in this path. Since there are no <code>T</code> leafs in
the resulting tree, it is correct to say that the formula is
unsatisfiable: with any value of <code>x</code> we will arrive at
<code>F</code>.</p><p>One more example is
<code>AND(OR(x, F), AND(OR(x, OR(y, F)), AND(OR(NOT x, F), T)))</code>,
which is equivalent to “x AND (y OR z) AND NOT x”:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-last-example.png" width="600px"></p><p>After removing dead paths:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-last-example-final.png" width="600px"></p><p>The general observation is that, after encoding a CNF formula as an
if-tree and removing dead paths from it, if there is at least one
<code>T</code> leaf, the initial formula is satisfiable; otherwise, the
formula is unsatisfiable because there is no path from the root that
will take us to <code>T</code>. Think about it for a moment.</p><p>Having this technique at our disposal, we can proceed to the key
section.</p><a href="#supercompilation-of-sat"></a><p><em>Positive supercompilation</em> is a particular model of
supercompilation that propagates only <em>positive information</em> when
doing case analysis. For example, when supercompiling
<code>add(a, 2)</code>, a positive supercompiler will substitute (i.e.,
propagate) <code>a=Z</code> and <code>a=S(v1)</code> to the respective
children nodes. On the other hand, <em>negative information</em> means
that some variable is <em>not</em> equal to a particular value (or
values); a typical example is the “default” case in a pattern-matching
construction. A <em>perfect supercompiler</em> is a supercompiler that
is able to propagate both positive and negative information.</p><p>In this post, we only deal with positive supercompilation. Consider
the schematic representation of the CNF formula “x AND NOT x” again:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/x-and-not-x.png" width="550px"></p><p>Imagine that <code>if</code>, <code>T</code>, and <code>F</code> are
SLL constructors, with <code>if</code> holding three arguments: two
branches and a variable, which is <code>T</code> in the first branch and
<code>F</code> in the second. If we analyze the uppermost
<code>if x</code>, we will get the following “process tree” <a href="#fn17" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>:</p><p><img src="https://hirrolot.github.io/media/sat-supercompilation/if-x-f-f.png" width="550px"></p><p>Supercompilation acted as a dead code eliminator! This is because
<code>x=T</code> was propagated to the first branch of the uppermost
<code>if x</code>, resulting in the elimination of the branch
<code>T</code> of the innermost <code>if x</code>. The second uppermost
branch remains unchanged.</p><p>What if we somehow launch analysis of the whole if-tree? If so, we
would essentially eliminate all dead paths from the corresponding
expression, which is equivalent to solving the SAT problem! As I have
mentioned in the previous section, if there is at least one
<code>T</code> leaf in the final tree, the formula is satisfiable
because this <code>T</code> is reachable from the root. Otherwise (if
there is no <code>T</code>), the formula is unsatisfiable <a href="#fn18" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>.</p><p>Here is a complete SAT solver written in SLL:</p><div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1"></a>or(Var(x), rest) = If(x, T, rest);</span>

SAT problem with only 10 lines of code in SLL.</p><p>There are several theoretical and practical consequences of this
discovery:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Theoretically,</strong> this means that a positive
supercompiler can solve SAT “automatically” – possibly mixed with a
number of other optimizations and code transformations. In other words,
it is possible that supercompilation can optimize your code based on the
knowledge of a solution to a particular SAT problem.
<ul>
<li>A direct consequence of this is that supercompiling a particular
task can have exponential time and space complexity. This is both good
and bad: the good part is that supercompilation is very smart, and the
bad part is that it can be <em>too smart</em> to serve as a predictable
code optimizer.</li>
<li>Since it is generally believed that there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem">no
polynomial-time algorithm</a> to solve SAT, positive supercompilation is
also likely not to have it.</li>
<li>Since SAT is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-complete
problem</a>, meaning that it is at least as hard as any other problem in
NP, supercompilation is also at least as hard as any other problem in
NP. In other words, supercompilation has enough expressive power to
solve any NP problem <em>during the process</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Practically,</strong> using naive supercompilation as an
optimization pass would not be a good idea. However, since
supercompilation is a general method rather than a particular algorithm,
it should always be possible to restrict the expressive power of a
<em>particular</em> supercompiler to make it more predictable – albeit
less smart. See the technique of <em>speculative supercompilation</em>
from <a href="#fn19" id="fnref19" role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>.
<ul>
<li>The SLL solver demonstrated in the previous section can serve as a
good stress test for a practical supercompiler.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Although the idea of supercompilation dates back to the 1970’s,
developing an industrial supercompiler is still an open problem.</p><p>If you find the post interesting, please share your thoughts in the

Ideally you would be willing to grow into a leadership position over time, but it isn't strictly required, right now our focus is on looking for someone with a strong technical background.</p><p>The frontend is built on Angular/AWS.</p><p>Contact us at info [at] mindmonopol [dot] de, the email address goes to the inbox of Markus, tell him you're coming from Leo.

Manifesto
Manufacturing is important. It’s the fundamental industry on which everything else is built. We take it for granted. In 1989, 35% of the entire software industry was manufacturing systems. Back then, services, hand holding, customization, and consulting were necessary to get the systems to where they are today. What was the first massive burst in productivity from technology has stagnated into incremental diminishing returns and exponentially increasing complexity. We can only continue to add complexity for so much longer until the whole system collapses.
"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex. It takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction."
Manufacturing is important. We must deliver a touch of technological genius to reintroduce simplicity, efficiency, and integration.

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.</p><p>How can this be, and how can we change it?</p><p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.</p><p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.</p><p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?</p><p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.</p><p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them.

Our technology lets first responders get eyes and ears on what's happening in indoor structures when it's too dangerous for people to enter - whether it be a fire, medical emergency, violence, or search and rescue. In March 2023, we released the Lemur 2, our latest and most advanced drone, and we started shipping it to customers the same year.</p><p>In addition to launching more advanced drones, we're also expanding our software ecosystem into realtime monitoring and fleet management, and we recently shipped the first version of our first web app: LiveOps.  This app gives drone operators and first response teams access to real-time live-streaming drone data such as visual and thermal video feeds, 3D map data via point clouds, and a myriad of drone telemetry – it’s essentially a web-based drone fleet management software. But our vision isn’t just fleet management; LiveOps represents a critical part of BRINC’s transition from a company that just sells drones to a company that sells entire drone programs: we want to build out the entire drone ecosystem (both hardware and software) for our customers.</p><p>It’s an ambitious goal, but it’s one that we feel confident about – we’ve got a lot of interest from customers in what we’ve built so far, and we are seeking both a full-stack and a backend/platform engineer to join our engineering team and own the development of this web app and cloud ecosystem.</p><p>Job Postings:</p><p>- Senior/Principal Full-stack Engineer: <a href="https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f82f3d388d?rs=42706078" rel="nofollow">https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/a567bc8a-9d90-4961-9e30-e5f...</a></p><p>- Senior/Principal Backend &amp; Platform Engineer: <a href="https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5c5d97e904?rs=42706078" rel="nofollow">https://app.dover.io/apply/brinc/5aa2526c-472c-49b1-a1cf-8c5...</a></p><p>Some recent press:</p><p>- <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-with-the-23-year-old-founder-who-landed-openais-ceo-as-an-investor/" rel="nofollow">https://www.geekwire.com/2023/inside-drone-startup-brinc-wit...</a></p><p>- <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/" rel="nofollow">https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/02/brinc-lemur-2/</a></p><p>I'm the founding engineer for the cloud services engineering team at BRINC, so feel free to relay any questions about the role to me (dylan at brinc drones dot com, parse it yourself), but please apply through the job posting if you're interested in the role so that we can keep track of you!
