<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Throughout history, advancements in information abstraction and retrieval have driven human progress. From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation.&nbsp;</p>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately&nbsp;<a href="https://resources.data.gov/glossary/unstructured-data/">90%</a> of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing <a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/document/">Mistral OCR</a>. </p><p>Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API <em>mistral-ocr-latest</em> at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite&nbsp;<a href="http://console.mistral.ai/">la Plateforme</a>, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The U.K. government appears to have quietly scrubbed encryption advice from government web pages, just weeks after demanding backdoor access to encrypted data stored on Apple’s cloud storage service, iCloud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The change was spotted by security expert Alec Muffett, who wrote in <a href="https://alecmuffett.com/article/112522" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post on Wednesday</a> that the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is no longer recommending that high-risk individuals use encryption to protect their sensitive information.</p>







<p>The NCSC in October published a document titled “Cybersecurity tips for barristers, solicitors &amp; legal professionals,” that advised the use of encryption tools such as Apple’s Advanced Data Protection (ADP).&nbsp;</p>

<p>ADP allows users to turn on end-to-end encryption for their iCloud backups, effectively making it impossible for anyone, including Apple and government authorities, to view data stored on iCloud.</p>

<p>The URL hosting the NCSC document now redirects to a <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/defending-democracy/guidance-for-high-risk-individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">different page</a> that makes no mention of encryption or ADP. Instead, it recommends that at-risk individuals use Apple’s Lockdown Mode, an “extreme” security tool that restricts access to certain functions and features.</p>

<p>Muffett reports that the original document, still accessible via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241102140713/https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Cyber-security-tips-for-barristers.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Wayback Machine</a>, has been “wholesale deleted from the internet.” TechCrunch wasn’t able to find any encryption advice on the U.K. government’s website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The U.K. Home Office and NCSC did not respond to TechCrunch’s questions.</p>


<p>The removal of the encryption advice comes weeks after the U.K. government <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-demands-apple-backdoor-to-encrypted-cloud-data-report/">secretly ordered Apple to build a backdoor</a> that would give authorities access to users’ encrypted iCloud data. </p>

<p>Following the order, first reported by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Washington Post</a>, Apple pulled its ADP feature in the U.K., and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-icloud-end-to-end-encryption-feature-for-uk-users-after-government-demanded-backdoor/">confirmed</a> to TechCrunch that the feature will no longer be made available to new users in the U.K., and its current users would eventually need to disable it.</p>

<p>Apple is <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-demands-apple-backdoor-to-encrypted-cloud-data-report/">challenging</a> the U.K.’s data access order in the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3d8fe709-f17a-44a6-97ae-f1bbe6d0dccd?shareType=nongift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Financial Times</a> reported this week.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>The Voyager spacecraft have been cruising through interstellar space for more than 47 years, collecting precious data on the vast cosmos. All that traveling has taken a toll on the farthest human-made objects, and the spacecraft’s days are numbered. NASA engineers are resorting to shutting off science instruments on both Voyager probes to keep&nbsp;the two iconic missions alive.</p> <p>Mission engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory turned off Voyager 1’s cosmic ray subsystem experiment on February 25, and will shut off the low-energy charged particle instrument aboard Voyager 2 on March 24, NASA <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-turns-off-two-voyager-science-instruments-to-extend-mission/">announced</a> Wednesday. If it weren’t for these energy-conserving measures, the twin probes may have had a few more months left before running out of power. Both spacecraft now have enough power to operate for another year or so before engineers are forced to turn off two more instruments. It’s a grim reality for the popular interstellar travelers, who have suffered from a<a href="https://gizmodo.com/nasa-voyager-probe-making-sense-months-gibberish-1851427197"> fair share of glitches in the past couple of years</a>.</p> <p>“The Voyagers have been deep space rock stars since launch, and we want to keep it that way as long as possible,” Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at JPL, said in a statement. “But electrical power is running low. If we don’t turn off an instrument on each Voyager now, they would probably have only a few more months of power before we would need to declare end of mission.”</p> <p>The Voyagers are powered by heat from decaying plutonium, which is converted into electricity. Each year, the aging spacecraft lose about 4 watts of power. In an effort to conserve power, the mission team has turned off any systems that were deemed unnecessary to keep the missions going, including a few of the science instruments. Each Voyager spacecraft started off with 10 science instruments when they launched in 1977, but are now left with just three each.</p> <p>Some of the instruments were necessary to collect data during planetary flybys. Those instruments, however, were turned off as soon as both spacecraft completed their exploration of the solar system’s planets. Voyager 1 reached the beginning of interstellar space in 2012, while Voyager 2 reached the boundary in 2018, traveling beyond the protective bubble surrounding the solar system that is known as the heliosphere.</p>

 <p>The Voyager spacecraft were then left with instruments designed to study the solar system’s heliosphere and interstellar space. In October 2024, the team decided to turn off Voyager 2’s plasma science instrument, which measured the amount of electrically charged atoms, in an effort to conserve power.</p> <p>Voyager 1’s cosmic ray subsystem, which was shut down last week, is a suite of three telescopes designed to study cosmic rays by measuring their energy and flux. The data collected by those telescopes helped the Voyager team determine when and where Voyager 1 exited the heliosphere, according to NASA. Voyager 2’s low-energy charged particle instrument, which is scheduled for deactivation later this month, measures the various ions, electrons, and cosmic rays originating from our solar system and galaxy.</p>

 <p>Voyager 1 still has its magnetometer and plasma wave subsystem, and its low-energy charged particle instrument will be shut off next year. Voyager 2 will continue to collect data through its magnetic field and plasma wave instruments, while its cosmic ray subsystem is scheduled to be shut off in 2026.</p> <p>“The Voyager spacecraft have far surpassed their original mission to study the outer planets,” Patrick Koehn, Voyager program scientist, said in a statement. “Every bit of additional data we have gathered since then is not only valuable bonus science for heliophysics, but also a testament to the exemplary engineering that has gone into the Voyagers — starting nearly 50 years ago and continuing to this day.”</p> <p>Voyager 1 launched on September 5, 1977, less than a month after its twin probe, Voyager 2, began its journey to space. The spacecraft took a faster route, exiting the asteroid belt earlier than its twin, and making close encounters with Jupiter and Saturn, where it discovered two Jovian moons, Thebe and Metis, and five new moons, and a new ring called the G-ring, around Saturn. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, on a trajectory toward the solar system’s gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, and explored the icy giants Uranus and Neptune.</p>

 <p>Voyager 1 is more than 15 billion miles (25 billion kilometers) away from Earth, while Voyager 2 is over 13 billion miles (21 billion kilometers) away.</p> <p>With the current energy-conserving plan, NASA engineers believe the twin spacecraft could continue operating into the 2030s with one instrument each. “Every minute of every day, the Voyagers explore a region where no spacecraft has gone before,” Linda Spilker, Voyager project scientist at JPL, said in a statement. “That also means every day could be our last.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Math solutions can be found in surprising places, including the dark realms of the Internet. In 2011 an anonymous poster on the now infamously controversial image board 4chan posed a mathematical puzzle about the cult classic anime series <i>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</i>. Though the bulletin board has become littered with hateful, violent and extreme content, that original post led to a solution to the sophisticated math problem.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">The first season of this anime series consists of 14 episodes that were designed so that you can watch them in any order you like. (For people who are as unfamiliar with the anime world as I am: an eight-part live-action thriller called <i>Kaleidoscope</i> on Netflix follows the same principle.) At some point in a 2011 discussion of the series on 4chan, someone asked the minimum number of episodes they would have to watch to have seen it in every possible order.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In fact, this question is related to so-called superpermutations. And as it turns out, this mathematical area holds many puzzles: to this day, mathematicians are still unable to fully answer the problem that the 4chan user had posed.</p><hr><h2>On supporting science journalism</h2><p>If you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism by<!-- --> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/">subscribing</a>.

Please look it over for any loopholes I might have missed,” wrote the user, who explained in several steps how they arrived at their estimate. Other users then took up the arguments and discussed them—but outside of 4chan, none of this made any waves. No one seemed to take any notice.</p><h2 id="extreme-binge-watching" data-block="sciam/heading">Extreme Binge-Watching</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In mathematics, two objects permutate when they are rearranged or recombined. For example, you can permutate AB to BA. If an anime series consisted of only two parts, you could either watch the first and then the second episode (1-2) or the second and then the first (2-1).</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">If you want to watch a series in multiple arrangements—perhaps to figure out which sequence of episodes makes the most sense—you need a superpermutation. This is a sequence of all possible permutations. Imagine a marathon showing where you watch the first episode, followed by the second, and then watch the second episode, followed by the first (1-2-2-1). To avoid watching the second episode twice in a row, a shorter superpermutation would be 1-2-1; you would only have to watch three episodes to still have every possible order covered.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">If a series consists of three episodes, it becomes a little trickier to find the shortest superpermutation. In this case, there are 3! = 6 different sequences: 1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-3-1, 2-1-3, 3-1-2, 3-2-1. Fortunately, you don’t have to watch 3 × 6 = 18 parts but can find a clever shortcut, in this case: 1-2-3-1-2-1-3-2-1. That order contains all possible permutations of the numbers 1, 2 and 3, but you only have to watch nine episodes!</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Mathematicians have also calculated the shortest superpermutations for a series consisting of <i>n</i> = 4 and <i>n</i> = 5 episodes (33 and 153 episodes, respectively). Beyond that, however, they are in the dark. The shortest superpermutations for <i>n</i> &gt; 5 are not known.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In fact, the challenge relates to one of the most intractable problems in algorithmics: <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-math-mystery-that-connects-sudoku-flight-schedules-and-protein-folding/">the traveling salesperson problem</a>. In this problem, a person wants to visit different cities and end up back in their hometown. The task is to find the shortest route that connects all the cities. The shortest superpermutation is a variation of this problem in which the individual permutations represent different cities. In this case, you assign different distances between cities by determining the overlap of the permutations. For example, cities 1-2-3 and 2-3-1 have a large overlap: the last two digits of the first permutation match the first two digits of the second, so they can be combined to form 1-2-3-1. We can therefore assign a short distance between those two cities. On the other hand, 1-2-3 and 2-1-3 do not overlap. (To see both sequences, you have to look at a full six parts; no shortcut is possible.) Thus, these cities have a large distance between them.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">To find the shortest route within permutations, you connect the permutations that overlap the most. There is only one difficulty: there is no known algorithm that solves the traveling salesperson problem quickly. If we are dealing with a few cities—or, in the case of an anime series, a few episodes—this is not a major drawback. But as soon as the <i>n</i> becomes large, computers fail at the task because the computing time grows exponentially with <i>n</i>.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Computers are able to calculate superpermutations for <i>n</i> = 4 and <i>n</i> = 5 but not for anything beyond that. And although it is possible to calculate elaborate superpermutations for larger numbers, finding the shortest superpermutation becomes more difficult.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Experts must therefore make do with estimates. For example, there is an algorithm that helps estimate the length of the shortest possible superpermutation for <i>n</i> objects: 1! + 2! + 3! + ... + <i>n</i>! Using that algorithm, if <i>n</i> = 2, you get a superpermutation of length 1 + 2 = 3. For <i>n</i> = 3, this results in a length of 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. For <i>n</i> = 4, you get 33. And for <i>n</i> = 5, you get 153, which corresponds to the shortest superpermutation in each case.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">For larger <i>n,</i> however, this algorithm no longer applies: computers have been able to find shorter superpermutations than it would suggest exists. In fact, the formula 1! + 2! + 3! + ... + <i>n</i>! massively overestimates the length of the shortest superpermutation for large <i>n</i>. Although the algorithm offers only an approximate answer, mathematicians use it as a starting place, with the goal of narrowing down options to find more precise answers.</p><h2 id="coincidences-and-rediscoveries" data-block="sciam/heading">Coincidences and Rediscoveries</h2><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In 2013 Nathaniel Johnston, now a mathematics professor at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, landed on a <i>Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</i> fandom page. Johnston himself was not an anime fan. He had arrived at the site after Googling some search terms related to superpermutations. There he came across the discussion that had been held on 4chan almost two years earlier, which a user had copied to the fandom site.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Johnston didn’t bother doing the math <a href="http://www.njohnston.ca/2013/04/the-minimal-superpermutation-problem/">but cited the fandom post on his blog</a>. This comment, too, went unnoticed for several years.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Then in October 2018 mathematician Robin Houston came across his colleague’s blog post through a curious coincidence. Houston had just learned that Australian science fiction author Greg Egan had found a new <i>maximum </i>length for the shortest superpermutations, expressed as:</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><i>n</i>! +(<i>n</i> –1)! + (<i>n</i> – 2)! + (<i>n</i> – 3)! + <i>n </i>– 3</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">That in itself was bizarre. But when Houston started learning more about this result, he realized that the minimum length of a superpermutation had been given a new value by an anonymous anime fandom user (he didn’t know about the origins on 4chan at that time). The formula for the minimum length is:</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph"><i>n</i>! +(<i>n</i> – 1)! + (<i>n</i> – 2)! + <i>n</i> – 3</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Houston shared <a href="https://x.com/robinhouston/status/1054637891085918209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1054637891085918209%7Ctwgr%5Eaa026a45fed15b42edf702c30c79bae8cc6e60c7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spektrum.de%2Fkolumne%2Fsuperpermutation-und-anime-4chan-user-gelingt-mathematischer-beweis%2F2251925">his discovery on Twitter</a> (now X) on October 23 of that year. “A curious situation. The best known lower bound for the minimal length of superpermutations was proven by an anonymous user of a wiki mainly devoted to anime,” he wrote.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Along with his colleagues, mathematicians Jay Pantone and Vince Vatter, Houston decided to check the 4chan user’s proof and write it down in a mathematical way. <a href="https://oeis.org/A180632/a180632.pdf">The researchers posted their mathematical work</a> to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences that same month, and the first author is listed as “Anonymous 4chan Poster.”</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">So what do these formulas tell us? If you want to watch all episodes of an <i>n</i>-part series in all possible combinations, you must sit through at least <i>n</i>! +(<i>n </i>– 1)! + (<i>n</i> – 2)! + <i>n</i> – 3 episodes—that’s the 4chan user’s contribution—and at most <i>n</i>! +(<i>n</i> – 1)! + (<i>n</i> – 2)! + (<i>n</i> – 3)! + <i>n</i> – 3, which we know through Egan’s work.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">In the case of the eight-episode series <i>Kaleidoscope,</i> you would have to watch at least 46,085 and, at most, 46,205 episodes. For <i>The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, </i>or <i>Haruhi,</i> with 14 episodes, the number increases drastically: a minimum of 93,884,313,611 episodes and a maximum of 93,924,230,411. Recall that this is not a complete solution—it’s just setting a range for the size of a superpermutation that would allow you to efficiently watch the series in every possible order.</p><p data-block="sciam/paragraph">Fortunately, Egan also provided an algorithm for constructing the corresponding superpermutation. This allows <i>Haruhi</i> fans to work out the best viewing order of episodes. But with an average episode length of around 24 minutes, it would take about 4 million years to sit through this superpermutation.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p dir="auto">CodeTracer is a user-friendly time-traveling debugger designed to support a wide range of programming languages.</p>
<p dir="auto">It records the execution of a program into a sharable self-contained trace file. You can load the produced trace files in a GUI environment that allows you to move forward and backward through the execution and to examine the history of all memory locations. They say a picture is worth a thousand words — well, a video is even better! Watch the demo below to see CodeTracer in action:</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZsJ55JVqmU" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/579ce66477a6c9253101d6ac952c56903dcf4b4aff5b14c83a3503d1f95eb61b/68747470733a2f2f696d672e796f75747562652e636f6d2f76692f785a734a35354a56716d552f6d617872657364656661756c742e6a7067" alt="Watch the video" data-canonical-src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/xZsJ55JVqmU/maxresdefault.jpg"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The Benefits of Time-Travel</h2><a id="user-content-the-benefits-of-time-travel" aria-label="Permalink: The Benefits of Time-Travel" href="#the-benefits-of-time-travel"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Compared to traditional debuggers, CodeTracer gives you two major superpowers:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Once you capture a bug in a recording, consider it squashed!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">Bugs that are hard to reproduce can be painful to fix — you’ve surely been there. Once such a bug is captured with CodeTracer, you'll rarely need more than 30 minutes to track it down! This is largely a consequence of the next superpower:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Most bugs are easily revealed when you know the origin of any value in the program.</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">All programs produce output. Some examples are bytes generated as a response to a web request, pixels being drawn on your screen or perhaps a simple log line written to the terminal.</p>
<p dir="auto">When CodeTracer creates a recording, it captures a user-extensible set of output events relevant to the program. The GUI displays these events in a searchable chronological event log.</p>
<p dir="auto">Consider a misbehaving program that prints unexpected output to a log file midway through its execution. Clicking on the specific output event in CodeTracer will take you to the precise moment and code line where it was generated.</p>
<p dir="auto">The unexpected value must be originating from some variable that's being passed to the logging function. With CodeTracer, you can now ask the question "Where did this value come from?". CodeTracer will find another moment in the execution, potentially multiple seconds earlier, in a completely different part of the program where this particular memory location was last written to.</p>
<p dir="auto">This could be memory corruption or a genuine logical error. Either way, CodeTracer will report the origin. Let's say that you end up in the correct function that is responsible for computing the problematic value, but another input there leads to the issue. You can continue the search by repeating the question "Where did this input come from"? It usually takes just a few of these jumps to earlier moments in time to arrive at the root cause for the bug.</p>
<p dir="auto">Every time you jump to a new moment in the execution, you can fearlessly explore your surroundings by stepping forward or backwards, having access to a back button that can always get you to any previous point of interest. At every point of the journey, our novel UI shows you details about the past and future program states at a glance and you know your position in the precisely recorded call trace of the program.</p>
<p dir="auto">These features combined, make for a truly powerful debugging experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Current state of the project and 2025 roadmap</h2><a id="user-content-current-state-of-the-project-and-2025-roadmap" aria-label="Permalink: Current state of the project and 2025 roadmap" href="#current-state-of-the-project-and-2025-roadmap"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The initial release of CodeTracer supports the Noir programming language. It has been developed in collaboration with the Blocksense team and currently requires the use of the <a href="https://github.com/blocksense-network/noir">Blocksense Noir Compiler</a>, which is included in the CodeTracer distribution.</p>
<p dir="auto">CodeTracer’s open-source development is made possible by the generous support of Aztec Network, Arbitrum Foundation, and Aptos Foundation. During 2025, CodeTracer will evolve into a comprehensive Web3 development toolkit by gaining support for many additional smart contract and zero-knowledge programming languages. Most of its functionality will be packaged into reusable libraries that will power the creation of block explorers with advanced transaction tracing capabilities and omniscient debugging plugins for Visual Studio Code and other IDEs.</p>
<p dir="auto">CodeTracer uses an <a href="https://github.com/metacraft-labs/runtime_tracing">open format</a> for its trace files and we've started several community-driven projects which aim to add support for other programming languages:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://github.com/metacraft-labs/codetracer-ruby-recorder">Ruby</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/metacraft-labs/codetracer-python-recorder">Python</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Metacraft Labs is also developing an alternative back-end, capable of working with <a href="https://rr-project.org/" rel="nofollow">RR</a> recordings, which will make CodeTracer suitable for debugging large-scale programs in a variety of system programming languages such as C/C++, Rust, Nim, D, Zig, Go, Fortran and FreePascal.</p>

<p dir="auto">Once you have time travel, you can re-imagine how a debugger works from the ground up! Here are some of the features of CodeTracer that set it apart from traditional debuggers:</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Omniscience</h3><a id="user-content-omniscience" aria-label="Permalink: Omniscience" href="#omniscience"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When CodeTracer breaks at a certain line of code, it knows not only the past but also the future. You can immediately see the values of all variables in the current function right next to the source code. This includes variables in loops where you can easily scroll through the iterations. Taken code branches are highlighted, while the non-executed code is immediately grayed out.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tracepoints</h3><a id="user-content-tracepoints" aria-label="Permalink: Tracepoints" href="#tracepoints"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Many developers tend to transition from using interactive debugging early on in their careers, to mostly relying on carefully placed print statements as they start to face harder problems in distributed and real-time systems.</p>
<p dir="auto">CodeTracer gives you the best of both worlds. A tracepoint allows you to see the effects of adding additional code to your program, without recompiling and rerecording it.</p>
<p dir="auto">The added code can feature if statements, additional function calls and various ways to print or plot the captured data. The output is typically produced in seconds.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Call Trace</h3><a id="user-content-call-trace" aria-label="Permalink: Call Trace" href="#call-trace"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Instead of a stack trace limited to a single moment in time, CodeTracer shows you the entire tree of function calls in the recorded execution. You can navigate and filter it in various ways and the clever collapsing and expanding algorithms still allow you to obtain a classic stack trace whenever you need it.</p>

<p dir="auto">Every variable in CodeTracer has a history. You can see all the values that the variable held during the entire execution of the program and for each of them you can jump to the originating expression that computed it. CodeTracer follows the path of trivial copies in assignments to save you extra time when tracking down more convoluted bugs.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Event Log</h3><a id="user-content-event-log" aria-label="Permalink: Event Log" href="#event-log"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The event log gives you a chronological view over anything of interest in your program, interleaved with the tracepoint outputs. Clicking on any event takes you to the precise moment in time when it was produced, which gives you excellent starting points for your investigations. Tracking down the origins of anomalous events and program states through the history of the involved variables is the essence of debugging with CodeTracer.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e120a36e9623ec73ba08a9237a0fe7c89d893d3d9cca24558491b7e61efeda6/68747470733a2f2f646f776e6c6f6164732e636f64657472616365722e636f6d2f666561747572652d686967686c69676874732f6576656e746c6f672e77656270"><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/4e120a36e9623ec73ba08a9237a0fe7c89d893d3d9cca24558491b7e61efeda6/68747470733a2f2f646f776e6c6f6164732e636f64657472616365722e636f6d2f666561747572652d686967686c69676874732f6576656e746c6f672e77656270" alt="eventlog" title="eventlog" data-canonical-src="https://downloads.codetracer.com/feature-highlights/eventlog.webp"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Terminal Output</h3><a id="user-content-terminal-output" aria-label="Permalink: Terminal Output" href="#terminal-output"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The terminal output panel renders the recorded <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code> events like a standard terminal. Clicking anywhere in the output takes you to the exact moment when the specific character was generated. This allows for a fallback to a more traditional print-style debugging when the expressivity of tracepoints is not sufficient. In the future, CodeTracer will allow you to slide through the states of the terminal through time which will help for debugging highly interactive TUI apps.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Mouse Stepping</h3><a id="user-content-mouse-stepping" aria-label="Permalink: Mouse Stepping" href="#mouse-stepping"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Since CodeTracer is aware of all past and future control flow, it offers some convenient shortcuts for quickly navigating the program execution by interacting with its source code:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Jump to a line: Middle-click on any undimmed line in the current function to quickly step to it. If you use a mouse without a middle button, you can achieve the same with <code>Ctrl+Click</code> or by pressing <code>Ctrl+F8</code>(as a special kind of <code>continue</code>) after navigating to the respective line with your keyboard.</li>
<li>Jump into a call: Double middle-click on the function name in a call expression to jump into it. If you use a mouse without a middle button, you can achieve the same with <code>Ctrl+Alt+Click</code> or by pressing <code>Ctrl+F11</code>(as a special kind of <code>step-in</code>) after navigating to the respective call expression with your keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Explore the right-click context menu for additional operations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scratchpad</h3><a id="user-content-scratchpad" aria-label="Permalink: Scratchpad" href="#scratchpad"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The scratchpad provides a play area where you can pin values from different locations and moments in time. You can explore their differences both manually and algorithmically to gain quick insights into the behavior of your program.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">The CodeTracer CLI</h3><a id="user-content-the-codetracer-cli" aria-label="Permalink: The CodeTracer CLI" href="#the-codetracer-cli"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">When you launch the CodeTracer GUI, it will offer you the option to also install the CodeTracer CLI. It provides convenient ways to create and load trace files from the command-line or to integrate CodeTracer with CI processes.</p>
<p dir="auto">Run <code>ct --help</code> to see the full list of supported subcommands, but the most commonly used ones are the following:</p>
<p dir="auto"><code>&lt;application&gt;</code> can be a source file or a project folder (depending on the language):</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><code>ct run &lt;application&gt;</code> - Creates a recording and load it in CodeTracer with a single command.</li>
<li><code>ct record &lt;application&gt;</code> - Creates a trace file that can be loaded later or shared.</li>
<li><code>ct replay</code> - Launches the CodeTracer GUI with a previously recorded trace file. Common usages are:
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>ct replay</code> - Opens a simple console-based dialog to choose what recording you want to replay.</li>
<li><code>ct replay &lt;program-name&gt;</code> - Opens the last trace of an application.</li>
<li><code>ct replay --id=&lt;trace-id&gt;</code> - Opens a trace by its trace id.</li>
<li><code>ct replay --trace-folde=&lt;trace-folder&gt;</code> - Opens a trace by its trace folder.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ct</code> - Launches the startup screen of the CodeTracer GUI.</li>
<li><code>ct help / ct --help</code> - Gives you a help message.</li>
<li><code>ct version</code> - Returns the current version of CodeTracer.</li>
</ol>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><a id="user-content-keyboard-shortcuts" aria-label="Permalink: Keyboard Shortcuts" href="#keyboard-shortcuts"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">You can learn all CodeTracer keyboard shortcuts by examining the main menu and the tooltips over all buttons in the interface.
The default configuration should be familiar to users experienced with Microsoft Visual Studio™.</p>
<p dir="auto">Since CodeTracer provides a reverse counterpart to most traditional debugging operations, we typically use the <code>Shift</code> modifier to indicate this (e.g. <code>F10</code> is "Next Step" while <code>Shift+F10</code> is "Previous Step").</p>
<p dir="auto">The user config file located at <code>~/.config/codetracer/.config.yml</code> allows you to specify custom shortcuts for all operations.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Building from source</h2><a id="user-content-building-from-source" aria-label="Permalink: Building from source" href="#building-from-source"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Metacraft Labs team is using <a href="https://nixos.org/" rel="nofollow">Nix</a> to define a reproducible development environment for working on CodeTracer. Linux is our primary development platform, while some of our team members use macOS. Building on Windows will be supported in the near future.</p>
<p dir="auto">To enter the Nix development environment, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install/" rel="nofollow">Install Nix</a>.</li>
<li>Clone this repository.</li>
<li>At the repository root, execute <code>git submodule update --init --recursive</code>.</li>
<li>At the repository root, execute <code>nix develop</code> (or <code>direnv allow</code> for users of <code>direnv</code>).</li>
<li>In the resulting shell, you can build all targets by running <code>just build-once</code> or <code>just build</code> if you intend to make continuous changes to the source code.</li>

<p>All of the kool kids in Twitter land seem to be jumping on the bandwagon of a very annoying craze. Twitter threads. Please stop; write a blog post instead.</p>
<p>As someone who has only really started using Twitter in the last few months (as I much prefer <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@kev">Mastodon</a>) I've noticed that some people love nothing more than a good thread.</p>
<p>I assume it's because these people seem to get a tonne of followers off the back of these threads, thus perpetuating the whole thing and forcing more people onto that bandwagon.</p>
<h2 id="h-what-is-a-twitter-thread">What is a Twitter thread?</h2>
<p>That's a fantastic question, dear reader. Basically, a Twitter thread is a collection of single Tweets that collectively make one story. It's common to have 10 or more Tweets in a single thread, but some times they get ridiculous.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1449525455988539394">this thread</a> is <strong>50 Tweets long</strong>. Fifty. Tweets. Long!</p>
<figure><img alt="A 50 tweet Twitter thread!" loading="lazy" src="https://kevquirk.com/media/pages/blog/forget-twitter-threads-write-a-blog-post-instead/239c3d6ace-1723205404/50-tweet-thread-example.png"></figure>
<h2 id="h-what-s-my-problem-with-threads">What's my problem with threads?</h2>
<p>Anyone who regularly reads my content will know <a href="https://kevquirk.com/my-history-with-blogging/">I've been blogging for a long time</a>, so I'm always going to be bias. But the issue I really have with these blasted threads boils down to one thing. <strong>Context.</strong></p>
<p>Using the example above, I became aware of it because someone that I follow re-tweeted Tweet number 47 in this ridiculously long thread. Because it was a random Tweet in a very long thread, I (and I imagine most other people reading the tweet) had absolutely no context as to what the whole saga was about.</p>
<h3 id="h-it-isn-t-the-right-platform">It isn't the right platform</h3>
<p>Secondly, Twitter isn't the right platform for long-form content. If it was, it wouldn't have a 280 character limit. It's a micro blogging platform; and as we all know, <em>micro</em> means small.</p>
<p>Surely a much better way of sharing long-form content would be to write a single coherent piece on a blog, then post a link to it on Twitter so your followers can read it in its entirety.</p>
<p>This also has the added benefit of decentralising content away from platforms like Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Kev, not everyone knows how to setup a blog!</p>
<p><cite>Non-bloggers everywhere</cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I get it, most people don't have a blog, but <a href="https://kevquirk.com/how-to-start-a-blog-if-youre-not-a-nerd/">it's super simple</a> to start your one, or use a hosted provider, like <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. So there's no excuse really.</p>
<p>I know some people on Twitter who post threads regularly. Why can't these long-form threads become posts on a blog? It would be easier for people to consume, they can still post it on Twitter, and it has the added benefit of potentially creating a whole new audience for the creator.</p>
<p>I've seen some really interesting threads on Twitter that are full of useful information, but as a consumer of that content, it's a nightmare to follow. Content creators should make content as simple to consume as possible.</p>
<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts</h2>
<p>Maybe I'm just a dinosaur that needs to get with the times. If that's the case, I'll continue to die on this hill. I'd much rather own my content, and provide a coherent, easy to consume experience for my readers. Rather than trying to shoehorn a platform into submission just because it's the cool thing to do, or because it's the content creator's preferred platform.</p>
<p>I've tried posting a couple of Twitter threads myself, but both times I did it I found it awkward and confusing. Honestly, I don't get why people do it. For the likes? For the shares?</p>

Hadoop’s meteoric rise led many organizations to implement it without understanding its complexities, often resulting in underutilized clusters or over-engineered architectures. Iceberg is walking a similar path. The ability to unify batch and streaming workloads, combined with features like schema evolution, has made it an alluring choice. Yet, Iceberg’s adoption often outpaces organizations’ abilities to operationalize it effectively.</p><p id="05a0">The lesson here is timeless: Adoption should be driven by alignment with organizational maturity. Jumping on the Iceberg bandwagon without a clear data strategy can lead to technical debt and unmet expectations. For example, a fintech company might adopt Iceberg for ACID guarantees in their fraud detection pipelines but grapple with compaction strategies because their streaming setup generates too many small files.</p><p id="ac99">Successful Iceberg adoption requires the same care as Hadoop — focusing on skill-building, workload alignment, and incremental integration.</p><h2 id="401a">The Small Files Problem Redux</h2><p id="395d">One of Hadoop’s most infamous pain points was the “small files problem.” HDFS wasn’t designed to handle many small files efficiently, leading to bottlenecks and degraded performance. Organizations often resorted to nightly compaction jobs or elaborate ETL pipelines to aggregate data.</p><p id="f2a4">Iceberg is not immune to this issue. While it abstracts much of the storage layer, small files remain a persistent challenge. For instance, streaming data pipelines or frequent incremental writes can lead to performance degradation due to excessive metadata overhead. Tools like Apache Spark and Flink — commonly used with Iceberg — magnify this issue if not carefully tuned.</p><p id="2511">However, the issues don’t stop there; the small file problem considerably impacts object storage costs (think of the number of requests toward S3), exponential extra computing is required for compaction, and so on.</p><p id="62f9">For example, consider a retail company capturing clickstream data. A poorly configured Flink job writes data into Iceberg tables with a default file size of 10 MB. Over time, these small files pile up, bloating the metadata catalog and slowing down query performance. Implementing periodic compaction jobs and tuning Flink’s file size thresholds could alleviate this problem.</p><p id="b4cb">As a counterexample, Estuary Flow utilizes a few tricks to <a href="https://estuary.dev/memory-efficient-streaming-parquet/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">stream data into the underlying Parquet files efficiently</a>. It also allows users to stagger data materializations even in a streaming environment to align with compaction schedules.</p><p id="6220">File size tuning and write strategies are critical. Use tools like Apache Spark’s adaptive query execution to optimize partitioning or leverage Iceberg’s built-in compaction utilities to merge small files periodically. Ignoring these tasks can turn a promising Iceberg deployment into a performance bottleneck.</p><h2 id="c625">A Complex Stack to Maintain</h2><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://mad.firstmark.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://mad.firstmark.com/</a></figcaption></figure><p id="75ca">Hadoop was never a standalone product. It required a constellation of tools — HBase for real-time reads, Hive for SQL queries, and Spark for advanced analytics. Managing this complexity demanded specialized skill sets and sophisticated orchestration.</p><p id="c91a">Iceberg, despite its simplifications, is no different. Its power lies in its ecosystem: query engines (Trino, Spark, Flink), storage backends (S3, GCS, HDFS), and catalogs (Hive, Glue, Nessie, Polaris, Unity, the REST Catalog, and probably many more..). The configuration options can be overwhelming. For example, partitioning strategies can significantly impact query performance, and selecting the wrong catalog implementation might limit scalability.</p><p id="3f74">This complexity highlights a broader truth: No tool is an island. The success of Iceberg depends not just on its features but on the ecosystem around it. Companies that excel with Iceberg often adopt a “platform engineering” mindset, creating internal tooling and automation to manage metadata, monitor performance, and orchestrate workloads.</p><h2 id="5489">Metadata Overhead: A New Kind of Complexity</h2><p id="7770">Hadoop’s NameNode bottleneck exemplified how metadata management could derail performance. With its distributed snapshot-based metadata model, Iceberg avoids this single point of failure but introduces its own challenges. As table sizes grow, so do snapshots and manifests, leading to bloated metadata stores.</p><p id="d84b">A media company uses Iceberg to manage petabytes of video analytics data. Over time, their snapshot history grows unchecked, causing query planning times to increase. By implementing periodic snapshot expiration and manifest compaction, they keep their query performance consistent while controlling metadata growth.</p><p id="5307">My tip: Treat metadata as a first-class citizen. Automate snapshot pruning and compaction tasks and invest in monitoring solutions that surface metadata bottlenecks early.</p><h2 id="1bef">Build vs. Buy</h2><p id="3142">Hadoop’s early days required organizations to build everything from scratch. Managed services like Cloudera and AWS EMR eventually simplified adoption but came with trade-offs in cost and flexibility.</p><p id="5860">Iceberg users face a similar decision. Self-hosting offers maximum control but requires expertise in scaling and tuning. Managed solutions like Snowflake’s Iceberg tables or Starburst Galaxy reduce operational overhead but can limit flexibility and lead to vendor lock-in.</p><p id="8231">The decision boils down to your organization’s core competencies. If your team already excels in DevOps, self-hosting may offer the best ROI. Conversely, smaller teams or those new to Iceberg might benefit from managed services to jumpstart adoption.</p><h2 id="1acd">The Community Effect: Vibrant, Yet Fragmented</h2><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ydolan_in-the-last-2-years-most-of-my-apache-iceberg-activity-7256666018935173121-ofqB/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ydolan_in-the-last-2-years-most-of-my-apache-iceberg-activity-7256666018935173121-ofqB/</a></figcaption></figure><p id="2478">Hadoop thrived on open-source collaboration, but its fragmentation — Spark vs. MapReduce, Hive vs. Impala — often created confusion. Iceberg benefits from a vibrant open-source community. Yet, competing table formats like Delta Lake and Hudi mirror this fragmentation.</p><p id="c2dd">While competition drives innovation, it can also stall adoption. Standardization efforts — such as integrating Iceberg more deeply with query engines — will be crucial for its long-term success. The emergence of interoperability layers, akin to the “Hive Metastore” era, may define the next chapter for Iceberg.</p><h2 id="96f0">What’s Next for Iceberg?</h2><p id="e775">Despite its parallels to Hadoop, Iceberg benefits from hindsight. The data community has learned to prioritize simplicity, scalability, and cloud-native architectures. Here are key trends to watch:</p><h2 id="81f4">1. Consolidation</h2><p id="4da1">Just as Spark emerged as the dominant engine in the Hadoop ecosystem, a dominant table format and catalog may appear in the Iceberg era. This consolidation will drive standardization, whether Iceberg itself or a future innovation.</p><p id="e75a">Projects like <a href="https://xtable.apache.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Apache XTable</a> are working on making interoperability super easy among table formats.</p><h2 id="2e14">2. Operational Maturity</h2><p id="8351">The next wave of Iceberg tools will focus on reducing operational complexity. Managed services and orchestration frameworks are already emerging, following the footsteps of Databricks and Snowflake.</p><p id="ebc3">Amazon’s recently announced <a href="https://estuary.dev/s3-tables-for-apache-iceberg/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">S3 Tables</a> is an excellent example of this. It abstracts away the complexities of maintaining Iceberg tables and offers a built-in catalog, although this has a side effect of reduced compatibility with the rest of the ecosystem.</p><h2 id="7576">3. Beyond Analytics</h2><p id="e9c2">Iceberg’s support for streaming and transactional workloads positions it as more than an analytics tool. Imagine using Iceberg to power event-driven architectures or real-time machine learning pipelines — scenarios that push beyond traditional batch processing.</p><p id="2c03"><a href="https://estuary.dev/destination/s3-iceberg/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Estuary Flow’s Iceberg connector</a> is a good example of the table format that can be integrated into real-time streaming projects.</p><h2 id="b3ca">Final Thoughts</h2><figure><figcaption>Iceberg is here to stay</figcaption></figure><p id="0a39">Apache Iceberg is undeniably transformative, much like Hadoop was a decade ago. But with great power comes great complexity. As with any tool in the modern data stack, success lies in aligning the technology with your organization’s readiness, skill set, and strategic goals.</p><p id="b7c3">While the parallels to Hadoop are striking, we also have the opportunity to avoid its pitfalls. By learning from the past, we can ensure that Iceberg isn’t just the Hadoop of the modern data stack — it’s the evolution we’ve been waiting for.</p></div></div>]]></description>

</div><div>

<p>The text below, dubbed the “Authoritarian Regime Survival Guide”, was published in social media in January 2017 in a series of improvised, spontaneous tweets, which reached 3 million views within one month. Their common element was their trademark signature, “- <em>With love, your Eastern European friends</em>”, and the accompanying hashtag <em>#LearnFromEurope</em>.</p>
<p>The Guide went viral in the US and many other countries, being translated into several languages, from Turkish to Filipino. It was printed on placards during anti-Trump protests, studied at two American universities, quoted by CNBC’s Joy Reid on national TV and recommended by former US Secretary of Labor Robert Reich.</p>
<p>Excerpts and summaries were published by various on-line media, but this is the first time it is published as a whole.</p>
<p>—</p>
<h2>YEAR 1 Under Authoritarianism</h2>
<h2>What to Expect?</h2>
<p>1. They will come to power with a campaign based on fear, scaremongering and distorting the truth. Nevertheless, their victory will be achieved through a democratic electoral process. But beware, as this will be their argument every time you question the legitimacy of their actions. They will claim a mandate from the People to change the system.</p>
<p><strong>Remember – gaining power through a democratic system does not give them permission to cross legal boundaries and undermine said democracy.</strong></p>
<p>2. They will divide and rule. Their strength lies in unity, in one voice and one ideology, and so should yours. They will call their supporters Patriots, the only “true Americans”. You will be labelled as traitors, enemies of the state, unpatriotic, the corrupt elite, the old regime trying to regain power. Their supporters will be the “People”, the “sovereign” who chose their leaders.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t let them divide you – remember you’re one People, one Nation, with one common good.</strong></p>
<p>3. They will subjugate state media, turning them into a propaganda tube. Then, through convoluted laws and threats they will attempt to control all mainstream media and limit press freedom. They will ban critical press from their briefings, calling them “liars”, “fake news”. They will brand those media as “unpatriotic”, acting against the People (see point 2).</p>
<p><strong>Fight for every media outlet, every journalist that is being banned, censored, sacked or labelled an “enemy of the state” – there’s no hope for freedom where there is no free press.</strong></p>
<p>4. They will create chaos, maintain a constant sense of conflict and danger. It will be their argument to enact new authoritarian laws, each one further limiting your freedoms and civil liberties. They will disguise them as being for your protection, for the good of the People.</p>
<p><strong>See through the chaos, the fake danger, expose it before you wake up in a totalitarian, fascist state.</strong></p>
<p>5. They will distort the truth, deny facts and blatantly lie. They will try to make you forget what facts are, sedate your need to find the truth. They will feed “post-truths” and “alternative facts”, replace knowledge and logic with emotions and fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Always think critically, fact-check and point out the truth, expose ignorance with facts.</strong></p>
<p>6. They will incite and then leak fake, superficial “scandals”. They will smear opposition with trivial accusations, blowing them out of proportion and then feeding the flame. This is just smokescreen for the legal steps they will be taking towards totalitarianism.</p>
<p><strong>See through superficial topics in mainstream media (see point 3) and focus on what they are actually doing.</strong></p>
<p>7. They will propose shocking laws to provoke your outrage. You will focus your efforts on fighting them, so they will seemingly back off, giving you a false sense of victory. In the meantime they will push through less “flashy” legislation, slowly dismantling democracy (see points 4 and 6)</p>
<p><strong>Focus your fight on what really matters.</strong></p>
<p>8. When invading your liberal sensibilities they will focus on what hurts the most – women and minorities. They will act as if democracy was majority rule without respect for the minority. They will paint foreigners and immigrants as potential threats. Racial, religious, sexual and other minorities will become enemies to the order and security they are supposedly providing. They will challenge women’s social status, undermine gender equality and interfere with reproductive rights (see point 7). But it means they are aware of the threat women and minorities pose to their rule, so make it your strength.</p>
<p><strong>Women and minorities have to be ready to fight the hardest – reminding the majority what true democracy is about – and you must fight together with them.</strong></p>
<p>9. They will try to take control of the judiciary. They will assault your highest court. They need to remove the checks and balances to be able to push through unconstitutional legislation. Controlling the judiciary they can also threat anyone that defies them with prosecution, including the press (see point 3).</p>
<p><strong>Preserve the independence of your courts at all cost, they are your safety valve, the safeguard of the rule of law and the democratic system.</strong></p>
<p>10. They will try to limit freedom of assembly, calling it a necessity for your security. They will enact laws prioritizing state events and rallies, or those of a certain type or ideology. If they can choose who can demonstrate legally, they have a legal basis to forcefully disperse or prosecute the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Oppose any legislation attempting to interfere with freedom of assembly, for whatever reason.</strong></p>
<p>11. They will distort the language, coin new terms and labels, repeat shocking phrases until you accept them as normal and subconsciously associate them with whom they like. A “thief”, “liar” or “traitor” will automatically mean the opposition, while a “patriot” or a “true American” will mean their follower (see point 2). Their slogans will have double meaning, giving strength to their supporters and instilling angst in their opponents.</p>
<p><strong>Fight changes in language in the public sphere, remind and preserve the true meaning of words.</strong></p>
<p>12. They will take over your national symbols, associate them with their regime, remake them into attributes of their power. They want you to forget that your flag, your anthem and your symbols belong to you, the People, to everyone equally. Don’t let them be hijacked. Use and expose them in your fight as much as they do.</p>
<p><strong>Show your national symbols with pride, let them give you strength, not associate you with the tyranny they brought onto your country.</strong></p>
<p>13. They will try to rewrite history to suit their needs and use the education system to support their agenda. They will smear any historical or living figure who wouldn’t approve of their actions, or distort their image to make you think they would. They will place emphasis on historical education in schools, feeding young minds with the “only correct” version of history and philosophy. They will raise a new generation of voters on their ideology, backing it with a distorted interpretation of history and view of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Guard the education of your children, teach them critical thinking, ensure their open-mindedness and protect your real history and heritage.</strong></p>
<p>14. They will alienate foreign allies and partners, convincing you don’t need them. They won’t care for the rest of the world, with their focus on “making your country great again”. While ruining your economy to fulfil their populist promises, they will omit the fact that you’re part of a bigger world whose development depends on cooperation, on sharing and on trade.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t let them build walls promising you security instead of bridges giving you prosperity.</strong></p>
<p>15. They will eventually manipulate the electoral system. They might say it’s to correct flaws, to make it more fair, more similar to the rest of the world, or just to make it better. Don’t believe it. They wouldn’t be messing with it at all if it wasn’t to benefit them in some way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Oppose any changes to electoral law that an authoritarian regime wants to enact – rest assured it’s only to help them remain in power longer.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>And above all, be strong, fight, endure, and remember you’re on the good side of history.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>EVERY authoritarian, totalitarian and fascist regime in history eventually failed, thanks to the PEOPLE.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>– With love, your Eastern European friends</strong></p>
<p>—</p>

<p><strong>– With love, your Eastern European friends.</strong></p>
<p>—</p>
<h2>6 RULES for Survival under an Authoritarian Regime</h2>
<p><strong>Rule 1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t stay indifferent. It WILL concern you eventually. It will concern your family, your friends. Voice your objection IMMEDIATELY. Show them you care. RESIST.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2</strong></p>
<p>They thrive on FEAR &amp; IGNORANCE. Expose their scaremongering, show flaws in their arguments. Raise awareness, EDUCATE people around you. They will try to distort FACTS, rewrite history. DON’T LET THEM.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3</strong></p>
<p>Organize protest movements, mobilize civil society. They’re well organized, so should you be. FLOOD THE STREETS. They WILL back off when they see your numbers. They depend on you – the PEOPLE.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4</strong></p>
<p>Don’t let them DIVIDE you into different classes of citizens, “true Americans”, “patriots” vs “traitors”, “enemies of the state”. You’re ALL citizens, ONE nation, despite different beliefs and ideology. Make your diversity your STRENGTH. Stay TOGETHER for a common goal – survival of your country, of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 5</strong></p>
<p>Don’t give up, don’t get tired, and don’t try to wait it out. Don’t hope it will pass. It WON’T. They will manipulate the people, control the media to sway public opinion, fix the electoral system and STAY FOR GOOD.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 6</strong></p>
<p>If you don’t get them to back off or to step down, you better make goddamn SURE that when the next elections come, assuming there’s still any democracy left, NO ONE will vote for the same bastard(s) again!</p>

<h2>7 RULES on Approaching Authoritarian Supporters</h2>
<h2>What if your neighbour, friend or family member supports the authoritarian regime?</h2>
<p><strong>Rule 1</strong></p>
<p>Don’t look down on them, don’t patronize them, even if you know what they’re saying has no factual basis or you find it offensive. Don’t preach, ask questions. Try to understand them, where they are coming from, what their problems are and why they see solutions to them in the regime. Treat them as people, as equals. They believe what they’re saying is true and they might have valid reasons for their support.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2</strong></p>
<p>Don’t get emotional, don’t get provoked into heated arguments. Fight the other side’s emotions with your calm, logical approach. The angrier they get, the calmer you should be. They’ll calm down eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 3</strong></p>
<p>Focus on what you have in common. Do you live in the same neighborhood? Do you work in the same company or sector? The smaller the community, the easier it is. Give examples, like “we all need to get this done for all of us, if we don’t cooperate neither of us will have it”.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 4</strong></p>
<p>Use their language, don’t treat it as inferior or below you – don’t seem patronizing (see rule 1). If they curse, curse with them. If they approach you with humor, don’t get angry or uptight about it, reply with humor. Show them you’re actually not that different (see rule 3). As long as you communicate on two different planes, you will never meet.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 5</strong></p>
<p>Don’t block their news sources, don’t turn away from their leaders and authority figures. Treat them as an insight to their worldview and tactics. Use them to your advantage, to better prepare for their arguments. Whenever you don’t agree with something or detect a lie, voice it calmly, expose it with factual arguments.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 6</strong></p>
<p>Pinpoint the practical, negative effects of their side’s actions, ones that affect them directly. Find examples of how they, their families, children or friends will be personally impacted by their policies, or how it will affect your shared community.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 7</strong></p>
<p>If all else fails, don’t turn away, don’t abandon your friends and family, don’t shun your neighbors. Remember, an authoritarian wants to divide you to control you. So invite them over to your BBQ, crack open a beer, and who knows, maybe they’ll realize you’re not so different after all.</p>
<p><strong>– With love, your Eastern European friends.</strong></p>

												<p>To find ways to connect, look to your local Indivisible chapter or look to local protests and rallies.  Almost every cause you care about has an organization that is political.  I belong to Save Our Schools and we fight to fully fund public schools, but now we are fighting for our democracy.  You can get connected!  Please do!</p>

												<p>But how do you survive once they are in control? It’s happening at slow, but steady pace in the US and we don’t learn or change course until the worst possible scenario happens..</p>
<p>Everything we said would protect us, hasn’t; everything we said would hold, is breaking; and everything we said wouldn’t happen, is slowly happening. </p>
<p>What do we do? What do people who cannot be silenced until they are silenced, do? What happens when they take over and we’re completely under their control?</p>

												<p>Nov is not going to save us, even if the repubs allow a Dem congress or pres to be seated — which I dont think they will allow. Biden has all the power in the world right now, and he refuses to do ANYthing — and Harris is pledging the same. They are both saying they wont lift a finger; in fact they havent lifted a finger. They tell us to go elect 60 Senators and then they’ll do something. We are in dire trouble, and what we need is as you say, advice on how to live under authortiarianism.</p>

												<p>It has happened. They have “won” in a supposedly fair election. Project 2025,  the authoritarian handbook will be enacted on day one allegedly. Already they’ve corrupted the courts and oppressed women through denial of basic health care. We are quite far along this terrible path now.</p>

												<p>So here we are. We have 2 months to prepare. What do we do? Our Economy is going to collapse and we will all likely be homeless or very close. I’m a single mom and need to know how I’m going to keep my kids alive, fed, and safe. I am starting a garden this weekend. There are vegetables you can start growing in the fall/winter. We are truly terrified.</p>

												<p>Doomerism is giving up your power without a fight. </p>
<p>It’s going to get bad but it’s important to remember, they have hurdles to overcome to enact their agenda. Appointing unqualified rapists for AG and Defense Secretary is psychological warfare above all. It’s a flex, intended to shock you.</p>
<p>We are still in the pre-game warmup; don’t let the scare tactics get to you. We have an important job: to stymie their vision and promote our own.</p>

												<p>Update: it is literally happening, day one. Despite his claims that he knew nothing of project 25, Trump signed an overwhelming 200 executive orders today to push forth that very agenda. Anyone who knows their history knows where this is leading.</p>

												<p>Yep it happened here too. Trump &amp; Co. did exactly what Mussolini, Hitler, Orban etc did. They just got tossed out before they could finish destroying the republic. They have NOT stopped trying, and they might very well win/steal the House and Senate in Nov 2020 and elect/appoint Trump in 2024. At that point the Republic is dead.<br>
    My question is: will they create a Mussolini/ Putin/Orban style authoritarian regime, or full-blown Third Reich rule by terror?</p>

												<p>There is no doubt, in my mind anyway, that Trump would soon move to ruling by fear rather than working to earn faith within the people.  It is obvious his concerns are selfish and future actions will be vengeful towards his rivals and critics.  That will be the beginning of what will soon be hell on earth for all.  If he returns as President, our nation, as we know ( or knew ) it is doomed.</p>

The “American Experiment” is done, and we have ushered in an era of America under authoritarian rule. Trump won’t last his term, but Commander JD Vance is waiting to step in.</p>

												<p>With the prospect of another Trump presidency I am doing all that I am able to in order to make sure my family and I are safe. If that means leaving the country, then we are working toward a smooth exit. That checklist is pretty much entirely checked off at this point in American history and democracy is in its final stages. I would rather resist from a safe distance where my family doesn’t have to live in fear, abject poverty, or worse.</p>

												<p>My husband and I both studied nonviolence in theology school (we’re religious humanists). I was glad to come across this.  So many good people in the US are living in dread and I know Trump’s goal is to demoralize the public and convince us that resistance is useless.  Total nonsense.<br>
Nonviolent social action can and does work.</p>

												<p>This is similar to what is happening in Indonesia now, where President Joko Widodo is trying to maintain his power by changing the law on the age limit for vice presidential candidates, so that his children who do not meet the requirements can qualify for the vice presidential nomination.</p>

												<p>I’ve seen reduced participation in public demonstrations in the USA over the last few years. What are some other ways to “fight”, especially for secure elections, independent media, etc. I’ve been writing letters and making calls but that doesn’t seem very much like “fighting.”</p>

												<p>Join the League of Women Voters. Join Mobilize. Join Sunrise Movement. All of these are nationwide with local chapters and/or meetings. Meet with like minded people IRL at libraries, parks, pubs. Utilizing public spaces helps keep those public spaces open to the public. Join a Community Garden. Growing food is an act of resistance. Find neighborhood groups on social media. Volunteer to plant trees, pull up invasive weeds, and clean up rivers and lakes. Do good things; you’ll meet good people. Give to ACLU and abortion rights groups to help fund their lawyers. Stopping authoritarian rule this time is going to take a lot of court cases.</p>

												<p>Though I’m praying it doesn’t come to this, as a believer in risk management, I’ve begun to wonder what, as a 71 year old retired widow, I should be doing to prepare for a possible Trump win and authoritarian takeover.  I’m sure they have plans in place for the hammer to fall on day one and I want to be prepared.  Should I transfer my assets into my sons’ names?  Just seeing that written down makes me feel like I’m overreacting but I’m really scared.</p>

												<p>I fear it may be too late in the US to stop the Republicans from destroying the nation.  The dumbing down of Americans may be too far along to stop.  It seems that the party of Trump has started or completed a number of the steps listed above.  Especially when it comes to the Judicial side of the government, i,e. the lack of ethics in the Federal Supreme Court.</p>

												<p>Its a day after election in the United states and I feel an uneasy feeling. Something told me to do research to prepare myself for the next 4 years and its crazy seeing people comment from 2 years ago warning how trump will use these tactics and fear to get the vote…hedid just that. Its crazy we are going through this but I do believe in the half the country that voted for the right side of history. Hopefully the United States will not fall for this..Hopefully I will grow old in my home country and be able to say we fought against this regime.</p>

												<p>It’s Nov 2024, and here we are post-election staring down the worst scenario we could’ve imagined. He’s back. What is the first line of protection for our money and property we should be doing? We are fortunate to have dual citizenship (Canada/US) … will we be able to move out of the US or will they stop us at the border? It is HORRIFYING that we even have to think about this. What other things should we be taking care of before January 20th? </p>

They ignore me or don’t take him seriously when I share something like US announcement to take over Gaza, or taking immigrants to Guantanamo, or threat to make Canada the 51st “state.” I want to protect myself (minority here) but also know I have a civic duty.</p>

												<p>It’s interesting that this travesty is coming to fruition just when most the WWII veterans have passed. I wonder how the people who fought fascism and saw its evil face in Europe would feel about the destruction of the American freedoms they sacrificed so much to protect.  Al Gore, Hillary Clinton, and Kamala Harris would all been President had women, young people, and people of color not been the victims of voter suppression in every election since at least 2000. Which is not to say that it hasn’t been happening before, especially for people of color.  Here we are in 2025, and as one who grew up in the 60s and 70s, so believed in the shining promise of the 21st century. But THIS Medusa just keeps on growing new heads, so it will be a longer battle to promote and nurture the best in human beings, and depose those who would promote the worst.  Sometimes creating a better future is a longer haul than we expect.</p>

												<p>Reading comments spanning across years and sitting here today, in January 2025, and seeing it all unfold exactly as we feared. </p>
<p>Only ten days into Trump’s second term:<br>
– Federal funding freeze causes chaos, confusion and total shutdown in all areas of the govt.<br>
– Illegal firings of inspector generals and federal employees<br>
– New federal employees must prove their loyalty to MAGA<br>
– Transgender people banned from military service<br>
– Across the board removal of any and all lgbt, racial minority, etc protections. Discrimination based on sex, sexuality, race, and religion is now legalized.<br>
– Pressure on private companies to enact the same policies. Leading corporations like Amazon have caved, companies who refuse like Costco are threatened.<br>
– Departure from WHO, shutdown of federal health organizations.<br>
– An insane cabinet of sycophants<br>
– This doesn’t even cover it all, and it’s been 10 days</p>
<p>This would be a very long comment to list citations of everything here, but researching these facts is easy. Potustracker.us is a useful resource.</p>

												<p>It’s like Trump is using this as a To Do List. Horrifying. I hate this timeline. Let’s go back to 2016 and give Bernie the nomination that he earned. Ugh. Imagine the beautiful world we’d be living in rn if he was our president in 2016.</p>

												<p>I am 80 years old. I will do whatever I can, however I can to help our citizens and others here to remain safe.  Our USA democracy and our Constitution are sacred and the land is sacred!  All of our children and grandchildren, human, animal and spiritual are blessings of life and must be protected. from those who would steal from them or us!</p>
<p>About 20-25 years ago I had a dream that I was in Philadelphia PA on a beautiful sunny day where I saw our Founding Fathers, in spirit form.  They were rushing to get to an older brick building, so I asked, “Where are you going?”  One of our Founding Fathers answered that they were hurrying to a meeting because our Democracy is in danger! May we also hurry with them to save our Democracy “of, by and for the people” IT IS NOT FOR THE OLIGARCHS!!!<br>
I hope all who have been helped, by democracy, and/or love democracy will help as best as they can. We must work together to get our democracy, our beloved land and country out of danger and working for the good of all sharing, kind and gracious beings.</p>

												<p>Tim Snyder has written on tyranny. Keep it simple: Remain visible &amp; indivisible. Don’t obey in advance. Never concede your power. Find time for yourself to refresh &amp; recoup. Dig into your local community by volunteering. Look for the helpers. Keep your circle of friends &amp; if possible, family. Stay grounded. I just wish the Democrats were more aggressive. They’re all talk &amp; no action. They need to back up the People &amp; shut down the Senate &amp; realize GOP are anti-democracy. Realize they try to align our enemies &amp; alienate our allies.</p>

												<p>thank you for putting this up, there is much useful knowledge here.  I’m gonna pass it along to some friends.</p>
<p>I’ve been feeling since the inauguration almost as if I had woken up behind the Iron Curtain in an earlier time.  most Americans don’t have any relevant experience, and many don’t seem to be aware of where this is heading.</p>
<p>all we can do is keep marching, keep writing, keep supporting one another.  there are far more of us than there are of them, at least those running this clown show.</p>
<p>onward thru the fog we go.  wish us luck!!</p>

												<p>I am afraid our European friends may not understand how brainwashed his base is. Inviting them over for a beer is not going to break into the 24/7 propaganda they addictively consume.  We need to spend our time organizing, not trying to deprogram them, in my humble opinion.</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Test-time inference has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enabling language models to ``think'' longer and more carefully about complex challenges, much like skilled human experts. While reinforcement learning (RL) can drive self-improvement in language models on verifiable tasks, some models exhibit substantial gains while others quickly plateau. For instance, we find that Qwen-2.5-3B far exceeds Llama-3.2-3B under identical RL training for the game of Countdown. This discrepancy raises a critical question: what intrinsic properties enable effective self-improvement? We introduce a framework to investigate this question by analyzing four key cognitive behaviors -- verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining -- that both expert human problem solvers and successful language models employ. Our study reveals that Qwen naturally exhibits these reasoning behaviors, whereas Llama initially lacks them. In systematic experimentation with controlled behavioral datasets, we find that priming Llama with examples containing these reasoning behaviors enables substantial improvements during RL, matching or exceeding Qwen's performance. Importantly, the presence of reasoning behaviors, rather than correctness of answers, proves to be the critical factor -- models primed with incorrect solutions containing proper reasoning patterns achieve comparable performance to those trained on correct solutions. Finally, leveraging continued pretraining with OpenWebMath data, filtered to amplify reasoning behaviors, enables the Llama model to match Qwen's self-improvement trajectory. Our findings establish a fundamental relationship between initial reasoning behaviors and the capacity for improvement, explaining why some language models effectively utilize additional computation while others plateau.

                </div><p>Bhargav Krishna, an air pollution expert at New Delhi-based Sustainable Futures Collaborative, called the loss of data “a big blow” to air quality research. </p><p>“They were part of a handful of sensors in many developing countries and served as a reference for understanding what air quality was like,” Krishna said. “They were also seen to be a well-calibrated and unbiased source of data to cross-check local data if there were concerns about quality.” </p>
    
<p>“It’s a real shame”, said Alejandro Piracoca Mayorga, a Bogota, Colombia-based freelance air quality consultant. U.S. embassies and consulates in Lima, Peru, Sao Paulo and Bogota have had the public air monitoring. “It was a source of access to air quality information independent of local monitoring networks. They provided another source of information for comparison.”</p><p>Khalid Khan, an environmental expert and advocate based in Pakistan, agreed, saying the shutdown of air quality monitoring will “have significant consequences.” </p><div data-align-center="">

He said vulnerable people in Pakistan and around the world are particularly at risk as they are the least likely to have access to other reliable data.</p>
    
<p>In Africa, the program provided air quality data for over a dozen countries including Senegal, Nigeria, Chad and Madagascar. Some of those countries depend almost entirely on the U.S. monitoring systems for their air quality data. </p><p>The WHO’s air quality database will also be affected by the closing of U.S. program. Many poor countries don’t track air quality because stations are too expensive and complex to maintain, meaning they are entirely reliant on U.S. embassy monitoring data. </p><h2>Monitors strengthened local efforts</h2><div data-align-center="">

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>Last night, as President Trump delivered his State of the Union address</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-158462587" href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight#footnote-1-158462587" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span>, the Wall Street Journal </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/disney-to-cut-nearly-6-staff-across-abc-news-disney-entertainment-networks-8af04b40" rel="">reported</a><span> that ABC News would lay off the remaining staff at 538 as part of broader cuts within corporate parent Disney. Having been through several rounds of this before, including </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/some-personal-news" rel="">two years ago</a><span> when the staff was cut by more than half and my tenure expired too</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-158462587" href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight#footnote-2-158462587" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span><span>, I know it’s a brutal process for everyone involved. It’s also tough being in a business while having a constant anvil over your head, as we had in pretty much every odd-numbered (non-election) year from 2017 onward at 538/FiveThirtyEight.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-158462587" href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight#footnote-3-158462587" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span><span> I don’t know all of the staffers from the most recent iteration of the site, but the ones I have met or who I overlapped with are all extremely conscientious and hard-working people and were often forced to work double-duty as jobs were cut but frequently not replaced. My heart goes out to them, and I’m happy to provide recommendations for people I worked with there.</span></p><p>Beyond that, I wasn’t inclined to say too much more, but it felt weirder not to say anything at all. And it’s easier to say something here than filter it through a reporter or something.</p><p><span>For more extended thoughts on the environment at Disney — plus plenty of self-reflection/self-criticism — you can see the item at the bottom of </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/sbsq-12-will-the-polls-lowball-trump" rel="">SBSQ #12</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-4-158462587" href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight#footnote-4-158462587" target="_self" rel="">4</a></span><span> But the basic issue is that Disney was never particularly interested in running FiveThirtyEight as a business, even though I think it could have been a good business. Although they were generous in maintaining the site for so long and almost never interfered in our editorial process, the sort of muscle memory a media property builds early in its tenure tends to stick. We had an incredibly talented editorial staff, but we never had enough “product” people or strategy people to help the business grow and sustain itself. It’s always an uphill battle under those conditions, particularly when it comes to recruiting and retaining staff, who were constantly being poached by outlets like the New York Times and the Washington Post.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png" width="1456" height="853" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:853,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2eaa07e3-ed12-49ce-8202-3fb2a91c234d_1574x922.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture></div></a><figcaption>The FiveThirtyEight.com homepage as of its relaunch under ESPN/Disney on March 17, 2014.</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>It also doesn’t quite feel like the end, exactly. “Data journalism” may have been a dumb name for what we were doing — </span><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-fox-knows/" rel="">that one’s on me</a><span> — and Fivey Fox aside, the FiveThirtyEight brand was never warm and cuddly. But it always found a huge audience, and coverage of polls and political data is now much smarter. Compare the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/27/upshot/online-polls-election.html" rel="">extremely analytical polling deep dives</a><span> that Nate Cohn is doing at the New York Times, for instance, to the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/22/readersopinions/the-scream.html" rel="">vibes-based coverage</a><span> of the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_on_the_Bus" rel="">Boys on the Bus era</a><span>. That trend may get even more entrenched as former 538ers form a diaspora that filters out to the rest of the media.</span></p><p>Also, I’d like to think we’re carrying a piece of the FiveThirtyEight torch here at Silver Bulletin. So, just two more quick beats. One about our near-term plans here — in slightly awkward timing, we’re launching our Trump approval ratings dashboard tomorrow. But first, a shout-out to one of the extremely valuable functions that FiveThirtyEight provided.</p><p><span>Collecting and maintaining a database of public polls is a lot of work, requiring diligence, meticulousness, and dealing with constant complaints about edge cases from readers and pollsters. But it’s also a public service. </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/so-how-did-the-polls-do-in-2024-its" rel="">Polling has its challenges</a><span>, but I believe it’s vital in a democracy. People only get to vote every two to four years — if they’re lucky enough to live in a state where their vote even matters. While being too “poll-driven” has pitfalls, the alternative isn’t necessarily enlightened governance. Rather, left to their own devices, elected officials are often inclined to follow some combination of (i) narrow self-interest, (ii) the loudest voices in the room, and (iii) </span><em>elite</em><span> opinion, which often doesn’t match broader public opinion.</span></p><p><span>FiveThirtyEight had long made its data publicly available through APIs and other tools. At Silver Bulletin, I hope we’re upholding that tradition too — although admittedly with a twist. For instance, not only are our </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/pollster-ratings-silver-bulletin" rel="">pollster ratings</a><span> (which apply the methodology I originally developed for FiveThirtyEight</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-5-158462587" href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/a-few-words-about-fivethirtyeight#footnote-5-158462587" target="_self" rel="">5</a></span><span>) publicly available, but so is the underlying database of more than 12,000 polls that populates them. And for our </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/nate-silver-2024-president-election-polls-model" rel="">presidential election forecast last year</a><span>, our polling averages were free for everyone — though, here’s the twist, of course — the probabilities that the model spat out were paywalled. Even so, there were literally dozens of data visualizations and downloadable files just beyond that paywall — we’re not giving away the cow (the model code), but you’re getting basically everything else.</span></p><p>I think there are really only two options to provide an adequate incentive for the hard work of keeping a comprehensive public polling database:</p><ul><li><p>Either you need to have an upsell — most of the data is free, but premium features and/or models require a subscription; that’s basically what we’re doing. </p></li><li><p>Or you need to have some sort of not-for-profit structure. If a university or nonpartisan nonprofit out there wants to maintain a consortium of public polls, I’m happy to have those conversations and contribute ideas (and possibly data). Although there are some benefits from duplication — everyone finds some polls that others miss, and everyone has slightly different standards — there are also diminishing returns to this.</p></li></ul><p>For last year’s election, 538’s publicly-available databases were a major data source for the NYT and other news outlets that reported on the election or crunched the numbers, including Silver Bulletin. Basically, our process was to ingest their data and then make various additions, subtractions, and changes. On balance, we were slightly stricter than 538 about what polls we considered to meet a “scientific” standard — but there were edge cases that ran in both directions. (Eli is also sort of a wizard at finding polls faster than other people do.)</p><p>Going forward, we will continue to ensure that the database of polls that feeds into our models is publicly available, even if the outputs of the models aren’t. This was a bit superfluous before just because of the heavy overlap with 538 — indeed, we used nearly the same database structure since it’s the one I helped to design during my time there. But it’s less so now. So we’ll work to improve the discoverability and formatting of this data too when we’re publishing models and landing pages.</p><p><span>That doesn’t necessarily mean we want to be the “polling aggregator of record” for the entire industry, as FiveThirtyEight and Pollster.com formerly were. We have Trump approval ratings launching tomorrow, and we’ll probably release our version of </span><a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/generic-ballot/2024/" rel="">generic congressional ballot</a><span> averages beginning late this year. Eli and I can probably handle those two categories on our own. The midterms next year could be more of a challenge, with the abundance of House, Senate, and gubernatorial polls. But the solution is simple: we’ll hire additional staff next year as needed.</span></p><p>There are also some less sexy things that don’t fall into these buckets, however. For instance, vice presidential approval ratings, polls for special elections, and favorability ratings for other public figures. We’re very tempted by the idea of running an Elon Musk favorability tracker, but otherwise, these aren’t part of our plans in the short run. However, just as I don’t want to make any commitments, I also don’t want to rule anything out.</p><p><span>In the short term, though, we have some </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/sbsq-18-will-wokeness-bounce-back" rel="">pressing plans</a><span>:</span></p><ul><li><p>Trump approval ratings go up tomorrow and will be updated several times a week going forward.</p></li><li><p>Our new SBCB men’s college basketball ratings are also ready except for finalizing the charts, and will begin publishing on Friday or Saturday.</p></li><li><p>Then Selection Sunday is March 16, and within a day or two, we’ll also have our March Madness projections up for both the men’s and women’s brackets.</p></li><li><p><span>Meanwhile, I’m </span><a href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/job-listing-assistant-sports-analyst" rel="">hiring an Assistant Sports Analyst</a><span> with an eye toward getting NFL and NBA models ready for next season.</span></p></li></ul><p>It’s sort of a quirk that all of this is happening at once. For now, we’re just two people, and I had to get through some travel and other bottlenecks. But we’re trying to take a sustainable trajectory here, even if it’s slow. We greatly appreciate your support and hope you’ll stay with us for the long haul.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Tesla gets more than 20% of its parts from Mexico, as well as some from Canada on top of it. So, yes, Tesla will be negatively affected by the tariffs.</p>



<p>However, there’s another one-month delay.</p>



<p>I didn’t think I would have to write this article, but I have seen plenty of “Tesla influencers” claim that Tesla would not be affected by President Trump’s current trade war:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1206" height="804" src="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?quality=82&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg 1206w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?resize=1024,683 1024w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?resize=350,233 350w, https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/IMG_9059.jpg?resize=140,93 140w" sizes="(max-width: 1206px) 100vw, 1206px"></figure>



<p>This is false. Tesla gets a significant percentage of its car parts from Mexico and Canada.</p>	
	



<p>NHTSA releases data about the sourcing of parts for all vehicles in the US. Unfortunately, it doesn’t account for the US and Canada together, but it also lists the country of origin for the next largest source of parts.</p>



<p>For Tesla, that’s Mexico for all car models:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Models</strong></td><td><strong>US/Canada</strong></td><td><strong>Mexico</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Model 3 LR AWD/RWD</td><td>75%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Model 3 Performance</td><td>70%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Model Y LR AWD/RWD</td><td>70%</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Model Y Performance</td><td>70%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Cybertruck</td><td>65%</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Model S</td><td>65%</td><td>20%</td></tr><tr><td>Model X</td><td>60%</td><td>25%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This means that Tesla gets more than 20% of its parts from Mexico in addition to what it gets from Canada.</p>



<p>It’s also noteworthy that Tesla’s most popular car, Model Y, gets 25% of its parts from Mexico.</p>



<p>Despite free trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, Trump has implemented 25% blanket tariffs on the countries.</p>



<p>The tariffs were delayed last month, but they went into effect on Tuesday.</p>



<p>However, today, the White House confirmed that they were delayed again just for the automotive industry. Trump reportedly had a call with the big three this morning, Ford, GM, and Chrysler, and he agreed to another one-month delay.</p>



<p>If you needed more proof that Tesla is going to be affected by the tariffs, ever they go into effect, Tesla’s stock was up 2% on the news that Trump agreed to delay the tariffs.</p>



<h2 id="h-electrek-s-take">Electrek’s Take</h2>



<p>Tesla fans are delusional. They think that because Elon is involved with Trump and he is not fighting the tariffs, it means that it wouldn’t negatively affect Tesla. </p>




	<p>That’s a false assumption. Elon is not fighting because he is either completely delusional about Tesla himself or just doesn’t care.</p>



<p>If the tariffs are ever implemented, they will negatively affect Tesla. They will increase the cost of all Tesla vehicles. Some automakers will be more affected, but Tesla will be hurt, too.</p>



<p>The tariffs are a complete mess. They are on one day and delayed the next. I doubt they will ever be in place for any significant length of time.</p>



<p>Their only real impact is making Canadian and Mexican buyers and businesses think twice about doing business with the US. This impact will likely last longer than the tariffs and Trump’s administration.</p>

</p><p>Volkswagen AG became a global car giant thanks to the Beetle, an affordable model for the masses. Now, the German automaker is finally <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/mobility-for-everyone-with-the-id-every1-volkswagen-is-providing-a-preview-of-an-entry-level-electric-model-19039" target="_blank">unveiling a budget car for the electric-vehicle age</a> as it tries to catch up with Chinese brands and other rivals with cheaper options.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW on March 5 presented the compact ID. EVERY1 concept car that will cost around €20,000 ($21,000) — its lowest-priced EV yet. The first VW-brand model to use electric architecture jointly developed with Rivian Automotive Inc., it’s due to start production in two years at an undecided location in Europe.
      	  			            

</p><p>The model will offer more than 155 miles of range and is the “last piece of the puzzle” for VW’s next-generation lineup, said Thomas Schaefer, CEO of the brand.

<p>European carmakers are struggling to convince consumers to make the switch to EVs given their higher sticker prices and lingering concern around charging infrastructure.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW is seeking to regain ground on rivals with its own cheaper EV models after a year where sales slumped. Like other German manufacturers, VW initially focused its efforts on premium EVs to offset high development and battery costs. Tech enthusiasts and subsidies helped bolster a first wave of EV growth, but demand has stagnated on a dearth of affordable models, rising inflation and high electricity costs.

<p>VW’s tumbling sales were accompanied by a painful restructuring hammered out with unions in 2024, making it “one of the most challenging years of Volkswagen’s history,” Schaefer said at an event in Düsseldorf, Germany. “After everything we’ve been through, this gives us back our confidence and powerful sense of momentum — and to be frank, that’s exactly what we needed,” he said.
      	  			            

</p><p>The ID. EVERY1 will follow VW’s ID. 2all, which launches next year at a starting price of €25,000.
      	  			            

</p><p>“They’re bringing an affordable electric vehicle to the masses that will enable them to compete with Chinese entrants,” independent autos analyst Matthias Schmidt said.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW’s more affordable models won’t be ready in 2025, which means Europe’s biggest automaker has a tighter window to ramp up sales and meet the European Union’s carbon dioxide emissions targets.
      	  			            

</p><p>And there’s no guarantee of financial success, according to UBS analyst Patrick Hummel. “In the past they struggled to make money with small cars in the combustion era,” Hummel said. “And with EVs, it’s going to be even more challenging.”

<p>The ID. 2all and the ID. EVERY1 will be the first VW models to use lithium iron phosphate batteries, which are cheaper, longer lasting and charge more quickly, but aren’t as resilient to temperature fluctuations.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW’s foray into EVs was marred by software glitches that culminated in the ousting in 2022 of former CEO Herbert Diess.
      	  			            

</p><p>His successor Oliver Blume’s efforts to catch up with Tesla Inc. were hindered by soaring inflation that put a lid on consumer spending. The arrival of cheaper Chinese brands led by BYD Co. didn’t help.
      	  			            

</p><p>The car will compete with budget models already unveiled by rivals, including Renault SA’s Twingo E-Tech and Citroën’s ë-C3 city car, which will both have price tags starting at less than €20,000.
      	  			            

</p><p>VW is seeking to restore its former glory. Until 2022, the Golf was Europe’s top-selling car for 14 years straight. The Golf and affordable Polo have sold more than 57 million units combined since their introduction in the mid-1970s.
