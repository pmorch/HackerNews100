<h2><a href="https://capnproto.org/news/">News</a></h2>



<p>It’s been a little over ten years since the first release of Cap’n Proto, on April 1, 2013. Today I’m releasing version 1.0 of Cap’n Proto’s C++ reference implementation.</p>
<p>Don’t get too excited! There’s not actually much new. Frankly, I should have declared 1.0 a long time ago – probably around version 0.6 (in 2017) or maybe even 0.5 (in 2014). I didn’t mostly because there were a few advanced features (like three-party handoff, or shared-memory RPC) that I always felt like I wanted to finish before 1.0, but they just kept not reaching the top of my priority list. But the reality is that Cap’n Proto has been relied upon in production for a long time. In fact, you are using Cap’n Proto right now, to view this site, which is served by Cloudflare, which uses Cap’n Proto extensively (and is also my employer, although they used Cap’n Proto before they hired me). Cap’n Proto is used to encode millions (maybe billions) of messages and gigabits (maybe terabits) of data every single second of every day. As for those still-missing features, the real world has seemingly proven that they aren’t actually that important. (I still do want to complete them though.)</p>
<p>Ironically, the thing that finally motivated the 1.0 release is so that we can start working on 2.0. But again here, don’t get too excited! Cap’n Proto 2.0 is not slated to be a revolutionary change. Rather, there are a number of changes we (the Cloudflare Workers team) would like to make to Cap’n Proto’s C++ API, and its companion, the KJ C++ toolkit library. Over the ten years these libraries have been available, I have kept their APIs pretty stable, despite being 0.x versioned. But for 2.0, we want to make some sweeping backwards-incompatible changes, in order to fix some footguns and improve developer experience for those on our team.</p>
<p>Some users probably won’t want to keep up with these changes. Hence, I’m releasing 1.0 now as a sort of “long-term support” release. We’ll backport bugfixes as appropriate to the 1.0 branch for the long term, so that people who aren’t interested in changes can just stick with it.</p>
<h2 id="whats-actually-new-in-10">What’s actually new in 1.0?</h2>
<p>Again, not a whole lot has changed since the last version, 0.10. But there are a few things worth mentioning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A number of optimizations were made to improve performance of Cap’n Proto RPC. These include reducing the amount of memory allocation done by the RPC implementation and KJ I/O framework, adding the ability to elide certain messages from the RPC protocol to reduce traffic, and doing better buffering of small messages that are sent and received together to reduce syscalls. These are incremental improvements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Breaking change:</strong> Previously, servers could opt into allowing RPC cancellation by calling <code>context.allowCancellation()</code> after a call was delivered. In 1.0, opting into cancellation is instead accomplished using an annotation on the schema (the <code>allowCancellation</code> annotation defined in <code>c++.capnp</code>). We made this change after observing that in practice, we almost always wanted to allow cancellation, but we almost always forgot to do so. The schema-level annotation can be set on a whole file at a time, which is easier not to forget. Moreover, the dynamic opt-in required a lot of bookkeeping that had a noticeable performance impact in practice; switching to the annotation provided a performance boost. For users that never used <code>context.allowCancellation()</code> in the first place, there’s no need to change anything when upgrading to 1.0 – cancellation is still disallowed by default. (If you are affected, you will see a compile error. If there’s no compile error, you have nothing to worry about.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KJ now uses <code>kqueue()</code> to handle asynchronous I/O on systems that have it (MacOS and BSD derivatives). KJ has historically always used <code>epoll</code> on Linux, but until now had used a slower <code>poll()</code>-based approach on other Unix-like platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>KJ’s HTTP client and server implementations now support the <code>CONNECT</code> method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pull/1700">A new class <code>capnp::RevocableServer</code> was introduced</a> to assist in exporting RPC wrappers around objects whose lifetimes are not controlled by the wrapper. Previously, avoiding use-after-free bugs in such scenarios was tricky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many, many smaller bug fixes and improvements. <a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed">See the PR history</a> for details.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-planned-for-20">What’s planned for 2.0?</h2>
<p>The changes we have in mind for version 2.0 of Cap’n Proto’s C++ implementation are mostly NOT related to the protocol itself, but rather to the C++ API and especially to KJ, the C++ toolkit library that comes with Cap’n Proto. These changes are motivated by our experience building a large codebase on top of KJ: namely, the Cloudflare Workers runtime, <a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd"><code>workerd</code></a>.</p>
<p>KJ is a C++ toolkit library, arguably comparable to things like Boost, Google’s Abseil, or Facebook’s Folly. I started building KJ at the same time as Cap’n Proto in 2013, at a time when C++11 was very new and most libraries were not really designing around it yet. The intent was never to create a new standard library, but rather to address specific needs I had at the time. But over many years, I ended up building a lot of stuff. By the time I joined Cloudflare and started the Workers Runtime, KJ already featured a powerful async I/O framework, HTTP implementation, TLS bindings, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, KJ has nowhere near as much stuff as Boost or Abseil, and nowhere near as much engineering effort behind it. You might argue, therefore, that it would have been better to choose one of those libraries to build on. However, KJ had a huge advantage: that we own it, and can shape it to fit our specific needs, without having to fight with anyone to get those changes upstreamed.</p>
<p>One example among many: KJ’s HTTP implementation features the ability to “suspend” the state of an HTTP connection, after receiving headers, and transfer it to a different thread or process to be resumed. This is an unusual thing to want, but is something we needed for resource management in the Workers Runtime. Implementing this required some deep surgery in KJ HTTP and definitely adds complexity. If we had been using someone else’s HTTP library, would they have let us upstream such a change?</p>
<p>That said, even though we own KJ, we’ve still tried to avoid making any change that breaks third-party users, and this has held back some changes that would probably benefit Cloudflare Workers. We have therefore decided to “fork” it. Version 2.0 is that fork.</p>
<p>Development of version 2.0 will take place on Cap’n Proto’s new <code>v2</code> branch. The <code>master</code> branch will become the 1.0 LTS branch, so that existing projects which track <code>master</code> are not disrupted by our changes.</p>
<p>We don’t yet know all the changes we want to make as we’ve only just started thinking seriously about it. But, here’s some ideas we’ve had so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will require a compiler with support for C++20, or maybe even C++23. Cap’n Proto 1.0 only requires C++14.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In particular, we will require a compiler that supports C++20 coroutines, as lots of KJ async code will be refactored to rely on coroutines. This should both make the code clearer and improve performance by reducing memory allocations. However, coroutine support is still spotty – as of this writing, GCC seems to ICE on KJ’s coroutine implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cap’n Proto’s RPC API, KJ’s HTTP APIs, and others are likely to be revised to make them more coroutine-friendly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>kj::Maybe</code> will become more ergonomic. It will no longer overload <code>nullptr</code> to represent the absence of a value; we will introduce <code>kj::none</code> instead. <code>KJ_IF_MAYBE</code> will no longer produce a pointer, but instead a reference (a trick that becomes possible by utilizing C++17 features).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will drop support for compiling with exceptions disabled. KJ’s coding style uses exceptions as a form of software fault isolation, or “catchable panics”, such that errors can cause the “current task” to fail out without disrupting other tasks running concurrently. In practice, this ends up affecting every part of how KJ-style code is written. And yet, since the beginning, KJ and Cap’n Proto have been designed to accommodate environments where exceptions are turned off at compile time, using an elaborate system to fall back to callbacks and distinguish between fatal and non-fatal exceptions. In practice, maintaining this ability has been a drag on development – no-exceptions mode is constantly broken and must be tediously fixed before each release. Even when the tests are passing, it’s likely that a lot of KJ’s functionality realistically cannot be used in no-exceptions mode due to bugs and fragility. Today, I would strongly recommend against anyone using this mode except maybe for the most basic use of Cap’n Proto’s serialization layer. Meanwhile, though, I’m honestly not sure if anyone uses this mode at all! In theory I would expect many people do, since many people choose to use C++ with exceptions disabled, but I’ve never actually received a single question or bug report related to it. It seems very likely that this was wasted effort all along. By removing support, we can simplify a lot of stuff and probably do releases more frequently going forward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, we’ll drop support for no-RTTI mode and other exotic modes that are a maintenance burden.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may revise KJ’s approach to reference counting, as the current design has proven to be unintuitive to many users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will fix a longstanding design flaw in <code>kj::AsyncOutputStream</code>, where EOF is currently signaled by destroying the stream. Instead, we’ll add an explicit <code>end()</code> method that returns a Promise. Destroying the stream without calling <code>end()</code> will signal an erroneous disconnect. (There are several other aesthetic improvements I’d like to make to the KJ stream APIs as well.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We may want to redesign several core I/O APIs to be a better fit for Linux’s new-ish io_uring event notification paradigm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The RPC implementation may switch to allowing cancellation by default. As discussed above, this is opt-in today, but in practice I find it’s almost always desirable, and disallowing it can lead to subtle problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so on.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s worth noting that at present, there is no plan to make any backwards-incompatible changes to the serialization format or RPC protocol. The changes being discussed only affect the C++ API. Applications written in other languages are completely unaffected by all this.</p>
<p>It’s likely that a formal 2.0 release will not happen for some time – probably a few years. I want to make sure we get through all the really big breaking changes we want to make, before we inflict update pain on most users. Of course, if you’re willing to accept breakages, you can always track the <code>v2</code> branch. Cloudflare Workers releases from <code>v2</code> twice a week, so it should always be in good working order.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span>Credit: Louis Freedberg / EdSource</span></p><p><span>The California Department of Education building in Sacramento.</span></p></div><div><p><img src="https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Cali-DofE.jpg"><span>Credit: Louis Freedberg / EdSource</span></p><p><span>The California Department of Education building in Sacramento.</span></p></div><p><span>The California Department of Education has threatened to sue two prominent Stanford University education professors to prevent them from testifying in a lawsuit against the department — actions the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California calls an attempt to muzzle them.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLU, in turn, is threatening a lawsuit of its own — against CDE for infringing their and other researchers’ First Amendment rights.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Observers say the dispute has the potential to limit who conducts education research in California and what they are able to study because CDE controls the sharing of data that is not available to the public.</span></p>
<p><span>At issue is a restriction that CDE requires researchers to sign as a condition for their gaining access to nonpublic K-12 data. The clause, which CDE is interpreting broadly, prohibits the researcher from participating in any litigation against the department, even in cases unrelated to the research they were doing through CDE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“It keeps education researchers from weighing in on the side of parties who are adverse to the California Department of Education. So it’s really skewing the information and expertise that can come into courts,” said Alyssa Morones, an ACLU attorney involved with the case. “Individuals and students seeking to vindicate their rights no longer will have access to these education experts, and the court can no longer hear what they have to say.”</span></p>
<h3><b>Court brief: State failed to lead academic recovery</b></h3>
<p><span>Professors Sean Reardon and Thomas Dee had signed separate and unrelated data-partnership agreements with the department, and both were asked by attorneys in an ongoing lawsuit, </span><a href="https://publiccounsel.org/litigation/cayla-j-v-california/"><span>Cayla J. v. State of California</span></a><span>, to testify on behalf of students filing the case. The lawsuit, against the California Department of Education, the State Board of Education and State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, charges the state</span><span> with failing to prevent the deep learning loss imposed by the pandemic </span><span>on low-income students and other high-needs students.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reardon, who had co-authored </span><a href="https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/"><span>landmark nationwide research on pandemic learning,</span></a><span> said he would have considere</span><span>d providing expert testimony. </span><span>But warned this month by CDE that he’d be breaching his contract, Reardon declined — even though his learning loss research </span><span>did not involve the data obtained through his agreement with CDE.</span></p>

<p><span>Dee, a professor at the Graduate School of Education at Stanford, agreed to serve as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in the Cayla J. case on the effects of Covid-19 on enrollment, chronic absenteeism and student engagement in California. This month, he was one of a half-dozen nationally prominent education professors who filed briefs in the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In it, Dee cited data on enrollment declines and chronic absenteeism. He concluded, “Because of both its comprehensive data systems and its powerful fiscal and operational capacities, the state of California is in a unique position to provide leadership in better understanding and meeting the serious challenges of academic recovery. However, to date, the state has not clearly demonstrated such leadership, instead emphasizing responses by local school districts.”</span></p>
<p><span>CDE moved against Dee even though the data contract he had signed on behalf of a Stanford program was for research unrelated to the Cayla J. case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On Feb.24, after CDE discovered that Dee had filed the brief, the department warned Dee that he had violated the contract he had signed in February 2022 as the chief investigator for the </span><a href="https://gardnercenter.stanford.edu/"><span>John W. Gardner Center for Youth and Their Communities</span></a><span> at Stanford. As a result, the letter said, CDE was suspending the data partnership and demanding that Dee “mitigate further damage.” The department would consider seeking an injunction to prevent him from participating in the Cayla J. case along with a $50,000 fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Also, be aware,” wrote Cindy Kazanis, the director of CDE’s Analysis, Measurement, and Accountability Reporting Division, “that your actions have adversely impacted your working relationship with CDE, and your response to this letter is critically important to existing and future collaborations between us.” The letter was copied to Stanford.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The contract that Dee signed with CDE is </span><span>to examine how the California School Dashboard was affecting alternative schools serving those at risk of dropping out and those with motivation and behavior issues. He said he signed the contract in his capacity as faculty director of the Gardner Center, but had not actually looked at any of the data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dee said he relied on publicly available data in writing his brief for the Cayla J. case. He declined to comment further on the case.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The dispute is now in the courts. The plaintiffs’ attorneys in Cayla J., the public interest law firm Public Counsel and Morrison and Foerster, a San Francisco-based law firm doing pro bono work, </span><span>are asking a Superior Court judge to allow Dee’s participation in this case and protect him from CDE’s penalties — but only in this particular lawsuit. A hearing is scheduled early next week in Alameda Superior Court.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLU </span><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23889016-cde-aclu-tomdee-motion-072723"><span>filed a brief on Feb. 27 supporting Dee’s participation in the Cayla J. case</span></a><span>. But meanwhile, it took the first steps </span><span>toward </span><span>a larger lawsuit to eliminate CDE’s litigation prohibition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>‘What are state officials afraid of?’</b></h3>
<p><span>Michael Jacobs, an attorney with Morrison and Foerster, said he was disappointed that the state would attempt to block education experts from giving their expertise. “The futures of the least advantaged schoolchildren in California are at issue. The data these experts utilized are all public.”</span></p>
<p><span>“What are state officials afraid of?” Jacobs said. “That their performance in running the school system during the pandemic in fact aggravated the achievement gap? That notwithstanding their protestations, they haven’t done enough to address that problem?”</span></p>
<p><span>CDE declined to comment on the need for the litigation ban in data contracts or its threats and actions against Dee or Reardon. Researchers told EdSource they were unaware of similar prohibitions in other states, but EdSource could not verify that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a</span><a href="https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ACLU-CDE-EdResearch-let-070723.pdf"> <span>July 7 letter</span></a><span>, the ACLU gave the department 10 days to expunge the restriction from all contracts with researchers. In a one-sentence defense a week later, Len Garfinkel, general counsel for CDE, stated, ”In our view, the Department’s data protection agreements are compliant with law.”</span></p>
<p><span>ACLU hasn’t revealed when it might take its next step.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ACLU’s focus was a separate five-year research contract that the department signed in 2018 and updated in 2020 with the Learning Policy Institute, a Palo Alto-based nonprofit education research organization.</span></p>
<p><span>The next-to-the-last clause in the 11-page document, titled “Interests adverse to the California Department of Education,” states that as long as the contract is in effect, “</span><span>LPI’s employees, executives, and other representatives shall not voluntarily testify for, consult with, or advise a party in conjunction with any mediation, arbitration, litigation, or other similar legal proceeding where LPI knows that party is adverse to the CDE, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction or the State Board of Education.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, if anyone covered by the contract does become involved in litigation, CDE can immediately revoke the contract and demand all the data be returned or destroyed. LPI and signers of the agreement would be subject to a fine. That’s the same wording as in Dee’s contract through the Gardner Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Linda Darling-Hammond among contract signers</b></h3>
<p><span>Reardon, professor of poverty and inequality in education at the Stanford Graduate School of Education as well as a senior research fellow at LPI, signed that contract, along with 15 others, mainly LPI employees and researchers. Signing as the principal investigator was Linda Darling-Hammond, LPI’s president and CEO. She also is the president of the state board and an adviser to Gov. Gavin Newsom. She signed the original agreement a year before Newsom nominated her to the state board.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The ACLU, acting on its own, asserted the provision is clearly unconstitutional. A government can set restrictions for granting access to nonpublic data for research purposes, but not to limit a researcher’s First Amendment right of free speech, it said in its </span><a href="https://edsource.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ACLU-CDE-EdResearch-let-070723.pdf"><span>nine-page letter </span></a><span>to the department.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s “even ‘more blatant and more egregious,’” the ACLU wrote, citing a</span><a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2014/13-502"> <span>2015 U.S. Supreme Court decision</span></a><span>,</span><span> is the department’s “viewpoint discrimination.” The contract doesn’t ban an education researcher from testifying </span><i><span>for</span></i><span> the department in a lawsuit; it just can’t testify </span><i><span>against</span></i><span> it.</span></p>
<p><span>“Viewpoint discrimination is poison to a free society,”&nbsp; U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito wrote in</span><a href="https://www.mtsu.edu/first-amendment/article/1672/iancu-v-brunetti"> <span>a different high court opinion in a 2019</span></a><span> case that the ACLU also cited in its letter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Morones, who wrote the ACLU letter, said the prohibition is far more broad than the government needs to protect its data. As shown by the department’s response in the Cayla J. lawsuit, the department could apply the provision to thwart LPI and anyone who signed the contract from participating in any litigation against the department, the state board and the state superintendent, Thurmond, she said.</span></p>
<p><span>The </span><a href="https://educationrecoveryscorecard.org/"><span>Education Recovery Scorecard</span></a><span>,</span><span> the learning loss research that Reardon co-authored, relies on publicly available data from California and 39 other states, and, Reardon said, does not use any data provided to the LPI for its research project. Reardon’s project with LPI&nbsp; is focused on the pre-pandemic success of English learners in California from 2006 to 20-19.</span></p>
<h3><b>Researchers rely on partnership agreements</b></h3>
<p><span>Researchers seek agreements with the department to access nonpublic data, especially student-level data that detail the demographic information and the performance records over time of California’s 5.8 million students but without any names or identifying information. That data is the gold standard for accurate research. A partnership contract details the department’s commitments and researchers’ responsibilities, including strong assurances they will have security protections in place to protect students’ privacy and anonymity.</span></p>
<p><span>The dispute does not involve the disclosure of any student-level information.</span></p>
<p><span>Maria Clayton, the director of communications for CDE,</span> <span>said the agreement “is standard language that CDE has used for years in these types of data-sharing agreements.” </span></p>
<p><span>Reardon said in an email, “It’s perfectly appropriate – even necessary – that CDE or any state agency ensure student privacy and factual correctness when the state’s data is used by external researchers. It is unclear to me, however, how restricting researchers’ freedom to testify in a lawsuit, even an unrelated one, serves the interests of California’s students.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“The restriction does not make research better,” he added,&nbsp; “and does nothing that I can see to protect student privacy. It may limit which researchers are willing or able to work with the state, leaving the state without access to some of the best researchers; and it may limit the effectiveness of litigation that might benefit California’s students.”</span></p>
<h3><b>No restrictions on what researchers can publish</b></h3>
<p><span>The contract does not impose any restrictions on researchers’ ability to independently report what they learn from the data.</span></p>
<p><span>Patrick Shields, the executive director of LPI, said the department doesn’t interfere in how researchers report on their findings. And since LPI is a research organization that does not engage in litigation, it is not affected by the restriction not to testify against the state.</span></p>
<p><span>“We don’t feel restrictions on portraying data as it is. There have been no internal discussions (with the department) that we can’t say this or that,” he said.&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But researchers seek access to analyze data without knowing what they will discover. LPI’s contract with the department, which it calls the California Equity Project, covers a range of topics that have already generated and will produce dozens of studies on teacher shortages, teacher and administrator professional development, homeless students, English learners, foster youths and K-12 achievement and funding gaps.</span></p>
<p><span>Studies using a wide swath of data could lead to legislation, or it could also prompt advocacy organizations like Public Counsel and the ACLU to pursue remedies through the courts </span><span>to fix flaws in state laws or address poor student performance or inequities in funding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>ACLU argues that </span><span>preventing researchers from</span> <span>sharing their expertise with the plaintiffs would be prior restraint and deny</span> <span>the public a full and fair presentation of the issues</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>For this and other reasons, David Plank, the retired executive of Policy Analysis for California Education or PACE, a collaborative research and policy organization based at Stanford and several other universities, said he “would never have signed a contract in which we agreed to protect the interests or reputation of the agency with which we would have signed.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, he said, would be “contrary to the fundamental norms of academic research.”</span></p>

<p>Worldcoin — a new financial system connected to sensitive biometric information,<a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> mostly harvested from poor people</a> — sure <em>sounds</em> like a terrible idea.</p>
<p>“Terrible” doesn’t do it justice.</p>
<p>Worldcoin will need to assemble a vast database of iris data. But not everyone is eager to gaze into an Orb. In the bootstrapping phase, at least, you had to pay people to scan their eyes. And so Worldcoin turned to the global south — home to the cheapest eyeballs — and played a dark game of ‘what will people do for money?’</p>
<p>Incredibly, <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.theblock.co/post/237647/inside-sam-altmans-worldcoin-and-its-quest-to-catalog-all-humans" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Worldcoin was unprepared</a> for an obvious consequence of this rollout strategy: A black market for verified credentials. You can now seemingly <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/BlockBeatsAsia/status/1659060950748782594?s=20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">buy a World ID</a> for as little as $30. Anyone, then, with more than $30 on hand can command more than one digital identity (although Worldcoin is <a node="[object Object]" href="https://gizmodo.com/worldcoin-black-market-iris-data-identity-orb-1850454037" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aware of this issue</a> and has proposed solutions to resolve it). Connecting real people to digital identities is a thorny puzzle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldcoin does not fix this. And it’s unlikely it ever can, since nothing in the design can stop professional sybil attackers farming eyeballs on the ground level through nefarious means.</p>
<p>This does not inspire trust in the system or its designers. And yet trust is what they demand. Worldcoin’s promotional materials are <a node="[object Object]" href="https://worldcoin.org/faqs#data-privacy-&amp;-security" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">full of promises</a> — to delete sensitive biometric information, or keep it hidden from view, or not use it in nefarious ways. One blog post (quoted <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/06/1048981/worldcoin-cryptocurrency-biometrics-web3/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>; the original appears to have been changed since initial release) put it this way: “During our field-testing phase, we are collecting and securely storing more data than we will upon its completion… We will delete all the biometric data we have collected during field testing once our algorithms are fully-trained.”</p>
<p>“Trust us,” in other words. “We’ll totally delete the eyeball database.”</p>
<p>But when it comes to sensitive information, promises aren’t enough. And the very people who insist that you trust them are the ones who should command the most suspicion. The fact that Worldcoin’s co-founder Sam Altman also heads up OpenAI — a firm currently <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/05/authors-file-a-lawsuit-against-openai-for-unlawfully-ingesting-their-books" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">being sued</a> over allegations of dubious uses of large data sets — asks more questions than it answers.</p>
<p>Sometimes Worldcoin’s privacy promises are conjoined with dazzling technical details. Zero-knowledge proofs, we’re told, will save the day, and allow users to prove humanity without connecting any particular financial activity to a World ID or other associated transactions.</p>
<p>There’s a grain of truth here. Zero-knowledge proofs can generate impressive privacy guarantees. But in the case of Worldcoin marketing, they’re more theater than substance. Taking off your shoes at the airport makes it look like important precautions are being taken (but doesn’t actually make you any safer); and <a node="[object Object]" href="https://worldcoin.org/blog/developers/privacy-deep-dive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">long blog posts about zero-knowledge proofs</a> distract from, but don’t in fact address, the problem of Worldcoin asking for users’ trust.</p>
<p>Linking immutable biometric traits to money could have dystopian consequences.</p>
<p>Imagine that your digital identity has been lost in some way — shut down by authorities for non-compliance, or otherwise blocked. With traditional cash — and other cryptocurrencies — you can always make a new wallet and stash some fresh coins in it. But this isn’t <em>Minority Report, </em>and you can’t get a new iris from your neighborhood surgeon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your immutable digital identity is locked — imagine merchants who won’t take your coins from you without a digital signature announcing your World ID — it’s over for you. No old account. No new account. No soup for you. You just lost your digital personhood.</p>
<p>Boosters might reply that, thanks to zero-knowledge proofs, one <em>could</em> prove that a given transaction is associated with a valid World ID without disclosing which World ID that is — thus reducing the risk of total identity blockade. But this reply misses the point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zero-knowledge proofs <em>could</em> be used in benign ways or to preserve user privacy. Or authorities could demand more; they could demand that users reveal all, or be locked out altogether. Setting up a system and simply hoping its full powers of surveillance and control won’t be used is naive, at best.</p>
<h2 id="dystopian-premise-dystopian-premine">Dystopian premise… dystopian premine?</h2>
<p>Worldcoin is billed as a network “<a node="[object Object]" href="https://worldcoin.org/cofounder-letter" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">owned by everyone</a>.” Early promotional materials claim giving “<a node="[object Object]" href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/worldcoin#toggle-gdpr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">every person on the planet an equal share of a new cryptocurrency</a>” as a premise of the project. It sounds laudable. But a glance at the actual plan for distributing tokens casts doubt on whether equal distribution is an aim of the project at all, much less one it will achieve.</p>
<p>It’s a curious ‘world’ coin that <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/worldcoin-not-in-us">isn’t even available</a> in the <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-16/worldcoin-the-eyeball-scanning-crypto-unicorn-hits-signup-snags" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">United States, Turkey, Sudan, or China</a>. And if equal distribution is a goal, allocating a significant chunk <a node="[object Object]" href="https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">of all the tokens that will ever exist to insiders</a> is another curious choice. Early documentation put that insider number at twenty percent; it’s now slated to be at least twenty-five.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who are these insiders? It’s some combination of Worldcoin developers and their partners, Orb operators (with signup bonuses that exhibit a <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1452065666824028160" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pyramid-like structure</a>), and a <a node="[object Object]" href="https://venturebeat.com/consumer/worldcoin-launches-a-global-cryptocurrency-that-will-be-given-to-every-person-on-earth/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">slate of (in)famous investors</a> including Sam Bankman-Fried and Three Arrows Capital. Such self-dealing is not the plan one would expect, to put the point mildly, from an operation with genuine egalitarian ambitions.</p>
<p><strong>Read more from our opinion section:</strong> <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/worldcoin-eyeballs-scan-brooklyn">Worldcoin hackable by cutting off someone’s face, draping it over your own</a></p>
<p>Now that Worldcoin has launched, we know a bit more about how token distribution will work. It is not entirely reassuring.</p>
<p>There’s a well-known crypto trick; they call it a “Sam Coin” (yes, after <a href="https://blockworks.co/tag/sam-bankman-fried">that Sam</a>). The idea is to release into circulation a very small percentage of all the tokens that will ever exist. Despite low liquidity and trading volume, some eye-popping fully diluted market cap numbers can result, which make for great marketing and creative accounting.</p>
<p>Worldcoin — much like MAPS, a <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1588132362847748096" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">notorious crypto dud</a> — <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/DrNickA/status/1683404751164022786" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">is a Sam Coin</a>.</p>
<p>About one percent of the ten billion Worldcoin tokens that will ever exist are in circulation, <a node="[object Object]" href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/07/24/worldcoin-release-tokenomics-report-geofenced-for-some-countries/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">mostly in the hands of market makers partnered with Worldcoin</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet Worldcoin’s fully diluted market cap, at the time of writing, is somewhere around twenty billion dollars. It’s a great setup to attract speculative retail investors. And those market maker insiders, furthermore, have a deal that guarantees them <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/MomoOnChain/status/1683395484738527233" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">access to tokens at a fixed price</a>. Their profits are secure. The result is a market structure <a node="[object Object]" href="https://twitter.com/AriDavidPaul/status/1683627646633013249" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">primed for manipulation and pump and dump dynamics</a> — familiar to anyone who’s paid much attention to crypto.</p>
<p>Worldcoin is no radical new financial system, and certainly not one aimed at equality or fairness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s just more of the same, but with extra data harvesting steps.</p>
<p>Do not look into the Orb.</p>

The Electronic Frontier Foundation will award Alexandra Elbakyan, founder of the 'pirate' library Sci-Hub, for her efforts to provide access to scientific knowledge. According to EFF, Elbakyan's site is a vital resource for millions of students and researchers. Some medical professionals have even argued that the site helped to save lives.
</p>
</div><div>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub1.png" alt="Sci-Hub" width="225" height="281" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20225%20281'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/sci-hub1.png">There are thousands of pirate sites on the Internet but only a few will receive a permanent entry in the history books. That includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub">Sci-Hub</a>. </p>
<p>Founded by Kazakhstani computer programmer Alexandria Elbakyan, the shadow library provides free access to millions of academic publications. As such, it’s an essential tool for less privileged students and researchers around the world. </p>
<h2>Tearing Down Paywalls Since 2011</h2>
<p>Without Sci-Hub, many academics would be unable to complete their research projects. This all comes at the detriment of the profits of major publishers, but many argue that’s an easy tradeoff to make. </p>
<p>Alexandra knows this from experience. She started Sci-Hub after running into accessibility problems more than a decade ago while studying at a less fortunate university.</p>
<p>“When I was working on my research project, I found out that all research papers I needed for work were paywalled. I was a student in Kazakhstan at the time and our university was not subscribed to anything,” Alexandra <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-tears-down-academias-illegal-copyright-paywalls-150627/">told</a> TorrentFreak years ago.</p>
<p>Today, Sci-Hub continues to tear down academic paywalls but that comes at a cost. Sci-Hub has been sued several times and owes millions in damages to major publishers. In addition, Elbakyan also drew the attention of the FBI. </p>
<p>Instead of throwing in the towel, Sci-Hub’s founder continues to defend her ideals. They’re a thorn in the side of major publishers, but on the other side of the debate, Elbakyan reaps praise. </p>
<h2>EFF Award</h2>
<p>This week, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/electronic-frontier-foundation-present-annual-eff-awards-alexandra-asanovna-elbakyan">announced</a> that Sci-Hub’s founder will receive an award for her accomplishments in advancing access to scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>EFF’s awards are presented to people who have taken a leading role in the fight for freedom and innovation online. The previous winners include Internet pioneer Vint Cerf, Linux creator Linus Torvalds, and whistleblower Chelsea Manning.</p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/alexandra-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="292" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20292'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/alexandra-1-scaled.jpg"></center>
<p>According to EFF, Elbakyan deserves the award as her life’s work enables millions of people to access scientific knowledge that would otherwise exist beyond their financial reach.</p>
<p>“Sci-Hub is used by millions of students, researchers, medical professionals, journalists, inventors, and curious people all over the world, many of whom provide feedback saying they are grateful for this access to knowledge.</p>
<p>“Some medical professionals have said Sci-Hub helps save human lives; some students have said they wouldn’t be able to complete their education without Sci-Hub’s help,” EFF adds.</p>
<h2>The Real Threat?</h2>
<p>EFF also highlights that Elbakyan’s work helps to challenge the current academic publishing system, where researchers are used as unpaid workhorses. </p>
<p>“Through Sci-Hub, Elbakyan has strived to shatter academic publishing’s monopoly-like mechanisms in which publishers charge high prices even though authors of articles in academic journals receive no payment,” EFF writes. </p>
<p>Elbakyan previously said that academic publishers are the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-founder-academic-publishers-are-the-real-threat-to-science-not-sci-hub/">real threat</a> to the progress of science as they keep scientific progress and findings behind closed doors, instead of sharing knowledge freely as Sci-Hub does. </p>
<center><img decoding="async" src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg" alt="eff award" width="600" height="458" srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg 1169w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward-300x229.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20458'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg 1169w, https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward-300x229.jpg 300w" data-lazy-src="https://torrentfreak.com/images/effaward.jpg"></center>
<p>In addition to Elbakyan, the digital rights group will also present awards to the <a href="https://libraryfreedom.org/">Library Freedom Project</a> and the <a href="https://signalfoundation.org/en/">Signal Foundation</a> for their achievements.</p>
<h2>‘I Am Sci-Hub’</h2>
<p>Sci-Hub’s founder is <a href="https://twitter.com/ringo_ring/status/1684630479776145410">pleased</a> with EFF’s acknowledgment, although the initial plan to give the award to the Sci-Hub website, rather than her personally, wasn’t well received. </p>
<p>“It was really disgusting to read they ask me to accept their EFF Pioneer award ‘on behalf of Sci-Hub’,” Elbakyan said in <a href="https://twitter.com/ringo_ring/status/1680064493601304576">response</a> two weeks before the awards were officially announced. </p>
<p>“Why did not they want to give the award to me directly? Sci-Hub is my sole creation; it is not an organization and never had any team. In 1998 they awarded Torvalds, not Linux,” she added.</p>
<p>That commentary apparently made EFF reconsider its plan. The award now goes to Elbakyan directly and it will be officially handed out at the awards ceremony in San Francisco this coming September. </p>
<p>EFF previously recognized that it may be challenging for Sci-Hub’s founder to attend the ceremony in person, noting that there are secure methods of communication available in case she prefers to accept it virtually instead. </p>

            <pubDate>Fri, 28 Jul 2023 13:12:15 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tor-dark-web-privacy-secure-browser-anonymous-130048839.html">https://www.engadget.com/tor-dark-web-privacy-secure-browser-anonymous-130048839.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36906284">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“Tor” evokes an image of the dark web; a place to hire hitmen or buy drugs that, at this point, is overrun by feds trying to catch you in the act. The reality, however, is a lot more boring than that — but it’s also more secure.</p>
<p>The Onion Router, now called Tor, is a privacy-focused web browser run by a nonprofit group. You can <a data-i13n="cpos:1;pos:1" href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:1;pos:1;itc:0">download it for free</a> and use it to shop online or browse social media, just like you would on Chrome or Firefox or Safari, but with additional access to unlisted websites ending in .onion. This is what people think of as the “dark web,” because the sites aren’t indexed by search engines. But those sites aren’t an inherently criminal endeavor.</p>
<p>“This is not a hacker tool,” said Pavel Zoneff, director of strategic communications at The Tor Project. “It is a browser just as easy to use as any other browser that people are used to.”</p>
<p>That’s right, despite common misconceptions, Tor can be used for any internet browsing you usually do. The key difference with Tor is that the network hides your IP address and other system information for full anonymity. This may sound familiar, because it’s how a lot of people approach <a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.engadget.com/best-vpn-130004396.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;cpos:2;pos:1;itc:0">VPNs</a>, but the difference is in the details.</p>
<p>VPNs are just encrypted tunnels hiding your traffic from one hop to another. The company behind a VPN can still access your information, sell it or pass it along to law enforcement. With Tor, there’s no link between you and your traffic, according to Jed Crandall, an associate professor at Arizona State University. Tor is built in the “higher layers” of the network and routes your traffic through separate tunnels, instead of a single encrypted tunnel. While the first tunnel may know some personal information and the last one may know the sites you visited, there is virtually nothing connecting those data points because your IP address and other identifying information are bounced from server to server into obscurity.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: using regular browsers directly connects you and your traffic, adding a VPN routes that information through an encrypted tunnel so that your internet service provider can’t see it and Tor scatters your identity and your search traffic until it becomes almost anonymous, and very difficult to identify.</p>
<p>Accessing unindexed websites adds extra perks, like secure communication. While a platform like WhatsApp offers encrypted conversations, there could be traces that the conversation happened left on the device if it’s ever investigated, according to Crandall. Tor's communication tunnels are secure and much harder to trace that the conversation ever happened.</p>
<p>Other use cases may include keeping the identities of sensitive populations like undocumented immigrants anonymous, trying to unionize a workplace without the company shutting it down, victims of domestic violence looking for resources without their abuser finding out or, as Crandall said, wanting to make embarrassing Google searches without related targeted ads following you around forever.</p>
<p>Still, with added layers of security can come some additional hiccups, like lag or longer loading times. That could be true for some users depending on what they do online, but anecdotally it's gotten a lot faster in recent years, and users have said they barely notice a difference compared to other browsers. Sameer Patil, associate professor at the School of Computing at the University of Utah, studied this by having students and staff try out Tor as their main browser. “I was personally very surprised at how many sites and things just work fine in the Tor browser. So not only did they work as intended, but they also were fast enough,” Patil said.</p>
<p>But even if online privacy isn’t your main concern personally, using Tor can help support industries that heavily rely on it. By using the anonymous and secure browser, you’re supporting activists, journalists and everyone else’s privacy because the more people that use it, the more secure it gets, according to Patil. If only certain sensitive groups use it, it’ll be easier to deanonymize and ultimately track down identities. When you’re one in a billion using it, that task becomes nearly impossible.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Starting with the release of iOS 17, tvOS 17, watchOS 10 and macOS Sonoma, developers will be required to explain why they're using so-called required reason APIs. Apps failing to provide a valid reason will be rejected started in spring of 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some APIs... have the potential of being misused to access device signals to try to identify the device or user, also known as fingerprinting. Regardless of whether a user gives your app permission to track, fingerprinting is not allowed," Apple wrote. "To prevent the misuse of certain APIs that can be used to collect data about users’ devices through fingerprinting, you’ll need to declare the reasons for using these APIs in your app’s privacy manifest."</p>
<p>The new rules could increase the rate of app rejections, some developers told <em>9to5Mac</em>. For instance, an API called UserDefaults falls into the "required reason" category, but since it stores user preferences, it's used by a lot of apps. At the same time, it sounds like Apple will basically need to take a developer's word for reason declarations. If those prove to be false, though, it would certainly have a paper trail for any potential penalties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fingerprinting apps can use API calls to retrieve characteristics of your smartphone or PC, including the screen resolution, model, OS and more. It can then take all this information and create a unique "fingerprint," so it can identify you when you go to other apps or websites.</p>

           &quot;section_header&quot;: &quot;Speaking robot: Our new AI model translates vision and language into robotic actions&quot;
         }"><p data-block-key="m1qhn">For decades, when people have imagined the distant future, they’ve almost always included a starring role for robots. Robots have been cast as dependable, helpful and even charming. Yet across those same decades, the technology has remained elusive — stuck in the imagined realm of science fiction.</p><p data-block-key="dj147">Today, we’re introducing a new advancement in robotics that brings us closer to a future of helpful robots. <a href="https://robotics-transformer2.github.io/">Robotics Transformer 2, or RT-2</a>, is a first-of-its-kind vision-language-action (VLA) model. A <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html">Transformer</a>-based model trained on text and images from the web, RT-2 can directly output robotic actions. Just like language models are trained on text from the web to learn general ideas and concepts, RT-2 transfers knowledge from web data to inform robot behavior.</p><p data-block-key="6rulu">In other words, RT-2 can speak robot.</p><h2 data-block-key="dquo8">The real-world challenges of robot learning</h2><p data-block-key="7uvab">The pursuit of <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/making-robots-more-helpful-with-language/">helpful robots</a> has always been a herculean effort, because a robot capable of doing general tasks in the world needs to be able to handle complex, abstract tasks in highly variable environments — especially ones it's never seen before.</p><p data-block-key="6i5n1">Unlike chatbots, robots need “grounding” in the real world and their abilities. Their training isn’t just about, say, learning everything there is to know about an apple: how it grows, its physical properties, or even that one purportedly landed on Sir Isaac Newton’s head. A robot needs to be able to recognize an apple in context, distinguish it from a red ball, understand what it looks like, and most importantly, know how to pick it up.</p><p data-block-key="5d692">That’s historically required training robots on billions of data points, firsthand, across every single object, environment, task and situation in the physical world — a prospect so time consuming and costly as to make it impractical for innovators. Learning is a challenging endeavor, and even more so for robots.</p><h2 data-block-key="f967p">A new approach with RT-2</h2><p data-block-key="12vlp">Recent work has improved robots’ ability to reason, even enabling them to use <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html">chain-of-thought prompting</a>, a way to dissect multi-step problems. The introduction of vision models, like <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/03/palm-e-embodied-multimodal-language.html">PaLM-E</a>, helped robots make better sense of their surroundings. And <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/helping-robots-learn-from-each-other/">RT-1</a> showed that Transformers, known for their ability to generalize information across systems, could even help different types of robots learn from each other.</p><p data-block-key="8qa7i">But until now, robots ran on complex stacks of systems, with high-level reasoning and low-level manipulation systems playing an imperfect game of telephone to operate the robot. Imagine thinking about what you want to do, and then having to tell those actions to the rest of your body to get it to move. RT-2 removes that complexity and enables a single model to not only perform the complex reasoning seen in foundation models, but also output robot actions. Most importantly, it shows that with a small amount of robot training data, the system is able to transfer concepts embedded in its language and vision training data to direct robot actions — even for tasks it’s never been trained to do.</p><p data-block-key="4dl27">For example, if you wanted previous systems to be able to throw away a piece of trash, you would have to explicitly train them to be able to identify trash, as well as pick it up and throw it away. Because RT-2 is able to transfer knowledge from a large corpus of web data, it already has an idea of what trash is and can identify it without explicit training. It even has an idea of how to throw away the trash, even though it’s never been trained to take that action. And think about the abstract nature of trash — what was a bag of chips or a banana peel becomes trash after you eat them. RT-2 is able to make sense of that from its vision-language training data and do the job.</p><h2 data-block-key="f75no">A brighter future for robotics</h2><p data-block-key="esiq6">RT-2’s ability to transfer information to actions shows promise for robots to more rapidly adapt to novel situations and environments. In testing RT-2 models in more than 6,000 robotic trials, the team found that RT-2 functioned as well as our previous model, RT-1, on tasks in its training data, or “seen” tasks. And it almost doubled its performance on novel, unseen scenarios to 62% from RT-1’s 32%.</p><p data-block-key="888en">In other words, with RT-2, robots are able to learn more like we do — transferring learned concepts to new situations.</p><p data-block-key="1atu">Not only does RT-2 show how advances in AI are cascading rapidly into robotics, it shows enormous promise for more general-purpose robots. While there is still a tremendous amount of work to be done to enable helpful robots in human-centered environments, RT-2 shows us an exciting future for robotics just within grasp.</p><p data-block-key="65qo9">Check out the full story on the <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/rt-2-new-model-translates-vision-and-language-into-action?utm_source=keywordblog&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=rt2">Google DeepMind Blog</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
<hr>



<p>As a VyOS evangelist, maintainer, and more, I’ve been meaning to write a simple series of “how-to” guides for VyOS for a while.  Sure, there are plenty of guides out there, but I think a lot of them fall short in demonstrating WHY you are entering specific commands.  </p>



<p>VyOS is capable, but it’s much more helpful if you can fully understand what it’s doing.  </p>



<p>This initial guide will walk through the basic setup steps in replacing something like pfSense or some other consumer router with a simple and secure system running VyOS.  </p>



<p>This is also going to be a very very long post, so buckle in!</p>



<hr>





<hr>



<h2><span id="Who_is_this_For">Who is this For</span></h2>



<p>Anybody that wants to use VyOS of course!  </p>



<p>The nice thing about running VyOS is that if you set up it, and understand <strong><em>WHAT</em></strong> it’s doing, then you’ve actually learned something about networking.  </p>



<p>Does something like pfSense work?  </p>



<p>Sure, but it also doesn’t teach you much about what’s actually going on.  And the knowledge learned in VyOS will easily translate to almost any other vendor like Cisco, Arista, and more.  At that point, the concepts are the same, you are just learning the different dialects. </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Environment">Environment</span></h2>



<p>VyOS really doesn’t take much in resources.  </p>



<p>8GB of storage and 2-4GB of RAM will be overkill for most basic setups.  </p>



<p>CPU-wise, even small Pentium Silver CPUs can handle gigabit and beyond, even over VPN .  Anything like an i3/i5 or a Xeon won’t break a sweat except in all but the most demanding scenarios.</p>



<p>If you virtualize, it can be helpful to set up a test environment.  This could consist of a simple:</p>



<ul><li>WAN Network.  For testing this could be your existing LAN network.</li><li>A new “LAN” Network. For testing this could just be a separate port group or bridge, and it wouldn’t even need an uplink.</li><li>A simple VM with a GUI (or without), to run some testing. </li></ul>



<p>If virtualization isn’t an option, VyOS can run on almost any device that is x86_64.  I’ve run it on everything from:</p>



<ul><li>NUCs with single NICs and USB/USB-C NICs.</li><li><a href="https://blog.kroy.io/2019/12/08/the-wyse-5070-a-perfect-little-vyos-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WYSE 5070/3040 Thin Clients</a>.</li><li>A variety of Dells, including R710s/R620s/R630s.</li><li>Anything Supermicro from 1U to 4U devices.</li></ul>



<p>Finally, for this guide, I’ll be working with two NICs.  </p>



<p>One is a WAN, connected to my current LAN.  I’ll be creating a “network inside a network”.  The second will be our new “LAN”.  This is separate from my existing LAN so I can pretend like it’s a second private network.  These interfaces can be anything:</p>



<ul><li>Physical NICs.</li><li>VLANs.</li><li>Virtual NICs from ESXi, Proxmox, etc.</li></ul>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Install">Install</span></h2>



<p>The first step is to grab yourself a copy of the installer ISO.  </p>



<p>Most people will want the <a href="https://www.vyos.io/rolling-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Release</a>.  You can also build it yourself, via the <a href="https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/build-vyos.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker image</a>, which is helpful if there are some extra packages you want to add.</p>



<p>If you want access to the LTS version, it requires self-building (an easy process), contributing, or a subscription. I <a href="https://blog.vyos.io/vyos-access-subscriptions-for-documentation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly recommend contributing</a>, as even writing or cleaning up some documentation will get you access to the LTS prebuilt versions.  </p>



<p>You can also support and get access via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/vyos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/kUa78LT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BuyMeACoffee</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>Note that for these guides, I will be using a recent version of rolling.  This is important as some configuration nodes have changed locations and format between 1.3+ and the existing LTS versions (DHCP and IPv6 RAs are two things that come to mind).</p>


<div id=""><p>Rolling Stability</p><div><p>
It’s important to note that the rolling releases are generally completely stable.  I would say 95% of them or more are functional without any major bugs.
</p><p>Every once in a while, some broken functionality is pushed, but it is almost always fixed quickly. A broken upgrade is not a show-stopper and it is trivial to boot back into the working version with the built-in <a href="https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/image-mgmt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Image Management</a>.</p>
<p>I have no issues running rolling releases in many production locations.<br>
</p></div></div>



<h2><span id="Install_Steps">Install Steps</span></h2>



<p>Installation is trivial:</p>



<ul><li>Burn ISO to CD/DVD/USB stick, or boot ISO via remote management (iDrac, iLo, IPMI)</li><li>Login with <code><em>vyos</em></code>/<code><em>vyos</em></code></li><li>Type <code><em>install image</em></code></li><li>Answer the install steps</li><li>Reboot and remove installation media</li></ul>


<div id=""><p>Installation Gotchas</p><div>
<ul>
<li> The installer ISO is a fully functional VyOS image.  That means if you skip the <em>install image</em> step, you can configure the system, and it will work as intended… until you reboot.  Don’t be me.  Make sure to install if you want a permanent installation.
</li><li> Some systems that lack a serial port get stuck on a black screen on the installer ISO.  The simple fix is to edit the grub boot option line and remove the <em>console=ttyS0,115200</em> option from the kernel boot arguments.  Then just boot with <em>CTRL-X</em> as directed.
</li></ul>
</div></div>

<p>Once installed, you’ll be staring at the login screen.  Login with <code>vyos</code> and the password you set up during install:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="723" height="408" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png 723w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png 723w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-300x169.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<hr>



<h3><span id="Decision_Time">Decision Time!</span></h3>



<p>Before you go any further, you need to make a decision.  You need to pick out the subnet (or later subnets) where your network will live.  Or, if you are converting over your existing network, just reuse it.</p>



<p>These should be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network">RFC1918 addresses</a>.  You generally want a /24, which is 254 usable addresses.</p>



<p>So, there are three main groups of these private addresses you can choose from:</p>



<ul><li><code>10.X.Y.1-254</code>, where <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are any number between 0 and 255.  For the last number, 0 would be your “network” address, and 255 would be your broadcast address.  You could then assign all your hosts to 1-254.</li><li><code>172.X.Y.1-254</code>, in this case <code>X</code> would be between 16 and 31, and <code>Y</code> could be 0 to 255. </li><li><code>192.168.X.1-254</code>, where <code>X</code> is between 0 and 255.  </li></ul>



<div id=""><p>Subnetting Pro-tips</p><div>
<p>Many routers around the world off-the-shelf use a subnet like 10.0.0.0/24 or 192.168.0.0/24.</p>
<p>
While you can use these subnets, future-you will hate yourself if you ever want to access your network remotely or access other networks when both sides are using the same subnet.
</p>
<p>
I would highly recommend:
</p><ul>
 	<li>Choose a subnet away from the norm.  For example, 10.32.47.0/24.</li>
 	<li>If you want to plan ahead and are planning to break things out on VLANs, use a subnet like 10.32.X.0/24.  That way, in the future, X can represent your VLAN number, and you can do a summary route like 10.32.0.0/16.  I’ll be showing some examples of where this can be used later on in this post.</li></ul>

</div></div>



<hr>



<h3><span id="Configuring_the_LAN_and_Remote_access">Configuring the LAN and Remote access</span></h3>



<p>After the subnet is chosen, the first step is to get the router on the LAN and accessible via SSH.  This makes it much easier to configure, as you are no longer tethered to a keyboard/monitor, VM console, can copy/paste, etc.  </p>



<h4><span id="LAN_IP">LAN IP</span></h4>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter configure mode</li><li>Add address to the correct interface</li><li>Commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>The first step is to enter configure mode.  This allows you to make changes to the system configuration.  Type <code>configure</code>.  VyOS also supports shortcuts and tab completion, so typing <code>conf</code> or <code>conf&lt;TAB&gt;</code> will do the same thing.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="336" height="135" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png 336w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 336px) 100vw, 336px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png 336w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5-300x121.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-5.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>The prompt will change to include <code>#</code>, and the <code>[edit]</code> line will appear to designate that you are in configure mode.</p>



<p>Next, you need to add your LAN IP.  You can check your interfaces by typing <code>run show interfaces</code>.  This tells VyOS to show all the interfaces in operational mode (the mode you were in before you typed <code>conf</code>).</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png" alt="" width="580" height="98" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4-300x51.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png 600w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4-300x51.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-4.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>In my case, <code>eth1</code> is attached to my LAN here.  I’m going to use the subnet from above, <code>10.32.0.0/24</code>.  I prefer to use <code>.1</code> for my routers, but you can use any IP in that range.</p>



<p>There are two methods to assign it once in <code>conf</code> mode.  Either with the full path, or by drilling-down.</p>



<p>Full path:</p>



<pre><code>configure
set interfaces ethernet eth1 address 10.32.0.1/24
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description LAN
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>Drill down:</p>



<pre><code>configure
edit interfaces ethernet eth1
set address 10.32.0.1/24
set description LAN
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>Committing makes the configuration active, and saving saves it to disk so it will persist on a reboot.</p>

<h4><span id="Set_up_DHCP">Set up DHCP</span></h4>



<p>Now that that router has a LAN IP, it’s time to connect your laptop/desktop/etc up to it.  </p>



<p>You can assign it a static IP in the chosen subnet (<code>10.32.0.10/24</code> for example), but I imagine you are also going to want to assign a DHCP range for automatic configuration of clients.</p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter configure mode</li><li>Set up DHCP ranges</li><li>commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>Let’s talk about the following config.  </p>



<p>We are going to make two DHCP ranges, and leave some holes.  This would allow us to assign the IP addresses between <code>.2</code> and <code>.49</code> for static or other uses, as well as <code>.126-199</code> and <code>.251-254</code>.</p>



<p>While this is a non-standard usage, it demonstrates the capabilities. Many people would just have a single range. </p>



<pre><code>set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 0 start 10.32.0.50
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 0 stop 10.32.0.125
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 1 start 10.32.0.200
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 range 1 stop 10.32.0.250</code></pre>



<p>Some other important config options follow.   </p>



<p>You want to tell the DHCP server to hand out the router’s IP address as the default gateway and DNS.  This will make it so (eventually), your LAN devices will have DNS and routing to the Internet:</p>



<pre><code>set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 dns-server 10.32.0.1
set service dhcp-server shared-network-name LAN subnet 10.32.0.0/24 default-router 10.32.0.1</code></pre>


<div id=""><p>DNS Alert</p><p>This would also be the place to insert something like your pi-hole or active directory DNS server.  In the above example, your pi-hole/ADDNS address or addresses would be where the dns-server option is. </p></div>

<hr>



<h4><span id="SSH">SSH</span></h4>



<p>The final step before we can access the router over SSH is to actually enable SSH:</p>



<pre><code>set service ssh port 22
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>At this point you ought to be able to hook up a LAN client, and verify that you have an IP, gateway, and DNS.  </p>



<p>This is a fairly stock Debian VM I set up.  As you can see, my IP is in one of my DHCP ranges, and my DNS and default route are the router’s IP. </p>



<p>This is on Linux, but the same thing could be confirmed on Windows or MacOS:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="736" height="472" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png 736w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png 736w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16-300x192.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-16.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>From there, you should be able to ssh into the router with the username <code>vyos</code> and password you set up during install:<br></p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="541" height="191" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png 541w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13-300x106.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 541px) 100vw, 541px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png 541w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13-300x106.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>And typing <code>show configuration</code> (in op mode), should show you the work done so far.  VyOS also comes with a few defaults, like NTP servers configured.</p>

<h2><span id="NAT_DNS">NAT &amp; DNS</span></h2>



<h3><span id="NAT">NAT</span></h3>



<p>The next important duty for a router and firewall is to be able to NAT.  NAT allows all your private LAN devices to access the Internet.  </p>


<div id=""><p>Information Dump</p><div><p>
Back when the Internet started, every device had a unique IP address. 
</p><p>Unfortunately, because of the numbering scheme used, there are only 4.2 billion of these address, at least in IPv4, and the transition to IPv6 is far from complete.</p>
<p>Because of this, every device on your network needs to be able to “pretend” that it is your router to access the Internet.  Your router keeps track of which requests belong to which device.  </p>
<p>Source NAT is what allows you to do this.</p>
<p>This is also where the above mentioned “summary route” can come into play.  Instead of creating three separate NAT rules for 10.32.1.0/24, 10.32.2.0/24, and 10.32.3.0/24, you can create a single rule for 10.32.0.0/16.<br>
</p></div></div>



<p>For this setup, it’s important to identify which network interface will eventually be your WAN interface, even though it’s not configured yet.</p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>As before, enter configuration mode.</li><li>Set up a source NAT rule to target our LAN or LAN subnets.</li><li>Define the outgoing WAN interface on the rule.</li><li>Set the translation type of the rule to <code>masquerade</code>. </li></ul>



<hr>



<p>The type of NAT we will be using is called <code>SOURCE NAT</code>.  This type of NAT is going to have three components:</p>



<ul><li>Target all traffic from our LAN or LANs…</li><li>… when the traffic is going out to the Internet through this outgoing interface…</li><li>… Change the IP address from the LAN IP to the WAN IP</li></ul>



<p>To do this:</p>



<pre><code>set nat source rule 100 source address '10.32.0.0/24'
set nat source rule 100 outbound-interface 'eth0'
set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>In the above example, the <code>100</code> is an arbitrary number (between 1-9999).  The <code>eth0</code> is my eventual WAN interface.  <code>masquerade</code> translates the internal LAN IP to your public WAN IP.  </p>

<p>Once we set up our WAN interface, we’ll be able to type <code>show nat source rules</code> in op mode, or <code>run show nat source rules</code> in conf mode to run the op mode command, it will be clear what’s happening.</p>



<hr>



<h3><span id="DNS">DNS</span></h3>



<p>The next step is to set up our VyOS instance as for DNS.  This will allow you to use local DNS and caching instead of your ISP’s, but also eventually will allow you run custom DNS and hosts. </p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter config mode</li><li>Set the DNS Listen Address</li><li>Set the subnets we are allowing from</li><li>Set the cache size to 0</li><li>commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<pre><code>set service dns forwarding listen-address '10.32.0.1'
set service dns forwarding allow-from '10.32.0.0/24'
set service dns forwarding cache-size '0'
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>As mentioned, this accomplishes three things.  </p>



<ul><li>It tells VyOS to listen for DNS requests on its LAN IP, <code>10.32.0.1</code>.  </li><li>It limits requests from your LAN subnet.  </li><li>Finally, it sets the cache size to 0.  This is good to start out with to make sure everything is working, but later you can bump it up to speed up multiple requests for the same sites. </li></ul>



<hr>


<div id=""><p>Opportunity Alert</p><div><p>
This is another opportunity to use the “summary” route that I’ve mentioned a few times.  
</p><p>Instead of allowing “10.32.0.0/24”, you would allow “10.32.0.0/16”.  This would ensure that as you add VLANs and subnets, your DNS will just work without adding a long list of /24s.<br>
</p></div></div>



<hr>

<hr>



<h4><span id="DNS_Forwarding">DNS Forwarding</span></h4>



<p>There is one more consideration to be made.  As configured, your DNS server will run in “recursor” mode.  This means it will take responsibility for fully resolving DNS on its own.  This may be a bad thing for a number of reasons:</p>



<ul><li>It leaks your IP to potential undesirables.  </li><li>It’s almost always slower, as you don’t get to benefit from the caches of a large service like CloudFlare or Google.  </li></ul>



<p>It’s quite simple to set up in forwarding mode, meaning when you make a DNS request, you end up asking an upstream resolver.  </p>



<p>In the following example, we’ll be using CloudFlare and Google:</p>



<pre><code>set service dns forwarding name-server 1.1.1.1
set service dns forwarding name-server 1.0.0.1
set service dns forwarding name-server 8.8.8.8
set service dns forwarding name-server 8.8.4.4
commit
save</code></pre>

<hr>



<h4><span id="System_DNS">System DNS</span></h4>



<p>One final step is to set the DNS for VyOS itself.  Everything we’ve done so far has just set up VyOS to be a DNS server for your clients.</p>



<p>This will be the DNS that is used, for example, when you do a VyOS update, ping or traceroute from VyOS, etc.</p>



<p>The easiest thing to do if you’ve been following this guide, is just to use the DNS server you set up above:</p>



<pre><code>set system name-server 10.32.0.1
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>This is also another spot where if you wanted to use Google, CloudFlare, or AD-DNS, you could plug in that IP:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png" alt="" width="760" height="276" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png 760w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png 760w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13-300x109.png 300w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-13.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>Alternatively, you call tell VyOS to use the DNS servers that it received from your WAN DHCP server with:</p>



<pre><code>set system name-servers-dhcp eth0</code></pre>







<hr>



<h2><span id="Firewall">Firewall</span></h2>



<p>If you’ve made it this far, congrats!  We are almost there! </p>



<p>This section will cover the creation of a zone-based firewall, which is far superior to the default method of attaching firewalls to interfaces.  </p>



<p>The reason it is superior is simple.  It’s a bit more hassle to set up, but it’s far easier to manage on an ongoing basis, plus, you start thinking about firewalling as flows of information from interface to interface.</p>



<hr>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Enter configuration mode</li><li>Create a firewall to allow all LAN traffic.</li><li>Create firewall to allow all LAN traffic to access VyOS itself.</li><li>Create a firewall to protect the router itself from WAN.</li><li>Create a firewall to protect LAN devices from WAN.</li><li>Commit</li><li>Create LOCAL/LAN zones.</li><li>Assign appropriate interfaces to zones.</li><li>Commit and save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>For as complex as firewalling seems, it’s actually pretty simple when you break it down.  </p>



<p>A firewall tracks connection “states” to determine what is and is not allowed.  This is where packets are originating and going to, ports involved, types of traffic like TCP/UDP/ICMP, and more.  </p>



<p>We are going to build a very simple firewall that assumes that we want to block everything externally, and allow everything from LAN.</p>



<p>So let’s dig right into it.</p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="LAN">LAN</span></h2>



<p>First, create a firewall that will allow our LAN to access everything. This is a setup that would mimic what most consumer routers do:</p>



<pre><code>conf
set firewall name LAN-WAN default-action accept
set firewall name LAN-LOCAL default-action accept
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>The <code>LAN-WAN</code> and the <code>LAN-LOCAL</code> can be arbitrarily named anything.  I use this naming scheme because as mentioned above, it’s better to think about firewalls as controlling the flow of information through the router, and these names are self-documenting.</p>



<p><code>LOCAL</code> is a specific VyOS designation that means “this router”.  When you are attaching the firewall in the zones, LOCAL will be what you use to control traffic destined to the firewall itself.  </p>



<p>As should be obvious, we are just allowing everything.  But you can set whatever rules you wanted.  <code>LAN-WAN</code> would generally remain pretty open as it would be uncommon to block your own access to the Internet, but <code>LAN-LOCAL</code> might contain rules to maybe allow only specific devices access to manage the VyOS router.</p>



<p>Also note that we are just creating the firewalls here.  They don’t become active until you attach them to the zones.</p>

<h2><span id="LOCAL">LOCAL</span></h2>



<p>As mentioned, the <code>LOCAL</code> zone is traffic destined for the VyOS router itself.  </p>



<p>In most cases, it will have a similar ruleset to the LAN one above, as most people want their router to have full access to the Internet and their LAN devices:</p>



<pre><code>conf
set firewall name LOCAL-WAN default-action accept
set firewall name LOCAL-LAN default-action accept
commit
save</code></pre>


<div id=""><p>Food for Thought</p><div>
<p>While I might be getting a little ahead of myself here, it’s important to note that you could use the same firewall instead of creating four different firewalls as we’ve done here.  The firewalls are just attached to interfaces or zones by names, so there’s nothing really stopping you from creating a single firewall and attaching it to four different places.</p>
<p>As a bit of a pro-tip though, I would recommend not doing this.  Eventually you’ll want them broken out, and it’s far more of a hassle to do it later than to just do it during initial setup.<br>
</p></div></div>

<h2><span id="WAN">WAN</span></h2>



<p>The <code>WAN</code> zone is where we are actually going to do most of our work.  </p>



<p>The basic goal here will be two things.  To block all access to the router itself, and to provide basic setup and template for future things like port forwarding to our LAN.  </p>



<p>When you start moving data to and from the Internet, that’s when you need to start worrying about the state tracking I mentioned before.  </p>



<p>For both LOCAL and LAN traffic, we’ll be setting up what’s known as a “stateful firewall”.  </p>



<p>In stateful firewalling, there are three main states to worry about:</p>



<ul><li>New – Traffic in a <code>NEW</code> state is the first packet from a destination to a source.  Allowing or denying this packet ultimately determines whether the traffic will be allowed.</li><li>Established – Once traffic from <code>NEW</code> has been allowed, the subsequent packets are marked as <code>ESTABLISHED</code>.  This is essentially traffic that has already been allowed by other rules.  This is another basic requirement for a working stateful firewall.</li><li>Related – This means that this is traffic that is somehow related to already allowed traffic.  Also required.</li></ul>


<div id=""><p>A note about rule numbers</p><div><p>
As with the NAT rule numbers, the rule numbers you use for firewall are arbitrary.
</p><p>With that said, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t plan ahead a bit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rules are processed numerically, so for fastest firewalling and routing, you definitely want your ESTABLISHED/RELATED rule at the top.  That ensures that existing traffic, which is going to be the bulk of the traffic your firewall processes, only has to look at a single rule.</li>
<li>Leave yourself some gaps for future rules.  You’ll appreciate it later if you want to insert a new rule before an existing one, though you can always rename and move around.</li>
</ul></div></div>



<hr>



<h3><span id="WAN-LOCAL">WAN-LOCAL</span></h3>



<p>As mentioned, the <code>WAN-LOCAL</code> firewall is traffic destined for the VyOS router itself.  In the future, this will be where you allow traffic, say to your WireGuard port for VPN.</p>



<p>The first rule we want to build is to allow all <code>ESTABLISHED</code> and <code>RELATED</code> traffic.  So we’ll:</p>



<ul><li>Create the WAN-LOCAL firewall.  </li><li>Set the default policy on the firewall to drop everything.  </li><li>Create a rule to accept specific traffic for rule.</li><li>Set the match for the rule to our established and related states.</li><li>Set a description for ease of use later.</li></ul>







<pre><code>set firewall name WAN-LOCAL default-action drop
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 action accept
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 state established enable
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 state related enable
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 5 description "Allow EST/Related Traffic"
commit
save</code></pre>

<hr>



<p>The next rule we want on is to allow ICMP.  Many people like to block this, but not me.  I’ll defer to <a href="http://shouldiblockicmp.com/">ShouldIBlockICMP.com</a> on this.</p>



<ul><li>Create a new rule matching ICMP</li><li>Match the state of <code>NEW</code>. This is what actually matches the unknown traffic to allow</li><li>Allow the traffic</li><li>Commit and save</li></ul>



<pre><code>set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 20 protocol icmp
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 20 state new enable
set firewall name WAN-LOCAL rule 20 action accept
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>And you can see that the firewall is created (but still not attached to any interfaces), by doing the <code>op mode</code> command <code>show interfaces</code>.</p>

<h3><span id="WAN-LAN">WAN-LAN</span></h3>



<p>For now, the <code>WAN-LAN</code> firewall is identical to the <code>WAN-LOCAL</code>.  In the future, this is where you will allow your port forward rules, or other traffic you want to send to your LAN devices, so it’s helpful to break it out beforehand.</p>



<p>As before, we create the firewall, set it to drop by default, allowed EST/RELATED, and allow ICMP, which won’t do anything now, but could be helpful in the future:</p>



<pre><code>set firewall name WAN-LAN default-action drop
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 action accept
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 state established enable
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 state related enable
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 5 description "Allow EST/Related Traffic"
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 20 protocol icmp
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 20 state new enable
set firewall name WAN-LAN rule 20 action accept</code></pre>



<p>Don’t forget you can dive down into levels as in the following example:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="1002" height="672" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png 1002w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-300x201.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-768x515.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png 1002w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-300x201.png 300w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2-768x515.png 768w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-2.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<hr>



<p>Finally!  We have our firewalls set up and ready to deploy.  </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="WAN_and_Zones">WAN and Zones</span></h2>



<p>If you’ve been paying attention, we still don’t have one <em>VERY</em> important piece to this puzzle. We still don’t have WAN access!</p>



<p>Of course I did this to protect your router during the initial setup phase.  Until you have firewalls ready to deploy, you probably don’t want to be kicking your brand new VyOS install out on the open Internet.  </p>



<hr>



<h2><span id="Zones">Zones</span></h2>



<p>Zones are easily one of my favorite parts of VyOS, and something that in my opinion, puts it lightyears ahead of other firewall solutions.</p>



<p>Especially as your firewalling needs grow, zones just make it so <em>EASY</em>.  As I sort of touched on, zones are a bit more work initially, but save you <em>MUCH</em> more time in the future.</p>


<div id=""><p>Lockout Alert</p><div><p>
Be careful and pay attention here.  
</p><p>If you mistype something and are still configuring VyOS over SSH, you can potentially lock yourself out.<br>
</p></div></div>



<p>The naming scheme as I’ve outlined above should be helpful here when creating our firewall zones.  It basically says <code>FROMZONE-&gt;TOZONE</code></p>



<p>So let’s run through the whole thing.  </p>



<p>Goals:</p>



<ul><li>Set the default action for the zone.  This should always be drop to cover yourself in case you miss something.</li><li>Apply the “For traffic from X zone to current zone, attach Y firewall”</li><li>Add the interfaces that are part of this zone</li><li>Repeat for all zones</li><li>commit</li><li>save</li></ul>



<hr>



<p>So what does this look like for the LAN:</p>



<ul><li>In this example we are working on the LAN zone</li><li>We drop everything by default</li><li>We assign the <code>WAN-LAN</code> firewall to traffic from any interface in the below <code>WAN</code> zone</li><li>Similarly for the <code>LOCAL-LAN</code>.  This is traffic from the VyOS instance itself to LAN hosts.</li><li>We put <code>eth1</code> in our LAN zone.</li></ul>



<pre><code>set zone-policy zone LAN default-action drop
set zone-policy zone LAN from WAN firewall name WAN-LAN
set zone-policy zone LAN from LOCAL firewall name LOCAL-LAN
set zone-policy zone LAN interface eth1


</code></pre>



<hr>



<p>Repeat all steps for the <code>LOCAL</code> zone.  The major difference here is the <code>local-zone</code> designation.  As I’ve mentioned a few times, <code>LOCAL</code> is a special designation that means “this firewall”, so you don’t attach interfaces:</p>



<pre><code>set zone-policy zone LOCAL local-zone
set zone-policy zone LOCAL from LAN firewall name LAN-LOCAL
set zone-policy zone LOCAL from WAN firewall name WAN-LOCAL
set zone-policy zone LOCAL default-action drop
</code></pre>



<hr>



<p>Finally, the WAN zone is basically the same as the LAN zone. The only major change you should notice is that I just changed the firewall names and interface name:</p>



<pre><code>set zone-policy zone WAN from LAN firewall name LAN-WAN
set zone-policy zone WAN from LOCAL firewall name LOCAL-WAN
set zone-policy zone WAN interface eth0
set zone-policy zone WAN default-action drop</code></pre>

<hr>



<p>If you were like me, you might have tried committing between steps.  Unfortunately, if you don’t set up everything at once, you’ll quickly discover that zones are interdependent on one another.  This happens because I’ve created the LAN zone, but the referenced WAN and LOCAL zones don’t exist yet.</p>

<h3><span id="Show_your_work">Show your work</span></h3>



<p>Hopefully, if you’ve done everything correctly, you should see all your zone policies set up under the <code>op mode</code> command <code>run show zone-policy</code>.  This view should make it obvious which traffic is flowing through what firewall:</p>

<h2><span id="WAN_Setup">WAN Setup</span></h2>



<p>Finally, here we are.  </p>



<p>Setting up your WAN. If you’ve made it this far, congrats.  You are basically 1 or 2 commands away from having a working router and firewall!</p>



<p>There are multiple ways to get a WAN address.  For simplicity’s sake, I’ll just cover two of them here, static and DHCP assignment.  For something like PPPoE, you’ll need a few more steps.</p>



<h3><span id="DHCP_Assignment">DHCP Assignment</span></h3>



<p>DHCP is when your router asks your ISP’s servers for what it should use for its IP address and routing information.  This is accomplished with one simple command (well, four if you add a description to the interface, and commit and save):</p>



<pre><code>set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description WAN
commit
save</code></pre>



<p>You can verify that the setup is complete with the <code>op mode</code> commands <code>run show interfaces</code> and <code>run show ip route</code>.  (I have some debug variables set, so ignore the extra output:</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" width="988" height="1024" src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-988x1024.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-988x1024.png 988w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-290x300.png 290w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-768x796.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8.png 1490w" sizes="(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px" data-srcset="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-988x1024.png 988w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-290x300.png 290w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-768x796.png 768w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-1482x1536.png 1482w, https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8.png 1490w" data-src="https://blog.kroy.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-8-988x1024.png" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></figure>



<p>In the above output, <code>10.21.21.57</code> is the IP address I was assigned via DHCP.  The <code>show ip route</code> verifies that I have a default route.</p>


<div id=""><p>Information Dump</p><div><p>
Your “gateway” or default route, is the router your devices ask when they encounter an IP address that they don’t know how to get to.
</p><p>In the networking world, this is represented by <em>0.0.0.0/0</em>, which is a shortcut for <strong><em>the entire Internet</em></strong></p>
<p>So in the above example, this VyOS knows how to talk directly to anything in the 10.21.21.0/24 or 10.32.0.0/24 subnets because they are directly connected.  Anything outside of that, it needs to ask 10.21.21.1 for a route to it.<br>
</p></div></div>



<h3><span id="Static_IP">Static IP</span></h3>



<p>Static IPs just skip the automatic configuration.  It’s up to your ISP how this is configured, but usually it’s an extra step, manually applying your default route.</p>



<p>So to duplicate my above DHCP configuration:</p>



<pre><code>set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 10.21.21.57/24
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 10.21.21.1
commit

<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, I forgot the exact format, so I hit my <code>&lt;TAB&gt;</code> button to get hints:</p>

<p>Assuming nothing has gone wrong, you should be able to verify everything with the <code>op mode</code> command <code>ping</code>.  So let’s hit Google with 4 pings:</p>



<p><code>run ping www.google.com count 4</code></p>



<p>If all goes well, you should see a response:</p>

<p>We’ve spoken about arcade <em>Tron</em> a few times here on the blog over the years. Specifically, I shared some development documents a few months back <a href="https://arcadeblogger.com/2022/07/10/the-lost-tron-arcade-documents/">here</a>.</p>



<p>For those of you that don’t know, <em>Tron </em>essentially became two games – the regular <em>Tron</em> game with the four stages, and the spin off game, <em>Discs of Tron</em>.</p>

<p>Released in 1983, it was felt that <em>Discs of Tron</em> could stand as its own game, and is the rarer of the two. The game was released as what’s known as an ‘environmental’ cabinet, designed to immerse the player literally ‘inside’ the action.</p>

<p><em>Environmental Discs of Tron</em> (or <em>EDOT</em> for short) is arguably the most complex arcade cabinet of the Golden Age of videogaming. Working examples are hard to come by, and when they do, you can expect to pay handsomely for one! </p>



<p>What sets this game apart, is the thought that went into the cabinet design. Brian Colin (who we interviewed on the podcast a while back <a href="https://www.teddabneyexperience.com/episodes/tde/ep10/briancolin">here</a>), worked extensively on the game. Have a listen to his recollections of what made the game and cabinet so special.</p>



<p>So, finding one of these glorious pieces is a challenge these days. But can you imagine stumbling across one dumped in the street? Well, that’s exactly what happened to my friend <a href="https://www.timlapetino.com/">Tim Lapetino</a> recently.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was visiting my family in the Chicago suburbs recently, when my niece mentioned she saw “some TRON thing” sitting on a curb while she was riding her bike through the neighbourhood.<br>Of course we jumped in the car to go take a look, as it was just blocks away from where my parents and other family live. As we drove up to the spot, I uttered “What the &amp;*@$?!” forgetting that my niece was in the car with us. And would you believe it – there it was. An EDOT was sitting by the curb</p>
<cite>Tim Lapetino</cite></blockquote>

<p>So remarkably, it seems that this cabinet was owned by a local resident, and it had clearly been dragged down the driveway and left out on the sidewalk with the assumption that the garbage men would take it away. However, it was too large for them to load onto the garbage truck. So it had been sat there for a few days:</p>

<p>Not one to miss such an incredible opportunity, Tim immediately called a couple of friends and asked for recommendations on moving such a large cabinet. He got hold of his buddy who owns the local <em><a href="https://loganarcade.com/">Logan Arcade</a></em> for advice on how to safely move a 700lb arcade cabinet!</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So, my brother went and picked up ratchet straps and furniture dollies at a nearby store while I waited there, standing in the driveway of a stranger, like a goofball. But there was no way I was going to leave the machine without taking it with me!</p>
<cite>Tim Lapetino</cite></blockquote>



<p>While his brother was at the local Harbor Freight store gathering the gear required to move the cabinet, Tim decided to knock on the door of the owner. A woman answered and explained that the <em>EDOT</em> had sat in her garage for many years and she wanted to get shot of it. Tim was welcome to take it away for free, but she didn’t really want to discuss the machine’s provenance – Where was it from? Who acquired it?</p>



<p>Not one to argue, Tim and his brother loaded the cabinet onto the dollies and strapped everything down.</p>

<p>So not only was this a free game and one of the rarest arcade cabinets you could possibly find, it is clearly in incredible shape and everything looks to be all original!</p>



<p>Just one thing was missing – the large <em>TRON</em> back glass. Tim has ordered a repro and will be searching for an original.</p>

<p>Well I’m calling this find of the year! Dumped by the roadside and rejected by the local garbage collectors. By rights this thing could easily have been smashed into a thousand pieces (in fact it shouldn’t have been there in the first place!), but saved by Tim from the jaws of destruction!</p>

<p>Just to add context, this is absolutely my holy grail game! I don’t own any other arcade machines, but being a huge TRON fan and a lover of this game, this would have been my ideal game to (someday) own, and here it was just sitting blocks away from where my relatives live! I don’t really believe in coincidences, and this is an absolutely nuts story.</p>
<cite>Tim Lapetino</cite></blockquote>



<p>What a find. And a fantastic result for Tim – I couldn’t think of a safer (and more deserving) pair of hands for this beautiful piece of history to fall into. Nice work!</p>



<p>Meantime, the game is getting plenty of play, not only by Tim, but his two kids too, who have take a real shine to the immersive <em>EDOT</em> experience:</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>On the future of free long term support for Linux distributions</h2>

	<p><small>July 27, 2023</small></p>
</div><div><p>One of the things that's quite popular with people out in the world
is being able to set up a Linux server and then leave it be for the
better part of a decade without having to reinstall it or upgrade
the distribution. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSUsageCases">I believe this is a significant reason people
used CentOS</a>, and it's popular enough to support
similar things in other distributions. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/ZombieDistroVersions">I'm not fond of these old
zombie distribution versions</a>, but even we
have some of them (running CentOS 7). However, I'm broadly pessimistic
about people being able to get this for free in the future (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110695820822065790">cf</a>), and I'm also
pessimistic about even the current five year support period you get
for things like Canonical's Ubuntu LTS releases. To put it one way,
Red Hat's move is not unique; <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110613666965100965">Canonical is monetizing Ubuntu too</a>.</p>

<p>The reality is that <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110697536782034559">reliable backports of security fixes is
expensive</a> (partly
because <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/programming/BackportsAreHard">backports are hard in general</a>).
The older a distribution version is, generally the more work is
required. To generalize somewhat, this work does not get done for
free; someone has to pay for it.</p>

<p>To date, this public good has broadly been provided for free for
various periods of time by Debian developers, Red Hat, Canonical,
and so on. <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSStreamBigChanges">Red Hat's switch from 'CentOS' to 'CentOS Stream'</a> and now <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/CentOSUsageCases">their change to how Stream works</a> marks Red Hat ceasing to provide this public
good for free; it's now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110757392256002113">fairly likely</a> to be a more or
less private, for pay thing. Canonical has never provided this
public good beyond five years (<a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/UbuntuBugReportsUseless">and in practice only to a limited
extent</a>), and now <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110613666965100965">there are signs they're
going to limit this in various ways</a> (<a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110614121219974149">also</a>). Debian has sort
of provided this only <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/DebianVsUbuntuForUs">semi-recently</a>, in the
form of <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">non-official five year support</a>
(and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Extended">extended paid support</a>).
I'm not sure about the practical state of openSUSE but <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Lifetime">see their
lifetime page for the current claims</a>.</p>

<p>(Oracle claims to provide extended support for free but <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110697536782034559">I don't
trust Oracle one bit</a>.)</p>

<p>People using Linux distributions have for years been in the fortunate
position that companies with money were willing to fund a lot of
painstaking work and then make the result available for free. One
of the artifacts of this was free distributions with long support
periods. My view is that this supply of corporate money is in the
process of drying up, and with it will go that free long term
support. This won't be a pleasant process.</p>

<p>The whole thing is <a href="https://mastodon.social/@cks/110695820822065790">why I said that people who wanted a decade of
free support would need good luck</a>. Maybe a way can
be found to squeeze through the roadblocks that the people providing
the money are trying to throw in the way (and the money will keep
flowing, because one end game is that Red Hat and Canonical exit
the long term Linux distribution business).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>Directfs is now the default in runsc. This feature gives gVisor’s application
kernel (the Sentry) secure direct access to the container filesystem, avoiding
expensive round trips to the filesystem gofer. Learn more about this feature in
the following blog that was
<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/optimizing-gvisor-filesystems-with-directfs.html">originally posted</a>
on <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/">Google Open Source Blog</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="origins-of-the-gofer">Origins of the Gofer</h2>

<p>gVisor is used internally at Google to run a variety of services and workloads.
One of the challenges we faced while building gVisor was providing remote
filesystem access securely to the sandbox. gVisor’s strict
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/docs/architecture_guide/security/">security model</a> and
defense in depth approach assumes that the sandbox may get compromised because
it shares the same execution context as the untrusted application. Hence the
sandbox cannot be given sensitive keys and credentials to access Google-internal
remote filesystems.</p>

<p>To address this challenge, we added a trusted filesystem proxy called a “gofer”.
The gofer runs outside the sandbox, and provides a secure interface for
untrusted containers to access such remote filesystems. For architectural
simplicity, gofers were also used to serve local filesystems as well as remote.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-gofer-proxy.svg" alt="Figure 1" title="Filesystem gofer proxy" width="100%"></p>

<h2 id="isolating-the-container-filesystem-in-runsc">Isolating the Container Filesystem in runsc</h2>

<p>When gVisor was <a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor">open sourced</a> as
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/docs/">runsc</a>, the same gofer model was copied over to
maintain the same security guarantees. runsc was configured to start one gofer
process per container which serves the container filesystem to the sandbox over
a predetermined protocol (now
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/pkg/lisafs">LISAFS</a>). However, a gofer
adds a layer of indirection with significant overhead.</p>

<p>This gofer model (built for remote filesystems) brings very few advantages for
the runsc use-case, where all the filesystems served by the gofer (like rootfs
and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/">bind mounts</a>) are mounted
locally on the host. The gofer directly accesses them using filesystem syscalls.</p>

<p>Linux provides some security primitives to effectively isolate local
filesystems. These include,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html">mount namespaces</a>,
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><code>pivot_root</code></a> and
detached bind mounts<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>. <strong>Directfs</strong> is a new filesystem access mode that uses
these primitives to expose the container filesystem to the sandbox in a secure
manner. The sandbox’s view of the filesystem tree is limited to just the
container filesystem. The sandbox process is not given access to anything
mounted on the broader host filesystem. Even if the sandbox gets compromised,
these mechanisms provide additional barriers to prevent broader system
compromise.</p>

<h2 id="directfs">Directfs</h2>

<p>In directfs mode, the gofer still exists as a cooperative process outside the
sandbox. As usual, the gofer enters a new mount namespace, sets up appropriate
bind mounts to create the container filesystem in a new directory and then
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><code>pivot_root(2)</code></a>s into
that directory. Similarly, the sandbox process enters new user and mount
namespaces and then
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/pivot_root.2.html"><code>pivot_root(2)</code></a>s into
an empty directory to ensure it cannot access anything via path traversal. But
instead of making RPCs to the gofer to access the container filesystem, the
sandbox requests the gofer to provide file descriptors to all the mount points
via <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/unix.7.html"><code>SCM_RIGHTS</code> messages</a>.
The sandbox then directly makes file-descriptor-relative syscalls (e.g.
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/fstatat"><code>fstatat(2)</code></a>,
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/openat"><code>openat(2)</code></a>,
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/mkdirat"><code>mkdirat(2)</code></a>, etc) to perform filesystem
operations.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-directfs.svg" alt="Figure 2" title="Directfs configuration" width="100%"></p>

<p>Earlier when the gofer performed all filesystem operations, we could deny all
these syscalls in the sandbox process using seccomp. But with directfs enabled,
the sandbox process’s seccomp filters need to allow the usage of these syscalls.
Most notably, the sandbox can now make
<a href="https://linux.die.net/man/2/openat"><code>openat(2)</code></a> syscalls (which allow path
traversal), but with certain restrictions:
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/114a033bd038519fa6e867c230dc4ad4e057e675"><code>O_NOFOLLOW</code> is required</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/fcbc289a7ac14b8d84d0c0b23c4b2a14fc626e79">no access to procfs</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/commit/aa8abdfa9256cf057202ec8f4a81ba9f5d6a203f">no directory FDs from the host</a>.
We also had to give the sandbox the same privileges as the gofer (for example
<code>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</code> and <code>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</code>), so it can perform the same
filesystem operations.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that only the trusted gofer provides FDs (of the container
filesystem) to the sandbox. The sandbox cannot walk backwards (using ‘..’) or
follow a malicious symlink to escape out of the container filesystem. In effect,
we’ve decreased our dependence on the syscall filters to catch bad behavior, but
correspondingly increased our dependence on Linux’s filesystem isolation
protections.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Making RPCs to the gofer for every filesystem operation adds a lot of overhead
to runsc. Hence, avoiding gofer round trips significantly improves performance.
Let’s find out what this means for some of our benchmarks. We will run the
benchmarks using our newly released
<a href="https://gvisor.dev/blog/2023/04/28/systrap-release/">systrap platform</a> on bind
mounts (as opposed to rootfs). This would simulate more realistic use cases
because bind mounts are extensively used while configuring filesystems in
containers. Bind mounts also do not have an overlay
(<a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/04/gvisor-improves-performance-with-root-filesystem-overlay.html">like the rootfs mount</a>),
so all operations go through goferfs / directfs mount.</p>

<p>Let’s first look at our
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/test/perf/linux/stat_benchmark.cc">stat micro-benchmark</a>,
which repeatedly calls
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/lstat.2.html"><code>stat(2)</code></a> on a file.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-stat-benchmark.svg" alt="Figure 3" title="Stat micro benchmark" width="100%"></p>

<p>The <code>stat(2)</code> syscall is more than 2x faster! However, since this is not
representative of real-world applications, we should not extrapolate these
results. So let’s look at some
<a href="https://github.com/google/gvisor/blob/master/test/benchmarks/fs">real-world benchmarks</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://gvisor.dev/assets/images/2023-06-27-real-world-benchmarks.svg" alt="Figure 4" title="Real world benchmarks" width="100%"></p>

<p>We see a 12% reduction in the absolute time to run these workloads and 17%
reduction in Ruby load time!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The gofer model in runsc was overly restrictive for accessing host files. We
were able to leverage existing filesystem isolation mechanisms in Linux to
bypass the gofer without compromising security. Directfs significantly improves
performance for certain workloads. This is part of our ongoing efforts to
improve gVisor performance. You can learn more about gVisor at
<a href="http://www.gvisor.dev/">gvisor.dev</a>. You can also use gVisor in
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine">GKE</a> with
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods">GKE Sandbox</a>.
Happy sandboxing!</p>

				<h2>Non-destructive editing, powered by nodes.</h2>
				<!-- <div class="graphic">
					<img src="graphic.svg" alt="" />
				</div> -->
				<p>While working in Graphite, your edits are saved into the <em>Node Graph</em>. Its <em>nodes</em> represent operations and effects like Magic Wand selection and Blur. Node <em>parameters</em> can be altered anytime, helping you iterate faster. The graph is organized into layers and folders, and a layer panel provides a simpler, compact view of the graph.</p>

				<h2>Raster and vector art, crisp at any resolution.</h2>

					<img src="graphic.svg" alt="" />
				</div> -->
				<p>Just like <em>vector</em> artwork, which is based on curves instead of pixels to preserve quality at any scale, Graphite's <em>raster</em> paintbrushes, generators, and other tools
					work the same way. A <em>resolution-agnostic</em> render engine lets you zoom infinitely and export at any size.</p>

				</div> -->
				<p>Graphite aims to be the ultimate 2D tool for every technical artist. From procedural artwork to data viz and automation, it is designed from the ground up to fit into studio content
					pipelines. You can also integrate Graphite's render engine into your game, app, or server.</p>

		<h2>Built for the future, powered by Rust.</h2>
		<p>
			Always on the bleeding edge and built to last— Graphite is written on a robust foundation with Rust, a modern programming language optimized for creating fast, reliable, future-proof
			software.
		</p>
		<p>
			The underlying node graph engine that computes and renders Graphite documents is called Graphene. The Graphene engine is an extension of the Rust language, acting as a system for chaining
			together modular functions into useful pipelines with GPU and parallel computation. Artists can harness these powerful capabilities directly in the Graphite editor without touching code.
			Technical artists and programmers can write reusable Rust functions to extend the capabilities of Graphite and create new nodes to share with the community.

					<h2><a href="https://graphite.rs/blog/distributed-computing-in-the-graphene-runtime/">Distributed computing in the Graphene runtime.</a></h2>
				</p>
				<span>By Keavon Chambers. May 12, 2022.</span>
				<div>
						<p>Graphite is a professional 2D graphics editor for photo editing, image manipulation, graphic design, illustration, data visualization, batch processing, and technical art. It is designed to run on a variety of machines, from mobile hardware like iPads or web browsers on midrange laptops up to beefy workstations with dozens of CPU cores and multiple GPUs.</p>
<p>To provide a responsive user experience, its architecture is made to support the use of distributed computation to make up for deficiencies in local compute power. Resulting productivity benefits will scale for users on hardware ranging from low-end mobile devices up to high-end workstations because documents and use cases can grow to great complexity.</p>
<p>This article explores the current thinking about the problems and potential engineering solutions involved in Graphite and Graphene for building a high-performance distributed computing runtime environment. We are only just embarking on the graph engine implementation, meaning this post describes theoretical approaches to theoretical challenges. The aim is to shed light on what will need to be built and what we currently believe is the trajectory for this work. We hope this post prompts discussions that evolve the concepts and approaches described herein. If this topic sounds interesting and you have feedback, please <a href="https://graphite.rs/contact">get in touch</a>.</p>

					<h2><a href="https://graphite.rs/blog/graphite-a-vision-for-the-future-of-2d-content-creation/">Graphite: a vision for the future of 2D content creation.</a></h2>
				</p>
				<span>By Keavon Chambers. March 12, 2022.</span>
				<div>
						<p>Graphite is an open source, cross-platform digital content creation desktop and web application for 2D graphics editing, photo processing, vector art, digital painting, illustration, data visualization, compositing, and more. Inspired by the open source success of Blender in the 3D domain, it aims to bring 2D content creation to new heights with efficient workflows influenced by Photoshop/Gimp and Illustrator/Inkscape and backed by a powerful node-based, nondestructive approach proven by Houdini, Nuke, Blender, and others.</p>
<p>The user experience of Graphite is of central importance, offering a meticulously-designed UI catering towards an intuitive and efficient artistic process. Users may draw and edit in the traditional interactive (WYSIWYG) viewport with the Layer Tree panel or jump in or out of the node graph at any time to tweak previous work and construct powerful procedural image generators that seamlessly sync with the interactive viewport. A core principle of the application is its 100% nondestructive workflow that is resolution-agnostic, meaning that raster-style image editing can be infinitely zoomed and scaled to arbitrary resolutions at a later time because editing is done by recording brush strokes, vector shapes, and other manipulations parametrically.</p>

It lasted about 40 mins. Now, I can say, hand on heart, that in all my 20+ years of work that has never happened. Ever. He didn't have a role in mind, just that he wanted a few good candidates to pimp around to his contacts (CTO's and such).</p><p>My experience in the UK has been that you apply for a role you find on JobServe, you phone and chase the agent, and you hope to get through the cattle market, not this US-style agent-works-for-me stuff.</p><p>The other agent had a role in mind but he also grilled me extensively. Again, never happened before... they usually ask you about the keywords they're looking for and that's it: call done in 2 mins. This call took over 30 mins.</p><p>I asked the first guy what was going on as his style was more like the US system where a recruitment agent will work for YOU, and try to get you a role somewhere, whereas the UK model (unless headhunted!) was very much that the agents worked for the companies in question and acted like a CV-buffer to filter out the crap.</p><p>One of the agents hinted that there are a lot of average candidates out there at the moment looking for a smaller number of roles so they are aggressively filtering them before handing over to the clients.</p><p>I suspect that there have been a bunch of rejected CV's sent to the clients and they're now wanting better candidates... either that or agencies are indeed swamped in average candidates (not pissing on them, but if you have avg candidates and good candidates, the avg ones will lose out).</p><p>Anyway, things are a bit weird in the UK at the moment so I thought I'd chime in.

During the pandemic, I was hiring for an engineering role at a fairly unknown startup and we had to filter through over 500 applicants and interviewed only 15-20. Now, with LLMs, I imagine those numbers are an order of magnitude worse and applications are looking more and more personalized. A few bits of advice:<p>- Don't focus your efforts on cold applications, the numbers are against you</p><p>- If you must do cold applications, use LLMs to customize applications and aim to send out &gt;50 per day</p><p>- Focus on your personal and extended network, reach out personally to people you know and ask them if they have any opportunities they can connect you with. Personal connections are always going to trump sitting in a stack of 1000 cold applications

The fact you have only had one interview this year is very odd in my opinion. I've been on the market twice this year and it's been harder for sure (especially earlier this year), but it's far from impossible to find something.<p>I don't know if you're looking for advice or just anecdotes here, but I'll share some thoughts for what might be happening...</p><p>Frontend development has changed a lot over the last 5 years. Obviously I don't know what skills you have, but a few years ago it was common for companies to be looking for a "frontend developer" with just HTML5, CSS &amp; jQuery experience. These roles basically don't exist anymore. Typically a frontend developer today would be someone who's got experience with a modern JS framework like React (or similar), knows TypeScript, has experience writing tests, possibly has some experience with dev tools like Storybook or docker, etc... At least this the kind of thing I typically see companies recruiting for these days.</p><p>The last 5 years also haven't been very representative. The tech job market from around 2016 on has been very strong and there was a huge under supply of labour (especially during the pandemic). Today tech companies are cutting jobs, or slowing their hiring, meanwhile your average 12 year old has done some basic HTML and JavaScript coding. Just knowing your way around HTML and CSS isn't going to land you a job anymore – companies can afford to be much more selective.</p><p>If you're not even getting interviews you can assume your resume is the problem. Again, I don't know what skills you have but you either don't have skills that are being sought after or you are not showing your experience in a way that highlights those skills well on your resume.</p><p>It may also be that you're applying for roles that are beyond your experience level. In my experience if you've been a developer for 5 years that would typically mean you're a bit better than a junior developer, but unlikely to be a senior. A couple of years ago you may have been able to land a senior developer role, but today the market is far more competitive and you'll have people with well over a decade of experience applying for these roles in most cases. I know it sucks but you may want to look for roles which require a little less experience even if you believe you're worth more. It's far better to be employed and in a role where you're growing your experience than being unemployed. You can always look for something else when you have the experience you need or when the market picks up a bit.</p><p>The fact you've been out of work for about 6 months now would be sending huge warning flags to me if I were a recruiter. Recruiters want to place candidates that are in demand and as harsh as this may sound a 6 month gap in your employment will suggest you are not an ideal candidate. I would seriously consider coming up with a back story to explain why you've been out of work for this long.</p><p>Some will disagree with this, but you should think of your resume like an Instagram profile – only show the things others want to see, and don't be afraid to represent yourself in a slightly exaggerated way. Obviously you need to be able to do what you say you can do, but you need your resume to give a good impression of you and your experience if you want any chance of getting an interview. So for example, if I was the primary dev on some project I'll typically say that I "led" the project on my resume. I'll also always include things like "senior" &amp; "lead" in job roles because, "Lead software engineer" looks way better than "Frontend developer" imo. Minor things like this can make a big difference and help your profile stand out from the rest.</p><p>I guess to concluded though, the market isn't that bad that you should be getting at least some interviews. It sounds like your resume is being dismissed for some reason and you should try to understand why that is. If you want to anonymise and share your resume I'd be happy to take a look.

The market (in my case APAC: HK/SG/AU) is shit and frankly not really worth engaging in right now.<p>I'd love to be employed, but a low IC position (haven't done that in 13-14 years) for 60-70% less pay (the last one who contacted me) is a bit of a tough pill to swallow in a market with (last year) 10% inflation.

If your salary was $200K and you spent 1 year to find a job, your salary is now $100K. Compare it to other countries - Germany, for example. Salaries are lower, but if you work, you can't be fired. You're getting your paycheck, you're protected by laws, and it's your American fella who is going under the bridge with his family, not you.<p>We really need to make "employment at will" illegal.</p><p>Personal anecdote from Russia (I hold expired Russian passport and have many friends from there).

When I was completely desperate to find a job here in our region, I published a CV on the Russian HH.ru. And there is a lot of activity there.

And all as one are looking for remote employees, but for some fucking reason that is not clear to me, I have to be on the territory of the Russian Federation. That's just an exception with Yandex. They can arrange in Serbia. But you also have to go there.</p><p>=== &gt;8 ===</p><p>I don't know what they did to the US economy, so now it's even worse here than it is in Russia.

They use this rubric to score 15 different nominally open-source LLMs on different aspects of their availability, documentation, and methods of access. The researchers have collected these assessments in an <a href="https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>online table</u></a> that they have since expanded to include 21 different open-source models. Smaller, research-focused models were included in the assessment if they were deemed, as stated in the preprint, “open, sufficiently documented, and released under an open source license.”</p><p>“Meta using the term ‘open source’ for this is positively misleading.” —Mark Dingemanse, Radboud University</p><p>The scientists started the project when looking for AI models to use in their own teaching and research. “If you write a research paper, you want the results to be reproducible for as long as possible,” says <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/liesenfeld-a" target="_blank">Andreas Liesenfeld</a>, one of the preprint’s authors and an assistant professor at Radboud. “That’s something you would specifically value if you do research using these technologies, right? That’s something we did not see, for instance, from ChatGPT”—the chat-bot interface built off of OpenAI’s <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)</u></a> LLM series. Despite what may be inferred from its name, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/15/23640180/openai-gpt-4-launch-closed-research-ilya-sutskever-interview" target="_blank">OpenAI closed access</a> to much of its research code after launching <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/gpt-4">GPT-4</a> and receiving a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/qai/2023/01/27/microsoft-confirms-its-10-billion-investment-into-chatgpt-changing-how-microsoft-competes-with-google-apple-and-other-tech-giants/?sh=5ec5240d3624" target="_blank">substantial investment from Microsoft</a> earlier this year.</p><p><img alt="text on the left with green, yellow and orange boxes on the right" data-rm-shortcode-id="adc541926c705b8e849abba709e8a928" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/text-on-the-left-with-green-yellow-and-orange-boxes-on-the-right.jpg?id=34681681&amp;width=980" height="896" id="82e91" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/text-on-the-left-with-green-yellow-and-orange-boxes-on-the-right.jpg?id=34681681&amp;width=980" width="2402"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Radboud University team’s assessment gives very poor marks to ChatGPT’s and Llama’s open-source status. (The <a href="https://opening-up-chatgpt.github.io/" target="_blank">full table</a> had 20 entries at press time, we show only the top and bottom entries here.) </small></p><p>In fact, OpenAI’s <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> model has scored the worst out of all models currently assessed on the team’s openness table. Of the available statuses—open, partial, and closed—ChatGPT is marked “closed” in all assessments other than “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>model card</u></a>”—a standard format for describing the model and its limitations—and “preprint”—whether or not there is an in-depth research paper about the model. For these two, ChatGPT only gets a “partial” grade. Llama 2 is ranked second worst overall with an overall openness ranking only marginally better than that of ChatGPT.</p><h2>AI’s Reproducibility Problems</h2><p>Liesenfeld’s concerns about the reproducibility of ChatGPT-based research have borne some evidentiary fruit. A separate <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09009" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>preprint</u></a> from scientists at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, recently demonstrated that both GPT-4 and GPT-3.5’s performance on reasoning tasks has changed between March and June of this year, mostly for the worse. These changes have occurred without any accompanying announcement from <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/openai">OpenAI</a>. Such changes may prevent the reproduction of any research results produced from the use of these models during that time period.</p><p>While Liesenfeld and their colleagues determined that several smaller, research-focused models were considerably more open than Llama 2 or ChatGPT, they found that all the models they assessed were closed in two key ways. First, very few of the models gave sufficient detail of the important refinement process required of modern LLM function, also known as <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)</u></a>. This key step, which tunes language models to give useful outputs from the statistical patterns trained into them during model pretraining, appears to be the secret sauce behind contemporary LLM performance. The process is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>labor-intensive</u></a>, requiring human-in-the-loop assessment of model outputs during training.</p><p>The second major issue the researchers point to is the ways commercial LLM releases have avoided the peer review process. While publishing model architecture, training methods, and performance through reviewed conferences or journals is a well-established practice in academic research, ChatGPT and Llama 2 were both released with only a company-hosted preprint document, most likely to protect trade secret details around model structure and training.</p><p>While the light this project shines on the variable openness of LLMs may in fact push the field toward truly open-source model development, Liesenfeld and colleagues remain wary of commercial model use in academic research. <a href="https://www.ru.nl/en/people/dingemanse-m" target="_blank">Mark Dingemanse</a>, a coauthor of this report, had a particularly strong assessment of the Llama 2 model: “Meta using the term ‘open source’ for this is positively misleading: There is no source to be seen, the training data is entirely undocumented, and beyond the glossy charts the technical documentation is really rather poor. We do not know why Meta is so intent on getting everyone into this model, but the history of this company’s choices does not inspire confidence. Users beware.”</p><p><em>This story was corrected on 27 July 2023 to indicate that the Radbound group’s research was presented at a conference in July.</em></p></div></div>]]></description>

Electric word, “chatbot”. It means automation of human interactions and that’s a mighty cost effective thing. But I am here to tell you, <strong>no one wants to talk to your chatbot.</strong></p><p id="7905">So before you call up your programmers, and ask them about ChatGPT. Before you launch yet another automated calling system or virtual assistant, put down the Large Language Model. Don’t go crazy. It’s all be done before…</p><h2 id="2516"><strong>Party Like It’s 1999</strong></h2><p id="9d3a">In the late 90’s, it was a race to build commercial websites. We imagined that users would create direct relationships with our URLs. We imagined there would be brand loyalty. We scrambled to buy meaningful domain names. (My company sold <a href="http://start.com/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">start.com</a> to Microsoft. We were very excited!).</p><p id="6144">In our glorious future, websites would be the next generation of applications. Just like millions of users clicked on an Excel or Word icon on their desktops, millions would launch our websites from their bookmark bars. We were the apps and the browser was the new OS.</p><p id="f959">But of course, that isn’t how it worked out. It was the search engines that became to the entry point for users. We watched most users launch their browsers to Google and then search for us.</p><p id="5f32">We tried everything to get them to come to us directly. We added buttons to our sites that would automatically bookmark us. We worked with browser and computer manufacturers to pre-install our links. There is a still a host of shady browser toolbars and plugins that try to get their sites directly in front of users.</p><p id="df65">But the users have spoken. In response, we have created SEO, a whole new field of marketing to search engine algorithms in hopes that down the line they will market us to humans.</p><p id="7056">We are the apps. The browser is the new OS. But the search engine turned out to be the main interface. It is the shell that wraps all the apps.</p><h2 id="bae3">Rise of the Apps</h2><p id="7870">In 2007, 14 years after the launch of the web, 9 years after Google introduced their search; the iPhone launched. There had been other mobile platforms that came earlier, but none that reached the scale of the iTunes App Store (Now just the App Store).</p><p id="994d">All of a sudden, our dreams were coming true. We had our icons on the screen. Users launched us directly. Once installed, we didn’t have to continually re-invest in SEO for users to find our app versus others. Our websites became apps and we had full relationships with our users. Or, so we thought.</p><p id="9418">Apps were the new applications and iOS/Android was the new OS.</p><h2 id="f4c3">Apps are not Applications.</h2><p id="9d26">Apps are limited. They fit on smaller screens and can be used with only a few finger swipes and clicks. They don’t have mice, right-clicks, and sub-menus. Users don’t save and open files. Apps, and users, rely on their host OS for most advanced functions.</p><p id="d490">The OS handles payments, security, sharing, etc. As more features get handled by the OS, the more they become first point of contact with the user. The more the user has a relationship with their device and less with their apps.</p><h2 id="6074">Rise of the Assistants</h2><p id="25ac">In 2010, Apple launched Siri on MacOS (OS X back then) and added it to their iPhones in 2011. MicroSoft and Amazon followed suite in 2014 and Google’s assistant joined in 2016. Microsoft shutdown their assistant, Cortana, in 2020, but their voice assistant has merged with their search as part of Bing. (MicroSoft has been trying to crack the virtual assistant market since 1997 with Clippy!)</p><p id="d902">Up until now these voice powered personal assistants have been mostly curiosities, used for simple tasks like checking the weather, turning on or off lights, or playing music.</p><p id="e7c1">But if you look at the OS APIs, each company has been creating deeper integrations with their virtual personal assistants and their hosted Apps. iPhone and Android allow apps to chat through their assistance, expose functionality, and offer input. Siri can pull weather from one app, your calendar from another, and check traffic and directions from a third to offer you a complex and well informed dialogue.</p><p id="a226">Amazon’s Alexa is more direct. In addition to accessing your apps, developers can create Amazon Alexa Skills, programs which expand your Alexa virtual assistant with new capabilities. Skills can only be accessed via Alexa. Users talk to Alexa and skills respond back through her and in her voice.</p><h2 id="850f">Language Has Been the Logjam</h2><p id="74eb">Up until now, all of these virtual assistants have been held back by their lack of language skills. Anything beyond simple tasks become either comical and/or frustrating. You can get stonewalled by a benign “I don’t understand” to sidetracked by your assistant totally misunderstanding your request and launching the wrong thing.</p><p id="d824">Suddenly with Large Language Models (LLM) and each of these companies running their own LLM as a Service, these virtual assistants will see massive upgrades. Now they will understand not just you, but also the output of of your apps and skills.</p><h2 id="aad8">The Relationship Is With The Assistant</h2><p id="d53d">Apple and Amazon sell hardware. They are less interested in trying to monetize free users. Google and MicroSoft do both, but still want to own your device and assistant. They sell the operating system (and bundled assistant) that powers much of our hardware.</p><p id="f748">Their devices are in our pockets and our houses. We trust these companies with our personal clouds: our payments, our histories, our contacts, our logins, etc. They are the first devices we interact with when we wakeup and the last screens we stare at before going to sleep. We know their names and voices.</p><p id="2af7">We have been trained to call on them personally and we don’t switch easily. We have all seen a frustrated friend trying to talk to our Alexa by asking it “Hey Siri,” and trying to figure out why she won’t respond.</p><p id="6419">With LLM, these personal virtual assistants are the new starting point. They will be to apps what Google and Bing are to the web.</p><p id="8b11">Few people will be willing to interact with an army of different chatbots and online assistants. They will expect these other chat enabled systems to speak to and through their personal virtual assistant. They will log into their smart phone and expect all the other apps and skills to integrate with their personal clouds, arbitrated by their t<strong>rusted personal virtual assistant</strong>.</p><p id="a269">When they do come directly to your site or app, they are not looking for a chatbot. They are looking for a UI that works. They know why they came to you. They expect your UI to do what it should do.</p><p id="251a">If you have a chatbot, it is for Sir or Alexa to use, not people. I am here to tell you, no human wants to talk to your chatbot.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Launched as a tool for providing quick access to articles from scientific journals, Sci-Hub has grown a database of more than 88.3 million research articles and books freely accessible for anyone to read and download; much of this knowledge otherwise would be hidden behind paywalls. Sci-Hub is used by millions of students, researchers, medical professionals, journalists, inventors, and curious people all over the world, many of whom provide feedback saying they are grateful for this access to knowledge. Some medical professionals have said Sci-Hub helps save human lives; some students have said they wouldn't be able to complete their education without Sci-Hub's help. Through Sci-Hub, Elbakyan has strived to shatter academic publishing’s monopoly-like mechanisms in which publishers charge high prices even though authors of articles in academic journals receive no payment.

<p>Commander Keen's Adaptive Tile Refresh</p><hr>


<p>I have been reading <a href="https://amzn.to/43DLW2U">Doom Guy</a> by John Romero. It is an excellent book which I highly recommend. In the ninth chapter, John describes being hit by lightning upon seeing Adaptive Tile Refresh (ATS). That made me realize I never took the time to understand how this crucial piece of tech powers the Commander Keen (CK) series.</p>

<p> During my research I was surprised to learn that ATS only powered the first CK trilogy. The second trilogy turned out to use something far better.</p>


<p>EGA 101</p><hr><p>Commander Keen ran at its best on a PC equipped with a Enhanced Graphic Adapter (EGA) card. On these machines, graphic programming is done through a set of registers for configuration and a window of 64KiB memory mapped<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to the Video RAM (VRAM) to plot pixels. Internally the EGA stores data in four planes named C0, C1, C2, and C3<a name="back_2" href="#footnote_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. From the banks, bytes are picked up by the screen controller and sent to the monitor.
</p>



<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/ega_arch_sc.svg" width="361.24442mm" height="89.605553mm">

<p>This design involving four banks may seem bizarre but this was the only way to reach the bandwidth necessary to keep with the screen (CRT). No chip was fast enough so IBM designers made the controller (CRTC) read four bytes in parallel.</p>




<p>EGA Mode 0xD</p><hr><p>The EGA CRTC does not expect RGB values to generate pixels. Instead it is based on a palette system. Several modes offer various resolutions and colors. In its mode <code>Dh</code><a name="back_3" href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>, which is what CK uses, the resolution is 320x200 16 colors<a name="back_4" href="#footnote_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<span><i><small>EGA color space (64 values from 0x00 to 0x3F)</small></i></span>

<p><u><b>Trivia:</b></u> In mode <code>Dh</code>, the palette colors can still be reconfigured but only from the default 16 colors. This is how CK implements its crude fade in/out effect.</p>

<p>EGA Planar Mode</p><hr><p>Each bank stores a plane of a nibble (4-bit). <code>C0</code> stores all LSB of each nibble. <code>C3</code> stores all MSB of each nibble. And so on... As an example, the first byte in <code>C0</code> stores the LSB of the eight first pixel on the screen.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/ega_palette_sc.svg" width="262.46667mm" height="75.935417mm">
<p>A full screen requires 320x200/2= 32,000 bytes of VRAM. Each bank/plane stores 200 lines made of 40 bytes each.</p>

<!-- <p>This arrangement looks tedious to plot a single pixel because the operation involves, for each bank, reading what is there, OR it with the new value, and write it back. To help developer keep their sanity, the EGA has a mask allowing to pick which planes to write to, a latch that is loaded when the CPU reads, and a way to program how to combine incoming value with latch.</p> -->






<p>The problem Adaptive Tile Refresh solves</p><hr><p>At its heart the problem ATS solves is bandwidth. Writing 320x200 nibbles (32 KiB) per frame is too much for the ISA bus. There is no way to maintain a 60Hz framerate while refreshing the whole screen. If we were to run the following code, which simply fills all banks, it would run at 5 frames per seconds.
  </p>

<span>  <span>}</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></pre>

<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> Connoisseurs will point out there are ways for the EGA to write to all four banks simulaneously. These can help to clear the screen or in the case of Wolfenstein 3D duplicate columns. They don't help for Commander Keen.</p>

<p>How Adaptive Tile Refresh Works</p><hr><p>The best way to understand ATS is to build it from scratch, introducing EGA registers as we need them. Let's start by displaying a static image. We set the EGA in mode <code>Dh</code>, pick an address in VRAM, fill it with nibbles, and then use the "CRTC Start" register so the CRTC knows where to start reading from.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/no_scroll_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> There is no single CRTC start address register. A developer must to write in two registers named "Start Address High" (<code>0CH</code>), and "Start Address Low" (<code>0DH</code>). For simplicity, we treat it as if it was a single one and call it <code>CRTC_START</code>.</p>

<p>Smooth vertical scrolling</p><hr><p>Now we are going to add smooth scrolling. The goal is to create a system where the image displayed on the screen can be shifted with an EGA register (cheap) without plotting a single pixel (expensive).</p>

<p>Let's start with smooth vertical scrolling. If we allocate more memory than is displayed, we create a virtual screen in VRAM. We can add 16 lines above and 16 lines below. Instead of 40x200 = 8,000 bytes per plane, we now used 40 x 232 = 9,280 bytes per plane.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/v_scroll_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm"> 
<p>To move the displayed image up by a line, we can just increase the <code>CRTC_START</code> register by 40 bytes.</p>
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/v_scroll_up_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<p>To move the displayed image down by a line, we can just decrease the <code>CRTC_START</code> register by 40 bytes.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/v_scroll_down_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">

<p>The renderer now needs to write a few more lines to VRAM but the cost is amortized. The gain is that we can update the <code>CRTC_START</code> address up or down in the virtual screen to smoothly move the displayed image up or down.</p>



<p>Smooth horizontal scrolling</p><hr><p>The previous trick allows smooth vertical scrolling. However the truly impressive part, the one John Romero raves about in his book, is smooth horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>At first sight, it does not look like we can use the same trick since all lines are contiguous in VRAM (there is no space between them). But the EGA has a register to allow padding between lines. With the <code>OFFSET</code> register set to 2 we add 16 bytes of padding which results in 16 extra pixels on the left and 16 extra pixels on pixels in the virtual screen<a name="back_5" href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. 
</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/x_scroll_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<p>However this is not enough for the scrolling to be smooth. If we change the CRTC start address, we have to remember that nibbles are stored in planes. Increasing <code>CRTC_START</code> by 1 moves the screen horizontally by 8 pixels. This is coarse, not smooth.</p>

<p>The last register involved in ATS is called "Horizontal Pel Panning" (we will call is <code>PEL</code>). It accepts 4 bits  to tell the CRTC to skip up to 7 bits from <code>CRTC_START</code> before using nibbles. This is exactly what we need for smooth horizontal scrolling.</p>

<p>Each movement left or right is done with a <code>CRTC_START</code> register update (for coordinate / 8). Then the move is fine tuned with the <code>PEL</code> register (for coordinate % 8).</p>









<p>Running out of virtual screen -&gt; jolt</p><hr><p>So far, we have built a virtual screen in VRAM allowing 16 smooth one pixel moves in both axes using only EGA registers. But what happens when we reach an edge? That's where the innovation, and what left John Romero speechless for 30 minutes, starts.</p>

<p>As John Carmack explained<a name="back_6" href="#footnote_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>, once it reaches an edge, the virtual screen must be reset. And it cannot be a full screen redraw because it would take 200ms and drop framerate to 5fps. This operation, coined "jolt" by knolo in their excellent explanation<a name="back_7" href="#footnote_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a>, involves collaboration from the game designers.
</p>


<p>CK levels are built with tiles of dimension 16x16. Upon being drawn by artists, the build system give them an unique ID. A level design creates a map by placing tile IDs in a 2D editor. CK engine keeps track of which tile IDs are in the virtual screen. Since the engine only jolts at tiles size granularity, it can determine extremely fast what has changed on the screen by comparing IDs.</p>

<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/before_jolt_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm">
<span><i><small>Before the jolt</small></i></span>

<p>Notice how, before the jolt, the CRTC starts at the botton of the virtual screen. The image displayed on the screen has not changed between before and after. However the virtual screen has been "re-centered".</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/after_jolt_sc.svg" width="886.88336mm" height="304.79999mm"><span><i><small>After the jolt</small></i></span>



<p>Map Designer help needed</p><hr><p>To jolt, the engine compares each tile ID in the virtual screen current state and the desired, re-centered, state. For matching tiles there is nothing to do and they are skipped entirely. Only mismatch incur a CPU penalty because these need to be overwritten in VRAM.</p>

<p>This is the part where CK game designer had to help the engine with. The jolt efficiency is inversely proportional to the number of tiles to redraw. To avoid costy jolts, designers built tile-maps so there would be a lot of reperating tiles.</p>

<p>In the following screenshot of Commander Keen 1, the player smoothly moved to the right until it ran out of virtual screen. A 16 pixels left jolt occurs. We can see the small number of tiles which were overwritten.</p>

<p> 
  
  
<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/ega/before.webp" width="2240" height="1400" id="ck_diff">  </p>



<p>Only 40 tiles have changed (in pink) out of 250. The amount of redraw is just 16% of the whole screen.

</p><p>Sprites</p><hr><p>So far we have only discussed how the background (made of tiles) is rendered and smoothly scrolled. CK draws a layer of sprites on top of it. While it renders the sprites layer over the background tile layer, the engine maintains a list of dirty (overwritten) tile coordinates. Each new frame, the dirty list is traversed, the background tiles are restored, and then the sprites are drawn again. Rinse, repeat.
</p>


<p>Double buffering / Doing the math</p><hr><p>To avoid visual artifacts, the whole system is duplicated via two framebuffers. While an image is read by the CRTC, another can be written elsewhere in VRAM. Each buffer uses (320 + 32) * (200 + 32) * 4 / 8  = 40,832 bytes. With double buffer, the total is 40,832 * 2 = 81,664 bytes. This is way past the capacity of the standard set by IBM original EGA graphic card. But it was not a problem.</p>


  <blockquote>
Only the original IBM EGA board ever shipped with 64KiB,
and it was a clunky beast full of discrete components, which required
daughter-boards for VRAM expansion.<p>
  The EGA clones that started
coming along in ~1986-7 were based on integrated chipsets (like the
one from Chips &amp; Technologies), and the vast majority of them came
with 256K on board.  When Commander Keen came out, the headcount of
EGA cards with less than 256K 'in the wild' would've been practically
negligible.</p><p>- VileR (sources<a name="back_8" href="#footnote_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a><a name="back_9" href="#footnote_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>)</p>
    </blockquote> 

<!-- <p>In CK source code<a name="back_10" style="text-decoration: none;" href="#footnote_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> we can see that register <code>12h</code> is not even consulted to check how much VRAM is installed.</p> -->


<p><b><u>Trivia:</u></b> How to manage 256 KiB of VRAM with only a 64 KiB window? Not a problem since the banks contain 64 KiB each. The CPU can still "see" everything via the plane mask (selection) register.</p>

<p>Better than Adaptive Tile Refresh: Drifting</p><hr><p>Knowing how ATS works, and how it depends on repeating tiles, we should be surprised to see the difference between the first and second trilogy screenshots.</p>


<span><i><small>Commander Keen 1, 2, and 3</small></i></span>


<p>If Commander Keen 1, 2, and 3 show the characteristic repeating patterns required by ATS, the second trilogy, made of Commander Keen 4, 5, and 6, does not. It is most apparent with the starting forest of CK 4 where next to nothing is repeating except for the marginal underground.
</p>


<span><i><small>Commander Keen 4, 5, and 6</small></i></span>

<p>How did they pull that off? John Carmack alluded to the answer on his Twitter account in 2020<a name="back_11" href="#footnote_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a>.
</p>  

  <blockquote>
The second Keen trilogy used a better trick -- just keep panning and redrawing the leading edge, letting the screen wrap around at the 64k aperture edge.<p>- John Carmack</p>
    </blockquote> 

<p>An explanation further elaborated during an interview with Lex Fridman in 2022<a name="back_12" href="#footnote_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

  <blockquote>I finally asked what actually happens if you just go off the edge [OF THE VRAM]? 
<p>
If you take your [CRTC] start and you say
OK, I can move over and I get to what should be the bottom of the memory window.
[...] What happens if I start at 0xFFFE at the very end of the 64k block? It
turns out it just wraps back around to the top of
the block.

</p><p>
I'm like oh well this makes everything easy. You can just
scroll the screen everywhere and all you
have to draw is just one new line of
tiles. 
</p><p>
It just works. We no longer had the problem of having fields of similar colors. It doesn't matter what you're
doing, you could be having a completely unique world and you're just drawing the new strip.
</p><p>- John Carmack</p>
    </blockquote> 

<p>So there we have the explanation. ATS was improved upon not by adding a feature but by removing one. Without the jolt, the CRTC start address drift in VRAM space until it wraps around the 64KiB space of the banks. Since it happens with both elements of the double buffer, they drift at the same speed and never overlap. It worked well most of the time.</p>

  <blockquote>
This is so simple, it
just works and it's faster. It
seemed like there was no downside.<p>

Funny thing was it turned out, after we
shipped titles with this, there were super vga cards, allowing higher resolutions and
different features that the
standard ones didn't.
</p><p>
On some of those cards
there was a weird compatibility quirk
again because nobody thought this was what it was designed to do and some
of those cards had more memory.  They had more than just 256k and four planes they
had 512k or a megabyte and on some of
those cards I scroll my window down and then it goes
into uninitialized memory that actually
exists instead of wrapping back
around at the top!</p><p>
        

I was in a tough position. Do I
have to track every single one of these [SUPER VGA CARDS]
and it was a madhouse back then with 20 different video card
vendors with all slightly different
implementations of their non-standard
functionality. Either I needed to
natively program all of the 
cards or I kind of
punt. I took the easy solution of
when you finally did run to the edge of
the screen I accepted a hitch and just
copied the whole screen up.


        </p><p>- John Carmack</p>
    </blockquote> 

<p>This technique likely prevented tiles and sprites to be stored in VRAM (to use the fast 32-bit at at time VRAM to VRAM copy method popularized by Michael Abrash). But since very little has to be drawn each frame, it probably did not matter.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="storywrap-417276">


<h3>from the <i>yeeted-from-search</i> dept</h3>

<p>A few months ago, Jack Yan pointed out to me that if they did a search for Techdirt on DuckDuckGo, it showed only one single link which was (bizarrely) to a random story from like eight years ago. There were literally no other results for Techdirt. I replicated it, but was travelling, and by the time I went back to write about it a few days later, everything seemed back to normal (in the interim there were a few days where it just found a couple hundred Techdirt posts). Jack wrote a short blog post <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://jackyan.com/blog/2023/01/bing-increases-techdirts-results-saving-it-some-embarrassment/" target="_blank">on his own site</a> about it.</p>
<p>This morning, however, someone alerted me to the fact that DuckDuckGo currently shows zero results for Techdirt. Not even some random old article. Zero. None. Zilch.</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/6b3494cb-9fee-40b0-97a7-387a9b11fc4c-RackMultipart20230727-96-s73gmq.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>Of course, DDG is powered by Bing, so I went to check Bing, and sure enough there’s nothing there:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/43661fc7-153f-4c4f-8e40-cbefbdd2e5a8-RackMultipart20230727-118-ostor0.png?ssl=1" data-recalc-dims="1">Bing appears to have deleted all links to Techdirt. Though at least it tells you that “some results have been removed.” Though it doesn’t say why.</p>
<p>At no point did anyone at Bing let us know that we’ve been removed from the search index. And, of course, BIng has every right to kick us out of their index for whatever reason they want. But it does seem odd.</p>
<p>So, hey, if you happen to know anyone at DuckDuckGo or on the Bing team, maybe ask them why they booted Techdirt? Apparently, I’m <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/why-has-my-website-been-removed-from-bing/c5db8282-43a8-4696-8574-82e016b536b1">not the only person</a> this has happened to.</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime, I figured I’d ask Bing’s space aged AI chat bot if it could tell me what happened. And… it actually provided a decent answer, first pointing to Jack Yan’s blog post:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/3f0e00a5-fa74-4db4-8149-11930c87339e-RackMultipart20230727-111-nug85h.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>And then coming up with a very speculative list of reasons why we got the boot:</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lex-img-p.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/img/4807d472-3417-4d45-9b1b-e0c9023cdf16-RackMultipart20230727-111-wbg503.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure>
<p>I love that first one. Microsoft, a company with a $2.5 trillion market cap, “may not have enough resources” to crawl and index Techdirt? Cool. And the last one is of course possible: that Microsoft encountered “some legal or political pressure to remove or censor Techdirt.com, which is known for its critical and investigative reporting on various topics, such as technology, law, policy, and business,” but it would be nice if someone would just, you know, let me know?</p>
<p>I’m guessing it’s just a bug, but given that many Techdirt readers (for understandable reasons) prefer DDG to Google, it would be kinda nice if they could actually use it to get Techdirt results.</p>
<p>Now, of course, if this were a Trumpist nonsense peddler website, I’m sure there would be blaring headlines on Fox News and in the NY Post, and a whole set of hearings chaired by Jim Jordan about “censorship.” And we’d be hearing about it for years. That’s not going to happen with me. I’m sure the reality is much more mundane. I am guessing it’s just a glitch somewhere in the system.</p>
<p>But it would nice if it got fixed.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p data-block-key="mhvmh">Nearly every material, whether it is solid, liquid, or gas, expands when its temperature goes up and contracts when its temperature goes down. This property, called thermal expansion, makes a hot air balloon float, and the phenomenon has been harnessed to create thermostats that automatically turn a home furnace on and off. Railroads, bridges, and buildings are designed with this property in mind, and they are given room to expand without buckling or breaking on a hot day.</p><p data-block-key="e6hqc">Thermal expansion occurs because a material's atoms vibrate more as its temperature increases. The more its atoms vibrate, the more they push away from their neighboring atoms. As the space between the atoms increases, the density of the material decreases and its overall size increases.</p><p data-block-key="4pcsc">There are a few exceptions, but by and large, materials conform strictly to this principle. There is, however, a class of metal alloys called Invars (think <b><i>invar</i></b>iable), that stubbornly refuse to change in size and density over a large range of temperatures.</p>

<p data-block-key="9fouu">"It's almost unheard of to find metals that don't expand," says Stefan Lohaus, a graduate student in materials science and lead author of the new paper. "But in 1895, a physicist discovered by accident that if you combine iron and nickel, each of which has positive thermal expansion, in a certain proportion, you get this material with very unusual behavior."</p><p data-block-key="3ijgp">That anomalous behavior makes these alloys useful in applications where extreme precision is required, such as in the manufacture of parts for clocks, telescopes, and other fine instruments. Until now, no one knew why Invars behave this way. In a new paper published in <i>Nature Physics</i>, researchers from the lab of <a href="https://www.eas.caltech.edu/people/btf">Brent Fultz</a>, the Barbara and Stanley R. Rawn, Jr., Professor of Materials Science and Applied Physics, say they have figured out the secret to at least one Invar's steadiness.</p>

<p data-block-key="dk3n9">For over 150 years, scientists have known that thermal expansion is related to entropy, a central concept in thermodynamics. Entropy is a measure of the disorder, such as positions of atoms, in a system. As temperature increases, so does the entropy of a system. This is universally true, so an Invar's unusual behavior must be explained through something counteracting that expansion.</p><p data-block-key="9t7bk">Lohaus says it had been long suspected that this behavior was somehow related to magnetism because only certain alloys that are ferromagnetic (capable of being magnetized) behave as invars.</p>

<p data-block-key="47uer">"We decided to look at that because we have this very neat experimental setup that can measure both magnetism and atomic vibrations," Lohaus says. "It was a perfect system for this."</p><p data-block-key="a1a30">Since the magnetic properties of a material are the result of its electrons' so-called spin state— a quantum measure of angular momentum that can be either "up" or "down"—any magnetic effect counteracting the material's expected expansion must be due to the activity of its electrons.</p><p data-block-key="7qcii">The relationship between entropy, thermal expansion, and pressure, known as the "Maxwell relations" is often presented as a textbook curiosity, but the Caltech group found a way to use it to independently measure the thermal expansion caused by magnetism and by atom vibrations. The experiments were done at the Advanced Photon Source, a source of synchrotron X-rays at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, by measuring the vibrational spectra and magnetism of small samples of Invar at pressures within a diamond anvil cell.</p><p data-block-key="6oaei">The measurements showed a delicate cancellation of the thermal expansion from atom vibrations and from magnetism. Both changed with temperature and pressure, but in a way that maintained their balance. Using a newly developed accurate theoretical approach, collaborators on this work showed how this balance was helped by interactions between vibrations and magnetism, such as where the frequencies of atom vibrations are altered by magnetism. Such coupling between vibrations and magnetism could be useful for understanding thermal expansion in other magnetic materials, as well for developing materials for magnetic refrigeration.</p><p data-block-key="cqdgu">The experimental setup consisted of a diamond anvil cell, which is essentially two precisely ground diamond tips between which samples of materials can be tightly squeezed. In this case, a small piece of Invar alloy was squeezed at a pressure of 200,000 atmospheres. The researchers passed a powerful beam of X-rays through the alloy, and during that process the X-rays interacted with the vibrations (phonons) of its atoms. That interaction changed the amount of energy carried by the X-rays, allowing the researchers to measure how much the atoms were vibrating.</p><p data-block-key="bmkd">They also placed sensors around the diamond anvil cell that can detect interference patterns created by the spin state of the electrons belonging to the sample's atoms.</p><p data-block-key="56bno">The team used their experimental setup to observe both the atomic vibrations of an Invar sample and the spin state of its electrons as they increased the sample's temperature. At cooler temperatures, more of the Invar's electrons shared the same spin state, causing them to move farther apart and push their parent atoms farther apart as well.</p><p data-block-key="57uaj">As the temperature of the Invar rose, the spin state of some of those electrons increasingly flipped. As a result, the electrons became more comfortable cozying up to their neighboring electrons. Typically, this would cause the Invar to contract as it warmed up. But here, the Invar's atoms were also vibrating more and taking up more room. The contraction due to changing spin states and the atomic vibration expansion counteracted each other, and the Invar stayed the same size.</p><p data-block-key="890us">"This is exciting because this has been a problem in science for over a hundred years or so," Lohaus says. "There are literally thousands of publications trying to show how magnetism causes contraction, but there was no holistic explanation of the Invar effect."</p><p data-block-key="blb2p">The paper describing the research, "<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-023-02142-z.epdf?sharing_token=Kpp4hAGNnsZZoWfGGlC58dRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MqX9VjZ126twpdHMGPJ2csd8ecvTUNtpPOWfav11pUg8KfLRin8MEsCEPqrW1H3eUuJLV9emiFiAonE5bGA4x2booS9eOVot9ifuWO3VJgjFHYHgKvGP1fovePZwoYCuk%3D">Thermodynamic explanation of the Invar effect</a>," appears in the July 27 issue of <i>Nature Physics.</i> Co-authors are graduate students in materials science Pedro Guzman and Camille M.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><a rel="noopener follow" href="https://esthercrawford.medium.com/?source=post_page-----24a126098246--------------------------------"><div aria-hidden="false"><p><img alt="Esther Crawford" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fill:88:88/1*tgBvi4CuxtFvd_c4SUhcug.jpeg" width="44" height="44" loading="lazy"></p></div></a></div><figure><figcaption>since it’s a long read, feel free to listen to this post instead</figcaption></figure><p id="f91b">Like seemingly everyone on this app I have plenty of opinions about Twitter &gt; X and figure now is a good time to open up a bit about my experience at the company.</p><p id="ae62">I tweeted for years into the void for the love of it like many of you, but after selling my startup to Twitter in 2020 I finally got to see it from the inside. Up close it was both amazing and terrible, like so many other companies and things in life.</p><p id="983c">As someone with a maniacal sense of urgency built into me, Twitter often felt siloed and bureaucratic. Dumb power plays, reorgs and team name changes for the sake of someone’s ego were distractions that occurred too regularly.</p><p id="20f8"><strong>You couldn’t just be a builder — you also needed to be a politician.</strong></p><p id="1aca">I was shocked by how old and bespoke the infrastructure was, but there was little will to think beyond quarterly earnings calls because we were all beholden to the masters of mDAU and revenue growth as a public company. It often felt like things were held together with duct tape and glue, and that many people had just accepted that a small product change could take months or quarters to build.</p><p id="e4e0">Management had become bloated to accommodate <em>career growth</em> and the company culture felt too soft and entitled for my own taste. Healthy debate and criticism was replaced by a default refrain of “no, that can’t be done” or “another team owns that so don’t touch it”.</p><p id="6e63">Teams could spend months building a feature and then some last-minute kerfuffle meant it’d get killed for being too risky.</p><p id="7441"><strong>Just talking directly to customers could turn into a turf war and create deadlocks between functions.</strong></p><p id="4c3d">I recall one such episode where a teammate spent a month trying to get clearance to reach out to some creators. He went through 3 layers of management and 6 different functional teams. In the end 4 executives were involved in the approval. It was insanity, and unfortunately I saw several top performers get burnt out and demoralized after exhausting experiences like that.</p><p id="081c">Most people were good at their jobs but <strong>it was nearly impossible to fire poor performers</strong> — instead they got shuffled around to other teams because few managers had the will or resources to figure out how to get them out.</p><p id="02c1">A high performance culture pulls everyone up, but the opposite weighs everyone down. <strong>Twitter often felt like a place that kept squandering its own potential</strong>, which was sad and frustrating to see. The person who was best at cutting through the BS and inspiring a vision during my tenure was Kayvon Beykpour, but he wasn’t fully empowered to run the company since he wasn’t the CEO.</p><p id="4305">Despite those real issues, I was lucky enough to work with some of the most talented people in the business at Twitter in product, design, engineering, research, legal, BD, trust &amp; safety, marketing, PR and more. <strong>Often it was a small cross-functional team of intrinsically motivated people who made the biggest impact by challenging some core assumption.</strong> Those teams were very fun to be on but they felt like the exception rather than the rule.</p><p id="2da1">The months of waiting for the deal to close in 2022 were particularly slow and painful; it felt like leadership hid behind lawyers and legal language as all answers about the company’s future notoriously included the phrase “fiduciary duty”. Colleagues openly talked about how Twitter was being sold because leadership didn’t have conviction in their own plan or ability to fix longstanding problems.</p><p id="1546"><strong>Although I didn’t know much about Elon I was cautiously optimistic </strong>— I saw him as the guy who built incredible and enduring companies like Tesla and SpaceX, so perhaps his private ownership could shake things up and breathe new life into the company.</p><p id="1e38">My take on what’s happened since then is full of lived nuance.</p><p id="a660">When people ask why I stayed it’s easy to answer: optimism, curiosity, personal growth and money.</p><p id="d451">From the beginning I saw that some changes Elon was going to make were smart and others were stupid, but <strong>when I’m on a team I uphold the philosophy of “praise in public and criticize in private”</strong>. I was far from a silent wallflower. I shared my opinions openly and pushed back often, both before and after the acquisition.</p><p id="202c">I made peace with the fact that I didn’t have psychological safety at Twitter 2.0 and that meant I could be fired at any moment, and for no reason at all. I watched it happen repeatedly and saw how negatively it impacted team morale. Although I couldn’t change the situation I did my best to shine a light on folks who were doing important work while being an emotionally supportive leader for those who were struggling to adapt to the more brutalist and hardcore culture.</p><p id="7e08"><strong>In person Elon is oddly charming and he’s <em>genuinely funny</em>.</strong> He also has personality quirks like telling the same stories and jokes over and over. The challenge is his personality and demeanor can turn on a dime going from excited to angry. Since it was hard to read what mood he might be in and what his reaction would be to any given thing, people quickly became afraid of being called into meetings or having to share negative news with him.</p><p id="319e"><strong>At times it felt like the inner circle was too zealous and fanatical in their unwavering support of everything he said.</strong> When individuals encouraged me to be careful about what I said I politely thanked them and said I would not be taking their advice. I had no interest in adding to a culture of fear or walking on eggshells around Elon. Either he would respect me for being real or he could fire me. Either outcome was okay.</p><p id="96bb">I quickly learned that product and business decisions were nearly always the result of him following his gut instinct, and he didn’t seem compelled to seek out or rely on a lot of data or expertise to inform it. That was particularly frustrating for me since I believed I had useful institutional knowledge that could help him make better decisions. Instead he’d poll Twitter, ask a friend, or even ask his biographer for product advice. <strong>At times it seemed he trusted random feedback more than the people in the room who spent their lives dedicated to tackling the problem at hand.</strong> I never figured out why and remain puzzled by it.</p><p id="622d">I don’t think things had to be as difficult or dramatic as they turned out to be but I can’t say I’d bet against Elon or count him out. He’s smart and has enough money to make a lot of mistakes and then course correct when things go awry. As the largest shareholder he can tank the value in the short-term, but eventually he’ll need things to turn around.</p><p id="7e9f"><strong>His focus on speed is incredible and he’s obviously not afraid of blowing things up</strong>, but now the real measure will be how it get reconstructed and if enough people want the new <em>everything app</em> he is building.</p><p id="c2ac">I learned a ton from watching Elon up close — the good, the bad and the ugly. His boldness, passion and storytelling is inspiring, but his lack of process and empathy is painful.</p><p id="e2bb">Elon has an exceptional talent for tackling hard physics-based problems but products that facilitate human connection and communication require a different type of social-emotional intelligence.</p><p id="03ff"><strong>Social networks are hard to kill but they’re not immune from death spirals.</strong> Only time will tell what the outcome will be but I hope X finds its footing because competition is good for consumers.</p><p id="7414">In the meantime, I have a lot of empathy for the employees who are working tirelessly behind the scenes, the advertisers who want a stable platform to sell their stuff on, and the customers who are experiencing chaotic updates. It’s been a madhouse.</p><p id="4d34">Twitter moved at the speed of molasses and suffered from bureaucracy but now X is run by a mercurial leader whose instinct is driven by the unique and undoubtedly weird experience of being the biggest voice on the platform.</p><p id="7203"><strong>Many of you know me from the <em>sleeping bag incident</em> where I slept on a conference room floor</strong>, so I figure, let’s talk about that too.</p><p id="937e">Going viral was an odd and interesting experience. I was attacked by people on the left and called a billionaire bootlicker, while simultaneously being attacked by people on the right for being a working mom who was demonized as an example of a woman choosing her career over her family.</p><p id="de80">Thankfully I can laugh at myself and I don’t take armchair keyboard ideologues too seriously. <strong>Being the main character on the timeline, even for a few minutes, requires a thick skin and a strong sense of self.</strong></p><p id="e1f5">The real story is pretty simple. I was given a nearly impossible deadline for his first project and as the product lead I would never ask anyone to do anything I wasn’t willing to do myself. So I worked round the clock alongside an amazing team spanning many timezones, and we delivered it on schedule — truly against the odds. It was intense but also fun.</p><p id="7e54"><em>Those first few months were wildly crazy but I wanted to be there and I have no regrets.</em></p><p id="f2f5">Showing up and giving it your all should, in most cases, be celebrated. Obviously you can’t work at that pace forever but there are moments where bursts are mission critical. I’ve pulled many all-nighters in my career and also when I was a student for something that mattered to me. I don’t regret putting in long hours or being ambitious, and feel proud of how far I’ve come from where I started thanks in part to that type of work ethic.</p><p id="505a"><strong>I think of life as a game, and being at Twitter after the acquisition was like playing life at Level 10 on Hard Mode. </strong>Since I like taking on difficult challenges I found it interesting and rewarding because I was growing and learning so rapidly.</p><p id="6d44">I realize our society today trends toward polarization but when it comes to this app, its owner, and its future, <strong>I am neither a fan girl nor a hater — I’m an optimistic pragmatist</strong>.</p><p id="36f9">This may really irritate the internet but you cannot pigeonhole me into some radical position of either loving or hating every change that’s occurred. I escaped my fundamentalist upbringing and am a free thinker these days. <strong>Everyone can be seen as both a hero or a villain, depending on who is telling what angle of the story. </strong>Elon doesn’t deserve to be venerated or vilified. He’s a complicated person with an unfathomable amount of financial and geopolitical power which is why <strong>humanity needs him to err on the side of goodness, rather than political divisiveness and pettiness</strong>.</p><p id="e2d7">I disagree with many of his decisions and am surprised by his willingness to burn so much down, but with enough money and time, something new &amp; innovative may emerge.</p><p id="77a7">I hope it does.</p><p id="676a"><strong>Sometimes I get asked about how I felt when I got laid off, and the truth is it was the best gift I’ve ever received. </strong>Sure the headlines and punchlines wrote themselves but I was battle hardened by then. I knew that I’d worked in a way where I could walk out with my head held high. I have no bitterness about the Product Management team being dismantled, and it made sense for me to exit as nearly all of the remaining PMs were let go.</p><p id="2d07">Going on a sabbatical afterward has been exactly what I needed to decompress and I’m finally feeling rested and relaxed. I’m a creative and a builder, so sooner than later I’ll jump back into a high intensity company but I’m grateful for this season of thinking, reading, traveling and being with people I love.</p><p id="d8c5">After having time to reflect <strong>I believe more than ever that the very best outcomes flow from great leadership that combines <em>the head and the heart</em></strong>.</p><p id="f153">I’d be remiss if I didn’t note that in all of this there is also a cautionary tale for anyone who succeeds at something — which is that <strong>the higher you climb, the smaller your world becomes</strong>. It’s a strange paradox but the richest and most powerful people are also some of the most isolated.</p><p id="e085">I found myself frequently looking at Elon and seeing a person who seemed quite alone because his time and energy was so purely devoted to work, which is not the model of a life I want to live.</p><p id="7f5d">Money and fame can create psychological prisons which may worsen mental health conditions. We’ve all seen high profile cases of celebrities who end up with some combination of depression, paranoia, delusions of grandeur, mania and/or erratic behavior.</p><p id="09e0">Living in an echo chamber is dangerous and <strong>being at the top makes a person even more susceptible to being surrounded by yes people when nearly everyone around you is on the payroll and somehow stands to benefit from being in your orbit</strong>. Figuring out how to keep “better angels” around in the form of family, friends, and teammates is critical to staying on the rails and enduring intense ups and downs. Everyone needs to hear hard truths sometimes and if you fire all the people who speak up then the reality distortion field may just turn into a vortex.</p><p id="aa69">I was drawn to Twitter because I’m obsessed with the problem of loneliness and connection between people. <strong>I find it fascinating &amp; troubling that humans are getting lonelier as we simultaneously create a world that’s both safer and wealthier.</strong> I don’t believe that trade-off has to exist, which is why I keep returning to that theme in my personal and professional life.</p><p id="e729">I realize this is <em>too long of a tweet</em> but Twitter was a weird and special place on the internet, and I’m grateful to have played a teeny tiny role in its story and evolution.</p><p id="996a">I’m here for whatever comes next — on this app and in new places. Consumer social is very much alive and at a fascinating juncture, so I’ll be watching and participating and sharing hot takes because I don’t want to, and probably can’t, turn that part of me off.</p><p id="462d">Perhaps X becomes a resounding success. Or it fails epically.</p><p id="9005">Either way, I expect it will continue to be a very entertaining ride.</p><p id="876c">🫡</p></div></div>]]></description>
