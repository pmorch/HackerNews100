<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>John didn’t start his career mad. </p><p>He trained as an emergency medicine doctor in a tidily run Midwestern emergency room about a decade ago. He loved the place, especially the way its management was so responsive to the doctors’ needs, offering extra staffing when things got busy and paid administrative time for teaching other trainees. Doctors provided most of the care, occasionally overseeing the work of <a href="https://www.vox.com/even-better/24050901/nurse-practitioner-physician-assistant-doctor-health-care-quality">nurse practitioners and physician associates</a>. He signed on to start there full-time shortly after finishing his residency.</p><p>A month before his start date, a <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/6/21024740/private-equity-taylor-swift-toys-r-us-elizabeth-warren">private equity firm</a> bought the practice. “I can’t even tell you how quickly it changed,” John says. The ratio of doctors to other clinicians flipped, shrinking doctor hours to a minimum as the firm moved to save on salaries.</p><p>John — who is being referred to by a pseudonym due to concerns over professional repercussions — quit and found a job at another emergency room in a different state. It too soon sold out to the same private equity firm. Then it happened again, and then again. Small emergency rooms “kept getting gobbled up by these gigantic corporations so fast,” he said. By the time doctors tried to jump ship to another ER, “they were already sold out.”</p><p>At all of the private equity-acquired ERs where John worked, things changed almost overnight: In addition to having their hours cut, doctors were docked pay if they didn’t evaluate new arrivals within 25 minutes of them walking through the door, leading to hasty orders for “kitchen sink” workups geared mostly toward productivity — not toward real cost-effectiveness or diagnostic precision. Amid all of this, cuts to their hours when ER volumes were low meant John and his colleagues’ pay was all over the place.</p><p>Patient care was suffering “from the toe sprains all the way up to the gunshot wounds and heart attacks,” says John. His experience wasn’t an anomaly — it was happening in emergency rooms across the country. “All of my colleagues were experiencing the same thing.”</p><div><p>“Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” </p></div><p>At times, the short staffing combined with the pressure to churn patients led to deadly shortcuts. John remembers rushing to evaluate one patient and missing his extensive history of alcohol abuse. The patient spent hours getting tests directed at the wrong diagnosis.</p><p>John could have put together a more appropriate plan if he’d had a few more minutes to sit down and get a better history, but by the time he realized what was going on, the patient was too severely ill. He died in the intensive care unit two days later.</p><p>“Is that 100 percent because of that staffing? Probably not,” says John. “But if I wasn’t so stressed about jumping into that patient room, making sure my door-to-provider time was less than 25 minutes …” The hypothetical hangs in the air.</p><p>“Were they going to die anyway? Maybe. But that’s not how I sleep at night. That was four years ago. I think about that guy every day.” </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a giant round orange monster casting a dark shadow over an emergency medical center with medical equipment dangling from its teeth." data-chromatic="ignore" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="fill" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, (max-width: 1023px) 50vw, 700px" srcset="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=256 256w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=376 376w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=384 384w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=415 415w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=480 480w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=540 540w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=640 640w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=750 750w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=828 828w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1080 1080w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1200 1200w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1440 1440w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=1920 1920w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2048 2048w, https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400 2400w" src="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot1_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&amp;w=2400"></a></p></div><p><cite>Xinmei Liu for Vox</cite></p></div><p>The story of how private equity has been able to so thoroughly debilitate emergency care is one of the more dramatic examples of how corporate interests are corrosive to America’s health care system — and how powerless they leave individual consumers. Today, private equity continues to operate a shocking <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/p/state-of-the-us-emergency-medicine-677">quarter of ERs nationwide</a>, as of March 2024. </p><p>Still, there’s some hope: Academics, patient advocates, and doctors say you can make defensive moves to protect your finances and care before, during, and after you or a loved one visits an ER. </p><p>Understanding private equity’s transformation of America’s emergency rooms is the first step. </p><div><p id="how-private-equity-sunk-its-claws-into-emergency-care"><h2>How private equity sunk its claws into emergency care </h2></p></div><p>Modern private equity got its start in the early 1980s, when a free-market acolyte — and former member of the Nixon administration — completed the first major “<a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it">leveraged buyout</a>.” Using mostly borrowed money, William Simon and his partner bought a greeting card company, extracted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/business/reaping-the-big-profits-from-a-fat-cat.html">huge fees</a>, and then sold it for a massive profit less than two years later. </p><p>Over the next few decades, what was then called the leveraged buyout industry moved into other sectors. Firms flipped businesses to yield spectacular profits, often cutting corners on the products and services they offered, eliminating jobs, and reducing employee benefits. </p><p>It was only a matter of time until the industry, now rebranded as private equity, turned its gaze on the US’s $4 trillion health care sector, which was already becoming <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/explainer/2023/nov/private-equity-role-health-care#:~:text=Given%20its%20short%2Dterm%20financial,reduce%20costs%2C%20thus%20improving%20value.">increasingly commercialized</a> as nonprofit health systems consolidated, paid their executives <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy/2023/2/24/23610762/hospital-ceo-nurses-salary-study-north-carolina">ever more extravagant salaries</a>, and otherwise played business hardball. Private equity takeovers in health care <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5673a288-f55b-4cfd-aa76-0ebb30b029a6">started around 2000</a> and have steadily increased since; when several big banks crumbled in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, private equity’s growth only accelerated. </p><p>Emergency medicine wasn’t always an appealing target for private equity. Physician staffing in many emergency rooms around the country was traditionally handled by <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/welcome-to-the-emergency-room-a-wall-street-honcho-will-decide-your-treatment">co-op-like groups, run by working doctors</a>, that contracted with hospitals. In the 1990s, <a href="https://substack.perfectunion.us/p/what-happens-when-private-equity">ex-physicians and businesspeople</a> began taking ownership of these so-called contract management groups (CMGs). As they did, they started acting more like for-profit businesses, centralizing decision-making and earnings. </p><p>The easier it was to make decisions that prioritized profits, the more money CMGs made — and the more attractive they became to private equity. </p><p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">Through the mid- to late-2010s</a>, private equity firms swallowed up a shocking number of American emergency rooms, leaving in their wake a generationally hollowed-out system for providing emergency care to people across the country. Private equity firms and other corporate interests owned nearly 9 percent of ER doctor groups in 2009; by 2019, they owned <a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">22 percent</a>. The wave of takeovers and consolidations peaked in 2021 but carries on all over the US, especially in Florida, Texas, and other <a href="https://academic.oup.com/healthaffairsscholar/article/1/1/qxad008/7203733?login=false">parts of the South and West where the firms have been most aggressive</a>. </p><p>Doctors trying to practice medicine the way they’d been trained to — with a priority on patient care, not profits — found they couldn’t outrun the monster. Private equity’s dominance persisted even after the federal <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf">No Surprises Act</a>, enacted in 2022, made many of their most profitable practices illegal.</p><p>Lots of for-profit models are a bad fit for health care, but of all of them, private equity is perhaps the worst, says <a href="https://pestakeholder.org/about-us/meet-the-team/">Eileen O’Grady</a>, director of programs at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, a nonprofit watchdog group: “It basically takes the for-profit model and makes it so much more extractive and so much more harmful and risky.”</p><div><p id="private-equity-puts-profit-above-all-else"><h2>Private equity puts profit above all else </h2></p></div><p>To understand what makes private equity such a malignant force in health care, you have to understand its uniquely craven and purposefully opaque corporate structure. </p><p>Imagine you own a lemonade stand, and you want it to make more money. You have a few options: You can plow all your profits back into the business until it grows — what business school types call organic growth. Alternatively, you can get a bank loan. If you’re really ambitious, you can sell shares of your lemonade stand to the general public by promising them a good return on their investment. </p><p>There’s another option here, one that will make you richer quicker: You can sell all or most of the stand to the rich kid at the end of the street. He’s offering you a lot of money for it — more than you’d get over the short term from the other options. That’s because he’s taken out a huge loan to pay for the deal.</p><p>But there are a couple of catches: First, if he runs into financial trouble (which he very well might, since he’s been buying up lemonade stands all over town), he’ll sell it off for parts, leaving the neighborhood lemonade-less. This will cost him nothing personally because he used the lemonade stand as collateral for that big loan.</p><p>The second and perhaps more important catch is that this kid is buying your lemonade stand in order to sell it. He doesn’t care about lemonade or the people who like it. His strategy is to make the stand’s balance sheet look so attractive that a few years later, another investor will buy it at a premium — or if that fails, then yes, to sell it off for parts. A year down the road, odds are high your precious lemonade stand will be a sad shadow of what it once was, or it might not exist at all. </p><p>That kid is private equity.</p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot3_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of an elderly patient in a hospital bed looking on as two doctors race in opposite directions past his room.

It’s not just lemonade. People’s lives are at stake.</p></div><p>The way private equity gets into emergency care is by buying out the CMGs that manage physician staffing — that is to say, the firms only buy the clinicians themselves. </p><p>It’s a different model than when private equity invests in other areas of health care. When firms buy hospitals, nursing homes, medical practices, rehabilitation facilities, and group homes, they acquire not only staff, but also buildings, land, and medical equipment.</p><p>In the case of emergency care, “private equity doesn’t pay the hospital rent, they don’t hire the nurses, they don’t pay the electric bills, they don’t provide any of the equipment,” says <a href="https://medicine.temple.edu/robert-mcnamara">Robert McNamara</a>, chair of the emergency medicine department at Temple University in Philadelphia. The hospital still handles those finances. “They’re just working the labor force. … The highest-cost thing on their expense side is the board-certified emergency physician.” </p><p>When emergency rooms first caught the eye of private equity firms, the prospective investors offered the physician owners of CMGs huge payouts. </p><p><a href="https://www.ivyclinicians.io/about">Leon Adelman</a>, an emergency medicine doctor who leads the staffing firm <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/p/state-of-the-us-emergency-medicine-677">Ivy Clinicians</a> and writes a workforce-focused <a href="https://emworkforce.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=substack_profile">newsletter</a>, says the owners faced a tough choice: “‘Do I do what is ethical and feels right … and I get a nice going-away party and maybe a watch or something — or do I get $10 million?’”</p><p>“What they were buying was the ability to charge patients who were consuming a non-shoppable service,” Adelman says — one for which patients are unable to compare prices. If you’re having a heart attack, you’re not going to call around to hospitals to find out who is going to give you the best deal.</p><p>Hospitals that increasingly have profit on the brain often found private equity a more attractive partner than doctor-owned CMGs. The firms are flush with cash, which means they don’t look to the hospitals to shore up their finances. “They won’t ask you for a penny,” Adelman explains. “They’re making plenty of money.” </p><p>Once a private equity firm bought an emergency room, there were two levers it could pull to make a profit: It could maximize what it reaped from patients who’d received services, and it could cut what it spent paying the clinicians who provided those services.</p><p>Doing both at the same time has made emergency medicine practically unrecognizable.</p><div><p id="burned-out-doctors-screwed-over-patients"><h2>Burned-out doctors, screwed-over patients</h2></p></div><p>Under new private equity ownership, ERs adopted an assortment of unsavory practices. Firms not only pressured clinicians to see patients faster, as illustrated by John’s experience, but to recommend <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23623">hospital admission</a> for more patients. They also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/upshot/the-company-behind-many-surprise-emergency-room-bills.html">dramatically raised the price tags</a> for a range of emergency services, resulting in back-breakingly large bills for patients nationwide, like ones charging <a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/er-doctor-private-equity-in-medicine-is-dangerous-to-patients">thousands of dollars</a> for glue applied to a half-inch wound.</p><p>To avoid having to negotiate those astronomical bills with the expert hagglers at insurance companies, firms kept their ERs from participating in many insurance networks. It was easier to collect on a so-called balance bill — the portion of a medical bill not paid for by a patient’s insurer — if the care a patient had received wasn’t covered by their insurance at all. </p><p>In a study of two of the largest emergency medicine staffing firms in the US, health economist Zack Cooper found <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w23623">costs to patients went up more than 80 percent</a> after a corporate interest took ownership. </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot4_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a doctor running in three different directions with timers floating above her head.

However, in recent years, the burnout rate has climbed to <a href="https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/nearly-half-of-doctors-report-burnout-but-there-is-some-progress-survey-finds">63 percent</a>, according to a 2024 Medscape survey, and the specialty is <a href="https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2023/03/21/ed-doctors#:~:text=According%20to%20Elizabeth%20Datner%2C%20chair,thousand%20cuts%2C%22%20she%20said.">losing popularity</a> among medical students.

Gary Peters (D-MI) <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-care/senate-questions-private-equity-hospital-emergency-departments-peters-rcna145909">initiated an investigation</a> into private equity’s effects on the quality of emergency care. </p><p>Private equity can only do what it does because so many other parts of American health care are so dysfunctional. “Just to be really clear, private equity is not the main harm of health care in the US,” says O’Grady. “I think it’s a symptom of a much bigger problem.”</p><p>In the US health care ecosystem, private equity is a bottom-feeder, an entity that can only exist because of the bad behavior and misaligned incentives of the bigger players in the marketplace. Private equity’s deep pockets, its willingness to extort patients, its heavy-handedness with telling doctors how to practice wouldn’t be possible — much less an advantage — in the absence of these larger upstream problems. </p><p>Maybe there wouldn’t be as many <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/private-equity-investment-as-a-divining-rod-for-market-failure-policy-responses-to-harmful-physician-practice-acquisitions/">opportunities for private equity to make money</a> in health care if hospital budgets were stable; if insurance companies didn’t play hardball with both providers and patients; if pharmaceutical industry players didn’t artificially and unevenly inflate drug prices; if elected officials weren’t so susceptible to powerful lobbies that block comprehensive, loophole-closing health care reform.</p><p>That’s not the world we live in, however; and because the American health care system is broken in these and so many other ways, private equity thrives within it, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/private-equity-publicly-traded-companies/675788/">often invisibly</a>. </p><div><p id="congress-tried-to-fix-the-problem-but-fell-short"><h2><strong>Congress tried to fix the problem — but fell short</strong></h2></p></div><p>In 2020, Congress threw a huge wrench in the private equity game plan when it passed the <a href="https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nsa-keyprotections.pdf">No Surprises Act</a>, aimed at saving patients from receiving shocking bills after getting emergency care. </p><p>When the law took effect in January 2022, it meant that patients who receive emergency care can’t get billed for out-of-network care, even if the care is from an out-of-network facility or doctor. (They do still have to pay whatever deductibles, copays, or coinsurance their insurance plan would require related to an in-network visit.) It also protects people from higher bills if they get routine, non-emergency care at an in-network facility from an out-of-network doctor without their knowledge or consent. </p><p>Billers — including private equity owners of emergency medicine practices — now have to ask insurance companies to pay the balance of their out-of-network bills. It turns out it’s a lot harder to extract unreasonable fees from insurance companies than from individuals. </p><p>The act served as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-physician-partners-files-for-bankruptcy-after-shutdown-5792e23c">death</a> (or <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/fitch-downgrades-team-health-holdings-inc-to-ccc-13-11-2023">near</a>-<a href="https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/envision-healthcare-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy">death</a>) blow for several emergency medicine groups backed by private equity, which at their peak staffed nearly one-fifth of American emergency departments. That really only means some of these firms are now being run with oversight from courts and creditors, not that all of them are out of business: They’re largely still standing, and many have since only expanded their footprint in emergency care. </p><div><div><p><a href="https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/240917_xinmei_Vox_ER-Monster_spot2_v2.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;crop=0,0,100,100" data-pswp-height="1800" data-pswp-width="1800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img alt="An illustration of a giant orange monster peeking in the window of an emergency room’s seating area.

Many people simply are <a href="https://gop-waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Spicer-Testimony.pdf">unaware when they’ve been incorrectly billed</a>. Clinicians and the facilities they work for occasionally don’t follow the legislation’s rules, or inappropriately ask patients to waive their protections. Insurance companies don’t automatically absolve patients of responsibility for a surprise out-of-network bill, and the appeals process is complicated and time-consuming. And there are loopholes: Out-of-network ambulances and urgent care facilities aren’t covered, and neither is the follow-up care people get after an emergency room visit.</p><p>The emergency medicine profession, meanwhile, will take a while to recover from private equity’s onslaught. John’s colleagues are the kinds of doctors who will drive a patient home if they don’t have a ride, he says. Many of the people who seek care in American emergency rooms live on the poorest and most marginalized fringes of society; emergency medicine doctors know this, and for some of them, it’s an important reason they chose the work.</p><p>“This is not about pay for us,” he says. “This is just about being fair and letting us practice how we want to practice.

And yet, that’s the health care system the US has. </p><p>It’s hard for people to tell when a private equity firm has taken over a local emergency room. It’s not like the firm slaps its logo on the side of the building. Patients usually don’t even know until they get a bill that an investment company had a hand in determining who saw them in the emergency room and what kind of workup they ordered, says McNamara<strong>.</strong> </p><p>Given that reality, anyone who may one day visit an emergency room in the middle of a crisis — that is to say, nearly everyone — should know how to protect themselves, says <a href="https://pirg.org/people/patricia-kelmar/">Patricia Kelmar</a>, who directs health care campaigns for the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG).

Still, it’s worth making an advance plan for where you’ll go if you have the option.</p><p>Cooper, the health economist, says an emergency room’s ownership isn’t the only thing that matters in deciding whether to go there in an emergency. If a private equity-owned ER sees a higher patient volume than others and is affiliated with an academic institution, it may still be the best option.</p><p>Even with the No Surprises Act in place, care from in-network doctors at in-network hospitals is far less likely to result in unpleasant bills. So before you need an emergency room, check with your insurance company to see which ones are in network and nearest to you. Once you’re at an emergency room, Cooper suggests asking to see an in-network physician. </p><div><p id="make-a-plan-for-how-to-get-there"><h3><strong>Make a plan for how to get there</strong></h3></p></div><p>Ambulance transport is <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-unexpectedly-high-ambulance-bills-are-still-a-problem-in-the-u-s#:~:text=Every%20year%2C%20roughly%203%20million,transports%20are%20out%20of%20network">unlikely to be cost-free</a> for most Americans, so if you need to get to an emergency room and you’re in stable condition, it’s worth trying to get there in other ways. </p><p>Air ambulances are covered by the No Surprises Act, but ground ambulances are not, and are unfortunately often out-of-network for many people. The ones owned by private equity are especially <a href="https://healthpolicy.usc.edu/research/ground-ambulance-billing-and-prices-differ-by-ownership-structure/">likely to be wildly expensive</a>. Nevertheless, many states have laws to protect consumers from outrageous ambulance bills — but <a href="https://pirg.org/edfund/resources/emergency-the-high-cost-of-ambulance-surprise-bills/">only if their plan is state-regulated</a>, which means about 60 percent of insured people are still unprotected. You can figure out if yours is one of them by contacting your <a href="https://content.naic.org/state-insurance-departments">state’s insurance department</a>. </p><p>You can also work with your insurance company and the ambulance company to negotiate big bills; legal aid organizations can also provide assistance. </p><div><p id="understand-what-youre-signing"><h3><strong>Understand what you’re signing</strong></h3></p></div><p>Non-emergency hospital departments (for example, the ones that would take care of you if you had to stay in the hospital for more care after an ER visit) are allowed to ask you to sign away your No Surprises Act protections.

This is quite a feat for an organization that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/technology/mira-murati-openai.html">reportedly</a> burns through $7 billion a year—far more cash than it brings in—but it makes sense when you realize that OpenAI’s primary product isn’t technology. It’s stories.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Case in point: Last week, CEO Sam Altman published an online manifesto titled “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ia.samaltman.com/">The Intelligence Age</a>.” In it, he declares that the AI revolution is on the verge of unleashing boundless prosperity and radically improving human life. “We’ll soon be able to work with AI that helps us accomplish much more than we ever could without AI,” he writes. Altman expects that his technology will fix the climate, help humankind establish space colonies, and discover all of physics. He predicts that we may have an all-powerful superintelligence “in a few thousand days.” All we have to do is feed his technology enough energy, enough data, and enough chips.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Maybe someday Altman’s ideas about AI will prove out, but for now, his approach is textbook Silicon Valley mythmaking. In these narratives, humankind is forever on the cusp of a technological breakthrough that will transform society for the better. The hard technical problems have basically been solved—all that’s left now are the details, which will surely be worked out through market competition and old-fashioned entrepreneurship. <em>Spend billions now; make trillions later! </em>This was the story of the dot-com boom in the 1990s, and of nanotechnology in the 2000s. It was the story of cryptocurrency and robotics in the 2010s. The technologies never quite work out like the Altmans of the world promise, but the stories keep regulators and regular people sidelined while the entrepreneurs, engineers, and investors build empires. (<em>The Atlantic</em> recently entered a corporate partnership with OpenAI.)</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">Read: AI doomerism is a decoy</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Despite the rhetoric, Altman’s products currently feel less like a glimpse of the future and more like the mundane, buggy present. ChatGPT and DALL-E were cutting-edge technology in 2022. People tried the chatbot and image generator for the first time and were astonished. Altman and his ilk spent the following year speaking in stage whispers about the awesome technological force that had just been unleashed upon the world. Prominent AI figures were among the thousands of people who signed an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">open letter in March 2023</a> to urge a six-month pause in the development of large language models ( LLMs) so that humanity would have time to address the social consequences of the impending revolution. Those six months came and went. OpenAI and its competitors have released other models since then, and although tech wonks have dug into their purported advancements, for most people, the technology appears to have plateaued. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/gpt4-release-rumors-hype-future-iterations/673396/">GPT-4</a> now looks less like the precursor to an all-powerful superintelligence and more like … well, any other chatbot.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The technology itself seems much smaller once the novelty wears off. You can use a large language model to compose an email or a story—but not a particularly original one. The tools still hallucinate (meaning they confidently assert false information). They still fail in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/05/google-search-ai-overview-health-webmd/678508/">embarrassing and unexpected ways</a>. Meanwhile, the web is filling up with useless “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-generated-content-internet-online-slop-spam.html">AI slop</a>,” LLM-generated trash that costs practically nothing to produce and generates pennies of advertising revenue for the creator. We’re in a race to the bottom that everyone saw coming and no one is happy with. Meanwhile, the search for product-market fit at a scale that would justify all the inflated tech-company valuations keeps coming up short. Even OpenAI’s latest release, o1, was accompanied by a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://x.com/sama/status/1834283100639297910">caveat</a> from Altman that “it still seems more impressive on first use than it does after you spend more time with it.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In Altman’s rendering, this moment in time is just a waypoint, “the doorstep of the next leap in prosperity.” He still argues that the deep-learning technique that powers ChatGPT will effectively be able to solve any problem, at any scale, so long as it has enough energy, enough computational power, and enough data. Many computer scientists are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691249131/ai-snake-oil?srsltid=AfmBOoq0PglTl-ZvYI9vexaTNJouMOR1cqpznKeo_-DOv-KWBWCvQrZu">skeptical of this claim</a>, maintaining that multiple significant scientific breakthroughs stand between us and artificial general intelligence. But Altman projects confidence that his company has it all well in hand, that science fiction will soon become reality. He may need <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/sam-altman-seeks-trillions-of-dollars-to-reshape-business-of-chips-and-ai-89ab3db0">$7 trillion</a> or so to realize his ultimate vision—not to mention <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/sam-altman-s-helion-energy-promises-fusion-power-by-2028">unproven fusion-energy technology</a>—but that’s peanuts when compared with all the advances he is promising.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">There’s just one tiny problem, though: Altman is no physicist. He is a serial entrepreneur, and quite clearly a talented one. He is one of Silicon Valley’s most revered talent scouts. If you look at Altman’s breakthrough successes, they all pretty much revolve around connecting early start-ups with piles of investor cash, not any particular technical innovation.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/sam-altman-openai-for-profit/680031/">Read: OpenAI takes its mask off</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">It’s remarkable how similar Altman’s rhetoric sounds to that of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">his fellow billionaire techno-optimists</a>. The project of techno-optimism, for decades now, has been to insist that if we just have faith in technological progress and free the inventors and investors from pesky regulations such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html">copyright law</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/09/ftc-announces-crackdown-deceptive-ai-claims-schemes">deceptive marketing</a>, then the marketplace will work its magic and everyone will be better off. Altman has made nice with lawmakers, insisting that artificial intelligence requires responsible regulation. But the company’s response to proposed regulation seems to be “<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/">no, not like that</a>.” Lord, grant us regulatory clarity—but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225648/openai-letter-california-ai-safety-bill-sb-1047">not just yet.</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At a high enough level of abstraction, Altman’s entire job is to keep us all fixated on an imagined AI future so we don’t get too caught up in the underwhelming details of the present. Why focus on how AI is being used to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2024/09/ai-is-triggering-a-child-sex-abuse-crisis/680053/">harass and exploit children</a> when you can imagine the ways it will make your life easier? It’s much more pleasant fantasizing about a benevolent future AI, one that fixes the problems wrought by climate change, than dwelling upon the phenomenal <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/09/microsoft-ai-oil-contracts/679804/">energy</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/ai-water-climate-microsoft/677602/">water consumption</a> of actually existing AI today.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Remember, these technologies already have a track record. The world can and should evaluate them, and the people building them, based on their results and their effects, not solely on their supposed potential.</p></section><div data-event-module="footer"><p><h3>About the Author</h3></p><div><address id="article-writer-0" data-event-element="author" data-event-position="1" data-flatplan-bio="true"><div><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-karpf/" data-label="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/david-karpf/" data-action="click author - name">David Karpf</a> is an associate professor in the School of Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University.</p></div></address></div></div><gpt-ad format="injector" sizes-at-0="mobile-wide,native,house" targeting-pos="injector-most-popular" sizes-at-976="desktop-wide,native,house"></gpt-ad></article></div>]]></description>

<!-- /wp:separator --></div><p><a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/">Apple’s AI research team</a> has developed a new model that could significantly advance how machines perceive depth, potentially transforming industries ranging from augmented reality to autonomous vehicles.</p>



<p>The system, called&nbsp;<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02073">Depth Pro</a>, is able to generate detailed 3D depth maps from single 2D images in a fraction of a second—without relying on the camera data traditionally needed to make such predictions.</p>



<p>The technology, detailed in a research paper titled&nbsp;<em>“<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02073">Depth Pro: Sharp Monocular Metric Depth in Less Than a Second</a>,”</em>&nbsp;is a major leap forward in the field of monocular depth estimation, a process that uses just one image to infer depth.</p>



<p>This could have far-reaching applications across sectors where real-time spatial awareness is key. The model’s creators, led by Aleksei Bochkovskii and Vladlen Koltun, describe&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;as one of the fastest and most accurate systems of its kind.</p>

<p>Monocular depth estimation has long been a challenging task, requiring either multiple images or metadata like focal lengths to accurately gauge depth.</p>



<p>But&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;bypasses these requirements, producing high-resolution depth maps in just 0.3 seconds on a standard GPU. The model can create 2.25-megapixel maps with exceptional sharpness, capturing even minute details like hair and vegetation that are often overlooked by other methods.</p>



<p>“These characteristics are enabled by a number of technical contributions, including an efficient multi-scale vision transformer for dense prediction,” the researchers explain in their paper. This architecture allows the model to process both the overall context of an image and its finer details simultaneously—an enormous leap from slower, less precise models that came before it.</p>

<h2 id="h-metric-depth-zero-shot-learning">Metric depth, zero-shot learning</h2>



<p>What truly sets&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;apart is its ability to estimate both relative and absolute depth, a capability called “metric depth.”</p>



<p>This means that the model can provide real-world measurements, which is essential for applications like augmented reality (AR), where virtual objects need to be placed in precise locations within physical spaces.</p>



<p>And&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;doesn’t require extensive training on domain-specific datasets to make accurate predictions—a feature known as “zero-shot learning.” This makes the model highly versatile. It can be applied to a wide range of images, without the need for the camera-specific data usually required in depth estimation models.</p>



<p>“Depth Pro produces metric depth maps with absolute scale on arbitrary images ‘in the wild’ without requiring metadata such as camera intrinsics,” the authors explain. This flexibility opens up a world of possibilities, from enhancing AR experiences to improving autonomous vehicles’ ability to detect and navigate obstacles.</p>



<p>For those curious to experience Depth Pro firsthand, a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/depth-pro">live demo</a> is available on the Hugging Face platform.</p>

<h2 id="h-real-world-applications-from-e-commerce-to-autonomous-vehicles">Real-world applications: From e-commerce to autonomous vehicles</h2>



<p>This versatility has significant implications for various industries. In e-commerce, for example,&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;could allow consumers to see how furniture fits in their home by simply pointing their phone’s camera at the room. In the automotive industry, the ability to generate real-time, high-resolution depth maps from a single camera could improve how self-driving cars perceive their environment, boosting navigation and safety.</p>



<p>“The method should ideally produce metric depth maps in this zero-shot regime to accurately reproduce object shapes, scene layouts, and absolute scales,” the researchers write, emphasizing the model’s potential to reduce the time and cost associated with training more conventional AI models.</p>



<h2 id="h-tackling-the-challenges-of-depth-estimation">Tackling the challenges of depth estimation</h2>



<p>One of the toughest challenges in depth estimation is handling what are known as “flying pixels”—pixels that appear to float in mid-air due to errors in depth mapping.&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;tackles this issue head-on, making it particularly effective for applications like 3D reconstruction and virtual environments, where accuracy is paramount.</p>



<p>Additionally,&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;excels in boundary tracing, outperforming previous models in sharply delineating objects and their edges. The researchers claim it surpasses other systems “by a multiplicative factor in boundary accuracy,” which is key for applications that require precise object segmentation, such as image matting and medical imaging.</p>



<h2 id="h-open-source-and-ready-to-scale">Open-source and ready to scale</h2>



<p>In a move that could accelerate its adoption, Apple has made&nbsp;Depth Pro&nbsp;open-source. The code, along with pre-trained model weights, is <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available on GitHub</a>, allowing developers and researchers to experiment with and further refine the technology. The repository includes everything from the model’s architecture to pretrained checkpoints, making it easy for others to build on Apple’s work.</p>



<p>The research team is also encouraging further exploration of&nbsp;Depth Pro’s potential in fields like robotics, manufacturing, and healthcare. “We release code and weights at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/apple/ml-depth-pro</a>,”&nbsp;the authors write, signaling this as just the beginning for the model.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-next-for-ai-depth-perception">What’s next for AI depth perception</h2>



<p>As artificial intelligence continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible,&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;sets a new standard in speed and accuracy for monocular depth estimation. Its ability to generate high-quality, real-time depth maps from a single image could have wide-ranging effects across industries that rely on spatial awareness.</p>



<p>In a world where AI is increasingly central to decision-making and product development,&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;exemplifies how cutting-edge research can translate into practical, real-world solutions. Whether it’s improving how machines perceive their surroundings or enhancing consumer experiences, the potential uses for&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;are broad and varied.</p>



<p>As the researchers conclude, “Depth Pro dramatically outperforms all prior work in sharp delineation of object boundaries, including fine structures such as hair, fur, and vegetation.” With its open-source release,&nbsp;<em>Depth Pro</em>&nbsp;could soon become integral to industries ranging from autonomous driving to augmented reality—transforming how machines and people interact with 3D environments.</p>

Why? Because Seth Altman’s offense took place in Lubbock, Texas. I live in Austin, Texas. Four hundred miles away. What I do care about however is the misuse of emergency alert systems and public trust.</p><p><span>Sending out a screeching alert to 30million+ people over 250 million square miles in the middle of the night should only be used in the absolute DIREST OF CIRCUMSTANCES… circumstances like “Texas is under threat from hurricane/chemical leak/nuclear weapons, seek shelter now!” It should </span><em>never</em><span> be used for something that’s utterly irrelevant to 99.99% of people. </span></p><p>Why? Because the public’s trust in government emergency protocols is already hanging by a thread, and in order for those protocols to work when we really need them, they will need to be received and listened to. Instead, Texans by the hundreds of thousands are now turning off their phone’s emergency alerts, possibly forever. Why would anyone with a life to lead leave them on and risk getting their sleep disrupted over personally inconsequential events hundreds of miles away? </p><p>Such an outcome could be truly dangerous for Texas in the long run. If and when a real major emergency strikes, we will no longer have this important tool of public awareness or coordination. And that’s just the second order effects! There are likely going to be some excess deaths today as a direct result—there are 30m+ people in Texas, many of whom are in weak cardiovascular health. I would not be surprised at all if hospitals report an spike in cardiovascular events today. Not to mention an increase in road accidents; Texas is a notoriously driving-heavy state, and few things are worse for safe driving than sleep impairment.</p><p>So I hope the local government takes a long hard look at its alert-pressing finger. We all know the lesson of the Boy Who Cried Wolf, exhausting his village with his over-zealous cries. Well this time the village is thirty million people. Heads need to roll.</p></div></article></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p>LONDON (AP) — The European Union’s top court said Friday that social media company Meta can’t use public information about a user’s sexual orientation obtained outside its platforms for personalized advertising under the bloc’s strict data privacy rules. </p><p>The decision from the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is a <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-instagram-whatsapp-ai-artificial-intelligence-8d6cb3424ee410c641d0acdb154601f5">victory for Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems</a></span>, who has been a thorn in the side of Big Tech companies over their compliance with 27-nation bloc’s data privacy rules. </p><p>The EU court issued its ruling after Austria’s supreme court asked for guidance in Schrems’ case on how to apply the privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. </p><p>Schrems had complained that Facebook had processed personal data including information about his sexual orientation to target him with online advertising, even though he had never disclosed on his account that he was gay. The only time he had publicly revealed this fact was during a panel discussion. </p>
    

<p>“An online social network such as Facebook cannot use all of the personal data obtained for the purposes of targeted advertising, without restriction as to time and without distinction as to type of data,” the court said in a press release summarizing its decision. </p>



<p>Even though Schrems revealed he was gay in the panel discussion, that “does not authorise the operator of an online social network platform to process other data relating to his sexual orientation, obtained, as the case may be, outside that platform, with a view to aggregating and analysing those data, in order to offer him personalised advertising.” </p>
    
<p>Meta said it was awaiting publication of the court’s full judgment and that it “takes privacy very seriously.”</p><p>“Everyone using Facebook has access to a wide range of settings and tools that allow people to manage how we use their information,” the company said in a statement. </p>
    

<p>Schrems’ lawyer, Katharina Raabe-Stuppnig, lawyer representing Mr Schrems, welcomed the court’s decision. </p><p>“Meta has basically been building a huge data pool on users for 20 years now, and it is growing every day. However, EU law requires ‘data minimisation’,” she said in a statement. “Following this ruling only a small part of Meta’s data pool will be allowed to be used for advertising — even when users consent to ads.” </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<p>They were made by mostly avoiding 'computing' concepts altogether, and treating it more like a mechanical thing.</p>
<p>For example with Pong a major component is usually timers - every xth of a second the timer will emit a signal. You have timers calibrated to match the horizontal refresh of the screen, so they'll 'ring' at the same point on each scanline. Then you have timers calibrated to the vertical refresh, so they'll ring on the same scanline each frame.</p>
<p>The ball is then just two discrete timers for vertical and horizontal position, and their rings are sent through an AND gate that will raise the voltage going to the display when both are ringing causing a white dot to appear. The paddles build on this concept with a medium length timer that can be started and stopped to define the length.</p>
<p>To move the ball or paddles the timers can be advanced or delayed by a control signal. Or more accurately the timers are always paused at a certain point, like during half of the horizontal blanking period. This pausing is then shortened once to advance the timer (move left/up) or increased once to delay it (move right/down).</p>
<p>Since both the paddle and the ball timers are emitting a '1' when they are to be displayed you can impliment collision detection by performing another AND operation. So if both a paddle and the ball are being drawn at the same moment you know they've collided and can adjust a latch controlling the ball direction accordingly.</p>
<p>If you get into the Atari 2600 you'll find that it's really weird compared to other consoles (sprites with no clearly defined X coordinate, instead only the ability to place it at the actual current location of the CRT beam or nudge it a small amount either way), but that it starts to make a lot of sense when you realize they were implementing their Pong logic for a programmable chip.</p>

            <guid>41744434</guid>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy-11/">https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy-11/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41744434">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <p>We are excited to announce the release of mitmproxy 11, which introduces full support for HTTP/3 in both transparent
and reverse proxy modes. We’re also bringing in a ton of DNS improvements that we’ll cover in this blog post.</p>
<h5 id="editorial-note"><em>Editorial Note:</em></h5>
<p><em>Hi! I’m <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/authors/gaurav-jain/">Gaurav Jain</a>, one of the students selected for this year’s Google Summer of Code program to work on mitmproxy.
During this summer, I’ve worked on improving various low-level networking parts of mitmproxy some of which include
HTTP/3 and DNS. You can find my project report <a href="https://gist.github.com/errorxyz/af6f26549e9122f3ff3b93fd9d257df1">here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="http3">HTTP/3</h2>
<p>HTTP/3 now “just works” for reverse proxies. Your mitmproxy instance will listen for
both TCP and UDP packets and handle all HTTP versions thrown at it:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ mitmproxy --mode reverse:https://http3.is
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Our transparent proxy modes now all support HTTP/3 as well:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ mitmproxy --mode wireguard
</span></span><span><span>$ mitmproxy --mode local
</span></span><span><span>$ mitmproxy --mode transparent
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We have successfully tested HTTP/3 support with Firefox, Chrome, various cURL builds, and other clients to iron out
compatibility issues.
The only major limitation we are aware of at this time is that Chrome <a href="https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40138351#comment15">does not trust user-added Certificate Authorities for QUIC</a>.
This means you will either need to provide a publicly trusted certificate (e.g. from Let’s Encrypt), start Chrome with
a <a href="https://www.chromium.org/quic/playing-with-quic/#generate-certificates">command line switch</a>, or accept that it falls back to HTTP/2. Alternatively, Firefox doesn’t do such shenanigans.
For more HTTP/3 troubleshooting tips, you can check out <a href="https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/issues/7025#issuecomment-2351138170">#7025</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing HTTP/3 support to mitmproxy is a major effort that was started in 2022 by <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/authors/manuel-meitinger/">Manuel Meitinger</a> and <a href="https://mitmproxy.org/authors/maximilian-hils/">Maximilian Hils</a>.
QUIC and HTTP/3 make up an increasing share of network traffic in the wild, and we’re super excited to have this ready
and enabled by default now!</p>
<h2 id="improved-dns-support">Improved DNS Support</h2>
<p>With the advent of DNS <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/speeding-up-https-and-http-3-negotiation-with-dns/">HTTPS records</a> and new privacy enhancements such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Encrypted_Client_Hello">Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</a>, mitmproxy’s DNS
functionality is becoming increasingly important. We’re happy to share multiple advancements on this front:</p>
<h4 id="support-for-query-types-beyond-aaaaa">Support for Query Types Beyond A/AAAA</h4>
<p>mitmproxy’s old DNS implementation used <code>getaddrinfo</code> to resolve queries. This is convenient because everything is taken
care of by libc, but the <code>getaddrinfo</code> API only supports A/AAAA queries for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. It doesn’t allow us
to answer queries for e.g. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/speeding-up-https-and-http-3-negotiation-with-dns/">HTTPS records</a>, which are used to signal HTTP/3 support.</p>
<p>To overcome this limitation, we’ve reimplemented our DNS support on top of <a href="https://github.com/hickory-dns/hickory-dns">Hickory&nbsp;DNS</a>, a Rust-based DNS library.
Using Hickory, we now obtain the operating system’s default nameservers on Windows, Linux, and macOS and forward
non-A/AAAA queries there. This behavior can also be customized with the new <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-options/#dns_name_servers"><code>dns_name_servers</code> option</a>:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ mitmdump --mode dns --set dns_name_servers<span>=</span>8.8.8.8
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><img src="https://mitmproxy.org/posts/releases/mitmproxy-11/dns.png" alt="dns"></p>
<h4 id="skipping-etchosts">Skipping /etc/hosts</h4>
<p>By switching to Hickory, we now also have the option to ignore the system’s hosts
file (<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Linux) with the new <a href="https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-options/#dns_use_hosts_file"><code>dns_use_hosts_file</code> option</a>. We plan to move mitmproxy’s internal
DNS resolution to Hickory as well, at which point this feature will become incredibly useful in allowing transparent
redirection on the same machine for specific domains. At the moment, such a setup would cause mitmproxy to recursively
connect to itself because we always take the hosts file into account.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="shell"><span><span>$ echo <span>"192.0.2.1 mitmproxy.org"</span> &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>$ mitmdump --mode dns
</span></span><span><span>$ dig @127.0.0.1 +short mitmproxy.org
</span></span><span><span>192.0.2.1
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>$ mitmdump --mode dns --set dns_use_hosts_file<span>=</span>false
</span></span><span><span>$ dig @127.0.0.1 +short mitmproxy.org
</span></span><span><span>3.161.82.13
</span></span></code></pre></div><h4 id="support-for-dns-over-tcp">Support for DNS-over-TCP</h4>
<p>DNS uses UDP by default, but may also use TCP to support records that do not fit into a single UDP packet. mitmproxy has
previously gotten away with only supporting UDP, but now that we support arbitrary query types, message size and thus
TCP support is more important. Long story short, DNS-over-TCP works with mitmproxy 11!</p>
<h4 id="stripping-encrypted-client-hello-ech-keys">Stripping Encrypted Client Hello (ECH) Keys</h4>
<p>Unless a custom certificate is configured, mitmproxy uses the Server Name Indication (SNI) transmitted in the TLS
ClientHello to construct a valid certificate. Conversely, if no SNI is present, we may not be able
to generate a certificate that is trusted by the client.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Encrypted_Client_Hello">Encrypted Client Hello (ECH)</a> is an exciting new technology to increase privacy on the web. In short, the client uses
the new DNS HTTPS records to obtain an ECH key before establishing a connection, and then already encrypts the initial
ClientHello handshake message with that key. If both DNS queries and handshake are encrypted, passive intermediaries
cannot learn the target domain, only the target IP address (which is not conclusive for shared hosting and Content Delivery
Networks). This is a great advancement for privacy, but also breaks mitmproxy’s way of generating certificates.
To fix this, mitmproxy now strips ECH keys from HTTPS records. This way the client has no keys to encrypt the initial
handshake message with, and mitmproxy still learns the target domain and can construct a matching certificate.</p>
<p>Of course, ECH adds complexity for us and sometimes makes mitmproxy harder to use for our users. Nonetheless, we are
excited to see these privacy advancements being made for the rest of the web!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">ffmpeg over IP</h2><a id="user-content-ffmpeg-over-ip" aria-label="Permalink: ffmpeg over IP" href="#ffmpeg-over-ip"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Connect to remote ffmpeg servers. Are you tired of unsuccessfully trying to pass your GPU through to a docker
container running in a VM? So was I! <code>ffmpeg-over-ip</code> allows you to run an ffmpeg server on a machine with access
to a GPU (Linux, Windows, or Mac) and connect to it from a remote machine. The only thing you need is Node.js
installed and a shared filesystem (could be NFS, SMB, etc.) between the two machines.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><code>ffmpeg-over-ip</code> consists of two main parts, the server and the client. Both are packed neatly into single JS
files. You can download these from the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffmpeg-over-ip?activeTab=code" rel="nofollow">npm interface</a> or by <code>npm install ffmpeg-over-ip</code> and then copying
them to the relevant places. You don't need any <code>node_modules</code> to run the server or the client.</p>
<p dir="auto">The javascript files require Node.js runtime to work. If you want standalone files that you can mount in a docker
container, you can find these in the <a href="https://github.com/steelbrain/ffmpeg-over-ip/releases">Github Releases</a>. On the releases page, you may have to click <strong>"Show all
assets"</strong> to see the files.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Configuration</h2><a id="user-content-configuration" aria-label="Permalink: Configuration" href="#configuration"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The server and the client are both configured using JSONC (JSON with comments) configuration files. The paths
of these files can be flexible. To identify which paths are being used, you can invoke either with <code>--debug-print-search-paths</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Template/example configuration files are provided in this repository for your convinience. Unless the server and the client
share the same filesystem, you may have to specify <code>rewrites</code> in the server configuration file.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Usage</h2><a id="user-content-usage" aria-label="Permalink: Usage" href="#usage"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Both the server and the client files are executable, so long as there is a Node.js installation available. If you intend
to use this in a docker container, you can directly mount the client file to where the container would expect a regular
ffmpeg executable to be, ie <code>docker run -v ./path/to/client-bin:/usr/lib/jellyfin-ffmpeg/ffmpeg ...</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The server and the client communicate commands over HTTP, so make sure that whatever port you specify on the server is
allowed through the firewall.</p>
<p dir="auto">Assuming you <strong>download one of the release files</strong>, here's what the usage would look like</p>
<p dir="auto">On the client side</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ./ffmpeg-over-ip-client --debug-print-search-paths # See the places where it'll look for config

Looking for the JS/TS library? Check out <a href="https://github.com/livekit/agents-js">AgentsJS</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">✨ [NEW] OpenAI Realtime API support</h2><a id="user-content--new-openai-realtime-api-support" aria-label="Permalink: ✨ [NEW] OpenAI Realtime API support" href="#-new-openai-realtime-api-support"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">We're partnering with OpenAI on a new <code>MultimodalAgent</code> API in the Agents framework. This class completely wraps OpenAI’s Realtime API, abstract away the raw wire protocol, and provide an ultra-low latency WebRTC transport between GPT-4o and your users’ devices. This same stack powers Advanced Voice in the ChatGPT app.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Try the Realtime API in our <a href="https://playground.livekit.io/" rel="nofollow">playground</a> [<a href="https://github.com/livekit-examples/realtime-playground">code</a>]</li>
<li>Check out our <a href="https://docs.livekit.io/agents/openai" rel="nofollow">guide</a> to building your first app with this new API</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">What is Agents?</h2><a id="user-content-what-is-agents" aria-label="Permalink: What is Agents?" href="#what-is-agents"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The Agents framework allows you to build AI-driven server programs that can see, hear, and speak in realtime. Your agent connects with end user devices through a LiveKit session. During that session, your agent can process text, audio, images, or video streaming from a user's device, and have an AI model generate any combination of those same modalities as output, and stream them back to the user.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Plugins for popular LLMs, transcription and text-to-speech services, and RAG databases</li>
<li>High-level abstractions for building voice agents or assistants with automatic turn detection, interruption handling, function calling, and transcriptions</li>
<li>Compatible with LiveKit's <a href="https://github.com/livekit/sip">telephony stack</a>, allowing your agent to make calls to or receive calls from phones</li>
<li>Integrated load balancing system that manages pools of agents with edge-based dispatch, monitoring, and transparent failover</li>
<li>Running your agents is identical across localhost, <a href="https://github.com/livekit/livekit">self-hosted</a>, and <a href="https://cloud.livekit.io/" rel="nofollow">LiveKit Cloud</a> environments</li>
</ul>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Installation</h2><a id="user-content-installation" aria-label="Permalink: Installation" href="#installation"></a></p>
