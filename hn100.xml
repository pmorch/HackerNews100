<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <h3 id="zero-asic-releases-wildebeest-the-worlds-highest-performance-fpga-synthesis-tool">Zero ASIC releases Wildebeest, the world’s highest performance FPGA synthesis tool.</h3>
<p>Cambridge, MA – September 17, 2025 – Zero ASIC, a U.S. semiconductor startup on a mission to democratize silicon, today announced the release of Wildebeest<sup>TM</sup>, the world’s highest performance FPGA synthesis tool.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>The software world has largely moved away from proprietary, vendor-locked compilers in favor of open source alternatives such as LLVM<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-1" id="user-content-fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and GCC. Early on, these open source compilers lagged behind in performance, but over time, through the collective effort of the community, they caught up and even surpassed their proprietary counterparts.</p>
<p>In hardware, a similar transformation has been unfolding. Thanks to the pioneering work of Alan Mishchenko (ABC<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-2" id="user-content-fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>), Claire Xenia Wolf (Yosys<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-3" id="user-content-fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup>), and the broader open source EDA community, FPGA developers have had access to a full-featured Verilog RTL synthesis toolchain for years. Recently, SystemVerilog support has since been added through Mike Popoloski’s excellent Slang parser<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-4" id="user-content-fnref-4" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup>. Thanks to strong community involvement, the Yosys project now supports FPGA synthesis for a number of commercial and academic FPGA architectures.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, funding for open source FPGA synthesis has been minimal, and as a result a large QoR gap between open source and proprietary synthesis remains. Industrial users, who care obsessively about performance, have thus been stuck between a rock and a hard place: “Freedom or Performance”.</p>













































<table><thead><tr><th>Attribute</th><th>Vendor Tool</th><th>Yosys</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>FPGA Support</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Lock-in</td><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Open Source</td><td>No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Free</td><td>Yes/No</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Binary Size</td><td>Large</td><td>Small</td></tr><tr><td>QoR</td><td>Great</td><td>Good</td></tr><tr><td>Robustness</td><td>Great</td><td>Good</td></tr></tbody></table>
<h3 id="wildebeest-intro">Wildebeest Intro</h3>
<p>Wildebeest introduces a number of critical optimization techniques to open source. Some of these techniques are standard practice in commercial compilers, but this is the first time they have been demonstrated in an open source FPGA synthesis tool.</p>
<p>The most important Wildebeest strategy is the use of circuit size as a primary feature for selecting the synthesis algorithms. Existing single script solutions don’t work well because they either fail to converge for large circuits or sacrifice performance for robustness. Using a carefully selected set of size appropriate optimization scripts, Wildebeest achieves robustness and high performance for a wide range of benchmark (up to 1M LUT designs).</p>
<p>Another important aspect of the Wildebeest approach is the effective use of the most advanced <code>abc9</code> commands for speculative synthesis and logic depth minimization. ABC is an incredibly powerful logic synthesis library, but making effective use of all commands is a non-trivial task that requires deep expertise in logic synthesis, the ABC architecture, and Yosys, and software development.</p>
<p>Logic optimization is only as good as the benchmark data that grounds the algorithms used. Wildebeest adopted an industrial approach to development from day one, developing an internal suite of 150+ carefully selected benchmarks and automated profiling utilities. The open source <a href="https://github.com/zeroasiccorp/logikbench">LogikBench</a> benchmarks suite was created to enable independent evaluation and benchmarking.</p>
<p>Logic synthesis has been around for over 50 years. During this time, basic synthesis algorithms and approaches have been openly published by the synthesis R&amp;D community, but many of the “outer loop” tricks of the trade have been kept hidden by practitioners within proprietary tools. The lead Wildebeest developer, Dr. Thierry Besson is an industry insider with 30 years of experience in developing state of the art commercial logic synthesis solutions. Dr. Besson has previously contributed the fastest/smallest results on a number of the EPFL logic synthesis benchmarks and with Wildebeest he is releasing many of these techniques into the wild.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-5" id="user-content-fnref-5" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">5</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="benchmark-results">Benchmark Results</h3>
<p>The table below shows how Wildebeest compares against both open-source and proprietary synthesis tools for the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zeroasiccorp/logikbench/refs/heads/main/logikbench/blocks/picorv32/rtl/picorv32.v">picorv32 CPU design</a>.

<p>The results show that Wildebeest QoR exceeds both proprietary and open source FPGA synthesis solutions.</p>
<h3 id="future-work">Future Work</h3>
<p>This initial Wildebeest release is only the beginning of the journey. The development team has a pipeline of optimization techniques in development with QoR that is expected to exceed current proprietary tools by a wide margin.</p>
<p>The long term goal of the Wildebeest project is to help bring forth an era of “LLVM for synthesis” by working with the community to develop high performance open source FPGA tools, robust standard IRs and file formats, and broad hardware vendor adoption.</p>

    <p>For the past 15 years<sup id="fnref:fifteen" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:fifteen" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, F-Droid has provided a safe and secure
haven for Android users around the world to find and install free and open
source apps. When contrasted with the commercial app stores — of which the
Google Play store is the most prominent — the differences are stark: they
are hotbeds of spyware and scams, blatantly promoting apps that prey on
their users through attempts to monetize their attention and mine their
intimate information through any means necessary, including trickery and
dark patterns.[^spyware1]</p>

<p>F-Droid is different. It distributes apps that have been validated to work
<em>for</em> the user’s interests, rather than for the interests of the app’s
distributors. The way F-Droid works is simple: when a developer creates an
app and hosts the source code publicly somewhere, the F-Droid team reviews
it, inspecting it to ensure that it is completely open source and contains
no undocumented <em>anti-features</em> such as advertisements or
trackers<sup id="fnref:antifeatures" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:antifeatures" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. Once it passes inspection, the F-Droid build
service compiles and packages the app to make it ready for distribution. The
package is then signed either with F-Droid’s cryptographic key, or, if the
build is reproducible[^reproducible], enables distribution using the
original developer’s private key. In this way, users can trust that any app
distributed through F-Droid is the one that was built from the specified
source code and has not been tampered with.</p>

<h3 id="googles-move-to-break-free-app-distribution">Google’s move to break free app distribution</h3>

<p>The future of this elegant and proven system was put in jeopardy last month,
when Google unilaterally decreed<sup id="fnref:regann" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:regann" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> that Android developers everywhere
in the world are going to be required to register centrally with Google. In
addition to demanding payment of a registration fee and agreement to their
(non-negotiable and ever-changing) terms and conditions, Google will also
require the uploading of personally identifying documents[^regid], including
government ID, by the authors of the software, as well as enumerating all
the unique “application identifiers” for every app that is to be distributed
by the registered developer.[^regappid]</p>

<p>require all apps to be registered by verified developers in order to be
installed by users on certified Android devices.”
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html</a>
[^regid]: Android developer verification: “You will need to provide and
verify your personal details, like your legal name, address, email address,
and phone number. You may also need to upload official government ID.”:
<a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#verify-your-identity">https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#verify-your-identity</a>
[^regappid]: Android developer verification: “You’ll need to prove you own
your apps by providing your app package name and app signing keys.”:
<a href="https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps">https://developer.android.com/developer-verification#register-your-apps</a></p>

<p>The F-Droid project cannot require that developers register their apps
through Google, but at the same time, we cannot “take over” the application
identifiers for the open-source apps we distribute, as that would
effectively seize exclusive distribution rights to those applications.</p>

<p>If it were to be put into effect, the developer registration decree will end
the F-Droid project and other free/open-source app distribution sources as
we know them today, and the world will be deprived of the safety and
security of the catalog of thousands of apps that can be trusted and
verified by any and all. F-Droid’s myriad users<sup id="fnref:howmanyusers" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:howmanyusers" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> will be left
adrift, with no means to install — or even update their existing installed —
applications.</p>

<p>because we don’t track users or have any registration. “No user accounts, by
design”:
<a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html">https://f-droid.org/2022/02/28/no-user-accounts-by-design.html</a></p>

<h3 id="the-security-canard">The Security Canard</h3>

<p>While directly installing — or “sideloading”<sup id="fnref:sideloading" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sideloading" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> — software can be
construed as carrying some inherent risk, it is false to claim that
centralized app stores are the only safe option for software
distribution. Google Play itself has repeatedly hosted
malware[^playmal1][^playmal2], proving that corporate gatekeeping doesn’t
guarantee user protection. By contrast, F-Droid offers a trustworthy and
transparent alternative approach to security: every app is free and open
source, the code can be audited by anyone, the build process and logs are
public, and reproducible builds ensure that what is published matches the
source code exactly. This transparency and accountability provides a
<em>stronger</em> basis for trust than closed platforms, while still giving users
freedom to choose. Restricting direct app installation not only undermines
that choice, it also erodes the diversity and resilience of the open-source
ecosystem by consolidating control in the hands of a few corporate players.</p>

<p>came up with; it means “installing software without our permission,” which
we used to just call “installing software” (because you don’t need a
manufacturer’s permission to install software on your computer).’ —

<p>Furthermore, Google’s framing that they need to mandate developer
registration in order to defend against malware is disingenuous because they
<em>already</em> have a remediation mechanism for malware they identify on a
device: the Play Protect service<sup id="fnref:playprotect" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:playprotect" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> that is enabled on all
Android Certified devices already scans and disables apps that have been
identified as malware, regardless of their provenience. Any perceived risks
associated with direct app installation can be mitigated through user
education, open-source transparency, and existing security measures without
imposing exclusionary registration requirements.</p>

<p>harmful behavior”:
<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853">https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2812853</a></p>

<p>We do not believe that developer registration is motivated by security. We
believe it is about consolidating power and tightening control over a
formerly open ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="the-right-to-run">The Right to Run</h3>

<p>If you own a computer, you should have the right to run whatever programs
you want on it. This is just as true with the apps on your Android/iPhone
mobile device as it is with the applications on your Linux/Mac/Windows
desktop or server. Forcing software creators into a centralized registration
scheme in order to publish and distribute their works is as egregious as
forcing writers and artists to register with a central authority in order to
be able to distribute their creative works. It is an offense to the core
principles of free speech and thought that are central to the workings of
democratic societies around the world.</p>

<p>By tying application identifiers to personal ID checks and fees, Google is
building a choke point that restricts competition and limits user
freedom. It must find a solution which preserves user rights, freedom of
choice, and a healthy, competitive ecosystem.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-propose">What do we propose?</h3>

<p>Regulatory and competition authorities should look carefully at Google’s
proposed activities, and ensure that policies designed to improve security
are not abused to consolidate monopoly control. We urge regulators to
safeguard the ability of alternative app stores and open-source projects to
operate freely, and to protect developers who cannot or will not comply with
exclusionary registration schemes and demands for personal information.</p>

<p>If you are a developer or user who values digital freedom, you can
help. Write to your Member of Parliament<sup id="fnref:mp" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:mp" rel="footnote">8</a></sup>,
Congressperson[^congressperson] or other representative, sign petitions in
defense of sideloading, and contact the European Commission’s Digital
Markets Act (DMA) team<sup id="fnref:dmacontact" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:dmacontact" rel="footnote">9</a></sup> to express why preserving open
distribution matters. By making your voice heard, you help defend not only
F-Droid, but the principle that software should remain a commons, accessible
and free from unnecessary corporate gatekeeping.</p>

<p>When I finished school in 2010 (yep, along time ago now), I wanted to go try and make it as a musician. I figured if punk bands could just learn on the job, I could too. But my mum insisted that I needed to do something, just in case. So I went down to the local TAFE (this is like a trade school in Australia, though it has pathways into uni, it’s pretty neat!) and signed up for whatever looked good. I had always loved computers and gaming, I did all the courses for computing short of programming in school (the school didn’t offer it), and had an interest so I signed up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t love at first sight, as I still remember after a week freaking out in my room that I couldn’t do this. But I sat down with my massive VB.NET textbook we had to buy and pushed through it. And once I made it through, it clicked. I fell in love with programming after that, and it became something I was both good at and started growing a passion for.</p>
<p>From there, going through my games diploma, and my bachelors in games design and development (think a comp sci degree with game design elements, it’s pretty neat and I’m happy to answer questions about it), I wrote a lot of stupid code. Like a lot of it. In my courses, in my game jams (god good times), in my spare time when I was learning things both in uni and early in my career. It helped me refine my skills, but also learn a lot.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. I’ve been doing a dive on JavaScript/TypeScript and different runtimes like NodeJS and Deno, amongst a bunch of other stuff. At first, I was looking into a deep dive into node with <a href="https://youtu.be/rUFUTdQALrk?si=wSZcxvzoO3eA1_fj">this talk by James Snell</a> and wanted to try out the Streams API. Part of me wanted to start writing straight away, but held back because I didn’t think I had anything to use it on. After being unable to resist the urge to write some code after a few minutes, I just made the dumbest stock ticker I could so I could try streams out in an arbitrary way. But it left me thinking, “why didn’t I hold back”.</p>
<p>As I’m writing this now, I came up with the answer. As I was writing a little <a href="https://github.com/SpikePuppet/daily-inspo">app to output inspirational quotes</a>, I started umm’ing and ahh’ing over if I should make this. It’s small, it’s dumb, and there were probably plenty of options out there. But I wanted to write some code, and was interested in trying out Deno and seeing how it compiles binaries. So I did it. And I was happy (I’m very excited to use it), and I realised that I was scared to write something dumb. All my years of doing this helped refine my own abilities, but also made me much more harsh on myself. Harsh on my own code, harsh on just trying things.</p>
<p>After coming to this realisation, I’ve decided I’m going to give myself more grace when it comes to writing software for myself, and I encourage you all dear readers to do the same if you’ve been feeling this. There is no stupid code. There’s only code. Enjoy writing it, it doesn’t have to be nice or pretty if it’s for you. Have fun, try out that new runtime or language. Poke around and see what breaks. Keep that learning mindset, and keep feeding your curiosity. It’ll help you continue to grow across your career, and if you enjoy this kind of thing as a hobby like me, it’ll keep stoking your own enjoyment and passion.</p>   </article> </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If this post is appearing, it means I’ve succumbed to cancer or one of its side effects. Please don’t feel sad for me. I’ve had a life filled with love, great experiences and wonderful career opportunities. Despite my demise at a relatively young age, I consider myself beyond fortunate.</p><p>I’m hoping that, under the tree in front of our little Philadelphia rowhome, my wife Elaine will place a stone tablet inscribed with my name, and the year I was born and died. Underneath, I’d like the tablet to read:</p><p>Family • Readers • Words</p><p>(Note to Elaine: If you ever move, feel free to take the tablet with you.)</p><p>Family is everybody who’s brought love into my life: Elaine, my two children, my larger family, my close friends. Meanwhile, readers have been those I’ve served, and who rewarded that service with so much loyalty and affection. Finally, words have been my playground, taking the insights I’ve garnered and trying to make them understandable to others. Beside the tree are two metal chairs. I hope family and passersby will occasionally stop by, and fill me in on what I’ve been missing.</p><p>I’ve asked Elaine to arrange a memorial service at <a href="https://www.stpetersphila.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">St Peter’s Church</a> in Philadelphia’s Old City. She’ll post the time and date to the Forum when the details have been worked out.</p><p>Regular readers will know much of my life’s story. But I figure it’s appropriate to offer a not-so-brief recap.</p><p>I was born at 14 St Margarets Drive in Twickenham, London, on Jan. 2, 1963. At that time in the UK, it was standard practice for mothers to give birth in the hospital if it was their first child—or, in my mother’s case, her first two children. My older brothers, who are identical twins, had been born two years earlier. Because that first delivery went smoothly, my birth would be at home. From what I gather, the midwife took cigarette and scotch breaks with my father during lulls in the action. I was born at 6 a.m., thus establishing a lifetime habit of starting early.</p><p>In 1966, my father left financial journalism for a job at the World Bank, and we moved from London to Washington, DC. Two years later, my younger sister was born. In late 1972, my father was posted to the World Bank’s Bangladesh office for four years, and I was dispatched to boarding school in England, joining my two brothers.</p><p>After the comforts of a U.S. suburban childhood, it was a <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2023/03/the-other-enough/">brutal</a> change—cold dormitories, disgusting food, endless bullying—and I carried the scars for the rest of my life. But there was a silver lining: After nine years of boarding school, I squeaked into Cambridge University, where I spent much of my three years writing for and editing the student newspaper.</p><p>When I graduated Cambridge in 1985, the UK economy was in rough shape and landing a job was difficult. I ended up working for <em>Euromoney</em> magazine in London. Initially, all went well. But then there was a change in editor and, for reasons I never understood, the new editor took an instant dislike to me and made it clear he wanted me gone. But by then, I’d already decided to leave London and return to the U.S.</p><p>My then-fiancee and I flew to New York in August 1986. After a desperate scramble, I landed a job as a reporter—read “fact checker”—at <em>Forbes</em> magazine. The pay was miserable, but I couldn’t have been more grateful for that first paycheck. By then, all I had to my name was credit card debt.</p><p>Molly and I were married the following June, and Hannah arrived 15 months later. Her younger brother, Henry, would follow in 1992.</p><p>After 23 months as a fact checker, I was promoted to staff writer at <em>Forbes</em>, covering mutual funds. <em>The Wall Street Journal,</em> which was also in need of a funds reporter, came calling 16 months later. I’d always thought I’d never be a real journalist until I worked for a daily newspaper, and yet initially I said no.</p><p>At the time, I was in the midst of six months as a single parent, looking after Hannah on my own while Molly was in Syria, Greece and Turkey conducting research for her PhD. Still,&nbsp;the <em>Journal</em> wasn’t deterred, saying it would make allowances during my initial months.</p><p>In the early 1990s, the <em>Journal </em>was very different from the newspaper it is today. No photos, just the dot drawings for which the paper was renowned. While strong opinions could be found on the editorial page, they were to be avoided in the news pages. The sort of advice journalism I favored was frowned upon by some among the paper’s senior ranks.</p><p>Still, in 1994, Managing Editor Paul Steiger said he’d consider a few columnists for the <em>Journal’s</em> news pages. At age 31, and with some trepidation, I put up my hand. Thus was born the <em>Getting Going</em> column, which I wrote for the next 13-plus years, penning 1,009 columns for both <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> and <em>Wall Street Journal Sunday</em>. The latter were branded pages that appeared in some 70 newspapers around the country.</p><p>In retrospect, it’s astonishing that I was given my own column at such a young age. It took me a few months to hit my stride, but I was soon pounding away at the virtues of index funds, while also exploring new topics, often scouring academic research for insights I could share with readers.</p><p>The decade and a half that followed are something of a blur. I was cranking out columns, commuting into New York City from the New Jersey suburbs, and raising two children. In my memory, the years have the monotony of a hamster wheel. But that wasn’t the reality: There were high points and low points, plus the joy of watching Hannah and Henry grow up. The low points included&nbsp;the World Trade Center <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2021/09/twenty-years-ago/">attack</a>, my father’s <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/08/on-the-clock/">death</a> and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB945822461920337432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">libel suit</a>&nbsp;brought against the <em>Journal</em>. I’d been involved in editing the story that triggered the lawsuit.</p><p>In early 1995, while in Pittsburgh, I went on a nine-mile run with my brother-in-law, who was training for the city’s marathon. I’d long viewed running those 26.2 miles as a heroic endeavor. I committed to returning for the next year’s marathon. But I didn’t simply want to complete the distance. Instead, I set a goal of finishing in under three hours. I managed it, though barely, crossing the finish line <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB833401105627639500" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24 seconds</a> under the three-hour mark.</p><p>I ran countless road races over the next dozen years. I had my greatest success with half-marathons, finishing third in the four races I ran on land—and first in the 2001 half-marathon held on the deck of a boat floating off <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB984088892480498588" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Antarctica</a>. In shorter races, from one mile to 10, I also managed perhaps a dozen first-place finishes. What about the tearful, wimpy English schoolboy who had previously shunned athletic endeavors? Over countless miles, I managed to leave him behind.</p><p>Career and athletic success were not, alas, rivaled by relationship success. Molly announced she wanted a divorce in 1998. It would be the first of two failed marriages—not an achievement I’m proud of. But the third time was a charm. In the midst of the pandemic, Elaine and I met in August 2020, the month my second marriage officially ended. We were living together by the end of the month and married almost four years later, in May 2024, five days after my cancer diagnosis. I met Elaine during one of my life’s roughest periods, and was so lucky to have done so. Elaine, I fear, was not so fortunate, for now she must navigate the world on her own.</p><p>By 2006 or so, I’d started to tire of the <em>Getting Going</em> column, and began casting around for what to do next. I had a few conversations with potential employers, but those came to naught. Then, one day in early 2008, my phone rang. It was Andy Seig from Citigroup. He was heading up a startup within Citi known as myFi, which was aiming to deliver advice on a client’s entire financial life in return for a flat monthly fee. It was, I imagined, the exit from the <em>Journal</em> I was looking for.</p><p>I joined myFi that spring, and it soon became apparent that launching a startup in the middle of a huge corporate bureaucracy was a foolhardy endeavor. Layered on top of that was the financial crisis that unfolded through the year. By mid-2009, myFi was dead, and we employees spent a long, aimless summer trying to figure out what was next.</p><p>Next turned out to be a new wealth management operation cobbled together by combining myFi’s remaining employees, who had been hired to launch an innovative new financial service, and the old school brokers who sat in Citi’s bank branches. It wasn’t exactly a match made in heaven.</p><p>I toughed it out at Citi until spring 2014. Money was undoubtedly part of the reason. I was making more than $300,000 a year, a gaudy sum for a onetime ink-stained wretch. And the job wasn’t without interest. As director of financial education for the U.S. wealth management business, I gave more than 30 speeches in some years—forcing me to overcome my fear of public speaking—and I was dealing with financial topics I’d rarely written about as a journalist, while also learning about the investment business from the inside. Still, I was also frustrated by the nit-picky oversight of lawyers and compliance officers, and vowed to leave.</p><p>For a year, I planned my departure, getting my finances in order and setting in motion some work projects for my life after Citi. I waited until I got my final year-end bonus in early 2014, and then handed in my notice.</p><p>What followed was a period I came to call my <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2018/01/second-childhood/">second childhood</a>. Initially, that meant a 15-month return to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> as a freelance columnist—I left when my editor got ousted during a round of layoffs in 2015—and also working on two annual editions of the <em>Jonathan Clements Money Guide</em>. That <a href="https://humbledollar.com/money-guide/main-menu/">guide</a> eventually became the core of <em>HumbleDollar</em>, which I launched on Dec. 31, 2016.</p><p>The two printed editions of the money guide were among the nine <a href="https://humbledollar.com/books/">books</a> I wrote over my career—eight personal finance books and a novel. I also edited two books, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/My-Money-Journey-financial-freedom/dp/0857199862/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>My Money Journey</em></a>, a compilation of 30 essays by <em>HumbleDollar</em> writers, and contributed essays to &nbsp;a fistful of other tomes, including penning the foreword to two Bill Bernstein books. None of the books I authored was a huge success. But my favorite, and the one with the best sales, was my 2016 book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1523770813" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>How to Think About Money</em></a>.</p><p>In 2016, I was also contacted by Peter Mallouk, president of fast-growing Creative Planning, a registered investment advisor that favored index funds and sought to help clients with their entire financial life. As at Citi, I was again given the title of director of financial education, though I remained an independent contractor and worked limited hours for Creative. Still, for me, it proved to be one of my career’s most enjoyable professional relationships. Peter was great to work with, and together we hosted a monthly podcast that ran for the rest of my life.</p><p>By May 2024, I’d been living in Philadelphia for more than three years, I was engaged to Elaine and living just an eight-minute walk from my daughter, son-in-law and two grandsons. The youngest was born that month. Elaine and I were talking about retirement, trying to figure out how we could travel more and have more time for each other, even as I kept <em>HumbleDollar</em> humming along.</p><p>And then I got my cancer <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/06/the-c-word/">diagnosis</a>.</p><p>The period immediately after was astonishingly <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/07/no-slowing-down/">busy</a>, as I tried to get my affairs in order and prep <em>HumbleDollar</em> for a life without me, even as my diagnosis triggered a surprising amount of media attention. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/13/your-money/jonathan-clements-cancer.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The New York Times</em></a> wrote about my illness, I was interviewed for Consuelo Mack’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9op9EXJ493s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>WealthTrack</em></a>, and I was asked to pen articles for <a href="https://archive.ph/ZeWeF" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/health/other/i-m-61-and-i-ve-got-a-year-left-to-live-but-i-still-plan-to-work-every-day/ar-AA1rakRY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Telegraph</em></a> of London, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/personal-finance/jonathan-clements-personal-finance-cancer-e30d1396?st=ZHog6a&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> and <a href="https://www.aarp.org/benefits-discounts/members-only-access/info-2025/cancer-changed-retirement-plan.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AARP</a> magazine. Who knew that candor about one’s own death would generate so much interest? It was an odd bookend to a life spent partly in the public eye—one that had previously been most notable for pounding the table for index funds.</p><p>I faced the final months not with sorrow, but with great <a href="https://humbledollar.com/2024/09/no-regrets/">gratitude</a>. I had spent almost my entire adult life doing what I love and surrounded by those that I love. Who could ask for more?</p></div><p>Did you just log in?

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Random guitar pedal board design</h2><a id="user-content-random-guitar-pedal-board-design" aria-label="Permalink: Random guitar pedal board design" href="#random-guitar-pedal-board-design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Background</h3><a id="user-content-background" aria-label="Permalink: Background" href="#background"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is a personal toy project that has gone through several phases, but
the common theme has been that it makes absolutely no sense outside of
the very specific niche of "Linus is trying to learn random things about
electronics".</p>
<p dir="auto">So keep that in mind: there is very little point to any of this to
anybody else.  Don't expect some great useful guitar pedal experience.</p>
<p dir="auto">I call it my "LEGO for adults" hobby, because this got started when I
wanted to extend my traditional after-Christmas activity (which was
receiving and building <em>actual</em> LEGO kits, which has been a thing for me
since I was a wee tyke) with something else.</p>
<p dir="auto">So for Christmas 2024, I got a new soldering iron and randomly started
doing guitar pedal kits.  And so over the next month or two, I built at
least two dozen kits, and had to literally look for victims to give them
away to because I had no use for them myself.</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">Of all the kits I built, the ones I enjoyed the most were the Aion FX
ones, and if you are looking for a kit build of traditional analog
guitar pedals, I can heartily recommend them.</p>
<p dir="auto">The documentation, the customer service, the components, and the
enclosures were all top notch. See <a href="https://aionfx.com/" rel="nofollow">"Aion FX"</a></p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">Anyway, after building a lot of these traditional analog guitar pedal
kits I decided I really wanted to actually understand what they did,
because I really had very little experience with any analog circuits.</p>
<p dir="auto">While I've done some very limited electronics most of my life, almost
all of it has been related to computers, so it's been either digital
logic or power supplies for them.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, I was looking for a different kind of soldering experience where
there was less snipping of legs of through-hole components.  I actually
like soldering SMT components, but that doesn't tend to be what those
guitar pedal kits do.</p>
<p dir="auto">I had done some very limited PCB design with kicad a few years ago, so I
decided to just start learning more about analog circuits.  And then it
kind of grew from that.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Electrical design</h3><a id="user-content-electrical-design" aria-label="Permalink: Electrical design" href="#electrical-design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">This is the "fourth generation" of my guitar pedal design journey, and
is a new repository because the goal of the learning experience has
evolved.</p>
<p dir="auto">What started out being about the analog circuits (and the power rails:
those were always a big thing) got to the point where I realized I
really want to do a mixed signal design: understanding what the circuits
do is one thing, re-creating some analog design from the 70s when you
don't actually care about the sound is another thing entirely.</p>
<p dir="auto">Also, on the actual analog signal side, I started out using op-amps, but
as I was attempting to learn how things actually worked, I had switched
over to a "discrete components only" model, and this continues that
trend (except for the whole digital side, of course).</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">To me "discrete components" does include more optimized packages:
things like dual diodes or matched transistors, but not more complex
circuits like a op-amp (or a 555 timer or D Flip-flop or other classic
logic IC)</p>
</div>
<p dir="auto">Also, because I don't typically <em>listen</em> to the end result, but look at
it with a signal generator and an oscilloscope, I've grown to detest
power supply noise.</p>
<p dir="auto">Not knowing what I was doing, quite a lot of my circuits have been very
noisy indeed, and have coupled in noise from the power supply into the
signal chain, and you can really see that on an oscilloscope even when
it's not always audible.</p>
<p dir="auto">Even in op-amp designs, where the op-amp itself has a very high PSRR and
isn't mixing power supply noise into the signal, my biasing circuits
were often not great, and so the op-amp would see not just the signal
but the power supply noise coming in through the DC biasing.</p>
<p dir="auto">And every time I tried a dual power rail (so that I could just keep the
signal ground-referenced), the noise from the switching ended up just
always noticeable, and the extra complexity was annoying when a lot of
effects then didn't have any real use for the dual rail.</p>
<p dir="auto">Filtering obviously helps, but this is just a long-winded explanation
for why I ended up really appreciating the "bias to ground" JFET model
for the signal input side, and the common drain follower in particular.</p>
<p dir="auto">That works with a single JFET (the MMBF5103 worked well for me), but my
favorite design so far is a dual-JFET LS844 with the second matched JFET
used as a current sink.  It has basically infinite input impedance (and
could be DC coupled, although I do the coupling capacitor with resistor
to ground) and gives a good output signal somewhere roughly in the
middle of the single-supply 9V rail.</p>
<p dir="auto">See <a href="https://www.linearsystems.com/_files/ugd/7e8069_52b1022fbded45fab609459acb337629.pdf" rel="nofollow">LS844 Application note</a></p>
<p dir="auto">Why do I mention this in particular? Mainly because it's a great example
of how completely <em>insane</em> my designs are.  That LS844 is used as a
voltage follower with a noticeable DC offset, and that single dual-JFET
SOT-23-6 component is more expensive - and harder to find - than a
simple op-amp would be.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just to put that into perspective: you can buy LM358's at mouser for
about $0.07 each in reasonable quantities (ie a hundred).  Sure, that's
not the greatest op-amp ever and you'd have to have a 5V regulator, so
maybe you're better off at twice the cost, and go for a TL082 or a TL072
instead.  Or go for a BJT input one and be even cheaper.</p>
<p dir="auto">The LS844? Harder to find, and <em>much</em> more expensive.  If they are in
stock at all, you'll find them for $2.50 when you buy ten or more.  And
I'm using it as a questionable replacement for a single input of one of
those dirt-cheap op-amps.</p>
<p dir="auto">Put another way: go elsewhere for sane designs.  This is not the place.</p>
<p dir="auto">But it does work quite well. See some notes on the signal path testing
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/GuitarPedal/blob/main/Documentation/Passthrough/Notes.md">here</a></p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Physical design</h3><a id="user-content-physical-design" aria-label="Permalink: Physical design" href="#physical-design"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I started out with small designs that I decided would fit best into a
1590A enclosure (basically the smallest regular guitar pedal form
factor), because it was cute.  The purely physical layout limitations
were actually interesting, and since I was doing SMT components and
simple circuits, the circuit sizes were never even remotely an issue.</p>
<p dir="auto">However, as I decided that I don't want to play around with silly analog
audio effects from the 60's and 70's any more, that 1590A enclosure got
increasingly painful.  Putting an Electrosmith Daisy Seed inside of them
is possible, but only if you don't do a proper stomp-switch and limit
yourself to two pots.  And yes, I did that.</p>
<p dir="auto">Do I want to use the pre-built Daisy Seed? Maybe - and maybe not.  This
repository does include the beginnings of a "what if I did my own
version of a MCU and CODEC", because it's an interesting learning
experience too.  And I started that because then I'd be able to fit
things better in a 1590A.</p>
<p dir="auto">But then my meds kicked in, and I've finally given up on the 1590A.
It's cute.  The mechanical challenges were interesting.  But they've
gone from "interesting" to "overly limiting".</p>
<p dir="auto">So now I'm instead doing a much more reasonable enclosure.  So 1590B it
is.  That just simplifies things a lot and the end result is a lot
saner.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Components</h3><a id="user-content-components" aria-label="Permalink: Components" href="#components"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I've used JLCPCB, PCBWAY and OSH Park for PCB manufacturing.  The end
results are all good, pick the one you're most comfortable with.  I've
found that at least for me, JLCPCB gives the fastest turnaround time,
but I suspect it heavily depends on where you live.</p>
<p dir="auto">In the past, I've done some PCB assembly services too, and PCBWAY did a
good job.  With this project where the manual soldering has been part of
the whole experience, I've just done bare boards so far.</p>
<p dir="auto">I've toyed with the idea of doing some assembly service jobs in case I
decide to go for more fiddly components, but that's really for a future
"what if I do the digital side too".  I'm not there yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">Connectors and potentiometers are typically from Tayda Electronics, with
most of the actual common SMD components from kits or from Mouser.</p>
<p dir="auto">Some typical parts from Tayda:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.taydaelectronics.com/6-35-mm-1-4-righ-angle-mono-female-connector-thread-lock-panel-mount.html" rel="nofollow">Mono Audio Jack A-6976</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10k-ohm-linear-taper-potentiometer-round-shaft-pcb-9mm.html" rel="nofollow">10k Linear 9mm Pot A-1847</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.taydaelectronics.com/dpdt-compact-stomp-foot-pedal-switch-momentary-pcb.html" rel="nofollow">DPDT Compact Stomp Foot Switch A-1884</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.taydaelectronics.com/10-pin-box-header-connector-2-54mm-right-angle.html" rel="nofollow">Right Angle IDC Header A-2943</a></li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">For "random" SMD capacitors and resistors, get one of the kits.  I can
personally heartily recommend the Guanruixin kits from Amazon: there are
0805 and 1206 kits of both capacitors and resistors, and I love the
packaging and labeling.  Very good for organizing at a hobbyist level.</p>
<p dir="auto">Just the storage case makes them worth getting:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guanruixin-Capacitor-1pF-47uF-Capacitance-Compliant/dp/B0B3JV5PMT" rel="nofollow">Guanruixin 0805 Capacitor Kit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Guanruixin-Resistor-Assortment-Tolerance-Compliant/dp/B0B3JVDMZ1" rel="nofollow">Guanruixin 0805 Resistor Kit</a></li>
<li>.. any other sizes you want</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">There are other kits out there, but it's nice to have a good compact
case with a selection of various values.  If you are like me, you'll run
out of the common resistor values, and then I buy cut tape from Mouser
and just fill the specific compartments in that kit case.</p>
<p dir="auto">Which brings us to Mouser and DigiKey and the like: not just for
refills, but for anything that is slightly more specialized.  Like that
LS844, but really most of the not-completely-standard SMD components.</p>
<p dir="auto">My exact SMD component choices have been pretty random, and a number of
them have been influenced by footprint rather than technical merit.  I
tend to like things like dual transistor SOT-23-6 packages, and if you
look at my MOSFET choices I think you'll find that the primary choice
was packaging and a high enough V<sub>GSS</sub>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Put another way: I'm not claiming my parts choices necessarily make
sense.  They've worked for me - often in the sense of "that other part
was just too fiddly to solder, so I've replaced it with this other part
that works for me"</p>
<div dir="auto"><p dir="auto">Note</p><p dir="auto">If you actually know what you are doing, and you looked at the
schematic and went "Linus is clearly way over his head, and that is
just <em>stupid</em>", whether it comes to parts choices or to just the
circuit in general, please let me know.</p>
<p dir="auto">In particular, don't feel like it would be impolite to tell me I'm
incompetent and doing stupid things. I absolutely know I'm not
competent and would love to hear any criticism. Some of the best
teaching moments have been when I haven't understood something, and
somebody piped up to tell me I should do Xyz.</p>
<p dir="auto">I'm going to leave the link to the
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/1590A/issues/4" data-hovercard-type="issue" data-hovercard-url="/torvalds/1590A/issues/4/hovercard">"Tremolo doubling as a metronome"</a>
issue from the 1590A pedal project, because that was a case of
somebody (@gralco) coming in and very politely telling me I was doing
stupid things.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pushing me to do simulations in KiCad completely changed the game.
So don't be shy to tell me my circuits suck. Because that's literally
why I do this!</p>

					<h2>Episode Transcript</h2>
										<div id="transcript_inner">
						<p>Hey there, it’s Stephen Dubner. Before we get started on today’s episode, I’d love your help on a future episode we’re producing —&nbsp;especially if you happen to be a physician. We’re looking into the doctor shortage in the U.S., so if you happen to be a doctor, we want to hear from you. I’d like to know how your workload has changed over time, maybe how your workplace has changed, or if you have anything else on the topic to say you think we might find interesting. Just send a voice memo to radio@freakonomics.com, subject line: doctor shortage. Thanks in advance. Also: we’ll be doing a live taping of <em>Freakonomics Radio</em> as part of Sirius XM Podcasts Month, on Wednesday, October 8th in New York City. There’s room for a few <em>Freakonomics Radio</em> fans to come along, so if you’d like to be one of them, send an email to radio@freakonomics.com, subject line: “live taping.” Thanks for that —&nbsp;and now, on to today’s episode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>If you are an American, how do you think about the relationship between the U.S. and China? You may see China as a political and economic bully, and a thief of American intellectual property. You may see China as a hardcore surveillance state — internally and externally; maybe a propaganda state too. But you probably don’t think about the relationship between China and the U.S. the way that <strong>Dan Wang</strong> thinks about it:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://danwang.co/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>Dan WANG</em></strong></a><em>: I think that no two peoples are more alike. They have a hastiness around them. They have a sense of being willing to take shortcuts, especially on health and wealth. They both have a sense of the future in a way that I think is not so apparent anymore in Europe or Japan. They’re both striving towards something.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But for all those similarities between the U.S. and China, Wang sees one huge difference: China is a country that is run by engineers, while the U.S. is a country run by lawyers. Engineers, he explains, are driven to build while lawyers are driven to argue, and obstruct. Who is Dan Wang, and how did he come to hold this view? He was born in China, in the early 1990s. When he was seven, he immigrated with his parents to Canada and, later, to the U.S., near Philadelphia. But he returned to China in his twenties —&nbsp;as an analyst for an economic research firm. He stayed for six years, and each year he wrote a long letter home, and published it on his website.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: Yes, that’s right. Every year I tried to tell my friends what I was up to, and try to tell my parents what I was up to. And it kind of took a life of its own after I was stuck in China during the entirety of “Zero Covid,” and very few other people were able to observe the country and write about it as I was able to do.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>He has now turned those letters into a book, called <em>Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future. </em>Wang sees much to admire about an engineering state:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: They’ve just been solving seven problems a day before breakfast because they have so many problems to solve.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>But also, plenty of downside:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: They are also fundamentally social engineers, and the physical engineers cannot restrain themselves from treating society as just another big optimization problem.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Today on <em>Freakonomics Radio</em>, what happens when an engineering state goes up against a lawyerly society? What does the U.S. have to learn from China, and vice versa? And: what happens when an expat returns to explore the soul of his motherland?<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: I was concerned at several points for my safety. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>All that is coming up, starting now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>Okay, let’s have a proper introduction.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG: Hi, I’m Dan Wang. I am a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and the author of </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breakneck-Chinas-Quest-Engineer-Future/dp/1324106034" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future</a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: So Dan, what are you exactly? I ask because you’re not an academic researcher, quite. You’re not fully a journalist, quite. You’re not a business analyst, quite. So if you had to slap one big label on your forehead, what would it be?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I am Dan Wang. I think that is all I can be. But maybe you can give me a label. I think a lot of what I have tried to do is to be an observer of China partly as an outsider just as I’m an observer of the United States partly as an outsider of being Canadian.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>These days, Wang spends most of his time in Ann Arbor, Michigan.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG: My wife is a professor at the University of Michigan. is an anthropologist, really, of technology cultures, and so, she wrote a book about Shenzhen maker spaces called Prototype Nation. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: And where did she grow up?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG: She grew up in Salzburg. So, she is Austrian and we just spent a bit of time in Austria. We were hiking through the Austrian Alps.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Wang was born in the Chinese province of Yunnan.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: I grew up in China’s periphery. I did not grow up in its imperial core of Beijing or these rich coastal cities like Shanghai or Shenzhen.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>One of Wang’s grandfathers barely survived famine, and he became an army officer. His other grandfather came from a family that had once been rich, from trading in everything from copper and silk to liquor and possibly opium.</p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: My family is made up of some people with more elite origins, some people with more rural origins, but what was important was that they all suffered through the great turn of the Communist Party’s rule with Mao Zedong. Some of them made it out better than others. My parents were both lucky to be urbanites in China growing up. They were part of China’s luckiest generation, to have been born in the 1960s. They were able to attend university. They were able to have careers, to build a modicum of wealth, and they were able to emigrate abroad as well.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>DUBNER: You write that for your parents when they were younger, and especially your grandparents’ generation, that poverty was the normal state of affairs, that there were shortages in just about everything. </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: That’s right. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Imagine that they had been born — the same people that you know as your mother and father —&nbsp;had been born, let’s say, 30 years later, 1990. How would their lives have been different?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Yeah, well, that is around my age. I just turned 33, and this is one of these things that I reflect upon in China, that the decade of birth really, really matters. And so my parents were lucky in part because the socialist-planned economy was going away when my mom was in college. When she started college at the age of 18, she was given ration tickets to be able to eat pork once a month. That was all the pork that she was allotted. But most of that system had melted away by the time she reached her senior year of college. Now, if you were born in China in 1990 then I could expect that my parents by virtue of being urbanites should have been allocated two or three apartments from the state, which would be worth quite a bit more. And they may have been able to liquidate one of these homes in order to send me abroad for college, and maybe my parents could have afforded my college education much more easily.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>From around 1980 until 2016, the Chinese government —&nbsp;concerned about overpopulation — enforced its one-child policy.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: And my parents, I’m not sure whether they are really wanted to have a second child, but that option wasn’t available to them in part because when my mother gave birth to me, she was also forced to sign these documents in her workplace saying that she will not have a second child, and maybe she would have to consent to having a sterilization to make sure that she did not have a second child. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: How old were you when you learned about that? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I was maybe about seven or eight years old. This was shortly after we moved to Canada when I was growing up. My parents I think at least debated and discussed whether they should give me a sibling. We had a bit of a rocky start when I moved to Canada. My parents moved just after the dot-com bubble, and my dad was a software engineer. So they had a harder time finding their footing. And I was a handful, I admit. I was a rowdy child. I’m sorry, Mom. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Well, they got their revenge by placing you in some kind of military training program, yes?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I was such a rowdy child that my parents decided that I was best served to be a Royal Canadian Army Cadet. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: And that worked out well for you.</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I was never all that good at school. But the army really straightened me out, I was part of the army band, and I was really good at drill, I was cadet of the year and that was something I was really proud of.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Wang studied philosophy at the University of Rochester in upstate New York, but he dropped out to work for the Canadian e-commerce startup Shopify. He then spent some time in Silicon Valley and in Germany. He did eventually get his college degree, and he did some freelance writing — <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/4/13498504/shenzhen-smartphone-innovation-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including an article for <em>Vox</em> about Chinese drone technology</a>. This led to a job with a firm called Gavekal Dragonomics, which provides investment research about the Chinese economy. He moved to Hong Kong in 2017.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: We were trying to get beyond the headlines of the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg to figure what’s really going on in China for a broadly financial audience of folks in hedge funds, pensions, asset allocators. We were journalists, we were diplomats, we were analysts, we were executives, all trying to figure out this big thing of what China is. I was there to really study a big program called Made in China 2025, which was Beijing’s grand ambition to dominate 10 different industries of the future, included electric vehicles, included new forms of material science, and at the time there was a lot of skepticism that China could innovate, that China could build cars better than Germans and Japanese. And I had been feeling that China was going to be able to build all the cars, going to build all the industrial robotics. What I found really important was to treat China seriously by reading a lot of the core texts of the party state. So I found myself reading most major speeches by Xi Jinping that was published in the party’s main theory magazine. It’s a magazine called Seeking Truth, “Qiushi” in Chinese. I found myself reading this beautiful magazine that was very well-produced every month and sent to party members and curious folks like me. So I understood that China has this formal system in which you have a Communist Party that has a lot of propaganda that is often trying to explain itself and what it is trying to do. I also understood that China was not strictly a formal system, that the formality of the official China contrasts with the complete casual informality of Chinese society. I found myself going to visit as many places in China as I could, first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai as well as to villages, as well to third- and fourth-tier cities across the countryside as well.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: When you interact with these people, how open are they with you? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think that Chinese everywhere, including in the imperial center of Beijing, have a very nice appreciation of the informalities of Chinese society. The most blasphemous things that one could hear would be among urban residents in Beijing even today, who would tell you about all the ways that the central government is meddling with their lives and becoming very weird with politics. For the most part, Chinese people are wonderful and informal and they complain very openly and very bitterly about all of the problems that they face. I think for the most part people are not generally intimidated unless, you know, you’re speaking to a party member and it’s clear that I cannot be a party member because I’m a foreigner. The only person they’re really scared of is Xi Jinping. I think nobody would complain to that big guy. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: When you returned to China as a Chinese-born Canadian-American young person, now coming back to do economic research to benefit American investors, I’m curious how you were perceived?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Oh boy, that makes my life sound even more complicated than I expected. If you are of Chinese heritage, the Chinese government will view you essentially as a ward of the state for as long as you live. Doesn’t matter if you haven’t spent any time in China, doesn’t matter if your parents came to San Francisco 100 years ago, you will be viewed as a ward of the state. That is also one of these frightening things about China. I don’t want to be treated as a ward of the state forever. I am very proud to be a Canadian. I’m very happy to be a resident of the United States. And this is not how I would choose to be identified for the rest of my life.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Were you concerned for your safety there?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I was concerned at several points for my safety. At one point in 2022, the Chinese government banned my website within China. I was thinking, well, all I have is this rinky-dink website. It’s just my name, danwong.co. Did Beijing really feel like I was on par with Wikipedia or the New York Times in order to have to ban me? I had to go see the Canadian consul general in Shanghai to ask whether they needed me to leave in a hurry. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: And what were you told when you went there? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: They said that maybe this was just an algorithmic decision by the government. It’s not very clear. I didn’t have any censors’ doors I could knock on to ask, Hey, what’s going on, is there something I wrote? And so I had no idea. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Had you written things that you thought, had it caught the attention of the right people, it would have inflamed them? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: What I decided to do was that I was going to write about the country in the best way that I could, and if it inflamed anyone, I wasn’t going to worry too much about it. There’s a great sinologist named Perry Link who came up with this excellent metaphor for how to think about Chinese censorship, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anaconda-Chandelier-Writings-China/dp/1589881982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that metaphor was the anaconda and the chandelier</a>. So, imagine that you’re at a dinner table. There is a chandelier above you, and within this chandelier was a great anaconda that was just coiled inside, sleeping. All of these dinner guests are very well aware that there’s an anaconda hanging above them. And if they say the wrong thing, maybe the anaconda will wake up and come down and strangle them. A lot of the censorship in China consists of self-censorship. A lot of dinner guests don’t know if the anaconda will wake up, but they self-censor regardless. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: In that analogy, does the anaconda sometimes turn out to be a fake anaconda?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Yeah, it was a paper anaconda — as Mao Zedong might say. Sometimes you can say things and the anaconda will completely ignore you. I think fundamentally the issue here is uncertainty about when the anaconda might strike, and I think that produces a lot of the self-censorship. I decided I wasn’t going to self-censor. I wasn’t going to tread on eggshells here. I was going to write in the best way that I could whatever was going on in China as I observed it. If someone found my remarks inflammatory —&nbsp;well, that’s on them. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: If I recall correctly, because of Covid and because of the lockdown, you ended up staying in China either longer, at least more consistently, than you would have otherwise. Is that the case? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think that is fair, yes.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: So what do you think would have happened to you if Covid had never happened? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think I would have continued to study the path of U.S.-China relations, tried to study the trajectory of China’s technology improvements, and I would have probably not have been able to write quite a lot of this book. Because the Covid experience really was quite shocking to me, to have to stay in the country for three years, and I think it was shocking to absolutely everyone who didn’t expect the sort of measures that the Chinese government would enact. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Can you just talk about your experience, especially during <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/27/china/china-2022-zero-covid-intl-hnk-mic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that intense pursuit of “Zero Covid</a>.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I was in China at the start of 2020 until the end of 2022, basically having not left for three years. My observation of “Zero Covid” in China was that it consisted mostly of these, let’s call it, three acts, to put it a little bit dramatically. The first act of “Zero Covid” consisted of a lot of anger at the Chinese government. Whis was really the winter, spring of 2020 when we had heard of a new respiratory virus that had broken out of a city named Wuhan. And a lot of folks, including me, including a lot of Chinese around me, were angry that this was the second big respiratory virus to break out of China in two decades. The first one was SARS in 2003. And it followed some of those early issues of SARS, in which the Chinese government tried to suppress some of these whistleblowers that were talking about medical conditions. The second act moved pretty quickly. By April and May of 2020, people saw that China actually contained the virus fairly well. And there was a bigger sense of appreciation, that these methods of “Zero Covid,” though very harsh, was able to stomp out a lot of chains of transmission. Now, people were still straining under some of these difficult aspects of “Zero Covid,” which included things like, if you tested positive, the government was going to make you go to a convention center or a stadium to quarantine with other folks. You had to go through these contact-tracing apps. A lot of things were shut down. You had to wear a mask outside in most places. But most people decided that these costs were worth bearing. Restaurants were starting to come back online, a lot of the economy was returning to life. There used to be this early commentary at the start of 2020, that Covid was going to be China’s Chernobyl moment, which meant a natural disaster that triggered the political downfall of the regime. And if anything, people thought that, maybe Covid is the Chernobyl movement for everyone else, because Donald Trump’s America in 2020 certainly didn’t seem like a really good place to be. And that was the year that my parents did a very un-Chinese thing and said, “Dan, don’t come back and visit us in Pennsylvania. It’s a mess over here, just stay in China, where life is better- ordered.” And then there was a third act of “Zero Covid,” which started with the Shanghai lockdown in the spring of 2022. It was probably the most ambitious lockdown ever attempted in the history of humanity. China essentially demanded that its population in its largest city of 25 million people essentially could not leave their apartment compounds over the course of 10 weeks in the spring of 2022 because the Omicron variant of the virus, which was highly transmissible, was spreading out of control in the city. Xi’an in the Northwest also was subject to a very long lockdown. And so people were kept inside. A lot of folks felt food-insecure. The city had no plan really to implement a lockdown while delivering a lot of food to everyone. People who needed treatment for their diabetes, treatment for cancer, were essentially told, you need to stay at home because we don’t want Covid spreading. A lot of people across China were feeling very dissatisfied with “zero Covid.” In a few places, protests erupted, and I remember going to the Shanghai protests in October of 2022. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Some residents of Shanghai protested the Covid measures by screaming out of their windows, for hours.</p>
<p>The government deployed drones to tell residents to keep quiet.</p>
<p>The announcement says, “Please comply with Covid restrictions. Control your soul’s desire for freedom. Do not open the window or sing.” And then, the central government tried a different approach.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: The great denouement of “zero Covid” was that the central government essentially threw up its hands and said, “We’re not going to pursue this anymore.” Essentially, they dropped all of these barriers —&nbsp;not quite overnight, but over the course of a week in which “Zero Covid” became total Covid. And rather than trying to help and prepare the population to deal with this virus that the government has spent three years frightening people about, it really just allowed the virus to run rampant in the coldest month of the year, when a lot of people died.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>According to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research published by the </a><em>Journal of the American Medical Association, </em>there were nearly two million excess deaths in China among people 30 and over in the first two months after the “zero Covid” strategy was abandoned. Dan Wang reflected on this in his 2022 letter. “Over the last seven decades,” he wrote, “China has experienced lengthy periods of stability punctuated by government-triggered chaos. The Chinese state is usually levelheaded; but every so often it succumbs to a manic episode. It then comes to its senses and sets down a battered people, as the rest of the world looks on aghast.” And yet, despite this kind of failure, Dan Wang thinks the U.S. has a great deal to learn from China. That’s coming up, after the break; I’m Stephen Dubner, and this is <em>Freakonomics Radio</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>Last year, instead of writing <a href="https://danwang.co/2022-letter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his annual letter from China</a>, Dan Wang&nbsp;wrote a book called<em> Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future</em>. By the time it was published, in August of this year, he was living back in the States.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>DUBNER: What was your goal in writing this book? I mean, on the one hand, it’s what you do and it’s just a good and interesting thing to do for yourself and your career and so on, but I’m curious whether there’s something more than that. </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: A big reason I wrote my book is that I have a pretty strong sense that most Americans will never visit China. A lot of Americans are not necessarily very curious about China. They have no great interest in being there, and perhaps rationally so, because they fear about their lives and they don’t find it necessarily very attractive. I was really interested in showing them that Shanghai is a really wonderful, splendid city; that Beijing is full of solidness, splendor; and that Shenzhen feels quite a lot like Silicon Valley, in which it is made up of a lot of these boring office parks; that Chongqing is the most hydropunk city in the world. I just wanted to give people a bit of a texture so that there is an aspect of mutual curiosity. I also felt that we’re reasoning through these two great superpowers that are sometimes locking horns, that are probably going to be in some degree of conflict with each other over the next few decades. It didn’t really make sense to reason through all of their problems with these 19th century political-science terms like socialist or capitalist or autocratic or neoliberal. I think what we need to do is to have a playful new framework.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>That playful new framework is also the framework of <em>Breakneck. </em>“That’s the big idea behind this book,” he writes. “It’s time for a new lens to understand the two superpowers: China is an engineering state, building big at breakneck speed, in contrast to the United States’ lawyerly society, blocking everything it can, good and bad.”</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: China is a state defined very much by a leadership that views itself as not so much interested in soft, fuzzy stuff, of creative expression, but very much more interested in building highways, building mega-projects, building dams, building coal plants, building hyperscalers, building homes. That was the way for it to create political prestige over anything else. At various points in China’s recent past, the entirety of the senior leadership, all nine members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, had degrees in engineering, and this was engineering of a very Soviet sort. We had top leaders that were hydraulic engineers and thermal engineers and mechanical engineers, and part of my central thesis is that China is ruled as an engineering state because China treats building a megaproject as the solution to any number of problems. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: What would you say are the key downsides of an engineering state?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: The problem is that they are fundamentally also social engineers that treat society as just a giant math exercise as well, which is why I spend a lot of time thinking about the one-child policy as well as “Zero Covid” —&nbsp;which, the number is right there in the name. There’s no ambiguity about what this means. So China is made up of physical engineers, people who try to engineer the economy as well. They’re also social engineers. I think that for the most part, what the Chinese are interested in is being an engineer of the soul, which is a phrase from Joseph Stalin that Xi Jinping has recently repeated. They’re not just all social engineers, they’re also engineers of the soul. The main downsides are when the Chinese government decides that the population is just another problem to be optimized, as if the population could be controlled through a series of valves. This is where I document some of the ethno-religious minorities in Tibet as well as Xinjiang who are really suffering through the engineering of being Sino-fied because they are treated as their cultures do not matter, and must be harmonized into the dominant Han culture.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: How much of that is related to the building of infrastructure projects and populations being displaced?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think there is a component of trying to move, let’s say, Tibetans who are living in highland Himalayas down to the lowlands where they are probably better monitored by living in these big apartment blocks rather than these mountains that the government finds it really difficult to hike into. I think there is a component of that. There is a component of building very big detention centers and detention camps for the weaker minority in Xinjiang and to try to Sinicize them as well.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: This reminds me of, it was I think the first line of your 2022 letter from China, “Mountains offer the best hiding places from the state,” you wrote. Can you say a little bit more about that?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG: Yeah, I was born in China’s most mountainous province, and I am still very much attracted to mountains in part because of the works of political scientist and anthropologist James C. Scott of Yale University. His best-known work is <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300078152/seeing-like-a-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seeing Like a State</a>, in which Scott wrote about how the state really tries to organize the population in order to better control them. And one of Scott’s best works, maybe his very best work, is called <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300169171/the-art-of-not-being-governed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Art of Not Being Governed</a>, in which he wrote about a zone he called Zomia. That is a region of highland Southeast Asia that stretches from the southwestern part of China, where I’m from, all the way down to Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia, where you have all of these peoples that are uninterested in being part of organized states. They retreated to these mountain areas in part to run away from the Burmese state or the Tibetan state, and most especially the Han Chinese state. They’re tired of taxation, they’re tired of conscription, they’re afraid of the diseases that spread in urban quarters, and so they decided to be in the mountains, which are much more difficult to find them.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Okay, so if that’s what Wang means when he calls China an “engineering state,” what does it mean when he calls the U.S. a lawyerly society?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think that the U.S. is a lawyerly society because at first approximation, a lot of folks who end up in the White House have gone to Yale Law School. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>As <em>Politico </em>has pointed out, <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2023/02/22/the-yalies-take-the-wheel-00084037" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there were around 140 lawyers in the Biden White House</a>, and about 25 percent of them had Yale law degrees.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG: If we take a look at the founding of America, a lot of the founding fathers were trained as lawyers. If we look at the Declaration of Independence, essentially it reads like a lawsuit as the start of a great legal argument. The lawyerly society has persisted in the modern past, and the Democratic Party is especially lawyerly. I think the issue with lawyers is that lawyers are really good at saying no. Lawyers block everything, good and bad. So on the one hand, we don’t have a functional infrastructure almost anywhere in the U.S., but we also don’t have stupid ideas like the one-child policy.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: I’d like to know why you call the U.S. a lawyerly society versus a lawyerly state, especially considering that so many of our elected politicians are lawyers.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG: I call it a lawyerly society because this is something that we all participate in. One of the great things about lawyers is that they’re able to protect people with property. Unfortunately, what that has ended up in is that a lot of lawyers are protecting people who have already made it. They’re mostly already protecting the rich, and it is mostly the people with property, who are suing to block, let’s say, a new piece of housing from being developed around them, creating more mass transit systems, creating new highways. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: When you talk about the U.S. not being good at infrastructure, you know, I think of the interstate highway system, which is I think by most regards, still considered pretty good. And that was obviously a government project. I think about the commercial airline system, which is a collaboration between private firms and a big state architecture as well. Do you say that we’re bad at infrastructure because in the last 50 years, we’ve had, A, decay of the older stuff, and, B, an inability to build especially big public transportation projects, is that the primary accusation here? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Yes. I think it is both, that the U.S. is not maintained and it is also not building. Now, I acknowledge that the U.S. used to be an engineering state. The U.S. had this really big growth spurt between 1850s and 1950s. In the 19th century, the U.S. had been building these big systems of canals, it built the interstate railways, it built these big skyscrapers in Manhattan as well as Chicago. And then throughout the Second World War, the U.S. built a lot of other big projects as well, especially the highways, as you point out, but also the Manhattan Project as well the Apollo missions. I think the U.S. engineering state had made a lot of mistakes, it probably overbuilt. Throughout the 1950s and the 1960s, people started to revolt against these decisions made by urban planners, when folks like Robert Moses were ramming highways through dense urban neighborhoods. When the U.S. government agencies were spraying pesticides, especially D.D.T., absolutely everywhere. When fossil-fuel executives had gotten really close with the regulators as well as the automakers. And so people decided that a lot of big business, as well as a lot of big government, had to be restrained. We had a movement out of elite law schools, especially at Harvard Law as well as Yale Law, that decided that lawyers and law students had to be regulators as well as litigators. There were these movements of “sue the bastards,” and the bastards refer to the U.S. government as well as big businesses. And so a lot of the lawyers decided to restrain activity rather than build new activity.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: When you think of the downsides of the lawyerly society, what are the top three or five that come to mind?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: The first is that the U.S. has really lost a lot of its ability to be physically dynamic. We’re speaking in New York City. New York City has had a very extensive housing shortage for a very long time. The rents here are far too high. And the U.S. generally has not built enough housing in many of its big cities. New York is really bad at building mass transit. If we take a look at the data that’s being maintained by N.Y.U.’s transit project, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-23/in-nyc-subway-a-case-study-in-runaway-transit-construction-costs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York spends about $2 billion building a mile of subway</a> and this is not just a little bit more pricey than places like Spain and Italy and France, which are also complicated to build. It’s something like eight or nine times more expensive than subway projects in Rome or Paris or Barcelona.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: And in what ways are lawyers the cause?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: The lawyers are in part the cause because the state agencies are much more focused on procedure and process rather than actually getting the result done. I think a lot about the California high-speed rail project, in which nearly now 20 years after voters first approved the project in a referendum in California, basically none of us are able to ride a high-speed rail. The first segment will open probably later than 2030. Lawyers and the legal system have also made it really easy for any vested interest groups to file lawsuits alleging that there is some issue of environmental protection that the state has not sufficiently studied. I think that there is broad energy in the U.S. to correct some of these problems of the past. There is a strain of the left that is very interested in improving the power of the government, and to restrain some of the lawsuits that are excessively strangling core government functions. There is an element of the right that is interested in that as well. But I think the part of the American right that is thinking more about building is a little bit more animated about the rusting manufacturing base, the rusting defense industrial base, in which it has become quite clear that the U.S. is unable to make things like semiconductors, things like the top aviation jets, at high-enough quality levels. And even parts of the military industrial base have become quite non-functional. The U.S. has shipped off a lot of its munitions to Ukraine in its defense against Russia, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/07/21/is-the-us-ready-for-the-next-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and the U.S. hasn’t been able to replenish a lot of these stockpiles</a> <a href="https://www.rand.org/nsrd/projects/NDS-commission.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">because it</a> <a href="https://features.csis.org/preparing-the-US-industrial-base-to-deter-conflict-with-China/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can’t get the production facilities in order and figure out all of the supply chain issues</a>. According to the Government Accountability Office, every class of U.S. Naval ships is behind schedule by 18 months to three years. Even a lot of the core projects that the Department of Defense —&nbsp;a very powerful agency —&nbsp;cares about, it hasn’t been doing very well. So I think this is where the right and the left are both animated. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: To what degree do you think that our lawyerly society has contributed to our political partisanship?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: When people feel that they can’t have affordable housing, when people see that prices of goods around them are going up, when people take a look at some of America’s apex manufacturers —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/23/technology/intel-computer-chips-tech-ai-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">companies like Intel</a> <a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/quick-take/boeings-decline-traced-to-decades-of-catering-to-shareholders-above-all-others/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Boeing</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sixty-Zero-Collapse-Motors-Industry/dp/0300158688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Detroit automakers</a> —&nbsp;which have, for the most part, been an unceasing tale of woe for their production over the last couple of years, I think there is a pretty broad sense that things in America are not working as they should, that it’s lacking some aspect of dynamism. When the economy is weak, when it’s not working for the many, when it is working mostly for the elites —&nbsp;which is also the people that lawyers are most set up to serve —&nbsp;that people get quite mad. And I think that is creating some sort of political dysfunction. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: So what would you argue are the best lessons that the U.S. has to learn from China’s engineering state, or maybe the best components of being an engineering state that are worth trying to copy? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think the U.S. needs a little bit of the engineering spirit of Robert Moses once again today. New York City has just not built enough infrastructure. Part of what China has really decided to build is a lot of infrastructure, mass transit, but also parks, a lot of power capacity and also a lot of very tall bridges in the countryside. I think when people see that their cities have new subway lines, when the rivers are being connected by bridges, when their city is becoming more pleasant, they also have a broader sense of optimism about the future. This is in part a redistribution strategy in which, you know, you have these bridges built in pretty poor areas in order to try to make them better- connected. And so, that has produced not only a lot of economic gains, but it has also created some degree of political resilience for the party. Because when Chinese are pointing to their high-speed rail networks or drone shows with pride, I think their pride is very real. So we can call it propaganda of the deed, but I think this is what people feel really good about. I think they feel really good when they are able to access better manufacturing goods, as China has been able to deliver. One of the strange things about the early days of Covid in the U.S. was how manufacturers were unable to retool their production lines in order to produce basic goods like masks and cotton swabs. This is something that the Chinese had no shortage of.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: One factor that’s often overlooked when people talk about how the U.S. and other countries have offshored manufacturing to China over the past 30 or whatever years is that we also offshored our pollution. Can you just talk about that from the Chinese side especially, and what kind of sentiment and perhaps accusations, complaints go into that?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Yeah, the Chinese have sucked up a lot of these highly polluting industries, something like rare-earth processing. Rare earths is a bit of a misnomer. Most rare earths are not actually very rare. There’s about, I think, 20 elements on the periodic table that are classified as rare earths. But for the most part, they are pretty abundant. Anyone can dig them up and then process them into refined material. The challenge with rare earths is that processing is so energy-intensive and so polluting that only the Chinese have the stomach to do something like this. If you take a look at some of the cities and the towns and the villages around these rare earths processing facilities, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/china-rare-earths-baotou-life-metallic-elements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cancer rates are off the charts</a>, and I think it is absolutely valid for Americans to think about whether they want to live near one of these highly polluting, belching toxic facilities. But the Chinese have been able to stomach it in part because former top leader Deng Xiaoping stated as a matter of national strategy that China has rare earths. We don’t have very much, he said this in the 1980s, we don’t have very much, but we have these rare earths and we are going to be able to process them.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: I’ve heard you say that neither lawyers nor engineers are the best people, especially in concentration, to run a government. <a href="https://www.sinicapodcast.com/p/the-engineering-state-and-the-lawyerly" target="_blank" rel="noopener">And you’ve said that economists would be better</a>. Now, I will not argue with you on that, but I think some people would argue. So give me your best pitch for why economists are the kind of analysts, thinkers, maybe even doers who belong in government.</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Well now, Stephen, you’re really trying to get me canceled by having to praise economists.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Can I say —&nbsp;when I heard you explain this, you then said, “but economists are the most reviled of the social scientists” — and I was surprised to hear you say that. Economics has plainly taken its hits over time, as any field does, but when you look at how influential it’s been in policymaking, especially compared to the other social sciences, there’s no contest. But again, that’s my assessment; maybe I’m biased.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think that is still not a very good position to take in the academy, because people attribute every wrong in the world to the evils of economists. I have great admiration for economists because I think they synthesize the best from the lawyers as well as the engineers. I think that economists are indeed very empirical. They look at a lot of data and they also have a very keen sense of social science. They know that systems are dynamic. One of the things I will always be grateful to economists for is that economists were the greatest critics of the one-child policy in China, as well as briefly when it was kind of discussed in the U.S., after Ehrlich published The Population Bomb. Economists <a href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/storage/app/uploads/public/58e/1a4/96a/58e1a496ac31b736950996.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could tell in a way that many engineers could not that population change is a dynamic variable</a>. We don’t reason through straight lines. When the population gets wealthier or better educated, the fertility rate might fall. And so I think the economists are good blends of both technocratic empirical expertise as well as having enough humanistic tendencies to really have the right formulas. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>Coming up after the break: what does Dan Wang think about Donald Trump’s approach to China?</p>
<blockquote><p><em>WANG</em><em>: I’m pretty skeptical that reshoring under Donald Trump is going to work very well.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>I’m Stephen Dubner, this is <em>Freakonomics Radio</em>. We’ll be right back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
<p>Okay, back now to my conversation with Dan Wang, the author of <em>Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><em>DUBNER: I’m just curious who you most want to read the book? Because I can imagine that you have a variety of constituencies in mind.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think the modal audience member that I had in mind was a lawyer in Ohio, or a —&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Would that be J.D. Vance?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I would be down if J.D. Vance decided to pick up this book —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/17/us/jd-vance-yale-law-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also of Yale Law School.</a></em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: I would imagine that J.D. Vance would find a lot to be interested —&nbsp;not just interested in your book, but would feel like confirmatory evidence of what he has been talking about, yes?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Yes, although I think I’m not quite so critical of the Yale Law School as he is. Critical, though I am about the broader lawyerly culture. But I was trying to write for the smart person who was deeply curious about China coming from a perspective of someone who spoke the language and read the language and who was living there through this recent period of darkening relations between the U.S. and China. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Talk to me about the degree to which China wants to be a global superpower. The reason I ask you that question is, you know, if you read even a little bit of Chinese history, this notion of the Middle Kingdom, and their embrace of that idea, is really just compelling. There’s Heaven, there is the lowly rest of the civilizations on earth, and there’s China in the middle, and it does feel like an aspiration toward supremacy. But in the last century and a half or whatever, there hasn’t been such a big imperial appetite. So does China want to be that kind of superpower, as we tend to think, or do they just want to be, you know, a regional hegemon that gets left alone? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think that is a really important question to figure out, and this is something that the specialists are always up in a conniption about. I think the first thing to say is that, Yes, China really does view itself as the center of the world. One can translate it as the Middle Kingdom. Another way to translate it as the Central Kingdom. This is the center of the world. In the last days of the Qing Empire — this was the last empire of China before it became a republic — the Qing Empire also referred to itself as the Celestial Empire. There is a way in which the Chinese have viewed themselves to be the center of the world and everybody else is just another shade of barbarians. But what does this really mean? This is where the specialists debate. Does China want only regional hegemony? And what does regional hegemony really mean? Well, maybe it means something like demanding that the heads of state of Malaysia and Vietnam and the Philippines regularly come to the top leader in Beijing and kowtow for the emperor’s pleasure. If that is the case, is that a very big threat for American interests, if a lot of China’s near neighbors are paying fealty to China’s top leadership? I am a little bit skeptical of the case that China would want to be much more aggressive and try to, let’s say, seize Japan or seize Russia. I think that China is much more interested in declaring itself to be a great power with sufficient credibility for its own people by doing things like being a center of culture, being a center of order, producing many splendid goods that the rest of the world doesn’t have, which is how the Chinese have regarded themselves. The Chinese were able to make porcelain, were able to make silk, they were able to make tea, and the barbarians were not. That was really what defined Chinese, apart from others. And I think what that means perhaps in the modern context is that China has these fantastic cities full of drone shows in which electric vehicles, the best in the world, are speeding through. And a lot of what China is interested in is what the Qing emperor said to Lord Macartney, who was the head of the British embassy, to say, “we have no use of your splendid trinkets because we are self-sufficient in all the best goods in the world.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: So, a lot of Americans, especially the political class, have argued for years that China has advanced in large part by essentially stealing I.P., intellectual property, from the U.S. and others, and that they don’t innovate. My sense is that that may have been true 10 or 20 years ago, but very much no longer true. Can you tell me what’s what?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: China has stolen a lot of American I.P., and I think it is not the most relevant comparison for thinking about the U.S.-China competition. My starting point is to think that China is really good at climbing ladders, and the U.S. is really good at laying ladders. So what does that mean? The U.S. invents major industries — I’m thinking about something like solar production. Do you know who invented the first solar cell?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: I guess you’re going to tell me it’s in the U.S.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: It is in New Jersey. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1954/04/26/archives/vast-power-of-the-sun-is-tapped-by-battery-using-sand-ingredient.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It was Bell Labs of New Jersey that invented the first solar cell in 1954.</a> And the U.S. didn’t really do enough with the solar industry. It was really a big science project for a while. The Germans took a lot of the solar industry from the U.S. and the Chinese have completely taken it away from the Germans. So if you take a look at the solar industry, everything from the polysilicon processing in the upstream end down to the actual production of the solar photovoltaic cells, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/25/business/germany-solar-panels-china-protectionism.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that is 90 percent a Chinese product</a>. One of the things that I always like to ask American policymakers is, which has a greater glory: is it to invent a product but not really to own the industry, or is it to actually own this industry? </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: The way you’ve been describing this so far, you sound like you subscribe at least somewhat to the zero-sum line of economic thinking, which is a win for China or Germany or the U.S. is inevitably at least a partial loss for the others. Is that the way you think, or not necessarily?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I would say that there is a little bit more nuance than that, which is that technological advancement is a dynamic process. We can’t expect countries to be amazing at different technologies all out of their own. A lot of advancements in something like engines came out of really good machinery goods that were being produced in Germany, that the British textile industry laid the basis for. Part of the reason that I’ve been concerned about America’s loss of manufacturing prowess is that the U.S. lost a lot of production of televisions to Japan in the 1980s. At the time, policymakers were thinking, Well, is this a problem? Maybe we don’t really care that much about television production. But if you don’t master something like television production, then it becomes quite a lot more difficult to master other aspects of consumer electronics. The first city that really produced iPhones at scale was Shenzhen in southern China, which is right across from Hong Kong. After Shenzhen mastered the iPhone production, <a href="https://www.vox.com/new-money/2016/11/4/13498504/shenzhen-smartphone-innovation-capital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">workers in Shenzhen were pretty quickly able to turn their skills into building other major electronics products</a>.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/business/dji-chinese-drones-ban.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> It is no accident that Shenzhen also became the center of the worldwide drone industry</a>. The world’s biggest drone maker is D.J.I., it’s centered in Shenzhen, it also makes all sorts of other batteries. Let’s imagine that Apple, working with a contract manufacturer not in southern China, but in, let’s say, the industrial Midwest in the United States, call it Pennsylvania or Michigan or Wisconsin, could it have been possible that drones and batteries and all sorts of other electronics advancements were made in the U.S. Midwest rather than Shenzhen? I think that would have been quite likely.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: What you’re describing now, is this what you write about as “process knowledge”? </em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: That’s exactly right. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: That was a particularly interesting piece of your argument to me because it is much more subtle than the usual argument we hear about manufacturing jobs being off-shored. You talk about how Chinese workers, especially in technology fields, that they progress through different jobs to become sort of master craftsmen even in an industrial-assembly setting, and that really does seem to differ from the U.S. So how do you see, with the current emphasis from the Biden administration, but especially in Trump 2 administration, the emphasis on reshoring and rebuilding a variety of manufacturing now. How would you see that playing out? Because I would assume that that depth of process knowledge takes considerable time and considerable intention and education and so on. Do you think that’s something that can be captured or recaptured well here?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think it’s first really important to understand a little bit of what process knowledge really is. So Stephen, if we’re thinking about what exactly is technology, I would propose that there are three different segments of technology. The first aspect of technology is the hardware, it’s the equipment, it is all these things that we can physically observe and use. If we wanted to use a kitchen analogy, I would say that technology is something like the stove, the pots and the pans that we use to cook with. Second, technology is written instruction. So these are patents, these are blueprints, these are the recipes from which we can actually make something. And the third and I think the most important part is process knowledge, which we can also call tacit knowledge. It’s just the practical experience of doing things. So if we wanted to put someone who has never cooked a day in his life to make something quite simple and we give him the most well-equipped kitchen as well as the most exquisite recipes, are we sure that that person is able to do something as simple as fry an egg? That might be quite risky. That is really the fundamental Chinese advantage in technology. They’ve just been solving seven problems a day before breakfast because they have so many problems to solve. They have all of this experience that accrues, and then people take this process knowledge to invent whole new industries. I think it is really important for the U.S. to engage in some degree of reshoring, and I am critical of both the Biden approach as well as the Trump approach. I think the Biden administration was absolutely right to try to spend a lot more in the United States with big projects like the CHIPS Act as well the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act as well as the Inflation Reduction Act. But the problem with a lot of these programs was that the Biden administration moved really slowly. It was plodding, it was proceduralist, it was lawyerly, and a lot of this money wasn’t even allocated by the time that voters chucked Joe Biden out of the White House and brought back in Donald Trump. Because the Biden administration moved so slowly, President Donald Trump is going to have a lot of opportunities to name these big bridges and roads and highways after himself because the Biden administration was so lawyerly. And even though Donald Trump is not a lawyer by any means, I think he is still a product of the lawyerly society, because lawsuits have been completely central to his business career. He has sued absolutely everyone. He has sued business partners, he has sued political opponents, he has sued his former lawyers as well. And there is, I think, something still very lawyerly about Donald Trump in which he is flinging accusations left and right, he’s trying to intimidate people, trying to establish guilt in the court of public opinion.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: And a mentor of his was Roy Cohn —&nbsp;who, you could argue, essentially invented the modern concept of lawfare.</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Right, right. Yes, exactly, and this sort of bare-knuckled lawfare is completely natural to Donald Trump. I’m also pretty skeptical that reshoring under Donald Trump is going to work very well, in part because Trump is weakening most aspects of American strengths in science and technology. Manufacturing employment has fallen by about 40,000 workers since Liberation Day in April. That’s quite a lot of skill loss as well. I think it is not an intuitive idea that we will become a greater scientific superpower by cutting off funding to our science funding agencies, namely the National Science Foundation as well as the National Institutes of Health. I think it doesn’t quite make sense to attack universities, because the universities have driven a lot of science advancements over the past few decades in the U.S. And finally, it doesn’t make sense to deport a lot of workers. To kick them out of the country is not going to rebuild much of the process knowledge base and also, to frighten away a lot of higher skilled researchers through intimidation at the border or anything else.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: A lot of the Chinese expats I know — who are plainly a different group than those living there —&nbsp;they talk about China almost as a prison to be escaped. And I feel it’s unfair for someone like me to interpret that as the main mode of the way to think about China, for sure. But, you know, I think about the artist Ai Weiwei, I think he now lives in Portugal — he was actually imprisoned in China. So that’s obviously a heightened example. But I’m curious to know how Chinese expats of your generation think about the motherland, and I’m also just curious to how patriotic the median Chinese of that generation is.</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Among a lot of expats, there’s still a sense of considerable pride in China, even though there has been a lot of prison-like aspects of China as well. There is a very broad sense that China has been able to achieve something amazing among developing countries. <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501764561/how-china-escaped-the-poverty-trap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This degree of economic growth has not yet been matched by India and Brazil and Indonesia</a>. China has been a much more decisive grower of its economy than these other countries. That in itself aspires quite a lot of pride. There is a sense of skepticism of a lot of the democratic impulses of the West. One sees a lot of the disorderliness in the streets of New York. One sees disorderliness on January 6th in 2021. There are a lot of people who do genuinely feel that China doesn’t have these sort of issues. There are also a lot of Chinese who lived in, let’s say, New York or California, who lived through life in the U.S., and have decided that it’s a much easier life to live in Shanghai. Let’s say you have a degree in the U.S. from a good school. You may well be able to earn roughly the same salary in China as you would in the U.S., but you can save a lot of money, you have a lot more convenience, the subway systems work a lot better, there’s much better public order in the streets. </em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: What kind of person do you think you would be had you been born in China when you were, but of parents who decided not to immigrate and were 33 years old now —&nbsp;what would Dan Wang be doing in China now?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I would certainly not be writing this book. Because part of the joy of having studied philosophy and then dropped out to go work in Silicon Valley and did everything that I did —&nbsp;and I await your excellent label about what exactly it is that I do — I certainly wouldn’t have been able to pursue the sort of intellectual projects that really drive me right now. I may well have ended up working in let’s say a state-owned enterprise, being bored most of the time, probably not working very hard and not earning quite a lot of money as well. I may be working for a tech company, where the default is for people to work 9-9-6, which means 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., 6 days a week. And that would be probably a little bit more interesting but also much more stressful as well.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Toward the end of the book, you reflect on your parents’ decision to immigrate long ago, when you were seven years old — first to Canada and then the U.S. — and you kind of ask whether it was worth it. I gather your mother and father may have different feelings from each other, but how do they feel about that decision? And I’m also curious whether you know how they actually feel, or if that’s a guarded conversation?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I am thankful that my parents are relatively unguarded with me. We have always had very open communication. Right now they are very content, and I think content is the right word, with their suburban lifestyle that I find a little bit dreary, but they feel is quite good. Because when they compare themselves with their peers in China, with some of their college classmates who are some of their best friends, they’ve seen that a lot of these college classmates have much, much more money than they do. But it came at these pretty considerable costs, and pretty high levels of stress, because in China, you never really know when the government might take away your company or might smash your entire industry, which is something that has happened to quite a lot of folks in business in China because they crossed some sort of political line and then they saw that their industry no longer really exists. So though my parents’ lives in suburban Philadelphia are a little bit too quiet, quiet is something that has worked very well for them.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: Do you have children?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: No, not yet.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: If you have children, where do you think you would most like to live with them, and why?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: That’s a superb question. It is also something that we think quite a lot about. We just spent the last two months in Europe. We’d been thinking about whether Europe is quite the place that makes sense. For the most part, we decided it’s not. I think that there still are so many strange, stagnant issues in Europe.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: The “mausoleum economy,” you call it.</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: The mausoleum economy. Thank you for picking that up. That was, um — I’m still quite proud of that phrase.</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: It’s a great phrase. I read that sentence over and over and over again. And I suspect it’s deeply true although I’d never thought of it that way. This is you describing the dynamism of both the U.S. and China, and then you write “Europeans have a sense of optimism only about the past. Stuck in their mausoleum economy because they are too sniffy to embrace American or Chinese practices.” So, again, that resonates with me, and I’m pretty sure many people will also agree. But can you give me the best evidence that that is indeed true?</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I think there is something extremely dynamic about both the United States as well as China. And I set out in the opening stages of my book to say that no two peoples are more alike than Americans and Chinese. There is quite a big difference between Americans and Chinese, and let’s say Europeans and Japanese. In Europe and Japan, there is something very perfectionist, something very cozy about these places. And these places are, let’s say, much more beautiful than a lot of the hustle and bustle of the United States. But for the most part, I remain convinced — more than ever, after having spent a lick of time in the mausoleum economy — that it is still China and the U.S. that are going to be driving the future. Because either the government can’t stop it, because the societies are so dynamic, and in some cases, the government is producing it. I feel really, you know — I’m not sure if “optimistic” is quite the right word. But I believe that the U.S. can still change for the better, and I see this especially in matters of economics. </em></p></blockquote>
<p>It is of course impossible to predict the future. But if you look at the recent past, I’d say that the central framework of Dan Wang’s argument —&nbsp;a nation of engineers versus a nature of lawyers — holds up pretty well, and it explains a lot. I’d also argue that in the U.S., there is a fair amount of backlash against the lawyerly approach. I think the anti-lawyerly backlash also helps explain why President Trump is so popular in some quarters. Even though Trump plays the legal game very well, as Dan Wang pointed out in our conversation —&nbsp;including lawfare when it suits him —&nbsp;Trump often seems to say exactly what he is thinking, and do exactly what he wants, both of which are the opposite of lawyerly behavior. Anyway, this conversation with Dan Wang gave me a lot to think about, and I hope you feel the same way.</p>
<blockquote><p><em>DUBNER: It was so much fun to talk to you, Dan. And I did think of what to call you, if you want to know.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Oh, yes, please. I’m dying to know, yes.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: I think you’re a Chi-losopher.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: A Chi-losopher. What does that mean?&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: A philosopher whose understanding of China is deep in many dimensions.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Thank you very much. That is very kind.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: I’m not saying you have to use it.</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: I’ll toy with it.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>DUBNER: It’s your portmanteau to adjust.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>WANG</em><em>: Very good.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>My thanks to Dan Wang for today’s conversation; again, his book is called <em>Breakneck. </em>Let us know what you thought of this conversation. Our email is radio@freakonomics.com. Until then, take care of yourself — and, if you can, someone else too.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://virtualize.sh/blog/vmscape-and-why-xen-dodged-it/">https://virtualize.sh/blog/vmscape-and-why-xen-dodged-it/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45406573">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>It’s been less than two weeks since the security team at ETH Zürich published their research on a new microarchitectural attack they call <strong>VMScape</strong>:</p><figure><a href="https://comsec.ethz.ch/research/microarch/vmscape-exposing-and-exploiting-incomplete-branch-predictor-isolation-in-cloud-environments/?ref=virtualize.sh"><div><p>VMScape: Exposing and Exploiting Incomplete Branch Predictor Isolation in Cloud Environments – Computer Security Group</p><p><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/icon/cropped-Mini-Logo-270x270.jpg" alt=""><span>Skip to content</span></p></div><p><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/thumbnail/ETH_COMSEC_small.png" alt="" onerror="this.style.display = 'none'"></p></a></figure><p>It’s a neat piece of work, and it shows once again how CPUs, with all their clever tricks for performance, can sometimes open the door to data leaks across virtual machines.</p><h2 id="what-is-vmscape">What is VMScape?</h2><p>The short version: modern CPUs use a <strong>branch predictor</strong> to guess where code will go next. It makes things faster, but the predictor also “remembers” past patterns. If you can manipulate that memory, you can mislead the CPU and peek at things you shouldn’t. That’s the basic idea behind Spectre-style attacks.</p><p>According to the ETH team:</p><blockquote>“We find that branch predictor state is not fully flushed across VMs, enabling cross-VM Branch Target Injection (vBTI) primitives. We demonstrate the practical impact of vBTI with VMScape, a cross-VM attack capable of leaking QEMU userspace secrets from a malicious guest VM on AMD Zen 4 and Zen 5 CPUs.”</blockquote><p>In other words, a malicious VM can target the hypervisor’s userspace components and start leaking data. For KVM, that means QEMU, which is heavily exposed. VMware is in the same situation.</p><h2 id="why-xen-wasn%E2%80%99t-affected">Why Xen wasn’t affected</h2><p>The researchers also note that <strong>Xen is not vulnerable</strong>. That’s not because Xen has no bugs (it does, like every hypervisor), but because of its architecture.</p><p>From day one, Xen was designed to keep the hypervisor core small and move everything else out. Device emulation, storage drivers, network stacks — they all live in <strong>Dom0</strong>, which is itself just another virtual machine. Dom0 has more privileges than a normal guest, but it’s still not the hypervisor.</p><figure><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/2025/09/xen-overview.drawio.svg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="701" height="461"></figure><p>That architectural choice makes Xen closer to a <strong>microkernel</strong> than a traditional monolithic hypervisor. The core stays minimal, with a narrow set of responsibilities, and anything that doesn’t absolutely need to run at the highest privilege level gets pushed out. That’s not just elegant — it’s a big deal for security.</p><h2 id="size-matters-in-a-good-way">Size matters (in a good way)</h2><p>Because the hypervisor itself is small, it’s easier to audit, reason about, and even certify. That’s why you’ll find Xen at the heart of a lot of <strong>embedded and safety-critical projects</strong>, where formal verification and certification are required. Try doing that with a massive, monolithic kernel and you’ll quickly run into a wall. With Xen, it’s actually feasible (and being done as we speak).</p><p>VMScape highlights the benefits of that design: QEMU is simply not sitting next to the hypervisor. Even if you leak information from it, you’re still only talking about a process in Dom0, not the privileged heart of the system.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h2><p>Architectural choices made twenty years ago are paying off today. By separating responsibilities, Xen reduced its attack surface and avoided a whole class of problems. That doesn’t make it invincible (Xen has had and will have its share of vulnerabilities) but it does mean that <strong>by design, certain attacks don’t land as hard.</strong></p><p>As the ETH Zürich team points out, mitigations for KVM involve adding new predictor flushes, which Linux developers have already started to implement. VMware will need similar patches. Xen doesn’t need those same emergency measures, because the architecture already put a buffer in place.</p><figure><img src="https://virtualize.sh/blog/content/images/2025/09/2025-Xen-Panda-Standup-Green-Circle-Transparent-1.webp" alt="" loading="lazy" width="529" height="600"></figure><h2 id="defense-in-depth">Defense in depth</h2><p>It’s tempting to say “Xen wins” and stop there. But that’s not the whole story. Security is never just about one design decision. CPUs will keep evolving, new side channels will keep appearing, and no hypervisor can afford to be complacent.</p><p>Still, VMScape is a good reminder that <strong>defense in depth starts at the architecture level</strong>. A small, microkernel-like core, privilege separation, isolation of device emulation — all of that adds resilience. It won’t stop every possible attack, but it does add another layer of safety, and in security, layers are what make the difference.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="how-did-the-moose-begin">How did the moose begin</h2><p>My standard "everyday" solution when it comes to connecting computers into a single network is Wireguard. <br> Wireguard is good, supports p2p, and generally has no downsides.</p><p>The downsides come from having part of my home infrastructure located in territory controlled by a country that has blocked Wireguard by signatures. <br> This is, of course, utterly disgusting, and what's even more disgusting is that these blocks have long since stopped following any kind of legislation. <br> The result is an incomprehensible black box that can do anything, behave however it wants, and nobody knows how this shaitan-machine even works anymore.</p><p>So it's time for penetration.</p><h2 id="why-not-obfuscation">Why not obfuscation?</h2><p>Actually, there are several projects that allow obfuscating Wireguard traffic and punching through firewalls. <br> <a href="https://github.com/wangyu-/udp2raw">udp2raw</a>, <a href="https://github.com/erebe/wstunnel">wstunnel</a> and others handle this excellently. <br> And <a href="https://amnezia.org/">Amnezia VPN</a> has made their own fork of Wireguard, specifically for breaking through government censorship.</p><p>But the main problem with obfuscation is the reduction of effective packet MTU.

They guess what you're about to do, like a nosy algorithm trying to sell you sneakers after you Googled "foot pain." Branch predictors make CPUs fast by speculating on branches... until they guess wrong and everything grinds to a halt for 15,20 cycles.</p><p>Branchless programming is how we get around this: we rewrite our code to <strong>not branch at all</strong>. Instead of jumping to conclusions, we manipulate bits like 1980s assembly gremlins.</p><h3>WHAT IS A BRANCH</h3><p>What is a branch first of all?In a program, you may observe parts like this:</p><pre><code>if (condition), then
    ...
elif (condition), then
    ...
else
    ...
fi
</code></pre><p>This block of instructions is a collection of three branches. Each <code>if</code>, <code>elif</code>, and <code>else</code> represents a possible execution path the CPU can take depending on the evaluation of the conditions. At runtime, only one of these paths is taken, and the others are skipped. This choice ,  this deviation in the control flow ,  is what we call a branch.</p><p>In terms of machine code, a branch is often implemented as a jump (<code>jmp</code>, <code>je</code>, <code>jne</code>, etc.). These are instructions that tell the CPU: “if this condition holds, skip to label X; otherwise, keep going.” That jump disrupts the nice linear stream of instruction execution, forcing the CPU to guess where you’re going next.</p><p>Here’s a simple ASCII representation of how this decision tree looks:</p><pre><code>          [Condition A]
              |
        +-----+------+
       Yes          No
       |             |
[Block A]     [Condition B]
                  |
            +-----+------+
           Yes          No
           |             |
      [Block B]      [Block C]
</code></pre><p>From a CPU perspective, each conditional check and potential jump is a “fork in the road.” If your code has a predictable pattern (e.g., always taking the same branch), the CPU can guess well and maintain performance. But if it's unpredictable, say, random data or user input, then the CPU may guess wrong, flush its pipeline, and pay a heavy penalty.</p><p>This is why branches can be so dangerous in tight loops or performance-critical code: even one mispredicted branch can cost dozens of cycles, ruining your cache-fueled dreams.</p><h3>WHY IS BRANCHLESS PROGRAMMING IMPORTANT?</h3><p>Branches, when predictable, are cheap. But when unpredictable, they're evil. Imagine a tight loop that checks a condition based on data from user input, or real-world sensors, or shuffled arrays. The branch predictor stumbles, and every misstep means flushing the pipeline ,  a costly affair on modern superscalar out-of-order CPUs.</p><p>Branchless code avoids that entirely. By rewriting conditional logic into arithmetic and bit operations, or using CPU instructions like <code>cmov</code>, we let the CPU chew through code without pausing to guess. It’s smoother, faster, and often <em>more deterministic</em>, which is crucial in performance-critical or side-channel-resistant scenarios (looking at you, cryptography).</p><p>We're going to take you on a wild ride through three increasingly complex examples:</p><ol><li><code>abs(x)</code> ,  a gentle warm-up with unary fun</li><li><code>clamp(x, min, max)</code> ,  a common pattern with two conditions</li><li><code>partition()</code> ,  a full algorithm with data-dependent control flow</li></ol><p>We'll compare these in <strong>C</strong> (our performance-hungry workhorse), we'll show you how these concepts look in both worlds, how they perform.</p><h2>0×01 ABS: THE LOW-HANGING BRANCH</h2><p>Absolute value is your first ticket to understanding how to cut down branches without cutting performance.</p><p>We want to calculate the absolute value of a signed integer without using a conditional branch. This is foundational — a single-bit operation can turn a branch into math.</p><pre><code>int abs_branch(int x) {
    return x &lt; 0 ? -x : x;
}

// Compiles to a `cmp` and a `jge` or `jl`, depending on compiler and optimization level.

int abs_branchless(int x) {
    int mask = x &gt;&gt; 31;
    return (x + mask) ^ mask;
}
</code></pre><h3>BRANCHLESS EXPLANATION</h3><ul><li>Arithmetic right-shift of a signed 32-bit integer by 31 yields all 0s for non-negatives, all 1s (i.e., -1) for negatives.</li><li>Adding <code>mask</code> to <code>x</code> either increments or doesn't.</li><li>XORing with <code>mask</code> flips bits only if <code>mask</code> is -1.</li></ul><h3>BONUS VARIANT</h3><pre><code>int abs_alt(int x) {
    int mask = x &gt;&gt; 31;
    return (x ^ mask) - mask;
}
</code></pre><p>Produces identical results; different taste of the same bit soup.</p><h3>ASSEMBLY BREAKDOWN</h3><pre><code>mov eax, edi       ; move x into eax
sar eax, 31        ; sign-extend right shift to produce mask
mov ecx, eax       ; duplicate mask
add edi, ecx       ; edi = x + mask
xor eax, edi       ; eax = result = (x + mask) ^ mask
</code></pre><p>Fast. No jumps. Pure ALU (arithmetic logic unit).</p><h2>0×02 CLAMP: SQUASHING RANGES WITHOUT IFS</h2><p>The clamp is more complex. You want to bound a value between a <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>.We want to ensure a value stays within <code>[min, max]</code> without branches. This is key in physics simulations, rendering, and safety constraints.</p><pre><code>int clamp(int x, int min, int max) {
    if (x &lt; min) return min;
    if (x &gt; max) return max;
    return x;
}

int clamp_branchless(int x, int min, int max) {
    int r1 = x - ((x - min) &amp; ((x - min) &gt;&gt; 31));
    return r1 - ((r1 - max) &amp; ((r1 - max) &gt;&gt; 31));
}
</code></pre><h3>BRANCHLESS EXPLANATION</h3><ul><li><code>(x - min) &gt;&gt; 31</code> creates a mask that's all 1s if <code>x &lt; min</code>.</li><li>Mask is used to select <code>min</code> when necessary.</li><li>Second line applies the same trick to limit the upper bound.</li></ul><h3>DISASSEMBLED STRATEGY</h3><pre><code>sub eax, min
sar eax, 31       ; create mask_low
and eax, (x - min)
sub x, eax        ; x = max(x, min)

sub x, max
sar ..., 31       ; create mask_high
and ..., (x - max)
sub x, ...        ; x = min(x, max)
</code></pre><p>Every operation is ALU-based. No branching, just pure logic.This removes branches by computing masks and blending values accordingly. Elegant? No. Effective? Absolutely.</p><h2>0×03 PARTITION: QUICKLY AND DIRTY</h2><p>This is where branchless logic makes the biggest splash, in algorithms that iterate over data and make conditional swaps.Partition an array around a pivot such that all elements &lt; pivot come before elements &gt;= pivot, without any conditional branching in the inner loop.</p><pre><code>void swap(int* a, int* b) {
    int temp = *a;
    *a = *b;
    *b = temp;
}

int partition(int* arr, int low, int high) {

    int i = low;
    for (int j = low; j &lt; high; j++) {

        i += arr[i] &lt; pivot;
    }
    swap(&amp;arr[i], &amp;arr[high]);
    return i;
}
</code></pre><h3>OPTIONAL BITMASK VARIANT</h3><pre><code>i += ((arr[i] - pivot) &gt;&gt; 31) &amp; 1;
</code></pre><p>Relies on arithmetic right shift and masking to conditionally increment.</p><h3>ASSEMBLY-LEVEL INSIGHT</h3><pre><code>mov eax, [arr+i*4]
cmp eax, pivot

    <p>We are in the midst of a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/25/open_source_to_closed_doors/">Ruby drama for the ages</a>. I'm sure a bunch of people figured we were all too old for this shit, but apparently we are not.</p>
<p>This debate has been eating at me ever since the news first broke, but I've tried to keep the peace by staying out of it. Unlike most discourse about what's going on, my discomfort stems less from the issue at hand—what Ruby Central did, how they did it, and how <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/strengthening-the-stewardship-of-rubygems-and-bundler/">poorly it was communicated</a>—and more to do with how one-sided the public discussion has been. Beneath the surface of this story are the consequences of a decade-old conflict that was never fully resolved. Then and now, one side—<a href="https://arko.net/">Andre Arko</a> and many people associated with him—has availed itself of public channels to voice their perspective, while the other—which includes a surprisingly wide swath of well-known Ruby and Rails contributors—has chosen to stay silent.</p>
<p>The losers in this dynamic are the vast majority normal everyday Ruby developers, most of whom are operating on very little information and who understandably feel confused and concerned. People whose livelihood depends on the health of the Ruby ecosystem deserve more information than they're getting, especially now that its operational stability has come under threat. The future of that ecosystem is once again uncertain, but—just like last time—the outcome is being shaped by a history that's been kept from the public, widening the rift between its key decision-makers and the communities they serve.</p>
<p>I don't have the answers to what's going on in 2025. A few details have been shared with me—details that would contradict fact-checks and timelines others have pieced together and published—but I can't pretend to have a clear picture of what actually happened, why no one is setting the record straight, or when we'll have clarity on what the future holds. All I can do is offer a little bit of context to explain why I'm dubious of the dominant narrative that has taken shape online. Namely, <strong>I don't believe this is a cut-and-dry case of altruistic open-source maintainers being persecuted by oppressive corporate interests.</strong></p>
<p>After you read this, perhaps your perspective will shift as well.</p>

</h2>
<p>Before anything else can make sense, it's important to understand how weird the governance of the Ruby ecosystem is. There are three moving parts involved that are ostensibly managed by three different groups, but whose members have such broadly overlapping systems access that it has now led to disputes over who owns what:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ruby itself</strong>, created by Matz and maintained by a large group of (mostly Japanese) committers, who host <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/">ruby-lang.org</a>, control the <a href="https://github.com/ruby">@ruby GitHub organization</a>, and are supported by the <a href="https://www.ruby.or.jp/en/">Ruby Association</a></li>
<li><strong>RubyGems</strong>, specifically the <code>gem</code> and <code>bundler</code> CLI tools distributed with the Ruby language, which is hosted <a href="https://github.com/rubygems">under @rubygems on GitHub</a></li>
<li><strong>RubyGems.org</strong>, the <a href="https://rubygems.org/">website, API, and host</a> from which gem dependencies are installed and which has been run by <a href="https://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a> for ages</li>
</ul>
<p>If Ruby were invented today, a single party would probably control all three of these things, but it took nearly fifteen years for today's status quo to take shape. Ruby was invented by someone in Japan in the 1990s. RubyGems was created at <a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8967">a conference in Texas</a> by a few Americans in the early 2000s. RubyGems.org only became the de facto canonical host for gems <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120220191344/http://update.gemcutter.org/2009/10/26/transition.html">six years later</a>. My impression is that at no point was communication and coordination particularly fluent between the various parties.</p>
<p>Adding to this, <a href="https://bundler.io/">Bundler</a>—a meta tool for resolving the correct versions of all of a project's gem dependencies and which quickly became vital to nearly all Ruby application development—was created independently of the above players by Yehuda Katz and Carl Lerche. Andre Arko later became the lead maintainer of Bundler, and in 2015 he founded a 501(c)(6) nonprofit called Ruby Together. In 2019, <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/releases/tag/v3.1.0">Bundler was folded into RubyGems</a>. In 2022, <a href="https://rubycentral.org/news/a-new-chapter-for-rubygems-how-ruby-central-is-building-a-sustainable-future/">Ruby Together was absorbed by Ruby Central</a>.</p>
<p>Those last two events—the merging of Bundler and the unwinding of Ruby Together—came about after years of bitter conflict and simmering discord that I hope to shed some light on below. My direct involvement with any of these events was extremely minimal, but I had contemporaneous discussions with dozens of the principals involved. I never donated to Ruby Together and have never materially contributed to Bundler or RubyGems. That said, simply being made aware of several incidents as they were playing out in private was enough to leave behind a scar that has never fully healed. I can only imagine how others are feeling right now. Based on how badly things are playing out this time, it seems they were deeply impacted, too.</p>

</h2>
<p>The earliest recollection I have of someone telling me about Andre Arko was in the summer of 2015, after getting dinner with a friend who happened to be a Ruby Together board member. The friend explained that Andre believed programmers working on open source tools deserve to earn an income that's commensurate with what salaried engineers earn at the companies who benefit from those tools. As such, Andre's goal with Ruby Together was characterized as an effort to fund development activities—initially his own, but eventually others—by paying themselves a market hourly rate. I remember being extremely sympathetic to this perspective, having also wasted countless hours of my life maintaining open source for free only for others to benefit from it. I also recall a figure like either $200 or $250 per hour being mentioned as the rate he was effectively paying himself. Whatever the rate actually was, I distinctly remember thinking, "holy shit, that's a lot higher than individual donors would probably assume."</p>
<p>The first time I remember meeting Andre in person was at <a href="https://www.rubyevents.org/events/ruby-on-ales-2016">Ruby on Ales 2016</a>. I remember trying to make a good impression, because growing my network in the community was the primary reason I spoke at conferences. I was presenting with <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/the-12-macbook-was-announced-10-years-ago/">my beloved 12-inch MacBook</a>, which meant I was traveling with the first iteration of <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW5M3AM/A/usb-c-digital-av-multiport-adapter">this cursed dongle</a>. Andre needed an adapter, so I ran up to lend him mine. As he was giving it back, I recall him making a half-joking, flippant remark about either his dongle or his computer, saying that "Ruby Together will just buy me another one." It really rubbed me the wrong way. Over the years to follow, more than one person told me stories of Andre paying for shared meals on behalf of Ruby Together without an apparent legitimate justification. They told those stories, I assume, because the attitude he exhibited made them uncomfortable. If I had donated money to Ruby Together and heard the same stories, I would have been upset.</p>
<p>For how little has been said about this publicly, a lot of different people told me a lot of concerning stories about Ruby Together over the years, often providing evidence to back it up. I'll do my best to stick to the highlights in this post. Hopefully they will explain why I have not joined the rush to defend the maintainers whose access was recently removed. What Ruby Central did was undoubtedly handled very poorly, but I don't think their bungling of its execution and communication alone is enough to answer the question of what <em>should</em> happen to the future custody and direction of Bundler, RubyGems, and RubyGems.org.</p>

</h3>
<p>When Ruby Together first launched in 2015, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425040538/http://RubyTogether.org/">website suggested donations went to pay "our team"</a>, which initially <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/rubytogether.org/blob/9a03c4c/app/views/home/team.html.erb">linked to a list of the board members</a> without any explanation of how the money was being allocated. This resulted in a nonzero number of donors believing they were funding the work of people like Steve Klabnik, Aaron Patterson, and Sarah Mei, when in fact only Andre was being paid at the time. Shortly after the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9222549">wording was raised as misleading</a>, the team page <a href="https://github.com/rubytogether/rubytogether.org/blob/0136e9f/app/views/home/team.html.erb">was updated</a> accordingly.</p>
<p>In May of 2015, Andre suggested making support for older versions of Bundler <a href="https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby/pull/385/commits/6b3f3c71f4a98309e29748132be8e84b41d890de">contingent on Heroku paying Ruby Together</a>, which was interpreted as leveraging his control over Bundler as a pay-to-play scheme. Because <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> serves other people's Ruby apps—many of which aren't updated for very long stretches—the security of their service depends on clear and predictable support windows for Ruby's core technologies, it seems reasonable they would interpret this sudden revocation of support as a pressure tactic, aimed to solicit corporate sponsorship for Ruby Together. (Years later, Andre <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/1811#issuecomment-270788204">responded to a feature request from a Heroku engineer</a>, which was interpreted at the time as indicating the feature would be withheld from Bundler because Heroku had failed to pay Ruby Together.)</p>

</h3>
<p>The minutes of a December 2016 Ruby Together board meeting were leaked. The document acknowledged who was paying for the RubyGems.org service at the time: "Fastly is comping us something like $35k worth of CDN service per month. And that's on top of Ruby Central paying for $5k of servers and Ruby Together paying for about $15k of dev work every month." The use of "us" in that sentence suggests that Ruby Together was responsible for hosting RubyGems.org, which Ruby Central later went on <a href="https://blog.rubygems.org/2017/03/15/rubygems-funding.html">to publicly dispute</a>. Additionally, one presumes the number of hours and rate paid for development work was determined by Ruby Together itself, rather than being a hard operational cost. Later in the document was a discussion of potential strategies to increase revenue after "new memberships [had] flatlined." Several ideas were discussed, culminating in a proposal to rate-limit access to RubyGems.org as the apparent best option:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rate limiting RubyGems.org seems like the option that scales most linearly with our costs. Companies that cost us money need to pay more (or stop costing us money), and companies that don't cost us money can continue to have a free ride. To be clear, this would not mean cutting off anyone's access to RubyGems.org. I'm imagining that it would work something like GitHub's model: anonymous access has a low limit, registered accounts have a higher limit, and even higher limits are available at each Ruby Together membership level. There are a lot of implementation details that would need to be worked out, but in general I feel like this is probably the most effective option to make companies feel like they are paying money for something they use and that covers our costs well.</p></blockquote>
<p>The leaked minutes were widely circulated in private at the time, due largely to outrage over the document's presupposition that Ruby Together was paying to host RubyGems.org (citing "our costs" as scaling with usage), as opposed to paying for developer effort (the costs of which do not scale with usage). The leak left myself and others worried that Andre might leverage his systems access to effectively hold the Ruby ecosystem hostage for the financial benefit of Ruby Together and—since it was compensating his own development efforts—Andre himself.</p>

</h3>
<p>In January 2017, Andre <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/pull/5308/commits/072f9ab80bb1e2d4992962e59b42d479ac37a4c0">added a "post-install message" imploring users to fund Ruby Together</a>, which would be displayed every time anyone installed Bundler. Unlike the aforementioned board meeting, this happened in the open and triggered an immediate backlash before eventually being rolled back. In one comment, Andre defended the action and <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/bundler/issues/5311#issuecomment-271477520">pointed to Shopify's failure to pay Ruby Together</a>, publicly conflating Ruby Together's sponsorship of development effort with "~$40k/mo worth of servers." But, as Ruby Together's own board minutes from the month prior directly stated, money sent to Ruby Together wasn't going to pay server expenses—server costs were covered by <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> and Ruby Central.</p>
<p>In February 2017, following protracted discussion of the post-install message and the threat of rate-limiting access to gem installs, I agreed to put my name on a letter alongside 18 others (including one of Bundler's creators). The letter requested Ruby Together stop misleading the community in this way. My understanding is that some private one-on-one communication followed, that none of it was particularly productive, and that no formal communication occurred between the two groups afterward.</p>
<p>In March 2017, Ruby Central went on the record, attempting to clear up confusion and reassure users that <a href="https://blog.rubygems.org/2017/03/15/rubygems-funding.html">they alone were in control of RubyGems.org</a>, stating that Ruby Together donations were immaterial to its continued operation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this past year has also given rise to some misunderstandings about this relationship in some quarters: chiefly, that by donating to Ruby Together, companies were paying for the operations of RubyGems. And in turn, that if enough companies didn't donate to Ruby Together, RubyGems would subsequently be in a perilous situation. This isn't so.</p>
<p>No one in the Ruby community should worry about the availability or security of RubyGems being connected in any way to the fundraising of Ruby Together. Funds raised by Ruby Together go primarily towards paying developers to add features and fix bugs. Ruby Central, on the other hand, is wholly responsible for the operations and baseline stability of the system. While these two efforts go hand-in-hand, it's vitally important to understand that they are two different things. Ruby Together's requests for donations do not mean that there is any reason for concern about RubyGems' continued existence or operation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, in August 2017, Andre <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36">accused Google Cloud Platform</a> of wholesale copying <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/gemstash">gemstash</a>'s codebase, going so far as to threaten legal action in his opening message. He juxtaposed the accusation with the complaint that Google had, "repeatedly declined to support Ruby Together." The incident appeared to fit a pattern of behavior to pair high-conflict messaging with an admonition of the target's failure to fund the organization that paid him. Ultimately, Andre's claim turned out to be factually baseless—Google <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36#issuecomment-324503159">hadn't copied gemstash's code, after all</a>.</p>

<h3 id="20182024">

</h3>
<p>Things quieted down and I didn't hear much about any of this stuff anymore. Eventually, Bundler became part of RubyGems and many folks from Ruby Together migrated to analogous roles at Ruby Central.</p>

<h3 id="2025">
    <a href="https://justin.searls.co/posts/why-im-not-rushing-to-take-sides-in-the-rubygems-fiasco/#2025">2025</a>
</h3>
<p>In August 2025, and seemingly out of nowhere, someone pointed me to the project <a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv-ruby">spinel-coop/rv-ruby</a>, an apparent fork of <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-portable-ruby">homebrew/homebrew-portable-ruby</a>. I say "apparent", because rather than using <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo">GitHub's fork button</a>—which would have maintained clear attribution of who created the upstream project—it looks like it was instead cloned and re-pushed by Andre. Specifically, I was sent <a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv-ruby/commit/2234bdb7db4e41bfe883a01f06d7d0aff3188997">this commit replacing references to Homebrew</a> from late July. As evidence of Homebrew's authorship was being erased and obscured, no additional acknowledgement was added to credit Homebrew for having created and maintained Portable Ruby since 2016.</p>
<p>It immediately reminded me of Andre's <a href="https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-gemserver/issues/36">baseless accusation against Google</a>. "Not only did you not credit the Gemstash project in any way," Andre wrote, "from an ethical standpoint, this is also super gross." His blatant copying of Portable Ruby (a project significant enough that the lead maintainer <a href="https://rubykaigi.org/2019/presentations/MikeMcQuaid.html">gave a talk about how they did it</a>) struck me as brazenly hypocritical, given Andre's previous litigious and mistaken accusation against Google.</p>
<p>In fairness to Andre, the rv-ruby repo continues to retain a <a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv-ruby/blob/main/LICENSE.txt">copy of</a> Homebrew's <a href="https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-portable-ruby/blob/HEAD/LICENSE.txt">LICENSE.txt</a> which names "Homebrew contributors" as the copyright holder. Andre also later <a href="https://github.com/spinel-coop/rv-ruby/commit/76e96c9d9f74ea89eed9d34ff11491bb6c365d54">added an explicit acknowledgement to the README</a>, but that attribution came more than a month later, and (I'm told) only after he was directly asked to credit the original project.</p>
<p><a href="https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/">Andre wrote this week</a> that, "Ruby Together did not ever, at any point, demand any form of governance or control over the existing open source projects. Maintainers did their thing in the RubyGems and Bundler GitHub orgs, while Ruby Together staff and board members did their thing in the rubytogether GitHub org." However, while he was leading Ruby Together, he moved to <a href="https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1518">restrict committer access to RubyGems in rubygems/rubygems</a>, unilaterally <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler/commit/524add155d6b90c679db21b03f0bd9f877f21ab0">erased the original authorship from Bundler's gemspec in bundler/bundler</a>, and oversaw a number of <a href="https://github.com/bundler/bundler-site/commit/03d331ac8a0a05a5b4225319fb3783a8d1eb1c9b#diff-efb5113d13615a3e1c5706cd6f316ee73f5db628f8c5c06b450a51e537cf9ec6">contributors being removed from bundler/bundler-site</a> in a redesign of Bundler's website.</p>
<p>As a result of this broader historical context and in spite of the serious claims and grave implications being thrown around this month, I'm trying my best <strong>not to rush to judgment about who's at fault in the current conflict and would urge others to do the same</strong>. The future of the Ruby ecosystem may depend on it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>If you ever watch someone “coding”, you might see them spending far more time staring
into space than typing on their keyboard. No, they (probably) aren’t slacking off.
Software development is fundamentally a practice of problem-solving, and so, as with
solving a tricky crossword, most of the work is done in your head.</p>
<p>In the software development lifecycle, coding is the letters filled into the crossword,
only a small amount of effort compared to all the head scratching and scribbled notes.
The real work
usually happens alongside coding, as the developer learns the domain, narrows down
requirements, maps out relevant abstractions, considers side effects, tests features
incrementally, and finally squashes bugs that survived this rigorous process. It looks
something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-1.svg" alt="Thinking, then coding." title="Thinking, then coding."></p>
<p>But with AI-driven coding, things play out very differently.</p>
<h2>“Code first, ask questions later”</h2>
<p>AI coding agents such as <a href="https://claude.com/product/claude-code">Claude Code</a> are
making it astonishingly fast to write code in isolation. But most software lives within
complex systems, and since LLMs can't yet hold the full context
of an application in memory at once, human review, testing, and integration needs will
remain. And that is a lot harder when the code has been written without the human thinking
about it. As a result, for complex software, much of the time will be spent on post hoc
understanding of what code the AI has written.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-2.svg" alt="Coding, then trying to understand." title="Coding, then trying to understand."></p>
<p>This is the root of the difference between marketing copy that boasts of the paradigm
shifting speed of <strong>writing code</strong> with AI (often framed as
“<a href="https://docs.coderabbit.ai/overview/introduction">10X</a>
<a href="https://zencoder.ai/product/coding-agent">faster</a>”), and the marginal productivity gains
in <strong>delivering working software</strong> seen in the wild (usually
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/22158-allpay-github-copilot">closer to 10%</a>).</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-3.svg" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip"></p>
<p>An even more dispiriting upshot of this is that, as developers, we spend an ever greater
proportion of our time merely fixing up the output of these wondrous
<a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2024/12/24/llms-are-scrappy-innovators">babbling machines</a>. While the LLMs get to
blast through all the fun, easy work at lightning speed, we are then left with all the
thankless tasks: testing to ensure existing functionality isn’t broken, clearing out
duplicated code, writing documentation, handling deployment and infrastructure, etc.
Very little time is actually dedicated to the thing that developers actually love doing: coding.</p>
<p>Fortunately, help is at hand. While LLMs are shaking up how software development is
performed, this issue in itself is not actually new. In fact, it is merely a stark example
of an age-old problem, which I call:</p>
<h2>The tech lead’s dilemma</h2>
<p>As engineers progress in their careers, they will eventually
step into the role of <strong>tech lead</strong>. They might be <strong>managing</strong> a team,
or they could be a <strong>principal engineer</strong>, driving technical delivery without the
people management. In either case, they are responsible for the team’s technical
delivery. They are also usually the most experienced developer in the team: either in their career,
in the specialised domain of the team, or in both.</p>
<p>Software delivery is a team effort, but one in which experience can have a highly imbalancing
effect on individual contribution
<a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2023/11/10/software-engineering-mechanics">velocity</a>. As such, when the tech lead’s
primary job is to maximise delivery, they will often face an internal conflict between two
ways to deliver software:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fair delegation</strong> across the team, maximising learning and ownership opportunities for
junior team members, but allowing delivery to be bottlenecked by the speed of the least productive
team members.</li>
<li><strong>Mollycoddling</strong> the team, by delegating only the easy or non-critical work to juniors,
and keeping the hardest work for themselves, as the person on the team most capable of
delivering at speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, while we shall see that mollycoddling is extremely harmful to long-term team
health, it is also often a very effective way to accelerate delivery. The higher bandwidth of
the tech lead is often most efficiently deployed by eating up all the hardest work:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-4.svg" alt="Senior engineers have higher bandwidth." title="Senior engineers have higher bandwidth."></p>
<p>As such, I have seen this pattern repeated time and again over the course of my career. And,
of course, it comes at a cost. Siloing of experience in the tech lead makes the team brittle,
it makes support harder, and it places ever greater pressure on the tech lead as a single point
of failure. What follows next is predictable: burnout, departure, and ensuing crisis as the
team struggles to survive without the one person who really knows how everything works.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-5.svg" alt="Mollycoddling leads to short term gains but eventual failure." title="Mollycoddling leads to short term gains but eventual failure."></p>
<p>As is usually the case, the solution lies in a third way that avoids these two extremes
and balances delivery with team growth. We might frame it as something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Implement team practices that allow engineers to deliver working code within a framework
that minimises rework, maximises effective collaboration, and promotes personal growth and
learning.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I was CTO of Datasine, we enshrined this attitude in a simple tech team motto:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Learn. Deliver. Have fun.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good tech leads expose their engineers to work at the limit of their capabilities,
using processes and practices that minimise delivery risk while also enabling each team
member to grow their skills, knowledge, and domain expertise. This is, in fact, the essence
of good technical leadership.</p>
<p>There are many ways to accomplish it, from strict codified frameworks such as the
<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html">Extreme Programming rules</a>, through
to looser sets of principles which we might broadly refer to as “best practices”:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code reviews</li>
<li>Incremental delivery</li>
<li><a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/01/24/modular-software-design">Modular design</a></li>
<li>Test-driven development</li>
<li>Pair programming</li>
<li>Quality documentation</li>
<li>Continuous integration</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for experienced engineers today, an urgent question is: how can we translate these practices
into a world of AI-driven coding?</p>
<h2>LLMs are lightning fast junior engineers</h2>
<p>In 2025, many engineers are finding themselves for the first time in a position familiar
to every tech lead: overseeing a brilliant but unpredictable junior engineer. Harnessing
and controlling such talent, in a way that benefits effective team collaboration, is one
of the primary challenges of engineering leadership. But AI coding agents need different
management to junior engineers, because the nature of their productivity and growth is
fundamentally different.</p>
<p>As software engineers gain experience, we tend to improve our productivity in multiple
ways at the same time: writing more robust code, using better abstractions, spending less
time writing and fixing bugs, understanding more complex architectures, covering edge
cases more effectively, spotting repeated patterns earlier, etc. Engineering is a rich
and complex discipline with many avenues for specialisation, but for simplicity we might
group these dimensions into two broad themes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quality</strong>: ability to deliver more complex, more performant, more maintainable code</li>
<li><strong>Velocity</strong>: ability to develop working, bug-free code in a shorter space of time</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, good engineers will improve in both axes.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-6.svg" alt="Engineers and LLMs improve in both velocity and quality." title="Engineers and LLMs improve in both velocity and quality."></p>
<p>Early LLMs were fast to write code, but time spent fixing bugs and removing hallucinations
meant they were slow to complete bug-free code. Over time, smarter LLMs and better use of
context engineering and tools have meant that modern AI coding agents are much better at
“one shot” writing of code. The current generation of commercially available agents can be
incredibly fast at producing working code for problems that would challenge some mid-level
engineers, though they cannot yet match the expertise of senior engineers:</p>
<p>So we can think of the current generation of AI coding agents as junior engineers, albeit
with two fundamental differences:</p>
<ol>
<li>LLMs deliver code much, much faster than junior engineers, constrained neither by thinking
nor writing time;</li>
<li>LLMs have no true capacity to learn, and instead only improve through more effective
<a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/08/03/context-engineering">context engineering</a> or
the arrival of new foundation models.</li>
</ol>
<p>As with junior engineering talent, there are broadly two ways that you can deploy them, depending on
whether your focus is long-term or short-term:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AI-driven engineering</strong>: employing best practices, foregrounding human
understanding of the code, moving slowly to make development sustainable.</li>
<li><strong>Vibe coding</strong>: throwing caution to the wind and implementing at speed, sacrificing
understanding for delivery velocity, hitting an eventual wall of unsalvageable, messy code.</li>
</ul>
<p>As might be expected, the long-term trajectories of choosing between these two approaches
follow much the same pattern as choosing between parallel delegation and mollycoddling of a
junior team:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-7.svg" alt="Vibe coding has the exact same failure state as mollycoddling." title="Vibe coding has the exact same failure state as mollycoddling."></p>
<p>This is why the <a href="https://chrisloy.dev/post/2025/09/07/vibe-coding-art">vibe coding</a> approach
is great for tiny projects or throwaway prototypes: applications of sufficient simplicity
can be delivered without the need for any human thinking at all. By limiting the complexity
of our projects and leaning into the capabilities of the tools, we can deliver end-to-end
working software in no time at all.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-8.svg" alt="Vibe coding is great as long as you don't need to think." title="Vibe coding is great as long as you don't need to think."></p>
<p>But you <em>will</em> hit a wall of complexity that AI is incapable of scaling alone.</p>
<p>Building prototypes is now easier than ever. But if we want to effectively use LLMs to
accelerate delivery of real, complex, secure, working software, and to realise more than
marginal efficiency gains, we need to write a new playbook of engineering practices tailored
to maximise collaboration between engineering teams that include both humans and LLMs.</p>
<h2>How to avoid the AI coding trap</h2>
<p>AI coding agents are dazzlingly productive, but lack in-depth knowledge of your business,
codebase, or roadmap. Left unchecked, they will happily churn
out thousands of lines of code with no heed paid to design, consistency, or maintainability.
The job of the engineer, then, is to act as a tech lead to these hotshots: to provide the structure,
standards, and processes that convert raw speed into sustainable delivery.</p>
<p>We need a new playbook for how to deliver working software efficiently, and we can look to the
past to learn how to do that. By treating LLMs as <strong>lightning-fast junior engineers</strong>, we
can lean on best practices from the software development lifecycle to build systems that scale.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisloy.dev/images/2025/ai-coding-9.svg" alt="AI can be used at every stage of the software development lifecycle." title="AI can be used at every stage of the software development lifecycle."></p>
<p>Just as tech leads don't just write code but set practices for the team, engineers
now need to set practices for AI agents. That means bringing AI into every stage of
the lifecycle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Specification</strong>: exploring, analysing, and refining feature specifications to cover edge cases and narrow focus.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: generating and reviewing documentation up front to provide reusable guardrails and lasting evidence.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Modular Design</strong>: scaffolding modular architectures to control context scope and maximise comprehension.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test-Driven Development</strong>: generating extensive test cases prior to implementation to guide implementation and prevent regression.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Coding Standards</strong>: applying house styles and best practice when generating code, through context engineering.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Monitoring &amp; Introspection</strong>: analysing logs and extracting insights faster than any human ever could.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By understanding that delivering software is so much more than just writing code, we can
avoid the AI coding trap and instead hugely amplify our ability to deliver working, scalable software.</p></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PostgreSQL 18 was officially released on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-18-released-3142/">September 25, 2025</a>. No doubt the most consequential change is the new Asynchronous I/O (AIO) subsystem. However, this post focuses on the features that will impact developers in their day-to-day work, starting with native UUID v7 support.</p>
<h2 id="native-uuid-v7-support"><span>Native UUID v7 Support</span><a href="#native-uuid-v7-support"><span>#</span></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Commit: <a href="https://postgr.es/c/78c5e141e">78c5e141e</a></li>
<li>Docs: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/datatype-uuid.html">https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/datatype-uuid.html</a></li>
</ul>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 introduces the <code>uuidv7()</code> function for generating UUID version 7 values. This native support almost closes the long-standing debate about whether to use <code>SERIAL/IDENTITY</code> types or UUIDs as primary keys. UUIDv7 combines the best of both worlds: the global uniqueness of UUIDs with the sequential nature that makes serial keys perform well.</p>
<figure><pre><code><span>-- Generate a UUIDv7</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>SELECT</span><span> uuidv7</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span>
</span>
<span></span><span>-- Create a table using UUIDv7 as primary key</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Previously, while PostgreSQL extensions could generate UUIDv7, the most widely used <code>uuid-ossp</code> extension doesn't implement v7. Lesser-known extensions that do support v7 aren't typically packaged with PostgreSQL distributions, especially on cloud providers. This meant developers wanting UUIDv7 had to implement generation logic in their applications. Native support removes this friction entirely.</p>

<p>Generated columns were first introduced in PostgreSQL 12, but only with the <code>STORED</code> option, which means the generated column is stored on write and occupies disk space. Adding a <code>STORED</code> generated column will rewrite the entire table.</p>
<p>PostgreSQL 18 introduces the <code>VIRTUAL</code> option and makes it the default behavior for generated columns. These columns compute their values when read rather than when written. This is a more common approach, and making it the default aligns PostgreSQL with other major databases.</p>

<p>Virtual column advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Space Saving</strong>: For derived data that doesn't need physical storage, virtual columns eliminate redundant disk usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dynamic Computation</strong>: Some computations benefit from being executed at query time, especially when they depend on current system state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand, <code>STORED</code> generated columns remain valuable for heavy computations that rarely change, where the performance cost of repeated calculation outweighs storage concerns.</p>
<p>However, there are certain limitations as mentioned in the commit. The most noticeable one is that you cannot create indexes on <code>VIRTUAL</code> generated columns.</p>
<p>BTW, PostgreSQL 18 also adds support for generated columns in logical replication (<a href="https://postgr.es/c/745217a05">commit</a>, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/18/logical-replication-gencols.html">docs</a>). This feature is only available to <code>STORED</code> generated columns as well.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL 18 introduces the <code>pg_get_acl()</code> function for programmatically retrieving Access Control Lists (ACLs) for database objects. If you've ever spent time debugging the infamous <code>ERROR 42501: permission denied</code> messages, you'll appreciate having a unified way to inspect object privileges.</p>
<p>Previously, troubleshooting permissions required querying different system catalogs (<code>pg_class</code>, <code>pg_proc</code>, <code>pg_namespace</code>, <code>pg_attribute</code>) depending on the object type, each with their own ACL format.</p>
<p>The <code>pg_get_acl()</code> function provides a unified interface for retrieving ACLs from any database object, eliminating the need to remember which catalog to query for different object types.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple paid a multimillion dollar settlement to an Oregon woman after repair techs the company had contracted published nude photos of her from her phone on her Facebook. As first reported by <i><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2021/06/06/apple-pays-millions-woman-explicit-photos-posted-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>The Telegraph</span></a></i>, the unidentified woman sent her iPhone to Apple for repairs in 2016. According to court documents reviewed by Motherboard, two repair techs then posted “10 photos of her in various stages of undress and a sex video” to her personal Facebook page. The case highlights the personal nature of our devices and the need for Apple to relinquish its repair monopoly and let us repair our own stuff.</p>


<p>According to court records, the woman found out this happened when one of her friends reached out to say her nudes had been uploaded to Facebook. She pulled them down and threatened to sue Apple for invasion of privacy and emotional distress. In this case, the people who uploaded the photos and video worked for a company called Pegatron, which is a company Apple works with to do repairs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For years, Apple has been arguing to legislators that it needs to tightly control who is able to do repairs on iPhones and other Apple products. One of the core arguments it makes is that allowing “unauthorized” repair companies to fix iPhones will lead to privacy violations and will cause security problems. This case shows how, even when Apple tightly controls its repair infrastructure, it cannot prevent disastrous cases like this from happening. In a world where repair is a free and open marketplace, consumers can choose to take their phone to someone who they trust, or can decide to repair their phone themselves. In the current world we live in, you often have to take your phone to Apple; your phone then goes to a giant repair facility somewhere. The phone is essentially entering a black hole.&nbsp;</p>


<p>The only reason we know about this case is because of a dispute between Apple, Pegatron, and the AGLIC American Insurance Company. Apple and other large corporations pay for something called indemnity insurance. The basic idea is that when the big company screws up and has to pay a judgement in a case like this, the insurance reimburses them. In the lawsuit, Apple is named as a “customer” of Pegatron, but is not a party to the lawsuit. Apple fought (and succeeded) at filing details of the case under seal. Many of the documents remain sealed by the court.</p>



<p>Apple paid the multimillion dollar settlement, Pegatron reimbursed them, and then the insurance company refused to pay out the indemnity claim. The exact amount of the settlement isn’t known, but court records obtained by Motherboard discuss two transactions in dispute—one for $4.25 million and another for $1.7 million.</p>


<p>This isn’t the first time an Apple employee or contractor has sorted through a customer’s photo gallery and shared their nudes. It happens all the time. In 2019 an Apple genius <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/11/12/an-apple-store-employee-helped-customerby-texting-himself-private-photo-her-phone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>texted himself</span></a> a personal photograph of a customer who’d come in looking for help with her phone. In 2016, Apple fired a group of employees in Australia after uncovering evidence the group had set up a website to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/10/12/apple-australia-photo-sharing-ring-nsfw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>share customer’s</span></a> photographs.</p>



<p>Our devices are extremely personal. They hold an incredible amount of information about us, from personal emails, to explicit photographs, private communications, and financial information.&nbsp;</p>


<p>Companies like Apple intentionally manufacture devices to be repairable only by authorized companies. They often require special tools to diagnose and fix problems, which aren’t shared with the public or third-party repair shops. Apple and other companies have taken <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/topic/right-to-repair" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>extraordinary steps</span></a> to make sure people can’t repair their own devices, and even claim it’s unsafe for us to do so.</p>



<p>“Apple has been opposing Right to Repair bills by claiming that their service network is the only safe repair option for consumers,” Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, told Motherboard. “But the only person that is totally guaranteed to be trustworthy to fix your iPhone is you. Any time you hand your data to another entity, you risk something like this. By withholding access to service tools and forcing customers to use their third party contractor, Apple is willfully compromising the security of their customers.”</p>

<p>Laws enshrining the right-to-repair would fix these issues and pave the way for people to fix their own stuff. States <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqk38/the-right-to-repair-movement-is-poised-to-explode-in-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>across the country</span></a> are considering legislation that would give people the power to fix their own stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apple did not immediately respond to Motherboard’s request for comment.</p><!-- AI CONTENT END 1 -->

<p>Sagan explains that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science" title="Science">science</a> is not just a body of knowledge, but is a way of thinking.

<div><h3 id="Dragon_in_my_garage"><span id="Dragon_in_the_garage"></span>Dragon in my garage</h3><p><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Demon-Haunted_World&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Dragon in my garage"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></p></div>

<p>As an example of skeptical thinking, Sagan offers a story concerning a fire-breathing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" title="Dragon">dragon</a> who lives in his garage. When he persuades a rational, open-minded visitor to meet the dragon, the visitor remarks that they are unable to see the creature. Sagan replies that he "neglected to mention that she's an invisible dragon". The visitor suggests spreading flour on the floor so that the creature's footprints might be seen, which Sagan says is a good idea, "but this dragon floats in the air". When the visitor considers using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_camera" title="Infrared camera">infrared camera</a> to view the creature's invisible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a>, Sagan explains that her fire is heatless. He continues to counter every proposed physical test with a reason why the test will not work.
</p><p>Sagan concludes by asking: "Now what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists? Your inability to invalidate my hypothesis is not at all the same thing as proving it true."
</p><p>Continuing with concepts relevant to the 'dragon in my garage' story, Sagan writes about a patient of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack" title="John E. Mack">John Mack</a> who claimed to have scars on her body which were from encounters with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraterrestrial_life" title="Extraterrestrial life">aliens</a>. Sagan writes that if the patient is asked what her scars look like, she is unable to show them because, unfortunately, they are located in the private areas of her body.

<div><h3 id="Baloney_detection_kit">Baloney detection kit</h3><p><span><span>[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Demon-Haunted_World&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3" title="Edit section: Baloney detection kit"><span>edit</span></a><span>]</span></span></p></div>
<p>Sagan presents a set of tools for skeptical thinking that he calls the "baloney detection kit".<sup id="cite_ref-Palmer_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Palmer-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup><sup><span title="Page / location: 210">: 210 </span></sup><sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Skeptical thinking consists both of constructing a reasoned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument" title="Argument">argument</a> and recognizing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy" title="Fallacy">fallacious</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraudulent" title="Fraudulent">fraudulent</a> one. In order to identify a fallacious argument, Sagan suggests employing such tools as independent confirmation of facts, debate, development of different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypotheses" title="Hypotheses">hypotheses</a>, quantification, the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>, and the possibility of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability" title="Falsifiability">falsification</a>. Sagan's "baloney detection kit" also provides tools for detecting "the most common fallacies of logic and rhetoric", such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority" title="Argument from authority">argument from authority</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasty_generalization" title="Hasty generalization">statistics of small numbers</a>. Through these tools, Sagan argues the benefits of a critical mind and the self-correcting nature of science can take place.
</p><p>Sagan provides nine tools as the first part of this kit.
</p>
<ol><li>There must be independent confirmation of the facts given when possible.</li>
<li>Encourage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate" title="Debate">debate</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence" title="Evidence">evidence</a> from all points of view.</li>
<li>Realize that an argument from authority is not always reliable. Sagan supports this by telling us that "authorities" have made mistakes in the past and they will again in the future.</li>
<li>Consider more than one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a>. Sagan adds to this by telling us that we must think of the argument from all angles and think all the ways it can be explained or disproved. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> that then still hasn't been disproved has a much higher chance of being correct.</li>
<li>Try to avoid clinging obdurately to your own hypothesis and so become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias" title="Bias">biased</a>. Sagan tells us to compare our own hypothesis with others to see if we can find reasons to reject our own hypothesis.</li>
<li>Quantify. Sagan tells us that if whatever we are trying to explain has numerical value or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_data" title="Numerical data">quantitative</a> data related to it, then we'll be much more able to compete against other hypotheses.</li>
<li>If there is a chain of argument, every link in that chain must be correct.</li>
<li>The use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor" title="Occam's razor">Occam's razor</a>, which says to choose the hypothesis that is simpler and requires the fewest assumptions.</li>
<li>Ask if a given hypothesis can be falsified. Sagan tells us that if a hypothesis cannot be tested or falsified then it is not worth considering.</li></ol>
<p>Sagan suggests that with the use of this "baloney detection kit" it is easier to critically think and find the truth.
</p>

<p>There is a second part to the kit. This consists of twenty <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_fallacies" title="Logical fallacies">logical fallacies</a> that one must not commit when offering up a new claim.
</p>
<ol><li><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem" title="Ad hominem">Ad hominem</a></i>. An arguer attacks the opposing arguer and not the actual argument.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_ignorance" title="Appeal to ignorance">Appeal to ignorance</a>. One argues a claim in that whatever has not been proved false must be true, and vice versa.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading" title="Special pleading">Special pleading</a>. An arguer responds to a deeply complex or rhetorical question or statement by, usually, saying "oh you don't understand how so and so works."</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question" title="Begging the question">Begging the question</a>. An arguer assumes the answer and makes a claim such as, this happened because of that, or, this needs to happen in order for that to happen.</li>

<li>Misunderstanding of the nature of statistics. Someone misinterprets statistics given to them.</li>
<li>Fallacy of inconsistency. An arguer is very inconsistent in their claims.</li>
<li><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non_sequitur_(fallacy)" title="Non sequitur (fallacy)">Non sequitur</a></i>. This is Latin for "it doesn't follow". A claim is made that doesn't make much sense, such as "Our nation will prevail because God is great."</li>
<li><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc" title="Post hoc ergo propter hoc">Post hoc ergo propter hoc</a></i>. Latin for "it happened after, so it was caused by". An arguer claims that something happened because of a past event when really it probably didn't.</li>
<li>Meaningless question. Someone asks a question that has no real meaning or doesn't add to the argument at all.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excluded_middle" title="Excluded middle">excluded middle</a>. An arguer only considers or mentions the two opposite extremes of the conversation and excludes the aspects in between the two extremes.</li>

</p><p>In a 2020 interview for <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeptical_Inquirer" title="Skeptical Inquirer">Skeptical Inquirer</a></i>, when Sagan's wife <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Druyan" title="Ann Druyan">Ann Druyan</a> was asked about the origin of the phrase "baloney detection kit", she said that
</p>
<blockquote><p>It didn't really come from Carl. It actually came from a friend of mine named Arthur Felberbaum who died about forty years ago. He and Carl and I once sat down for dinner together. His politics were very left wing, so Carl and Arthur and I were trying to find common ground so that we could have a really good dinner together. And at one point, Arthur said, "Carl, it's just that I dream that every one of us would have a baloney detection kit in our head." And that's where that idea came from.<sup id="cite_ref-Palmer_3-1"><a href="#cite_note-Palmer-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p></blockquote>

<p>Sagan indicates that science can be misused. Thus, he is highly critical of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller" title="Edward Teller">Edward Teller</a>, the "father of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bomb" title="Hydrogen bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>", and Teller's influence on politics, and contrasts his stance to that of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Pauling" title="Linus Pauling">Linus Pauling</a> and other scientists who took moral positions.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (July 2017)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>Sagan also discusses the misuse of science in representation. He relates to the depiction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_scientist" title="Mad scientist">mad scientist</a> character in children's TV shows and is critical of this occurrence. Sagan suggests an addition of scientific television programs, many of which would take a look at believed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoaxes" title="Hoaxes">hoaxes</a> of the past and encourage viewers to engage in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_thinking" title="Critical thinking">critical thinking</a> to better represent science on popular <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television" title="Television">television</a>.

<p>Sagan indicates that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapists" title="Therapists">therapists</a> can contribute to the growth of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience" title="Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a> or the infusion of "false stories". He is critical of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_E._Mack" title="John E. Mack">John Mack</a> and his support of  abduction cases, which were represented in his patients.
</p><p>Sagan writes about the story of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurston_County_ritual_abuse_case" title="Thurston County ritual abuse case">Paul Ingram</a>. Ingram's daughter reported that her father had sexually abused her. He was told that "sex offenders often <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repressed_memory" title="Repressed memory">repressed</a> memories of their crimes."<sup id="cite_ref-Sagan,_Carl_1997_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sagan,_Carl_1997-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Ingram was eventually able to have a foggy visualization of the claimed events, and he suggested that perhaps "a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon" title="Demon">demon</a> might be responsible."<sup id="cite_ref-Sagan,_Carl_1997_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-Sagan,_Carl_1997-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> Sagan describes how once Ingram started remembering events, so did several other individuals and family members. A "memory recovery" technique was performed on Ingram, and he confessed to the crimes. A medical examination was done on his daughter, where none of the scars she described were actually found. Sagan writes that Ingram later tried to plead innocence once "away from his daughters, his police colleagues, and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastor" title="Pastor">pastor</a>."<sup id="cite_ref-Sagan,_Carl_1997_6-2"><a href="#cite_note-Sagan,_Carl_1997-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax" title="Hoax">Hoaxes</a> have played a valuable role in the history of science by revealing the flaws in our thinking and helping us advance our critical thinking skills. One of Sagan's examples is the "Carlos hoax" by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Randi" title="James Randi">James Randi</a> that revealed flaws in reporting by news media. Carlos was described as an ancient spirit that supposedly possessed José Alvarez and provided Alvarez with advanced knowledge about the universe. Many news outlets assumed this was true and reported it as such, which spread misinformation.

The <i>Smithsonian</i> article by Paul Trachtman argues that Sagan relates issues of government choices and declining scientific thinking skills to pseudoscience topics like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrology" title="Astrology">astrology</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_healing" title="Faith healing">faith healing</a> but ignores other issues that may be causing governmental bodies and other individuals to turn away from science. One such issue is consequences of pouring governmental money into cancer research. Trachtman writes, "it is not because of such beliefs that Congress now approaches the NIH budget with an ax. In fact, billions of dollars spent on years of research in the war on cancer have spawned growing professional bureaucracies and diminishing medical benefits." Trachtman argues that Sagan does not include problems like growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureaucracies" title="Bureaucracies">bureaucracies</a> and diminishing medical benefits as reasons for a lack of scientific attention.<sup id="cite_ref-smithsonianmag.com_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-smithsonianmag.com-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> In his review for <i>The</i> <i>New York Times,</i> James Gorman also argues for an unaddressed issue in Sagan's book, saying Sagan fails to emphasize the idea that scientists should take a more active role in teaching science to the public, while he does mention the failures of the education system to do so.<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup>

Per the <i>New York Review</i> article, "when it comes to the Supreme Extraterrestrial he is rather circumspect."<sup id="cite_ref-nybooks.com_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-nybooks.com-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The <i>Smithsonian</i> article suggests Sagan was very clear about his religious beliefs in the book, for he "splits his universe in two, into science and irrationality." The <i>Smithsonian</i> goes on to say that Sagan's defined religious views fall within the area of an untestable claim, a type of claim he argues against in <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-smithsonianmag.com_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-smithsonianmag.com-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>Lewontin's review also claims that Sagan includes something in <i>The Demon-Haunted World</i> which he also is arguing against in that same text. The article mentions how Sagan discusses a natural predisposition people have towards science; but, the article says, "He does not tell us how he used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" title="Scientific method">scientific method</a> to discover the "embedded" human proclivity for science."<sup id="cite_ref-nybooks.com_14-1"><a href="#cite_note-nybooks.com-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Sagan heavily discusses the importance of using the scientific method in his book, and this article claims he strays away from his own message by not including a description of his use of the scientific method on this topic.
</p><p>A review by Lee Dembart in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times" title="Los Angeles Times">Los Angeles Times</a></i> was positive. It described Sagan's book as "a manifesto for clear thought", with the main issue being the length of eight chapters.<sup id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> Gorman's review in <i>The New York Times</i> also criticised the length of the book.<sup id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup>
</p><p>The book has received a number of retrospective reviews. An article in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian" title="The Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>, 2012, described the book as somewhat dated, though still insightful.<sup id="cite_ref-17"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Another article from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Verge" title="The Verge">The Verge</a></i> in 2017 noted that a quote from the book regarding Sagan's pessimistic prediction for a future America had gone viral on Twitter, which the article described as "chillingly prescient". The article praised the book, stating that Sagan "practiced the scientific skepticism and thinking that he preached, and that's what helped him accurately analyze the trends of his time and forecast their eventual outcomes in ours.".<sup id="cite_ref-18"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Last month I have been on a multi-day hike with my dad. Each of us took
many pictures, and when we came back we put them all in a shared folder.
We both have Android phones, and the naming scheme used for our pictures
was the same: <code>IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss</code> followed maybe by some other numbers
and then a <code>.jpg</code>. Here <code>YYYY</code> stands for the year, <code>MM</code> for month and
so on, so that sorting the pictures in alphabetical order is the same as
sorting them by date.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. Strangely, when I looked at the files from my dad’s
Windows PC, they were not sorted correctly: all the pictures took
with my phone came first, followed by all the pictures took by him.
I thought this was surely some weird Microsoft bug - after using
Windows 11 at work for a while, I would not be surprised if you
told me their file explorer can’t figure out how to sort strings.</p>
<p>But then I looked at the same files in a shared Google Drive folder,
and again they were in the wrong order:</p>
<p><img src="https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-09-28-alphabetic-order/drive.png" alt="Screenshot from Google Drive"></p>
<p>As you can see, the picture taken at 5:54 (with my dad’s phone) comes
before the one taken at 9:20 (also with my dad’s phone), but after the
one taken at 12:11 (with my phone).</p>
<p>Weird. Well, maybe Microsoft <em>and</em> Google got this wrong. But
that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>Indeed, KDE’s Dolphin file manager does the same thing:</p>
<p><img src="https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-09-28-alphabetic-order/dolphin.png" alt="Screenshot from Dolphin"></p>
<p>I’ll spare you the screenshots, but Gnome and both the file managers
that I have on my phone also get the alphabetical order wrong.</p>
<p>At this point I thought that maybe one of the two phones is using some
weird alternative unicode character instead of the underscore <code>_</code>. Really,
I could not see any other explanation. But nope, this is not it, because
the good old <code>ls</code> sorts my files correctly:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l

total 218572
-rw-r--r-- 1 seba seba 1866185 Aug 28 18:51 IMG_20250820_055436307.jpg

-rw-r--r-- 1 seba seba  965353 Aug 20 10:39 IMG_20250820_103903_811.jpg
(and so on)
</code></pre>
<p>This was consistent among the couple of Linux distros I use, as well
as my OpenBSD server. On the one hand this is good: not <em>every</em> single
piece of software fucks up something as basic as string sorting. On the
other hand, this makes it harder to debug what the fuck is going on with
all the other file managers.</p>
<p>It took me more than a month to figure this one out. Tell me, which
file do you think comes first in alphabetical order, <code>file-9.txt</code> or
<code>file-10.txt</code>?</p>
<p>Of course, the user who named those files probably wants <code>file-9.txt</code> to
come before <code>file-10.txt</code>. But <code>1</code> is smaller than <code>9</code>, so <code>file-10.txt</code>
should be first in alphabetical order. Everyone understands that, and
soon people learn to put enough leading zeros if they want their files
to stay sorted the way they like.</p>
<p>Well, apparently all these operating systems have decided that no,
users are too dumb and they cannot possibly understand what alphabetical
order means.  So when you ask them to sort your files alphabetically,
they don’t. Instead, they decide that if some piece of the file name is
a number, the real numerical value must be used.</p>
<p>I don’t know when this became the norm, to be honest I have not used a
normal graphical file manager in a long time.</p>
<p><em>I know you asked for the files to be sorted in alphabetical order,
but you don’t want <code>file-10.txt</code> to come before <code>file-9.txt</code>, do
you? No, I know you don’t. I am not even going to ask you, your
mushy human brain is too small to comprehend the intricacies of
such a question. I’ll spare you the thinking.</em></p>
<p>So it turns out that my dad’s phone wrote the milliseconds in the file
name right after the seconds, while mine added an extra underscore to
separate them from the seconds.  Which in my mind it should not have
mattered, because alphabetically they should still have been sorted
correctly to the second. But with this “modern” interpretation of the
alphabetical order, the files without the extra separator in the name had
a much higher number, so they come last.</p>
<p>Now that I know what the issue is, I can solve it by renaming the files
with a consistent scheme. I have also found a setting to fix Dolphin’s
behavior, but it was very much buried into its many configuration
options. And I would rather not have to change this setting in every
application I use, assuming they even allow it.</p>
<p>I miss the time when computers did what you told them to, instead of
trying to read your mind.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="faq-body">
    
      <h3 id="What-is-Privacy-Badger">
        <a href="#What-is-Privacy-Badger">What is Privacy Badger?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Privacy Badger is a browser extension that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.  If an advertiser seems to be tracking you across multiple websites without your permission, Privacy Badger automatically blocks that advertiser from loading any more content in your browser.  To the advertiser, it’s like you suddenly disappeared.</p>

    
      <h3 id="How-is-Privacy-Badger-different-from-Disconnect,-Adblock-Plus,-Ghostery,-and-other-blocking-extensions">
        <a href="#How-is-Privacy-Badger-different-from-Disconnect%2c-Adblock-Plus%2c-Ghostery%2c-and-other-blocking-extensions">How is Privacy Badger different from other blocking extensions?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Privacy Badger was born out of our desire to be able to recommend a single extension that would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically analyze and block any tracker or ad that violated the principle of user consent</li>
<li>Function well without any settings, knowledge, or configuration by the user</li>
<li>Use algorithmic methods to decide what is and isn’t tracking</li>
<li>Be produced by an organization that is unambiguously working for its users rather than for profit</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, Privacy Badger differs from traditional ad-blocking extensions in two key ways. First, while most other blocking extensions prioritize blocking ads, Privacy Badger doesn’t block ads unless they happen to be tracking you; in fact, one of our goals is to incentivize advertisers to adopt better privacy practices.</p>
<p>Second, most other blockers rely on a human-curated list of domains or URLs to block. Privacy Badger is an algorithmic tracker blocker – we define what “tracking” looks like, and then Privacy Badger blocks or restricts domains that it observes tracking in the wild. What is and isn’t considered a tracker is entirely based on how a specific domain acts, not on human judgment.</p>
<p>Privacy Badger sends the <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> signal to opt you out of data sharing and selling, and the <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track">Do Not Track</a> signal to tell companies not to track you. If trackers ignore these signals, Privacy Badger will learn to block them.</p>
<p>Beyond this, Privacy Badger comes with other advantages like cookie blocking, <a href="#How-does-Privacy-Badger-handle-social-media-widgets">click-to-activate placeholders</a> for potentially useful tracker widgets (video players, comments widgets, etc.), and outgoing link click tracking removal on <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/privacy-badger-rolls-out-new-ways-fight-facebook-tracking">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/privacy-badger-now-fights-more-sneaky-google-tracking">Google</a>.</p>
<p>By using Privacy Badger, you support the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and help fight for a better Web for everybody.</p>

    
      <h3 id="Who-makes-Privacy-Badger">
        <a href="#Who-makes-Privacy-Badger">Who makes Privacy Badger?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Privacy Badger was created by the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, a nonprofit organization that protects your privacy and free expression online. We make free tools like Privacy Badger, publish educational guides, testify before lawmakers about technology, and fight for the public interest in court—all thanks to support from EFF’s members. If you want a better internet and a strong democracy, <a href="https://supporters.eff.org/donate/support-privacy-badger">join the fight</a> against creepy online surveillance.</p>

    
      <h3 id="How-does-Privacy-Badger-work">
        <a href="#How-does-Privacy-Badger-work">How does Privacy Badger work?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>When you view a webpage, that page will often be made up of content from many different sources. For example, a news webpage might load the actual article from the news company, ads from an ad company, and the comments section from a different company that’s been contracted out to provide that service.</p>
<p>Privacy Badger keeps track of all of this. If the same source seems to be tracking across different websites, then Privacy Badger springs into action, telling the browser not to load any more content from that source. And when your browser stops loading content from a source, that source can no longer track you. Voila!</p>
<p>At a more technical level, Privacy Badger keeps track of the “third party” domains that embed images, scripts and advertising in the pages you visit. Privacy Badger looks for tracking techniques like uniquely identifying cookies, local storage “supercookies,” and canvas fingerprinting. If it observes the same third-party host tracking on three separate sites, Privacy Badger will automatically disallow content from that third-party tracker.</p>
<p>By default, Privacy Badger receives <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/10/privacy-badger-learns-block-ever-more-trackers">periodic learning updates</a> from <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/badger-sett">Badger Sett</a>, our Badger training project. This “remote learning” automatically discovers trackers present on thousands of the most popular sites on the Web.</p>

        <a href="#What-is-a-third-party-tracker">What is a third party tracker?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>When you visit a webpage parts of the page may come from domains and servers other than the one you asked to visit. This is an essential feature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a>. On the modern Web, embedded images and code often use cookies and other methods to track your browsing habits — often to display advertisements. The domains that do this are called “third party trackers”, and you can read more about how they work <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/behind-the-one-way-mirror">here</a>.</p>

    
      <h3 id="What-do-the-red,-yellow-and-green-sliders-in-the-Privacy-Badger-menu-mean">
        <a href="#What-do-the-red%2c-yellow-and-green-sliders-in-the-Privacy-Badger-menu-mean">What do the red, yellow and green sliders in the Privacy Badger menu mean?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Red means that content from this third party domain has been completely disallowed.</p>
<p>Yellow means that the third party domain appears to be trying to track you, but it is on Privacy Badger’s cookie-blocking “yellowlist” of third party domains that, when analyzed, seemed to be necessary for Web functionality. In that case, Privacy Badger will load content from the domain but will try to screen out third party cookies and referrers from it.</p>
<p>Green means “no action”; Privacy Badger will leave the domain alone.</p>

    
      <h3 id="Why-does-Privacy-Badger-block-ads">
        <a href="#Why-does-Privacy-Badger-block-ads">Why does Privacy Badger block ads?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Actually, nothing in the Privacy Badger code is specifically written to block ads. Rather, it focuses on disallowing any visible or invisible “third party” scripts or images that appear to be tracking you even though you specifically denied consent by sending <a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/do-not-track">Do Not Track</a> and <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control</a> signals. It just so happens that most (but not all) of these third party trackers are advertisements. When you see an ad, the ad sees you, and can track you. Privacy Badger is here to stop that.</p>

    
      <h3 id="Why-doesn't-Privacy-Badger-block-all-ads">
        <a href="#Why-doesn%27t-Privacy-Badger-block-all-ads">Why doesn't Privacy Badger block all ads?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Because Privacy Badger is primarily a privacy tool, not an ad blocker. Our aim is not to block ads, but to prevent non-consensual invasions of people’s privacy because we believe they are inherently objectionable. We also want to create incentives for advertising companies to do the right thing. Of course, if you really dislike ads, you can also install a traditional ad blocker.</p>

    
      <h3 id="What-is-Global-Privacy-Control">
        <a href="#What-is-Global-Privacy-Control">What is Global Privacy Control (GPC)?</a>
      </h3>
      <p><a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/">Global Privacy Control (GPC)</a> is a new specification that allows users to tell companies they’d like to opt out of having their data shared or sold. By default, Privacy Badger sends the GPC signal to every company you interact with alongside the Do Not Track (DNT) signal.</p>
<p>What’s the difference? Do Not Track is meant to tell companies that you don’t want to be tracked in any way (learn more about what we mean by “tracking” <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/understanding-effs-do-not-track-policy-universal-opt-out-tracking">here</a>). Privacy Badger gives third-party companies a chance to comply with DNT by adopting <a href="https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy/">our DNT policy</a>, and blocks those that look like they’re tracking you anyway.</p>
<p>When DNT was developed, many websites simply ignored users’ requests not to be tracked. That’s why Privacy Badger has to act as an enforcer: trackers that don’t want to comply with your wishes get blocked. Today, users in many jurisdictions have the legal right to opt out of some kinds of tracking. That’s where GPC comes in.</p>
<p>GPC is meant to be a legally-binding request to all companies in places with applicable privacy laws. For example, <a href="https://theccpa.org/">the California Consumer Privacy Act</a> gives California residents the right to opt out of having their data sold. By sending the GPC signal, Privacy Badger is telling companies that you would like to exercise your rights.</p>
<p>The CCPA and other laws are <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-study-finds-significant-obstacles-to-exercising-california-privacy-rights/">not perfect</a>, which is why Privacy Badger uses both approaches. It asks websites to respect your privacy, and it blocks known trackers from loading at all.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>At present, Privacy Badger primarily protects you against tracking by third party sites. As far as privacy protections for “first party” sites (sites that you visit directly), Privacy Badger removes outgoing link click tracking on <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/05/privacy-badger-rolls-out-new-ways-fight-facebook-tracking">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/10/privacy-badger-now-fights-more-sneaky-google-tracking">Google</a>. We plan on adding more first party privacy protections in the future.</p>
<p>We are doing things in this order because the most scandalous, intrusive and objectionable form of online tracking is that conducted by companies you’ve <a href="https://lumapartners.com/content/lumascapes/display-ad-tech-lumascape/">often never heard of</a> and have no relationship with. First and foremost, Privacy Badger is there to enforce Do Not Track against these domains by providing the technical means to restrict access to their tracking scripts and images. The right policy for whether nytimes.com, facebook.com or google.com can track you <em>when you visit that site</em> – and the technical task of preventing it – is more complicated because often tracking is interwoven with the features the site offers.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>Unlike other blocking tools, we have not made decisions about which sites to block, but rather about which behavior is objectionable. Domains will only be blocked if Privacy Badger observes the domain collecting unique identifiers after it was sent Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control signals.</p>
<p>Privacy Badger <em>does</em> contain a “<a href="https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/src/data/pbconfig.json">yellowlist</a>” of some sites that are known to provide essential third party resources; those sites show up as yellow and have their cookies blocked rather than being blocked entirely. This is a compromise with practicality, and in the long term we hope to phase out the yellowlist as these third parties begin to <a href="https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy">explicitly commit to respecting Do Not Track</a>. The criteria for including a domain on the yellowlist can be <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/doc/yellowlist-criteria.md">found here</a>.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>The initial list of domains that should be cookie blocked rather than blocked entirely was derived from a <a href="https://jonathanmayer.org/papers_data/bau13.pdf">research project</a> on classifying third party domains as trackers and non-trackers. We will make occasional adjustments to it as necessary.

      </h3>
      <p>Browser fingerprinting is an extremely subtle and problematic method of tracking, which we documented with the <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">Cover Your Tracks project</a>. Privacy Badger can detect <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/meet-the-online-tracking-device-that-is-virtually-impossible-to-block">canvas-based fingerprinting</a>, and will block third party domains that use it. Detection of other forms of fingerprinting and protections against first-party fingerprinting are ongoing projects. Of course, once a domain is blocked by Privacy Badger, it will no longer be able to fingerprint you.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>No. Privacy Badger analyzes the cookies from each site; unique cookies that contain tracking IDs are disallowed, while “low entropy” cookies that perform other functions are allowed. For instance a cookie like LANG=fr that encodes the user’s language preference, or a cookie that preserves a very small amount of information about ads the user has been shown, would be allowed provided that individual or small groups of users’ reading habits could not be collected with them.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>One way is to stop tracking users who have turned on Global Privacy Control or Do Not Track signals (i.e., stop collecting cookies, supercookies or fingerprints from them). Privacy Badger will stop learning to block that domain. The next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will no longer include that domain in the list. Most Privacy Badger users will then update to that list.</p>
<p>You can also unblock yourself by promising to meaningfully respect the Do Not Track signal. To do so, post a <em>verbatim</em> copy of <a href="https://www.eff.org/dnt-policy">EFF’s Do Not Track policy</a> to the URL <a href="https://example.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt">https://example.com/.well-known/dnt-policy.txt</a>, where “example.com” is replaced by your domain. Posting EFF’s DNT policy on a domain is a promise of compliance with EFF’s DNT Policy by that domain.</p>
<p>If your domain is compliant with EFF’s DNT policy and declares this compliance, most Privacy Badgers will see this declaration the next time they encounter your domain. Also, the next version of Privacy Badger to ship with an updated pre-trained list will probably include your declaration of compliance in the list.</p>
<p>Note that the domain must support HTTPS, to protect against tampering by network attackers. The path contains “.well-known” per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5785">RFC 5785</a>. Also note that you must post a copy of the policy at each compliant subdomain you control. For example, if you wish to declare compliance by both sub1.example.com and sub2.example.com, you must post EFF’s DNT policy on each domain.</p>

        <a href="#Is-Privacy-Badger-compatible-with-other-extensions%2c-including-other-adblockers">Is Privacy Badger compatible with other extensions, including adblockers?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>Privacy Badger should be compatible with other extensions.</p>
<p>While there is likely to be overlap between the various manually-edited advertising/tracker lists and Privacy Badger, unlike adblockers, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger may learn to block trackers your adblocker doesn’t know about.</p>

        <a href="#Is-Privacy-Badger-compatible-with-Firefox%27s-built-in-content-blocking">Is Privacy Badger compatible with Firefox's built-in privacy protections?</a>
      </h3>
      <p>It’s fine to use Firefox’s built-in content blocking (<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/">Enhanced Tracking Protection</a> or ETP) and Privacy Badger together. While there is overlap between Firefox’s tracker lists and Privacy Badger, Privacy Badger automatically learns to block trackers based on their behavior. This means that Privacy Badger’s automatically-generated and regularly updated blocklist contains trackers not found in Firefox’s human-generated lists. Additionally, <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_what-enhanced-tracking-protection-blocks">Firefox does not fully block “tracking content”</a> in regular (non-“private”) windows by default.</p>
<p>What about Firefox’s <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/">Total Cookie Protection</a> (dynamic First Party Isolation or dFPI)? Total Cookie Protection works by keeping third-party cookies isolated to the site they were set on. However, if unblocked, trackers can still use techniques like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12370">first-party cookie syncing</a> and <a href="https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/">browser fingerprinting</a>. They can track your IP address, or they can use some combination of these techniques. Trackers <a href="https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2020/07/14/can-the-exfiltration-of-personal-data-by-web-trackers-be-stopped/">harvest sensitive information</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising">serve as vectors for malware</a>. Not to mention, unblocked trackers slow down websites and waste your bandwidth.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that Privacy Badger is <a href="#How-is-Privacy-Badger-different-from-Disconnect%2c-Adblock-Plus%2c-Ghostery%2c-and-other-blocking-extensions">not just a tracker blocker</a>.</p>

      <p>EFF uses Fastly to host EFF’s Web resources: Fastly is EFF’s CDN. Privacy Badger pings the CDN for the following resources to ensure that the information in them is fresh even if there hasn’t been a new Privacy Badger release in a while:</p>

      <p>When you install Privacy Badger, your browser warns that Privacy Badger can “access your data for all websites” (in Firefox), or “read and change all your data on the websites you visit” (in Chrome). You are right to be alarmed. You should only install extensions made by organizations you trust.</p>
<p>Privacy Badger requires these permissions to do its job of automatically detecting and blocking trackers on all websites you visit. We are not ironically (or unironically) spying on you. For more information, see our <a href="https://github.com/EFForg/privacybadger/blob/master/doc/permissions.md">Privacy Badger extension permissions explainer</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the extension permissions warnings only cover what the extension has access to, not what the extension actually does with what it has access to (such as whether the extension secretly uploads your browsing data to its servers). Privacy Badger will never share data about your browsing unless you choose to share it (by filing a broken site report).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article_text">
    <p>The current discourse around AI progress and a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ai-bubble-building-spree-55ee6128">supposed</a> “<a href="https://www.reuters.com/commentary/breakingviews/ai-investment-bubble-inflated-by-trio-dilemmas-2025-09-25/">bubble</a>” reminds me a lot of the early weeks of the Covid-19 pandemic. Long after the timing and scale of the coming global pandemic was obvious from extrapolating the exponential trends, politicians, journalists and most public commentators kept treating it as a remote possibility or a localized phenomenon.</p>
<p>Something similarly bizarre is happening with AI capabilities and further progress. People notice that while AI can now write programs, design websites, etc, it still often makes mistakes or goes in a wrong direction, and then they somehow jump to the conclusion that AI will never be able to do these tasks at human levels, or will <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/cost-delusion-artificial-general-intelligence">only have a minor impact</a>. When just a few years ago, having AI do these things was complete science fiction! Or they see two consecutive model releases and don’t notice much difference in their conversations, and they conclude that AI is plateauing and scaling is over.</p>
<h3>METR</h3>
<p>Accurately evaluating AI progress is hard, and commonly requires a combination of both AI expertise and subject matter understanding. Fortunately, there are entire organizations like <a href="https://metr.org/">METR</a> whose sole purpose is to study AI capabilities! We can turn to their recent study <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/">"Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks"</a>, which measures the length of software engineering tasks models can autonomously perform:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.julian.ac/images/2025-09-27-failing-to-understand-the-exponential-metr-task-length.webp" alt="METR task length"></p>
<p>We can observe a clear exponential trend, with Sonnet 3.7 achieving the best performance by completing tasks up to an hour in length at 50% success rate.</p>
<p>However, at this point <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet">Sonnet 3.7 is 7 months old</a>, coincidentally the same as the doubling rate claimed by METR in their study. Can we use this to verify if METR's findings hold up?</p>
<p>Yes! In fact, METR themselves keep an <a href="https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks/">up-to-date plot on their study website</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.julian.ac/images/2025-09-27-failing-to-understand-the-exponential-metr-task-length-v2.webp" alt="METR task length"></p>
<p>We can see the addition of recent models such as Grok 4, Opus 4.1, and GPT-5 at the top right of the graph. Not only did the prediction hold up, these recent models are actually slightly above trend, now performing tasks of more than 2 hours!</p>
<h3>GDPval</h3>
<p>A reasonable objection might be that we can't generalize from performance on software engineering tasks to the wider economy - after all, these are the tasks engineers at AI labs are bound to be most familiar with, creating some overfitting to the test set, so to speak.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can turn to a different study, the recent <a href="https://openai.com/index/gdpval/">GDPval</a> by OpenAI - measuring model performance in 44 (!) occupations across 9 industries:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.julian.ac/images/2025-09-27-failing-to-understand-the-exponential-gdpval-category.webp" alt="GDPval categories"></p>
<p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gdpval">evaluation tasks</a> are sourced from experienced industry professionals (avg. 14 years' experience), 30 tasks per occupation for a total of 1320 tasks. Grading is performed by blinded comparison of human and model-generated solutions, allowing for both clear preferences and ties.</p>
<p>Again we can observe a similar trend, with the latest GPT-5 already astonishingly close to human performance:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.julian.ac/images/2025-09-27-failing-to-understand-the-exponential-gdpval-progress.webp"></p><p>You might object that this plot looks like it might be levelling off, but this is probably mostly an artefact of GPT-5 being very consumer-focused. Fortunately for us, OpenAI also included other models in the evaluation<sup id="fr-benchmark-hack-1"><a href="#fn-benchmark-hack">[1]</a></sup>, and we can see that Claude Opus 4.1 (released earlier than GPT-5) performs significantly better - ahead of the trend from the previous graph, and already almost matching industry expert (!) performance:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.julian.ac/images/2025-09-27-failing-to-understand-the-exponential-gdpval-models.webp"></p><p>I want to especially commend OpenAI here for releasing an eval that shows a model from another lab outperforming their own model - this is a good sign of integrity and caring about beneficial AI outcomes!</p>
<h3>Outlook</h3>
<p>Given consistent trends of exponential performance improvements over many years and across many industries, it would be extremely surprising if these improvements suddenly stopped. Instead, even a relatively conservative extrapolation of these trends suggests that 2026 will be a pivotal year for the widespread integration of AI into the economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Models will be able to autonomously work for full days (8 working hours) by mid-2026.</li>
<li>At least one model will match the performance of human experts across many industries before the end of 2026.</li>
<li>By the end of 2027, models will frequently outperform experts on many tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may sound overly simplistic, but making predictions by extrapolating straight lines on graphs is likely to give you a better model of the future than most "experts" - even <a href="http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">better than most actual domain experts</a>!</p>
<p>For a more concrete picture of what this future would look like I recommend <a href="https://epoch.ai/blog/what-will-ai-look-like-in-2030">Epoch AI's 2030 report</a> and in particular the in-depth <a href="https://ai-2027.com/">AI 2027</a> project.</p>

<p>The underperformance of both Grok 4 and Gemini 2.5 Pro is also notable, especially given state-of-the-art claims on many benchmarks when released. Beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law">Goodhart's law</a>! <a href="#fr-benchmark-hack-1">↩</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p><span>I</span> was 34 years old when I first had the idea for the world wide web. I took every opportunity to talk about it: pitching it in meetings, sketching it out on a whiteboard for anyone who was interested, even drawing the web in the snow with a ski pole for my friend on what was meant to be a peaceful day out.</p><p>I relentlessly petitioned bosses at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (Cern), where I worked at the time, who initially found the idea <em>“</em>a little eccentric<em>” </em>but eventually gave in and let me work on it.<em> </em>I was seized by the idea of combining two pre-existing computer technologies: the internet and hypertext, which takes an ordinary document and brings it to life by adding “links”.</p><p>I believed that giving users such a simple way to navigate the internet would unlock creativity and collaboration on a global scale. If you could put anything on it, then after a while, it would have everything on it.</p><p>But for the web to have everything on it, everyone had to be able to use it, and want to do so. This was already asking a lot. I couldn’t also ask that they pay for each search or upload they made. In order to succeed, therefore, it would have to be free. That’s why, in 1993, I convinced my Cern managers to donate the intellectual property of the world wide web, putting it into the public domain. We gave the web away to everyone.</p><p>Today, I look at my invention and I am forced to ask: is the web still free today? No, not all of it. We see a handful of large platforms harvesting users’ private data to share with commercial brokers or even repressive&nbsp;governments. We see ubiquitous algorithms that are addictive by design and damaging to our teenagers’ mental health. Trading personal data for use certainly&nbsp;does not fit with my vision for a free web.</p><p>On many platforms, we are no longer the customers, but instead have become the product. Our data, even if anonymised, is sold on to actors we never intended it to reach, who can then target us with content and&nbsp;advertising. This includes deliberately harmful content that leads to real-world violence, spreads misinformation, wreaks havoc on our psychological wellbeing and seeks to undermine social cohesion.</p><p>We have the technical capability to give that power back to the individual. <a href="https://solidproject.org/" data-link-name="in body link">Solid</a> is an open-source interoperable standard that I and my team developed at MIT more than a decade ago. Apps running on Solid don’t implicitly own your data – they have to request it from you and you choose whether to agree, or not. Rather than being in countless separate places on the internet in the hands of whomever it had been resold to, your data is in one place, controlled by you.</p><p>Sharing your information in a smart way can also liberate it. Why is your smartwatch writing your biological data to one silo in one format? Why is your credit card writing your financial data to a second silo in a different format? Why are your YouTube comments, Reddit posts, Facebook updates and tweets all stored in different places? Why is the default expectation that you aren’t supposed to be able to look at any of this stuff? You generate all this data – your actions, your choices, your body, your preferences, your decisions. You should own it. You should be empowered&nbsp;by it.</p><p>Somewhere between my original vision for web 1.0 and the rise of social media as part of web 2.0, we took the wrong path. We’re now at a new crossroads, one where we must decide if AI will be used for the betterment or to the detriment of society. How can we learn from the mistakes of the past? First of all, we must ensure policymakers do not end up playing the same decade-long game of catchup they have done over social media. The time to decide the governance model for AI was yesterday, so we must act with urgency.</p><p>In 2017, I wrote a thought experiment about an AI that works for <em>you</em>. I called it <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Works.html" data-link-name="in body link">Charlie</a>. Charlie works for you like your doctor or your lawyer, bound by law, regulation and codes of conduct. Why can’t the same frameworks be adopted for AI? We have learned from social media that power rests with the monopolies who control and harvest personal data. We can’t let the same thing happen with AI.</p><p>So how do we move forward? Part of the frustration with democracy in the 21st century is that governments have been too slow to meet the demands of digital citizens. The AI industry landscape is fiercely competitive, and development and governance are dictated by companies. The lesson from social media is that this will not create value for the individual.</p><p>I coded the world wide web on a single computer in a small room. But that small room didn’t belong to me, it was at Cern. Cern was created in the aftermath of the second world war by the UN and European governments who identified a historic, scientific turning point that required international collaboration. It is hard to imagine a big tech company agreeing to share the world wide web for no commercial reward like Cern allowed me to. That’s why we need a Cern-like not-for-profit body driving forward international AI research.</p><p>I gave the world wide web away for free because I thought that it would only work if it worked for everyone. Today, I believe that to be truer than ever. Regulation and global governance are technically feasible, but reliant on political willpower. If we are able to muster it, we have the chance to restore the web as a tool for collaboration, creativity and compassion across cultural borders. We can re-empower individuals, and take the web back. It’s not too late.</p><p><span data-dcr-style="bullet"></span> Tim Berners-Lee is the author of <a href="https://thisisforeveryone.timbl.com/" data-link-name="in body link">This Is for Everyone</a> <em>(Macmillan</em><em>).</em></p><h2 id="further-reading"><strong>Further reading</strong></h2><p><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/innovators-9781471138805/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link">The Innovators</a> by Walter Isaacson (Simon &amp; Schuster, £10.99)</p><p><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-web-we-weave-9781541604124/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link">The Web We Weave</a> by Jeff Jarvis (Basic, £25)</p><p><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-history-of-the-internet-in-byte-sized-chunks-9781789295597/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article" data-link-name="in body link">The History of the Internet in Byte-Sized Chunks</a> by Chris Stokel-Walker (Michael O’Mara, £12.99)</p></div></div>]]></description>
