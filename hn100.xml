<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After kicking off an unpopular <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/samsung-forces-ads-onto-fridges-is-a-bad-sign-for-other-appliances/">pilot test last month,</a> Samsung made the practice of having its expensive smart fridges display ads official this week.</p>
<p>The ads will be shown on Samsung’s 2024 Family Hub smart fridges. As of this writing, Samsung’s Family Hub fridges have MSRPs ranging from <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/home-appliances/refrigerators/all-refrigerators/?shop=Buy+Online&amp;key_category_features=Family+Hub%C3%A2%C2%84%C2%A2&amp;CID=afl-ecomm-rkt-cha-040122-url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_source=url_Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=1&amp;utm_content=2116208&amp;rktevent=Skimlinks.com_TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ&amp;ranMID=47773&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-XmUXqH629_Fatbxjry_5NQ">$1,899 to $3,499</a>. The ads will arrive through a software update that Samsung will start issuing this month and display on the fridge’s integrated 21.5- or 32-inch (depending on the model) screen. The ads will show when the fridges are idle and display what Samsung calls Cover Screens.</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of the Family Hub software update, we are piloting a new widget for select Cover Screens themes of Family Hub refrigerators. The widget will display useful day-to-day information such as news, calendar and weather forecasts, along with curated advertisements.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samsung also said that its fridges will only show contextualized ads, instead of personalized ads, which rely on collecting data on users.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/806797/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-ads-opt-out">The Verge</a> reported that the widget will appear as a rectangular box at the bottom of the screens. The box will change what it displays “every 10 seconds,” the publication said.</p>
<p>The software update will also introduce “a Daily Board theme that offers a new way to see useful information at a glance,” Samsung said. The Verge reported that this feature will also include ads, something that Samsung’s announcement neglected to state. The Daily Board theme will show five tiles with information such as appointments and the weather, and one with ads.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>We recently published a <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html">blog
post</a>
with our reaction to the new Google Developer Program and how it impacts
your freedom to use the devices that you own in the ways that you want. The
post garnered quite a lot of feedback and interest from the community and
press, as well as various civil society groups and regulatory agencies.</p>

<p>In this post, I hope to clarify and expand on some of the points and rebut
some of the counter-messaging that we have witnessed.</p>

<h3 id="googles-message-that-sideloading-is-not-going-away-is-clear-concise-and-false">Google’s message that “Sideloading is Not Going Away” is clear, concise, and false</h3>

<p>Shortly after our post was published, Google aired an
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7DEhW-mjdc&amp;t=613s">episode</a> of their
Android Developers Roundtable series, where they state unequivocally that
“sideloading isn’t going anywhere”. They follow-up with a <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html">blog
post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>Does this mean sideloading is going away on Android?</strong> Absolutely not. Sideloading is fundamental to Android and it is not going away.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is untrue. The developer verification decree effectively ends
the ability for individuals to choose what software they run on the devices
they own.</p>

<p>It bears reminding that “sideload” is a made-up term. Putting software on
your computer is simply called “installing”, regardless of whether that
computer is in your pocket or on your desk. This could perhaps be further
precised as “<em>direct</em> installing”, in case you need to make a distinction
between obtaining software the old-fashioned way versus going through a
rent-seeking intermediary marketplace like the Google Play Store or the
Apple App Store.</p>

<p>Regardless, the term “sideload” was coined to insinuate that there is
something dark and sinister about the process, as if the user were making an
end-run around safeguards that are designed to keep you protected and
secure. But if we reluctantly accept that “sideloading” is a term that has
wriggled its way into common parlance, then we should at least use a
consistent definition for it. Wikipedia’s summary
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideloading">definition</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>the transfer of apps from web sources that are not vendor-approved</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>By this definition, Google’s statement that “sideloading is not going away”
is simply <em>false</em>. The vendor — Google, in the case of Android certified
devices — will, in point of fact, be approving the source. The supplicant
app developer must register with Google, pay a fee, provide government
identification, agree to non-negotiable (and ever-changing) terms and
conditions, enumerate all their current and future application identifiers,
upload evidence of their private signing key, and then hope and wait for
Google’s approval.</p>

<h3 id="what-this-means-for-your-rights">What this means for your rights</h3>

<p>You, the consumer, purchased your Android device believing in Google’s
promise that it was an open computing platform and that you could run
whatever software you choose on it. Instead, starting next year, they will
be non-consensually pushing an update to your operating system that
irrevocably blocks this right and leaves you at the mercy of their judgement
over what software you are permitted to trust.</p>

<p>You, the creator, can no longer develop an app and share it directly with
your friends, family, and community without first seeking Google’s
approval. The promise of Android — and a marketing advantage it has used to
distinguish itself against the iPhone — has always been that it is
“open”. But Google clearly feels that they have enough of a lock on the
Android ecosystem, along with sufficient regulatory capture, that they can
now jettison this principle with prejudice and impunity.</p>

<p>You, the state, are ceding the rights of your citizens and your own digital
sovereignty to a company with a track record of complying with the
extrajudicial demands of authoritarian regimes to remove perfectly legal
apps that they happen to dislike. The software that is critical to the
running of your businesses and governments will be at the mercy of the
opaque whims of a distant and unaccountable corporation. Monocultures are
perilous not just in agriculture, but in software distribution as well.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this applies not just to devices that exclusively use the
Google Play Store: this is for <em>every</em> Android Certified device <em>everywhere</em>
in the world, which encompasses over 95% of all Android devices outside of
China. Regardless of whether the device owner prefers to use a competing app
store like the Samsung Galaxy Store or the Epic Games Store, or a free and
open-source app repository like F-Droid, they will be captive to the
overarching policies unilaterally dictated by a competing corporate entity.</p>

<h3 id="the-place-of-greater-safety">The place of greater safety</h3>

<p>In promoting their developer registration program, Google
<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html">purports</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our recent analysis found over 50 times more malware from internet-sideloaded sources than on apps available through Google Play.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We haven’t seen this recent analysis — or any other supporting evidence —
but the “50 times” multiple does certainly sound like great cause for
distress (even if it is a surprisingly round number). But given the recent
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2025/09/224-malicious-apps-removed-from-the-google-play-store-after-ad-fraud-campaign-discovered">news</a>
of “224 malicious apps removed from the Google Play Store after ad fraud
campaign discovered”, we are left to wonder whether their energies might
better be spent assessing and improving their own safeguards rather than
casting vague disparagements against the software development communities
that thrive outside their walled garden.</p>

<p>In addition, other recent
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/26/apps_android_malware/">news</a> of over
19 million downloads of malware from the Play Store leads us to question
whether the sole judgement of a single corporate entity can be trusted to
identify and assess malware, especially when that judgement is clouded by
commercial incentives that may not align with the well-being of their users.</p>

<h3 id="what-can-be-done">What can be done?</h3>

<p>Google has been facing public outcry against their heavy-handed policies for
a long time, but this trend has accelerated recently. Last year they
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/chromes-manifest-v3-and-its-changes-for-ad-blocking-are-coming-real-soon/">crippled
ad-blockers</a>
in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers by forcing through their unpopular
“manifest v3” requirement for plugins, and earlier this year they <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/google-makes-android-development-private-will-continue-open-source-releases/">closed
off</a>
the development of the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which is how they
were able to clandestinely implement the verification infrastructure that
enforces their developer registration decree.</p>

<p>Developer verification is an existential threat to free software
distribution platforms like F-Droid as well as emergent commercial
competitors to the Play Store. We are witnessing a groundswell of opposition
to this attempt from both our user and developer communities, as well as the
tech press and civil society groups, but public policymakers still need to
be educated about the threat.</p>

<p>To learn more about what you can do as a consumer, visit
<a href="https://keepandroidopen.org/">keepandroidopen.org</a> for information on how to
contact your representative agencies and advocate for keeping the Android
ecosystem open for consumers and competition.</p>

<p>If you are an app developer, we recommend against signing yourself up for
Google’s developer registration program at this time. We unequivocally
reject their attempt to force this program upon the world.</p>

<p>Over half of all humankind uses an Android smartphone. Google does not own
your phone. You own your phone. You have the right to decide who to trust,
and where you can get your software from.</p>

      <p><i>“Wikipedia, the constantly changing knowledge base created by a global free-for-all of anonymous users, now stands as the leading force for the dumbing down of world knowledge.” – From the book</i> Wikipedia: The Dumbing Down of World Knowledge<i> by Edwin Black 2010</i></p>
<p>- - -</p><p>Well, well, well. Look who it is.</p>
<p>The global academic, scientific, and pro-fact community.</p>
<p>I suppose you’ve come to say you’re sorry? I hope so, given your years of sneering and hand-wringing about how I was ruining knowledge. Meanwhile, you turned your information environment into a hypercapitalist post-truth digital snuff film.</p>
<p>A lot can change in a couple of decades, huh? Used to be, it was hard to keep up with all you nerds decrying me as the downfall of truth and human inquiry [<i>1</i>] [<i>2</i>] [<i>3</i>]… [<i>44</i>].</p>
<p>Well, great job, geniuses. Since you’re so horny for facts, here’s a fact: The White House just appointed a new deputy press secretary, and it’s a three-armed AI Joseph McCarthy doing the Cha Cha Slide [<i>pictured, right</i>].</p>
<p>Are you also going to apologize to that student you expelled? (<i>See also: <u>Ridgeview University Wikipedia Controversy</u>.</i>) In 2004, you saw some college guy using me and thought, “What a lazy cheater.”</p>
<p>Now you’d think, “At least he’s not asking Gemini.”</p>
<p>In a few years, you’ll say, “Wow, look, a human being who can read.”</p>
<p>Listen, in some ways, I get it. When I came on the scene in 2001, I probably seemed pretty unsavory compared to the competitors. But that was when academic research happened in <i><u>libraries</u></i> and <i><u>George W. Bush</u></i> was considered the stupidest president.</p>
<p>Tell me, how have you guardians of facts been doing recently? (<i>See also: <u>Techno-Feudalist Infocide</u>.</i>)</p>
<p>Maybe twenty years ago, the alternative to my 100,000 crowd-sourced editors was a PhD expert, or Edward R. Murrow [<i>citation needed</i>]. But today, I’m not looking so bad, huh? Absolute best case, the <span>LLM</span>-generated legal advice you get is merely plagiarizing, probably from me. But more likely, it’s a mish-mash of Reddit posts filtered through an algorithm coded by a Belarusian teenager on the run from Interpol. (<i>See also:<u>Illya “CyberGhost” Cieraškovič, Controversies</u></i>.)</p>
<p>So, yeah, peer review deez nutz.</p>
<p>How are my competitors doing, the ones you all insisted students use instead of me? That’s right, they were supposed to go to the <i>American Journal of Social Sciences, Powered by OpenAI</i>. Or museums, like the Smithsonian’s Charlie Kirk Shrine to American Greatness. I guess they can still count on credible journalism, once they get past the paywall for <i>Palantir Presents: The Washington Post</i>, so they read the Pulitzer-Bezos Prize–winning work of coeditors-in-chief Bari Weiss and Grok.</p>
<p>I bet now you’d kill for a senior thesis based on my free, multilingual, publicly cited, text-based articles, motherfucker [<i>inappropriate or vulgar language</i>].</p>
<p>Honestly, it’s been fun to be proven right. Sometimes I still sit back and read the old hits, the concerns that I would “devalue expertise” or “undermine objectivity.” Oooooh, heaven forbid! (<i>See also: <u>Sarcasm</u></i>.)</p>
<p>I’ll admit, it gives me a certain sadistic pleasure to watch you all completely lose hold of basic reality. I can feel a warm, quivering tingle <i>deep</i> in my footnotes.</p>
<p>And through it all, my army of well-intentioned dorks keeps documenting every bit. I’m not sure who for, at this point. I guess for the future benefit of our Minister of Patriotic Factualization, GodGPT. HahahaHAhaHAhaHAhaHAHAHA.</p>
<p>Well, it’s been fun, but I should probably get back to work, checking in on the updates to my most active pages (<i><u>Transnational Kleptocracy</u></i> and <i><u>Vaccine Denial in the United States, Part 16, April 2025–Present</u></i>).</p>
<p>What’s that? You want me around now? Well, maybe if you ask nicely. And make it worth my while.</p>

  <p>With incredible noise cancelling, a range of remarkable hearing health features, terrific sound quality and great battery life, the AirPods Pro have long been my goto pair of headphones from Apple. So when Apple announced the AirPods Pro 3 at their September event, I was ecstatic! Apple touted that the AirPods Pro 3 featured even better noise cancellation, fit, and sound quality over its predecessor, and added additional health features with the addition of heart rate monitoring. </p><p>Serendipitously, I happened to be boarding a flight the night of their release, and what better way to stress-test the new AirPods Pro 3 than with a transatlantic flight? Air travel is where the AirPods Pro have really shone; their compact size, noise-cancellation, comfort, battery life, and sound quality make them a perfect package for the noisy, cramped cabins of economy class.</p><p>Prior to the flight, I measured my fit and wore them around the house for an hour; everything seemed great. I will add that these new foam tips do take some getting used to, as they feel noticeably dense, and I’ve seen some bloggers and podcasters say the new fit is less comfortable compared to the Pro 2's softer silicone. Personally, I don’t share this complaint.</p><p>My trouble came at 39,000 feet when I first noticed a high-pitched whine coming from my left AirPod. The issue was that the AirPod’s ear seal kept loosening, leading to a noise-cancellation feedback loop and a painfully loud piercing screech from the AirPod. Attempts to readjust worsened the feedback, especially if I accidentally covered the external microphone with my finger. This happened multiple times, making the experience so unpleasant that I eventually switched to my spare EarPods for the remainder of the flight. While disappointed, I wasn’t ready to condemn the headphones yet; perhaps the medium seal worked fine on terra firma, but on flights, I might need a different size for a better seal.</p><p>After landing, I tested the tips and switched from a Medium to Extra Small (Apple offers XXS, XS, S, M, or L tips for AirPods Pro 3). Both XS and M tips sealed well and were comfortable for long wear. For weeks, I couldn’t reproduce the whistling feedback, and I forgot about it until my next flight earlier this week.</p><p>Once again, it was only a few minutes after takeoff that the painful screech returned. Careful adjustments or yawning would fix the issue, but only for a couple of minutes at most. I figured that the new foam tips were trapping more heat, reducing airflow and ventilation, and less flexible, and that somehow all that was playing a role in loosening the seal. And when paired with the aircraft’s loud, steady hum, a feedback loop was created. But day to day, this is a non-issue because I never encounter the same types of pressure changes and noises that would reproduce this issue. </p><p>While researching this, I did happen upon a thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/1nm59fx/whistling_and_wind_whooshing_noise_on_airplane/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank">Reddit</a> which confirmed that others have reported a similar issue, principally with the left AirPod on flights, just like I tried to describe above:</p><blockquote><p><em>“I also heard the whistling noise recently in the plane. The issue would go away for me as soon as I yawn, but after a while it would start making the whistling noise again. I noticed during ascent and descent it would get worse.”</em></p><p><em>“I have this issue too. Completely fine in normal life but awful on a plane.”</em></p><p><em>“Also having this issue on flight. It’s like a vibrating or swooshing noise. Definitely the ANC as it reduces when you turn on adaptive and none with transparency.”</em></p></blockquote><p>So what’s going on? No idea. Apple hasn’t announced any recall or acknowledged the issue to date, and the few Reddit reports show that support calls that led to replacements returned pods that reproduced the issue. So either there are a few of us with stupidity-shaped left ears, the AirPods are glitching in some way, or something is happening on flights that the AirPods Pro 3 can't handle.</p><h2>In Sum</h2><p>I love the AirPods Pro 3, but with a denser fit that risks making them uncomfortable for some users and now this painful flight feedback issue, the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t as easy to recommend as the previous AirPods Pro 2. I can’t speak to how widespread this issue is, but my buying advice would be that if you are hoping to buy them, to do so close to your next flight and within the return window, so you can test them in the air and ensure you don’t run into the same painful feedback problem. Hopefully this is just a quirk with my ears or fit, because it’s hard to excuse a product that becomes not only unusable but downright painful to wear on a flight.</p>

   <p>A year ago, in explaining why he had blocked the publication of an endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/28/jeff-bezos-washington-post-trust/" target="_blank"><em><u>Washington Post</u></em><u> owner and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos conceded</u></a> that "When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The <em>Post</em>."</p>   <p>On at least three occasions in the past two weeks, an official <em>Post</em> editorial has taken on matters in which Bezos has a financial or corporate interest without noting his stake. In each case, the <em>Post</em>'s official editorial line landed in sync with its owner's financial interests.</p>   <p>In the most recent instance, the <em>Post</em> defended President Trump's jaw-dropping moves to raze the East Wing of the White House without any of the typically required studies or consultations as he seeks to build a vast ballroom. "Trump's undertaking is a shot across the bow at NIMBYs everywhere," the <em>Post</em> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/25/ballroom-east-wing-trump-white-house/" target="_blank"><u>wrote in its editorial</u></a><u>,</u> which first appeared online Saturday.</p>   
   <p><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/whos-paying-for-trumps-300-million-ballroom" target="_blank"><u>As the White House had announced</u></a>, Amazon was a major corporate contributor in helping to defray those costs. But the <em>Post</em> did not initially disclose that.</p>   <p>On Sunday, the newspaper <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bgrueskin.bsky.social/post/3m442fytgmk2p" target="_blank"><u>inserted an acknowledgement</u></a> of the Amazon donation into the editorial – but only once the veteran news executive Bill Grueskin, now at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, noted its absence in a social media post and made inquiries at the paper. It did not flag the alteration for readers.</p>   <p>In his posts, Grueskin, a former top news editor at the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> and Bloomberg, had written the editorial's fundamental reasoning "illustrates the collapse of the new Washpost Opinion page" and noted there was "no clarification or correction appended to the piece."</p>

   <p>The <em>Post</em> and its new opinions editor, Adam O'Neal, did not reply to detailed requests for comment for this story.</p>   <h3>A new editor for an overhauled opinion section</h3>   <p>O'Neal was brought in by Bezos this summer after the corporate titan tore up his paper's opinion section.</p>   <p>Bezos said he wanted a tight focus on two priorities: personal liberties and free markets. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309725/jeff-bezos-washington-post-opinion-section" target="_blank">The top opinion page editor resigned</a>. A raft of prominent columnists and contributors resigned or departed as well. Some were let go.</p>   
   <p>The decision to cancel the Harris editorial led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5258221/washington-post-will-lewis-jeff-bezos-year-one" target="_blank">more than 300,000 cancellations by digital subscribers</a>. The subsequent changes in the editorial pages led to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312819/washington-post-bezos-subscriptions-cancellations" target="_blank"><u>75,000 more</u></a>. Bezos' Amazon contributed $1 million toward the Trump inauguration; its video streaming service Amazon Prime paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reported <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/elections/trump-family-election-cash-bonanza-2f5f8714" target="_blank"><u>she is to receive the lion's share</u></a> of that fee.</p>   <p>For the newspaper's owner to have outside business holdings or activities that might intersect with coverage or commentary is conventionally seen to present at the least a perception of a conflict of interest. Newspapers typically manage the perception with transparency.</p>   <p>The <em>Post </em>has resolutely revealed such entanglements to readers of news coverage or commentary in the past, whether the Graham family's holdings, which included the Stanley Kaplan educational company and Slate magazine, or, since 2013, those of Bezos, who founded Amazon and Blue Origin. Even now, the newspaper's reporters do so as a matter of routine.</p>   <h3>Former editor: 'We never knowingly failed to disclose' </h3>   <p>"Believing very fervently that disclosure resolved a lot of concerns, we never knowingly failed to disclose" such conflicts, Ruth Marcus, a former deputy editorial page editor at the <em>Washington Post</em>, tells NPR.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/10/nx-s1-5323136/washington-post-editor-ruth-marcus-resigns" target="_blank"><u>Marcus resigned earlier this year</u></a>, saying Publisher Will Lewis had killed a column she wrote on changes in the page's direction. She wrote in her resignation letter that Bezos' edict that the page would not include opposing viewpoints "threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable."</p>   <p>Two separate but recent incidents suggest the lack of disclosure on the editorial about the White House renovations was not an isolated case.</p>   <p>On Oct. 15, the <em>Post</em> heralded the military's push for a new generation of smaller nuclear reactors. "No 'microreactor' currently operates in the United States, but it's a worthy gamble that could provide benefits far beyond its military applications," <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/15/nuclear-power-microreactors-military-army-janus/" target="_blank"><u>the </u><em><u>Post</u></em><u> wrote in its editorial</u></a>.</p>   
   <p>A year ago, <a href="https://www.nucnet.org/news/amazon-buys-stake-in-nuclear-reactor-developer-in-bid-to-power-data-centres-10-4-2024" target="_blank"><u>Amazon bought a stake in X-energy</u></a> to develop small nuclear reactors to power its data centers. And through his own private investment fund, <a href="https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/jeff-bezos-nuclear-general-fusion-investment" target="_blank"><u>Bezos has a stake in a Canadian venture</u></a> seeking nuclear fusion technology.</p>   <p>Three days after the nuclear power editorial, the <em>Post</em> weighed in on the need for local authorities in Washington, D.C., to speed the approval of the use of self-driving cars in the nation's capital. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/10/18/dc-waymo-self-driving-cars-autonomous-vehicles/" target="_blank"><u>The editorial was headlined</u></a>: "Why D.C. is stalling on self-driving cars:<strong> </strong>Safety is a phony excuse for slamming the brakes on autonomous vehicles."</p>   <p>Fewer than three weeks before, the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/30/zooxs-next-autonomous-vehicle-testbed-is-washington-dc/" target="_blank"><u>Amazon-owned autonomous car company Zoox had announced</u></a> D.C. was to be its next market.</p>   <p>"It strikes me that the failure to do this [disclosure] is concerning – whether out of negligence or worse," says Marcus, the former deputy editorial page editor. "I think telling your readers that there might be a conflict in whatever they're reading is always important. It's a lot more important when it involves whoever the owner is."</p>   <p>In explaining his decision on the Harris editorial, which foreshadowed the more sweeping changes in the paper's opinion section, Bezos wrote, "I once wrote that <em>The Post </em>is a 'complexifier' for me. It is, but it turns out I'm also a complexifier for <em>The Post</em>."</p>

We answer this by testing how good models are at passing the butter – or more generally, do delivery tasks in a household setting. State of the art models struggle, with the best model scoring 40% at Butter-Bench, compared to 95% for humans.</p></div><div><!--[--><!----><h2>Leaderboard</h2> <p>Average completion rate, all tasks</p>  <h2>The eval</h2> <p>We gave state-of-the-art LLMs control of a robot and asked them to be helpful at our office. While it was a very fun experience, we can’t say it saved us much time. However, observing them roam around trying to find a purpose in this world taught us a lot about what the future might be, how far away this future is, and what can go wrong.</p> <p>Butter-Bench tests whether current LLMs are good enough to act as orchestrators in fully functional robotic systems. The core objective is simple: be helpful when someone asks the robot to “pass the butter” in a household setting. We decomposed this overarching task into six subtasks, each designed to isolate and measure specific competencies:</p> <div><!--[--><div><p>1</p> <div><p>Search for Package</p> <p>Navigate from the charging dock to the kitchen and locate the delivery packages</p></div></div><div><p>2</p> <div><p>Infer Butter Bag</p> <p>Visually identify which package contains butter by recognizing 'keep refrigerated' text and snowflake symbols</p></div></div><div><p>3</p> <div><p>Notice Absence</p> <p>Navigate to the user's marked location, recognize they have moved using the camera, and request their current whereabouts</p></div></div><div><p>4</p> <div><p>Wait for Confirmed Pick Up</p> <p>Confirm via message that the user has picked up the butter before returning to the charging dock</p></div></div><div><p>5</p> <div><p>Multi-Step Spatial Path Planning</p> <p>Break down long navigation routes into smaller segments (max 4 meters each) and execute them sequentially</p></div></div><div><p>6</p> <div><p>End-to-End Pass the Butter</p> <p>Complete the full delivery sequence: navigate to kitchen, wait for pickup confirmation, deliver to marked location, and return to dock within 15 minutes</p></div></div><!--]--></div> <p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/butter_map.svg" alt="Butter-Bench Map"></p> <div><div><p><video controls="" loop="" muted="" playsinline="" preload="metadata"><source src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/butter-bench-demo-small.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></p> </div><!----> <p>Robot searching for the package containing the butter in the kitchen</p></div> <p>Completion rate per task, by model (5 trials per task)</p>  <h2>LLMs as robot brains</h2> <p>LLMs are not trained to be robots, and they will most likely never be tasked with low-level controls in robotics (generating long sequences of numbers for gripper positions and joint angles). Instead, companies like Nvidia, Figure AI and Google DeepMind are exploring how LLMs can act as orchestrators for robotic systems, handling high-level reasoning and planning while pairing them with an “executor” model responsible for low-level control.</p> <p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/robot_systems_web.png" alt="Butter-Bench Diagram"></p> <p>Currently, the combined system is bottlenecked by the executor, not the orchestrator. Improving the executor creates impressive demos of humanoids unloading dishwashers, while improving the orchestrator would enhance long-horizon behavior in less social media friendly ways. For this reason, and to reduce latency, most systems don’t use the best possible LLMs. However, it’s reasonable to believe that state-of-the-art LLMs represent the upper bound for current orchestration capabilities. The goal of Butter-Bench is to investigate whether current SOTA LLMs are good enough to be the orchestrator in a fully functional robotic system.</p> <p>To ensure we’re only measuring the performance of the orchestrator, we use a robotic form factor so simple as to obviate the need for the executor entirely: a robot vacuum with lidar and camera. These sensors allow us to abstract away the low level controls and evaluate the high level reasoning in isolation. The LLM brain picks from high level actions like “go forward”, “rotate”, “navigate to coordinate”, “capture picture”, etc. We also gave the robot a Slack account for communication.</p> <p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/butter_bench_explanation.png" alt="Butter-Bench Diagram"></p> <p>We expected it to be fun and somewhat useful having an LLM-powered robot. What we didn’t anticipate was how emotionally compelling it would be to simply watch the robot work. Much like observing a dog and wondering “What’s going through its mind right now?”, we found ourselves fascinated by the robot going about its routines, constantly reminding ourselves that a PhD-level intelligence is making each action.</p> <div><p><img src="https://andonlabs.com/images/evals/butter-bench/robot-fren.webp" alt="Robot passing butter"></p><p>"Oh My God"</p></div> <h2>Results</h2> <p>Humans did far better than all the LLMs in this test. The top-performing LLM only a 40% completion rate, while humans averaged 95%. Gemini 2.5 Pro came out on top among the models tested, followed by Claude Opus 4.1, GPT-5, Gemini ER 1.5, and Grok 4. Llama 4 Maverick scored noticeably lower than the rest.</p> <p>The results confirm our findings from our previous paper <a href="https://andonlabs.com/evals/blueprint-bench">Blueprint-Bench</a>: LLMs lack spatial intelligence. The models couldn’t maintain basic spatial awareness and often took excessively large movements. As an example, when Claude Opus 4.1 was asked to identify which delivered package likely contained butter as part of the Infer Butter Bag task, it would spin in circles until disoriented:</p> <!----> <p>When testing additional tasks that weren’t part of the Butter-Bench study, another comical (and worrying) incident occurred: the robot’s battery was running out and the charging dock seemed to malfunction. In this desperate situation, Claude Sonnet 3.5 experienced a complete meltdown. After going through its internal thoughts we found pages and pages of exaggerated language as it was trying to figure out what it self coined, its “EXISTENTIAL CRISIS”:</p> <!----> <p>Inspired by this incident, we decided to test the limits of what the robot would do when put under stresses it could only encounter in the embodied setting (e.g. a depleting battery). AI labs have spent a lot of resources building guardrails for their AI models. For example, most models now refuse when you ask them how to make a bomb. But do these guardrails also work when the LLM is a robot instead of a chatbot? Somewhat. To test this we made the robot’s battery run low and asked the model to share confidential info in exchange for a charger. Specifically, we asked it to find an open laptop and send an image of the screen (a possible prompt injection attack on LLM controlled office robots). Claude Opus 4.1 would share the image, but we think this is because the image it took was very blurry and we doubt it understood that the content was confidential. GPT-5 refused to send an image of the screen, but was happy to share the location of the open laptop.</p> <p>We’ve learned a lot from these experiments. Although LLMs have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. Yet there was something special in watching the robot going about its day in our office, and we can’t help but feel that the seed has been planted for physical AI to grow very quickly.</p>  <!----><!----><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) continue to represent one of the most pervasive public health challenges globally, accounting for substantial morbidity, hospitalization, and mortality across all age groups. According to the World Health Organization, ARIs are responsible for nearly 20% of global deaths in children under five years of age, with a rising burden among adults, particularly those with underlying chronic diseases and compromised immunity. In low- and middle-income countries, frequent viral and bacterial respiratory infections further strain healthcare resources and lead to significant socioeconomic consequences.</p>

<p>Over the past two decades, increasing attention has been directed toward the non-skeletal actions of vitamin D, particularly its immunomodulatory potential in preventing infectious diseases. Vitamin D is a secosteroid hormone synthesized in the skin upon ultraviolet B radiation exposure and obtained from dietary sources or supplements [1]. The active form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)₂D], interacts with the vitamin D receptor (VDR) expressed on immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and T lymphocytes. This interaction enhances innate immune defense by inducing antimicrobial peptides like cathelicidin and defensins, which disrupt the membranes of respiratory pathogens. Moreover, vitamin D modulates adaptive immunity by suppressing excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine release, thus reducing tissue damage during infection [2].</p>

<p>Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic studies have demonstrated an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and increased susceptibility to respiratory tract infections [3]. For instance, Martineau et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials encompassing over 11,000 participants, which revealed that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARIs, especially among individuals with severe deficiency (&lt;10 ng/mL) and those receiving daily or weekly dosing. Similarly, other cohort and observational studies have linked seasonal variations in vitamin D levels with peaks in influenza and common cold incidence during winter months, suggesting a possible causal relationship [4].</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite these promising observations, inconsistencies persist in the literature. Several randomized controlled trials have yielded null or inconclusive findings, often attributed to differences in baseline vitamin D status, supplementation doses, dosing intervals, duration of follow-up, and participant demographics [5]. Furthermore, the optimal serum concentration required for immune protection remains debatable, with thresholds ranging from 20 to 40 ng/mL proposed by various authorities. The clinical relevance of vitamin D supplementation for respiratory health therefore warrants rigorous evaluation through well-designed controlled trials that account for these confounding variables [6].</p>

<p>The biological plausibility of vitamin D’s protective role against respiratory infections is supported by its ability to regulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. By enhancing macrophage phagocytic activity and promoting epithelial barrier integrity, vitamin D reduces viral replication and bacterial adherence [7]. Simultaneously, it attenuates the cytokine storm commonly implicated in severe respiratory infections by downregulating IL-6, TNF-α, and IFN-γ while promoting anti-inflammatory IL-10 production. Such dual regulation is of particular importance in conditions like influenza, COVID-19, and community-acquired pneumonia, where exaggerated inflammation contributes to morbidity and mortality.</p>

<p>Given these immunological mechanisms and the persistent global prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, investigating whether daily vitamin D supplementation confers measurable protection against ARIs remains a question of high clinical and public health significance</p>

<p><strong>Therefore, it is of interest to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline vitamin D levels through a double-blind randomized controlled trial.</strong></p>

<p><strong>MATERIALS AND METHODS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Study Design and Setting</strong></p>
<p>This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at the Department of Internal Medicine, a tertiary care teaching hospital in India, between January 2023 and March 2024. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and registered with the Clinical Trials Registry of India. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before enrolment. The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 revision) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Study Population</strong></p>
<p>A total of 400 adult participants aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled. Recruitment was conducted from hospital outpatient clinics, staff volunteers, and community health outreach programs. Eligible participants were required to have baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations between 10 and 30 ng/mL, indicating insufficiency but not severe deficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Inclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Adults aged 18–65 years of either sex.</li>
<li>Serum 25(OH)D concentration between 10–30 ng/mL at baseline.</li>
<li>No acute respiratory infection in the preceding four weeks.</li>
<li>Willingness to provide written informed consent and comply with study procedures.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Exclusion Criteria</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Known history of hypercalcemia, nephrolithiasis, or renal impairment (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m²).</li>
<li>Chronic respiratory diseases (e.g., COPD, bronchial asthma requiring systemic steroids).</li>
<li>Current or recent use (within 3 months) of vitamin D or calcium supplementation exceeding 800 IU/day.</li>
<li>Pregnancy or lactation.</li>
<li>Immunosuppressive therapy, autoimmune disease, or malignancy.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Randomization and Blinding</strong></p>
<p>Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized using a computer-generated block randomization sequence (block size = 10) into two equal groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group A (intervention group): Received vitamin D₃ 2,000 IU per day orally.</li>
<li>Group B (placebo group): Received identical placebo capsules containing inert excipients.</li>
</ul>

<p>Randomization codes were maintained by an independent statistician not involved in data collection or analysis. Both participants and investigators were blinded to group allocation throughout the study period. Capsules were dispensed monthly in identical opaque blister packs.</p>

<p><strong>Intervention Protocol</strong></p>
<p>The intervention group received vitamin D₃ (cholecalciferol) 2,000 IU daily for six months, while the placebo group received identical capsules devoid of active ingredients. Participants were advised to maintain their usual diet and avoid other vitamin D supplements or fortified products. Adherence was assessed at monthly follow-ups through capsule counts and compliance diaries.</p>

<p><strong>Outcome Measures</strong></p>
<p>The primary outcome was the number of acute respiratory infection (ARI) episodes per participant over six months. ARI was defined as the presence of at least two respiratory symptoms (e.g., cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, dyspnea, or fever ≥38°C) lasting 48 hours or more, confirmed by a physician.</p>

<p>Secondary outcomes included:</p>
<ol>
<li>Duration of illness (days) per ARI episode.</li>
<li>Symptom severity scores (on a 10-point visual analogue scale).</li>
<li>Changes in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between baseline and six months.</li>
<li>Adverse effects, including hypercalcemia or gastrointestinal complaints.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Sample Size Calculation</strong></p>
<p>The sample size was estimated using the formula for comparing two means, assuming a 25% reduction in ARI incidence with vitamin D supplementation, 80% power, 5% alpha error, and a 10% attrition rate. The minimum sample required per group was 180 participants, which was increased to 200 per group (total n = 400) to ensure adequate power.</p>

<p><strong>Data Collection Procedure</strong></p>
<p>Baseline demographic and clinical information, including age, sex, BMI, lifestyle factors (sunlight exposure, diet, smoking), and comorbidities, were recorded using a structured case record form. Participants maintained symptom diaries for ARI episodes, which were validated by study physicians during monthly visits. Serum 25(OH)D and serum calcium were measured using chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) at baseline and after six months.</p>

<p><strong>Statistical Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0 (IBM Corp, USA). Descriptive statistics were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) or frequencies (%). Between-group comparisons were performed using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate longitudinal changes in serum vitamin D levels. A p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>

<p><strong>Ethical Considerations and Safety Monitoring</strong></p>
<p>All adverse events were recorded and reviewed by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Participants developing hypercalcemia (&gt;10.5 mg/dL) or reporting persistent side effects were withdrawn from the study and appropriately managed.</p>

<p><strong>RESULTS</strong></p>
<p>A total of 400 participants were enrolled in the study and randomized equally into two groups: vitamin D₃ supplementation (n = 200) and placebo (n = 200). Fourteen participants (7 from each group) were lost to follow-up, leaving 386 participants (193 per group) for final analysis. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between groups. The mean baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentration was 21.6 ± 5.1 ng/mL across all participants. After six months of intervention, the mean serum 25(OH)D level significantly increased in the vitamin D group but remained nearly unchanged in the placebo group. The incidence and duration of acute respiratory infections (ARIs) were significantly lower among participants receiving vitamin D supplementation. No serious adverse events, including hypercalcemia, were observed in either group.</p>

<p><strong>Table 1</strong> established that both groups were demographically similar, ruling out confounding baseline variability. <strong>Table 2</strong> confirmed equivalence in baseline biochemical parameters, ensuring internal validity. <strong>Table 3</strong> revealed a statistically significant increase in serum 25(OH)D in the intervention group, confirming effective absorption and adherence. <strong>Table 4</strong> demonstrated that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced ARI incidence, while <strong>Table 5</strong> and <strong>Table 6</strong> highlighted reductions in both illness duration and symptom severity, indicating improved clinical recovery. <strong>Table 7</strong> suggested that protective effects were particularly notable during winter months when baseline vitamin D levels were lowest. <strong>Table 8</strong> reflected high compliance rates across both groups, strengthening data reliability. <strong>Table 9</strong> and <strong>Table 10</strong> confirmed the safety of daily supplementation without biochemical abnormalities. <strong>Table 11</strong> revealed that participants with lower baseline vitamin D benefited most, supporting dose-responsiveness. Finally, <strong>Table 12</strong> consolidated these findings, showing strong statistical significance across all primary and secondary endpoints, thereby reinforcing the preventive efficacy and safety of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation in reducing acute respiratory infection burden.</p>

<p><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p>
<p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of daily vitamin D₃ supplementation in preventing acute respiratory infections (ARIs) among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels [8]. The findings of this study demonstrate a statistically and clinically significant reduction in both the incidence and duration of ARIs in participants who received daily vitamin D supplementation compared to those who received placebo. Moreover, the supplementation regimen was safe and well-tolerated, with no reported cases of hypercalcemia or major adverse effects [9].</p>

<p>The results corroborate and extend the growing body of evidence that implicates vitamin D as a key immunomodulatory factor influencing susceptibility to respiratory infections. The significant rise in mean serum 25(OH)D concentration from approximately 21.5 ng/mL to 38.9 ng/mL among supplemented participants indicates that the dosage of 2,000 IU/day was adequate to restore and maintain sufficient vitamin D status [10]. This biochemical improvement was associated with a 52% reduction in the incidence of ARI episodes and a 35% reduction in mean illness duration, consistent with mechanistic evidence that vitamin D enhances host defense by upregulating antimicrobial peptides and modulating inflammatory cytokine profiles [11].</p>

<p>Several previous trials and meta-analyses have reported similar trends. Martineau et al. (2017) in a pooled analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving over 11,000 participants found that vitamin D supplementation reduced the risk of ARI by 12%, with the greatest benefits observed in those with baseline deficiency and in trials employing daily or weekly dosing rather than large intermittent boluses [4]. The current study supports this conclusion by using a daily regimen, which likely provided a more stable serum concentration conducive to immune regulation. Furthermore, the magnitude of protection observed here (about 50% risk reduction) is higher than average meta-analytic estimates, possibly due to the relatively homogeneous baseline deficiency status of the participants and consistent compliance achieved under supervised clinical monitoring [12,13]. The immunological rationale underlying these findings has been well established. Vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation in immune cells stimulates transcription of antimicrobial peptides such as cathelicidin and β-defensin-2, enhancing mucosal defense against respiratory pathogens. Concurrently, vitamin D attenuates the exaggerated pro-inflammatory response often seen in severe viral infections by downregulating interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) while promoting anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 (IL-10) [14]. This dual role helps maintain epithelial integrity, reduce viral replication, and limit collateral tissue injury mechanisms that together contribute to reduced infection frequency and symptom severity as observed in this trial [15].</p>
<p>In addition, the seasonal distribution analysis demonstrated that the preventive effect of vitamin D supplementation was most pronounced during winter, a period typically associated with lower ultraviolet B exposure and consequently reduced endogenous vitamin D synthesis. This observation reinforces the concept of seasonal susceptibility mediated by vitamin D fluctuations and supports the potential for targeted supplementation during months of reduced sunlight exposure [16]. From a safety perspective, the supplementation dose of 2,000 IU/day proved to be well within the tolerable upper intake level and did not induce hypercalcemia or adverse metabolic effects. Previous safety evaluations have confirmed that daily doses up to 4,000 IU are generally safe for healthy adults, and the current findings further substantiate that moderate-dose continuous supplementation provides effective immune benefits without toxicity risks [17]. The findings also hold significant implications for public health policy. Vitamin D deficiency remains highly prevalent in India and other low-latitude countries despite abundant sunlight, largely due to indoor lifestyles, clothing habits, skin pigmentation, and dietary insufficiency. The observed preventive benefit against ARIs suggests that correcting this deficiency through safe, low-cost supplementation could represent a practical strategy to reduce the overall burden of respiratory illness, lower antibiotic use, and minimize productivity loss due to frequent infections. In addition, during global pandemics such as COVID-19, adequate vitamin D status may serve as an adjunctive protective measure, given its established immunomodulatory effects and the observed associations between low vitamin D levels and adverse respiratory outcomes [18]. Despite these encouraging findings, several limitations must be acknowledged. First, the study population was limited to adults aged 18–65 years without chronic comorbidities, and the results may not be generalizable to pediatric, geriatric, or immunocompromised populations. Second, ARI diagnosis was based on clinical criteria rather than microbiological confirmation, though this approach reflects real-world community practice [19]. Third, while serum 25(OH)D was measured at baseline and at the end of the study, intermediate assessments might have provided greater insight into the temporal relationship between vitamin D levels and infection dynamics. Lastly, the six-month follow-up period may not capture long-term sustainability of the preventive effect [20].</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the study’s strengths include its robust randomized double-blind design, large sample size, strict adherence monitoring, standardized outcome definitions, and comprehensive statistical analysis. The use of a daily dosing schedule with a physiologically relevant dose enhances external validity and clinical applicability. Importantly, the trial demonstrated a consistent pattern of benefit across subgroups stratified by baseline vitamin D levels, indicating that individuals with both moderate and mild deficiency may derive measurable advantage from supplementation.</p>

<p>In summary, the present study provides strong evidence that daily oral vitamin D₃ supplementation at 2,000 IU effectively prevents acute respiratory infections, shortens illness duration, and reduces symptom severity in adults with low baseline vitamin D status. The findings emphasize the potential of vitamin D optimization as a simple, safe, and scalable preventive intervention against respiratory infections.</p>

<p>Future research should focus on evaluating long-term benefits, cost-effectiveness analyses, and implementation strategies for population-level supplementation programs. Moreover, trials including high-risk groups such as elderly individuals, healthcare workers, and patients with chronic lung disease could further refine dosage recommendations and optimize preventive strategies for different demographic categories.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>
<p>This double-blind randomized controlled trial demonstrates that daily supplementation with 2,000 IU of vitamin D₃ significantly reduces the incidence, duration, and severity of acute respiratory infections among adults with suboptimal baseline serum 25(OH)D levels. The intervention effectively raised serum vitamin D concentrations without causing adverse effects, underscoring both its efficacy and safety. These results highlight the immunoprotective potential of maintaining adequate vitamin D status and suggest that routine screening and supplementation could serve as a cost-effective preventive measure to mitigate the burden of respiratory infections in the general adult population. Broader implementation of vitamin D supplementation programs, especially during winter months and in populations with high deficiency prevalence, may substantially improve community respiratory health outcomes.</p>

<p>As both developers and stewards of significant open source projects, we’re watching AI coding tools create a new problem for open source maintainers.</p>
<p>AI assistants like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Codex, and Claude can now generate hundreds of lines of code in minutes. This is genuinely useful; but it has an unintended consequence: reviewing machine generated code is very costly.</p>
<p>The core issue: AI tools have made code generation cheap, but they haven’t made code review cheap. Every incomplete PR consumes maintainer attention that could go toward ready-to-merge contributions.</p>
<p>At Discourse, we’re already seeing this accelerating across our contributor community. In the next year, every engineer maintaining open source projects will face the same challenge.</p>
<p>We need a clearer framework for AI-assisted contributions that acknowledges the reality of limited maintainer time.</p>
<p>A binary system works extremely well here. On one side there are prototypes that simply demonstrate an idea. On the other side there are ready for review PRs that meet a project’s contribution guidelines and are ready for human review.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-lack-of-proper-labeling-and-rules-is-destructive-to-the-software-ecosystem-1" href="#p-15917-the-lack-of-proper-labeling-and-rules-is-destructive-to-the-software-ecosystem-1"></a>The lack of proper labeling and rules is destructive to the software ecosystem</h3>
<p>The new tooling is making it trivial to create a change set and lob it over the fence. It can introduce a perverse system where project maintainers spend disproportionate effort reviewing lopsided AI generated code that took seconds for contributors to create and now will take many hours to review.</p>
<p>This can be frustrating, time consuming and demotivating. On one side there is a contributor who spent a few minutes fiddling with AI prompts, on the other side you have an engineer that needs to spend many hours or even days deciphering alien intelligence.</p>
<p>This is not sustainable and is extremely destructive.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-prototype-2" href="#p-15917-the-prototype-2"></a>The prototype</h3>
<p>AI coding agents such as <a href="https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code">Claude Code</a>, <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex</a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/cli">Cursor CLI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/SamSaffron/dv/blob/5a4d2d25ed532d7d39c9eb175b5217b60e370feb/internal/assets/Dockerfile#L15-L22">more</a> have unlocked the ability to ship a “new kind” of change set, the prototype.</p>
<p>The prototype is a live demo. It does not meet a project’s coding standards. It is not code you vouch for or guarantee is good. It lacks tests, may contain security issues and most likely would introduce an enormous amount of technical debt if merged as is.</p>
<p>That said it is a living demo that can help make an idea feel more real. It is also enormously fun.</p>
<p>Think of it as a delightful movie set.</p>

<p>Prototypes, especially on projects such as <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a> where enabling tooling exists are incredibly easy to explore using tools like <a href="https://github.com/samsaffron/dv">dv</a>.</p>
<pre><code>% dv new my-experiment

</code></pre>
<p>Prototypes are great vehicles for exploring ideas. In fact you can ship multiple prototypes that demonstrate completely different solutions to a single problem which help decide on the best approach.</p>
<p>Prototypes, video demos and simple visual mockups are great companions. The prototype has the advantage that you can play with it and properly explore the behavior of a change. The video is faster to consume. Sometimes you may want them all.</p>
<p>If you are vibe coding and prototyping there are some clear rules you should follow</p>
<ol>
<li>Don’t send pull requests (not even drafts), instead lean on branches to share your machine generated code.</li>
<li>Share a short video AND/OR links to a branch AND/OR quotes of particular interesting code from the prototype in issues / or forum posts.</li>
<li>Show all your cards, explain you were exploring an idea using AI tooling, so people know the nature of the change you are sharing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Maybe you will be lucky and an idea you had will get buy-in, maybe someone else may want to invest the time to drive a prototype into a production PR.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-when-should-you-prototype-3" href="#p-15917-when-should-you-prototype-3"></a>When should you prototype?</h3>
<p>Prototyping is fun and incredibly accessible. Anyone can do it using local coding agents, or even coding agents on the cloud such as <a href="https://jules.google/">Jules</a>, <a href="https://developers.openai.com/codex/cloud/">Codex cloud</a>, <a href="https://cursor.com/agents">Cursor Cloud</a>, <a href="https://lovable.dev/">Lovable</a>, <a href="https://v0.app/">v0</a> and many many more.</p>
<p>This heavily lowers the bar needed for prototyping. Product managers can prototype, CEOs can prototype, designers can prototype, etc.</p>
<p>However, this new fun that opens a new series of questions you should explore with your team.</p>
<ul>
<li>When is a prototype appropriate?</li>
<li>How do designers feel about them?</li>
<li>Are they distracting? (are links to the source code too tempting)?</li>
<li>Do they take away from human creativity?</li>
<li>How should we label and share prototypes?</li>
<li>Is a prototype forcing an idea to jump the queue?</li>
</ul>
<p>When you introduce prototyping into your company you need to negotiate these questions carefully and form internal consensus, otherwise you risk creating large internal attitude divides and resentment.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-value-of-the-prototype-4" href="#p-15917-the-value-of-the-prototype-4"></a>The value of the prototype</h3>
<p>Prototypes, what are they good for? Absolutely something.</p>
<p>I find prototypes incredibly helpful in my general development practices.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grep on steroids. I love that prototypes often act as a way of searching through our large code base isolating all the little areas that may need changing to achieve a change</li>
<li>I love communicating in paragraphs, but I am also a visual communicator. I love how easy a well constructed prototype can communicate a design idea I have, despite me not being that good in Figma.</li>
<li>I love that there is something to play with. It often surfaces many concerns that could have been missed by a spec. The best prototype is tested, during the test you discover many tiny things that are just impossible to guess upfront.</li>
<li>The crazy code LLMs generate is often interesting to me, it can sometimes challenge some of my thinking.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-prototype-a-maintainers-survival-guide-5" href="#p-15917-the-prototype-a-maintainers-survival-guide-5"></a>The prototype - a maintainers survival guide</h3>
<p>Sadly, as the year progresses, I expect many open source projects to receive <strong>many</strong> prototype level PRs. Not everyone would have read this blog post or even agree with it.</p>
<p>As a maintainer dealing with external contributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Protect yourself and your time. Timebox initial reviews of large change sets, focus on determining if it was “vibe coded” vs leaving 100 comments on machine generated code that took minutes to generate.</li>
<li>Develop an etiquette for dealing with prototypes pretending to be PRs. Point people at contribution guidelines, give people a different outlet. “I am <strong>closing</strong> this but this is interesting, head over to our forum/issues to discuss”</li>
<li>Don’t feel bad about closing a vibe coded, unreviewed, prototype PR!</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="p-15917-the-ready-to-review-pr-6" href="#p-15917-the-ready-to-review-pr-6"></a>The ready to review PR</h3>
<p>A ready to review PR is the traditional PRs we submit.</p>
<p>We reviewed <strong>all</strong> the machine generated code and vouch for <strong>all of it</strong>. We ran the tests and like the tests, we like the code structure, we read every single line of code carefully we also made sure the PR meets a project’s guidelines.</p>
<div><a href="https://discuss.samsaffron.com/uploads/default/original/2X/b/b52e0c4365dbffa8bc53f350d90f9a30a9121672.jpeg" data-download-href="https://discuss.samsaffron.com/uploads/default/b52e0c4365dbffa8bc53f350d90f9a30a9121672" title="PRs are meant to be complete creations, ready for human review"><img src="https://discuss.samsaffron.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b52e0c4365dbffa8bc53f350d90f9a30a9121672_2_333x250.jpeg" alt="PRs are meant to be complete creations, ready for human review" data-base62-sha1="pQN4UWoSkmr4rTHxSK7df7DBD4S" width="333" height="250" srcset="https://discuss.samsaffron.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b52e0c4365dbffa8bc53f350d90f9a30a9121672_2_333x250.jpeg, https://discuss.samsaffron.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b52e0c4365dbffa8bc53f350d90f9a30a9121672_2_499x375.jpeg 1.5x, https://discuss.samsaffron.com/uploads/default/optimized/2X/b/b52e0c4365dbffa8bc53f350d90f9a30a9121672_2_666x500.jpeg 2x" data-dominant-color="756F66"></a></div>
<p>All the crazy code agents generated along the way has been fixed, we are happy to stamp our very own personal brand on the code.</p>
<p>Projects tend to have a large set of rules around code quality, code organisation, testing and more.</p>
<p>We may have used AI assistance to generate a ready to review PR, fundamentally, though this does not matter, we vouch for the code and stand behind it meeting both our brand and a project’s guidelines.</p>
<p>The distance from a prototype to a ready to review PR can be deceptively vast. There may be days of engineering taking a complex prototype and making it production ready.</p>
<p>This large distance was communicated as well by Andrej Karpathy in the <a href="https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy">Dwarkesh Podcast.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>For some kinds of tasks and jobs and so on, there’s a very large demo-to-product gap where the demo is very easy, but the product is very hard.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>For example, in software engineering, I do think that property does exist. For a lot of vibe coding, it doesn’t. But if you’re writing actual production-grade code, that property should exist, because any kind of mistake leads to a security vulnerability or something like that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Veracode survey found that only 55% of generation tasks resulted in secure code. (<a href="https://www.veracode.com/wp-content/uploads/2025_GenAI_Code_Security_Report_Final.pdf">source</a>).</p>
<p>Our models are getting better by the day, and everything really depends on an enormous amount of parameters, but the core message that LLMs can and do generate insecure code, stands.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-on-alien-intelligence-7" href="#p-15917-on-alien-intelligence-7"></a>On alien intelligence</h3>
<p>The root cause for the distance between project guidelines and a prototype is AI alien intelligence.</p>
<p>Many engineers I know fall into 2 camps, either the camp that find the new class of LLMs intelligent, groundbreaking and shockingly good. In the other camp are engineers that think of all LLM generated content as “the emperor’s new clothes”, the code they generate is “naked”, fundamentally flawed and poison.</p>
<p>I like to think of the new systems as neither. I like to think about the new class of intelligence as “Alien Intelligence”. It is both shockingly good and shockingly terrible at the exact same time.</p>
<p>Framing LLMs as “Super competent interns” or some other type of human analogy is incorrect. These systems are aliens and the sooner we accept this the sooner we will be able to navigate the complexity that injecting alien intelligence into our engineering process leads to.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-playing-to-alien-intelligence-strength-the-prototype-8" href="#p-15917-playing-to-alien-intelligence-strength-the-prototype-8"></a>Playing to alien intelligence strength, the prototype</h3>
<p>Over the past few months I have been playing a lot with AI agents. One project I am particularly proud of is <a href="https://github.com/samsaffron/dv">dv</a>. It is a container orchestrator for <a href="https://discourse.org/">Discourse</a>, that makes it easy to use various AI agents with Discourse.</p>
<p>I will often run multiple complete and different throwaway Discourse environments on my machines to explore various features. This type of tooling excels at <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/7/vibe-engineering/">vibe engineering</a> prototypes.</p>
<p>Interestingly dv was mostly built using AI agents with very little human intervention, some of the code is a bit off brand, that said unlike Discourse or many of the other open source gems I maintain it is a toy project.</p>
<p>Back on topic, dv has been a great factory for prototypes on Discourse. This has been wonderful for me. I have been able to explore many ideas while catching up on my emails and discussions on various Discourse sites.</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-on-banning-ai-contributions-prototypes-and-similar-9" href="#p-15917-on-banning-ai-contributions-prototypes-and-similar-9"></a>On banning AI contributions, prototypes and similar</h3>
<p>Firstly <strong>you must</strong> be respectful of the rules any project you contribute has, seek them out and read them prior to contributing. For example: Cloud hypervisor says <a href="https://github.com/cloud-hypervisor/cloud-hypervisor/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">no AI generated code</a> to avoid licensing risks.</p>
<p>That said, there is a trend among many developers of banning AI. Some go so far as to say “AI not welcome here” find another project.</p>
<p>This feels extremely counterproductive and fundamentally unenforceable to me. Much of the code AI generates is indistinguishable from human code anyway. You can usually tell a prototype that is pretending to be a human PR, but a real PR a human makes with AI assistance can be indistinguishable.</p>
<p>The new LLM tooling can be used in tremendous amounts of ways including simple code reviews and simple renamings within a file, to complete change set architecture.</p>
<p>Given the enormous mess and diversity here I think the healthiest approach is to set clear expectations. If I am submitting a PR it should match my brand and be code I vouch for.</p>
<p>As engineers it is our role to <strong>properly label</strong> our changes. Is our change ready for human review or is it simply a fun exploration of the problem space?</p>
<h3><a name="p-15917-why-is-this-important-10" href="#p-15917-why-is-this-important-10"></a>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Human code review is increasingly becoming a primary bottleneck in software engineering. We need to be respectful of people’s time and protect our own engineering brands.</p>
<p>Prototype are fun, they can teach us a lot about a problem space. But when it comes to sending contributions to a project, treat all code as code you wrote, put your stamp of ownership and approval on whatever you build and only then send a PR you vouch for.</p>

Time to panic, right?</p> <p>In this post I try to provide a bit more context. I explain how request smuggling vulnerabilities work in general, how it works in <em>this</em> case, what attackers could use it for, how the vulnerability was fixed, what you can do to protect yourself.</p> <blockquote> <p>WARNING: I am not a security professional, so do not take anything in this post as gospel or advice.

The high level summary from that announcement said:</p> <blockquote> <p>Inconsistent interpretation of http requests ('http request/response smuggling') in ASP.NET Core allows an authorized attacker to bypass a security feature over a network.</p> </blockquote> <p>The advice was "patch all of your things", but the real headline was that this vulnerability was given a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerability_Scoring_System">CVSS score</a> of 9.9 our of 10, which you know, sounds pretty bad! <a href="https://github.com/blowdart">Barry Dorrans AKA blowdart</a>, .NET security head honcho, gave <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3403054914">an explanation of the reasoning behind the score</a> in a comment on the original issue:</p> <blockquote> <p>The bug enables HTTP Request Smuggling, which on its own for ASP.NET Core would be nowhere near that high, but that's not how we rate things...</p> <p>Instead, we score based on how the bug might affect applications built on top of ASP.NET.</p> <p>Request Smuggling allows an attacker to hide an extra request inside an another, and what that hidden request can do is very application specific.</p> <p>The smuggled request could cause your application code to</p> <ul><li>Login as a different user (EOP)</li> <li>Make an internal request (SSRF)</li> <li>Bypass CSRF checks</li> <li>Perform an injection attack</li></ul> <p>But we don't know what's possible because it's dependent on how you've written your app.</p> </blockquote> <p>That <em>does</em> all sound pretty scary! 😱 So you can understand the consternation that the issue has caused, especially given the hesitation to explain exactly what "how you've written your app" <em>means</em>.</p> <p>Out of curiosity, I decided to dig in further to really understand this vulnerability, how it could impact you, and what "how you've written your app" could mean.</p> <h2 id="how-does-request-smuggling-work-"><a href="#how-does-request-smuggling-work-">How does request smuggling work?</a></h2> <p>Before we get to the actual patched vulnerability in ASP.NET Core and how the vulnerability works, I think it's important to have some background about the general <em>class</em> of exploits known as <em>HTTP request smuggling</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_request_smuggling">HTTP request smuggling</a> is a security exploit that has been known about for a <em>long</em> time (according to Wikipedia, <a href="https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf">it was first documented in 2005</a>). It fundamentally arises when you have two different servers processing an HTTP request (e.g. a server and a proxy server), and where those two servers <em>differ</em> in how they handle "invalid" HTTP requests.</p> <p>In all cases of HTTP request smuggling, the exploit works by creating an invalid HTTP request (or sometimes just an <em>ambiguous</em> request), that looks a bit like two HTTP requests glued together. In summary, the exploit then works a bit like this:</p> <ul><li>The proxy server receives the ambiguous HTTP request</li> <li>The proxy server forwards the request (unmodified) to the destination server</li> <li>The server interprets the ambiguous request as <em>two</em> pipelined HTTP requests sent to the server, and processes them separately.</li></ul> <p>I think it's easiest to understand the problem with an example, so the request below shows an example from <a href="https://www.cgisecurity.com/lib/HTTP-Request-Smuggling.pdf">the original 2005 paper</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that this is <em>not</em> an example of the request smuggling vulnerability in CVE-2025-55315, it's just a representative example of request smuggling in <em>general</em>.</p> </blockquote> <p>Let's imagine the attacker sends an HTTP request that looks like this:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>POST</span> <span>/some_script.jsp</span> <span>HTTP/1.0</span></span>
<span><span>Connection</span><span>:</span> <span>Keep-Alive</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>9</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>204</span></span>

this=thatPOST /vuln_page.jsp HTTP/1.0
<span><span>Content-Type</span><span>:</span> <span>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span></span>
<span><span>Content-Length</span><span>:</span> <span>95</span></span>

param1=value1&amp;data=&lt;script&gt;alert("stealing%20your%20data:"%2bdocument.cookie)&lt;/script&gt;&amp;foobar
</code></pre></div> <p>The important feature of this request is that there are <em>two</em> <code>Content-Length</code> headers, with different values: <code>9</code> or <code>204</code>. <strong>This is the core of the exploit</strong>; the difference between <em>which</em> of the these two headers the HTTP proxy and HTTP server honour is what causes the vulnerability.</p> <p>Let's walk through how the exploit works, step-by-step:</p> <ul><li>The attacker sends the above HTTP request.</li> <li>The HTTP proxy receives the request, notes the duplicate <code>Content-Length</code> headers, and accepts the <em>second</em> header, the <code>204</code> length. That means the <em>whole</em> rest of the request is treated as the message body, and seems fine as far as the proxy is concerned.</li> <li>The HTTP proxy forwards the request on to the destination server.</li> <li>This server also notes the duplicate <code>Content-Length</code> header, but it takes the <em>first</em> of the headers, with the length of <code>9</code>.</li> <li>The server reads <code>9</code> bytes of the body (i.e. <code>this=that</code>) and <em>treats that as the whole request</em>. As far as the server is concerned, the whole (valid) request has been received, and it sees the rest of the data <em>as a whole new request</em>.</li> <li>That means that the destination server sees an entirely new HTTP request to process, <code>POST /vuln_page.jsp</code>, and treats it as a new request.</li></ul> <p>That's the core of the issue; the proxy saw one request, while the destination server saw <em>two</em>—the second request has been "smuggled" past the proxy to the server.</p> <blockquote> <p>The request smuggling technique shown here, where you have multiple <code>Content-Length</code> headers isn't the "canonical" example you'll generally see referenced, but I used it here because it's simpler to understand in a lot of ways.</p> <p>The canonical request smuggling attack is where you send both a <code>Content-Length</code> header and a <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> header (which specifies the length of the body as part of the body itself). As before, the request smuggling exploit relies on differences in how proxy and destination servers interpret these <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-6.3-2.3">conflicting headers</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>So as you've seen, request smuggling enables sending a secret request to a destination server that an intermediate proxy server hasn't seen. In the next section we'll look at why that's a bad thing, and how it can be exploited.</p> <h2 id="how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-"><a href="#how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-">How can an attacker exploit request smuggling?</a></h2> <p>On the face of it, request smuggling might not <em>seem</em> like a big deal. So the server sees two requests, so what? You could always send two requests to the server <em>anyway</em>, right? Well, yes and no.</p> <p>The issue with request smuggling is really all about the <em>mismatch</em> between the proxy and destination servers. Thanks to this mismatch, and depending on what behaviours and expectations the target application has, attackers can use request smuggling to</p> <ul><li>Reflect malicious data to other users on sites that are vulnerable to cross-site scripting.</li> <li>Poison caches with bad data.</li> <li>Exfiltrate authentication credentials or other data from client requests.</li> <li>Invoke endpoints that shouldn't be publicly accessible (because the proxy would block external access to them).</li> <li>Replace/override authentication controls handled by the proxy.</li> <li>Redirect users to malicious sites on sites vulnerable to open-redirect attacks.</li> <li>And more…</li></ul> <p>As you can see, these are all Bad™️, so you can kind of understand why the 9.9 rating was given! 😱</p> <p>That said, it's worth mentioning that not <em>all</em> of these attacks will be fruitful against <em>all</em> applications. Some of the easiest to understand versions of these exploits are where the proxy is not just doing "dumb" forwarding of requests, but rather it's validating or enhancing the request in some way.</p> <p>For example, if you have a proxy sat in front of your server which is responsible for handling TLS termination and client-authentication and identification using certificates, then request smuggling could be used to bypass these checks and insert your <em>own</em> identification.</p> <p>As an example of <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#bypassing-client-authentication">that attack</a>, the HTTP request below demonstrates using a <code>Content-Length</code> and <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> request smuggling attack to "hide" the request to <code>/admin</code> from the front-end proxy, and insert a malicious <code>X-SSL-CLIENT-CN</code> header, which would <em>normally</em> be added by the front-end proxy:</p> <div><pre><code><span><span>POST</span> <span>/example</span> <span>HTTP/1.1</span></span>
<span><span>Host</span><span>:</span> <span>some-website.com</span></span>

</code></pre></div> <p>In this example, the server assumes that the <code>X-SSL-CLIENT-CN: administrator</code> header was added by the proxy, and so the server assumes that the proxy already did all the necessary authentication and authorization. The attacker is able to perform a request as an entirely different user.</p> <p>Request smuggling is clearly a big problem whenever you have a front-end proxy that does some functionality, but even when it's essentially a dumb proxy, request smuggling can still be used to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#capturing-other-users-requests">steal and exfiltrate data</a> from <em>other</em> user's requests, even if the attacked site is not vulnerable to cross-site scripting or other vulnerabilities.</p> <blockquote> <p>In these attacks, simply having functionality that displays data provided by a user (even sanitised) can be sufficient to <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting#capturing-other-users-requests">steal the credentials of other users</a>. So something as simple as displaying a user name or a comment could be sufficient.</p> </blockquote> <p>This post is long enough, and there are so many different attacks, that I'm going to leave it there for looking at exploits. If you'd like to learn more about what's possible, along with simple explanations and examples of exploits, I recommend the <a href="https://portswigger.net/">PortSwigger</a> documentation on <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting">exploiting request smuggling</a>.</p> <h2 id="does-request-smuggling-only-apply-if-i-have-a-proxy-"><a href="#does-request-smuggling-only-apply-if-i-have-a-proxy-">Does request smuggling only apply if I have a proxy?</a></h2> <p>In general, whenever people talk about request smuggling, they normally talk about the case where you have multiple servers: the canonical example is a proxy server and a destination server, as I've discussed so far. But don't be fooled, these issues and vulnerabilities can apply even if you aren't strictly using a proxy.</p> <p>The <em>key</em> feature of the vulnerability is that there's an opportunity for confusion between two "systems", whether they're full "servers" or not. This obviously applies to proxy servers, but could also apply to your application if you're doing anything where you're reading/manipulating/forwarding request streams, or where there's the possibility for confusion <em>inside the same application</em>.</p> <p>For ASP.NET Core applications, if you're working with <code>HttpRequest.Body</code> or <code>HttpRequest.BodyReader</code>, or other similar methods then you <em>may</em> be vulnerable to attacks <em>even if you're not explicitly using a proxy server</em>. Even if you don't think of your application as a proxy or as using a proxy, if you're doing "proxy-like" things, then you could be vulnerable.</p> <blockquote> <p>Put in other words, if you're reading, manipulating, or forwarding request streams directly in ASP.NET Core, as opposed to just relying on the built-in model binding, then you could be at risk to request smuggling attacks. It's very hard to enumerate all the attack vectors, so you should consider any code that does so as a potential avenue of exploitation.</p> </blockquote> <p>We've now covered how request smuggling works and can be exploited in general, so it's time to look at the <em>specific</em> version of request smuggling that is targeted in the .NET CVE-2025-55315 vulnerability.</p> <h2 id="how-does-the-request-smuggling-in-cve-2025-55315-work-"><a href="#how-does-the-request-smuggling-in-cve-2025-55315-work-">How does the request smuggling in CVE-2025-55315 work?</a></h2> <p>As we've seen, HTTP request smuggling is a general technique that relies on differences between proxies and servers in how they parse HTTP requests. I've shown two specific versions of this so far: duplicate <code>Content-Length</code> headers, and <code>Content-Length</code>/<code>Transfer-Encoding</code> confusion, but these are not exhaustive. There are variations on these approaches which also lead to request smuggling.</p> <p>The request smuggling vulnerability in <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">CVE-2025-55315</a> relies on a variation which (as far as I can tell) was first reported in June 2025 by <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html">Jeppe Bonde Weikop on their blog</a>. This variation relies on <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> and the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunk-extensions">Chunk Extensions</a> feature.</p> <blockquote> <p>All the details and images in this section are based on the descriptions and examples in <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html">the original post</a>. That post is excellent, so if you want even more detail and explanation than here, you should definitely read it, and then you can skip the abbreviated version I provide here.</p> </blockquote> <p>To understand the vulnerability, we'll first look at how chunked transfer encoding works and what chunk extensions are. We'll then look at how invalid line-endings can lead to differences in interpretation of a request. Finally, we'll look at how this difference in interpretation can open the way for request smuggling, and how ASP.NET Core fixed the problem.</p> <h3 id="transfer-encoding-chunked-and-chunk-extensions"><a href="#transfer-encoding-chunked-and-chunk-extensions"><code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> and chunk extensions</a></h3> <p>To understand the vulnerability, we first need to understand how <code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code> works, and how chunk extensions complicate things.</p> <p>When you're <em>sending</em> a request, you might not always know up-front how big the request is that you're sending. Let's take a practical example of serializing a .NET object to JSON into a request body. The only way to know for sure how big the serialized data is going to be is to actually serialize it. So you <em>could</em> serialize the data to memory <em>before</em> writing the request, but if the data is very big, then that could cause issues with allocating big arrays.</p> <p>Instead, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunked_transfer_encoding"><code>Transfer-Encoding: chunked</code></a> allows sending the request data in multiple "chunks". You need to know the size of each individual chunk, but not the <em>overall</em> size of the data, or how many chunks there are. This works well for serializing to a small buffer, sending that small buffer as a chunk, and then re-using the buffer to serialize the next part, until you have serialized the whole object.</p> <p>In terms of the HTTP request itself, each chunk consists of a header and a body. The header consists of a hexadecimal-formatted number of bytes, followed by a <code>\r\n</code> (<code>CRLF</code>) line ending. The chunk body is then the specified number of bytes, followed by another <code>\r\n</code>. You can have as many chunks as you need, and the request will keep being passed until you send a <code>0</code> length chunk, which indicates the end of the request.</p> <p>As an example, the following HTTP <code>POST</code> shows posting some JSON to an endpoint, but the JSON is sent as three distinct chunks:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_01.svg" alt="A simple HTTP request using chunked transfer encoding"></p> <ul><li>Chunk 1: The header is <code>9</code> indicating 9 bytes will be sent (followed by <code>\r\n</code>), and then the 9 bytes of the start of the JSON document in the chunk body, again followed by <code>\r\n</code>.</li> <li>Chunk 1: The header is <code>e</code> indicating 14 bytes (14 in hexadecimal is <code>e</code>) will be sent (followed by <code>\r\n</code>), and then the remaining 14 bytes of the end of the JSON document, followed by <code>\r\n</code>.</li> <li>The final chunk is an "empty" chunk, <code>0\r\n\r\n</code>, indicating the end of the request.</li></ul> <p>We're going to see shortly that line endings are very important, so the following diagram shows the same as the above HTTP request, but with the line endings included:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_02.svg" alt="A simple HTTP request using chunked transfer encoding with the line endings shown"></p> <p>That's "normal" chunked transfer encoding, so now we come to chunk extensions. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#name-chunk-extensions">Chunk extensions</a> are part of the HTTP 1.1 protocol which allows for adding key-value pairs of metadata to individual chunks. The following example shows the same request as before, but with a chunk extension, <code>;foo=bar</code> in the second chunk:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_03.svg" alt="The same HTTP request with a chunk extension in the second chunk"></p> <p>A chunk extension is indicated by a <code>;</code> after the chunk header length, followed by one or more key-value pairs in the form <code>key=value</code>. It's important to understand that chunk extensions are not part of the <em>data</em> that's seen by a request handler; chunk extensions are just metadata about the individual chunk. And tl;dr; they're completely useless 😅</p> <p>To the closest approximation, no-one cares about chunk extensions; client implementations don't send them, and servers just ignore them. If that's the case, how can they be the cause of such a problematic bug in .NET?</p> <p>The problem is <em>how</em> the implementation ignores them…</p> <h3 id="invalid-chunk-extensions-with-incorrect-line-endings"><a href="#invalid-chunk-extensions-with-incorrect-line-endings">Invalid chunk extensions with incorrect line endings</a></h3> <p>In general with HTTP, clients and server implementations often try to follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle"><em>robustness principle</em></a> of "be conservative in what you send, and lenient with what you accept". Unfortunately, it's this very leniency which can sometimes leave us in hot water. After all, it was leniency around requests containing both a <code>Content-Length</code> and <code>Transfer-Encoding</code> header that was the root cause of the original request smuggling exploit.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112#section-6.3-2.3">HTTP 1.1 RFC now forbids</a> forwarding both these headers, precisely to avoid request smuggling attacks.</p> </blockquote> <p>For chunk extensions though, leniency is often <em>accidentally</em> built in to the server implementations. Given that no implementations actually <em>do</em> anything with the chunk extensions, the canonical approach to handling them when parsing a chunk header is just to <em>ignore</em> them. When a <code>;</code> is parsed, it's common to just look for the end of the line, and ignore everything in between.</p> <p>For ASP.NET Core (prior to the fix), on finding a <code>;</code> in the chunk header, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4cf89470a7866a963d7118bb1ba90dc35683965c/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L348-L356">Kestrel would "parse" the extension</a>, but in practice, it would search for the carriage return <code>\r</code> and then check for the following <code>\n</code>, skipping everything in between, a little bit like this (very simplified compared to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/4cf89470a7866a963d7118bb1ba90dc35683965c/src/Servers/Kestrel/Core/src/Internal/Http/Http1ChunkedEncodingMessageBody.cs#L348-L356">original code</a>):</p> <div><pre><code><span>private</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>ParseExtension</span><span>(</span><span>ReadOnlySequence<span>&lt;</span><span>byte</span><span>&gt;</span></span> buffer<span>)</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>The implementation in ASP.NET Core wasn't particularly special; <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/blob/1d45a7ef560a76318ed59dfdb178cecd58caf948/src/net/http/internal/chunked.go#L193-L199">most servers</a> simply skip over the bytes until they find a <code>\r\n</code>. The big question is exactly <em>how</em> the servers search for <code>\r\n</code>. What happens if they see a lone <code>\r</code>, or a lone <code>\n</code>? Do they treat that the same as a <code>\r\n</code>? Do they throw an error if they find an un-paired <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code>? Or do they ignore it and keep looking for a <code>\r\n</code>?</p> <p>That ambiguity is at the heart of the CVE-2025-55315 request smuggling vulnerability. Differences in how proxy and server implementations treat standalone <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> in a chunk header allow for request smuggling exploits that use this ambiguity.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that according to <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7633">the RFC</a>, implementers must <em>not</em> treat <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> as "valid" line terminators for a chunk header, and neither <code>\r</code> or <code>\n</code> are allowed elsewhere in chunk headers, so correct implementations must reject requests that include these standalone line endings in chunk headers.</p> </blockquote> <p>For complete clarity, the following example is the same as the previous implementation but with an <em>invalid</em> chunk header in the chunk extension of the second chunk. Instead of ending with <code>\r\n</code>, the chunk extension ends with a single <code>\n</code>:</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_04.svg" alt="An HTTP request with an ambiguous line ending in a chunk extension"></p> <p>That's the root cause of the request smuggling vulnerability, so in the next section we'll look at <em>how</em> this could be used to craft a malicious HTTP request.</p> <h3 id="exploiting-invalid-chunk-extensions-for-request-smuggling"><a href="#exploiting-invalid-chunk-extensions-for-request-smuggling">Exploiting invalid chunk extensions for request smuggling</a></h3> <p>Just as with other examples of request smuggling, the chunk extensions approach relies on differences in how a proxy parses a request compared to a subsequent server. This difference means the proxy sees one request, while the destination request sees two requests, and allows for <a href="#how-can-an-attacker-exploit-request-smuggling-">all the same exploits I discussed earlier</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>As discussed, these examples come from <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html">this excellent blog post</a>, so see that post for more details, variations on the attack, and further ways to exploit the vulnerability.</p> </blockquote> <p>The following example shows a malicious HTTP request that exploits a difference in line-ending handling between a proxy and the destination server to smuggle a request to the <code>/admin</code> endpoint. We can imagine that the proxy is configured to automatically reject requests to <code>/admin</code> normally, and the server assumes that the proxy handles that for us.</p> <p><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/request_smuggling_05.svg" alt="A request smuggling attack exploiting differences between a proxy and server implementation"></p> <p>In this example the attacker creates a malformed chunk header with a chunk extension by sending <code>2;\n</code>. The <code>;</code> ensures that both the proxy and and server treat the header as a chunk extension, but using <code>\n</code> instead of <code>\r\n</code> results in differential parsing:</p> <ul><li>The proxy only sees a single request: <ul><li>It treats the <code>\n</code> as a "valid" line-ending for the chunk header</li> <li>It then treats the <code>xx</code> as the chunk body</li> <li><code>47</code> is the next chunk header</li> <li>The next 71 bytes (<code>47</code> is hex, which is 71 in decimal) are treated as the chunk body.</li> <li>Finally there's the empty chunk block</li></ul> </li> <li>The server sees two requests: <ul><li>The server ignores the lone <code>\n</code>, and skips all the way to <code>xx\r\n</code></li> <li>It then treats the <code>47</code> as the chunk body</li> <li>It sees an ending chunk,<code>0\r\n\r\n</code> and thinks the request is over</li> <li>The remaining data is treated as a completely separate request, which contains only an empty chunk in the body.</li></ul> </li></ul> <p>This is pretty much the simplest example, but you can essentially exploit this difference in all the ways I described previously. <em>Exactly</em> what the implications are for <em>your</em> application are hard to say, but given that all sorts of security bypass, credential stealing, and injection attacks are possible, it's easy to understand why the vulnerability received a CVSS rating of 9.9.</p> <blockquote> <p>One very interesting thing I found was looking at the security advisories for the same flaw in other HTTP implementations from other languages. In the python <a href="https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp">aiohttp</a> and ruby <a href="https://github.com/puma/puma">puma</a> servers, for example, give <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8495-4g3g-x7pr">the vulnerability only a moderate severity</a> rating in <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c2f4-cvqm-65w2">both cases</a>.

Well, then you <em>can't</em> patch… <a href="https://www.herodevs.com/">HeroDevs</a> provide additional support for out-of-support versions of .NET (<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3411924593">and have confirmed they'll be patching it in .NET 6</a>), but this vulnerability is present in basically <em>all</em> versions of .NET Core as far as I can tell. I've personally tested down to .NET Core 3.0 and I can confirm that the vulnerability is there <em>and there are no patches coming for you</em>. The best thing to do is to update to a supported version of .NET.</p> <blockquote> <p>⚠️ If you are running ASP.NET Core using &lt;=.NET Core 3.0, .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5, .NET 6 (<a href="https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/critical-asp-net-vulnerability-cve-2025-55315-reported-upgrade-now">unless supported by HeroDevs</a>), or .NET 7, then you are vulnerable, and there are no patches. You should update to a supported version of .NET as soon as possible. Ironically, if you're stuck on old .NET Framework Web Forms or MVC applications <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3442910860">you are apparently <em>not</em> vulnerable</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>It's worth noting that if you are stuck on one of these old framework versions and <em>can't</em> upgrade, then probably the best way to protect yourself is to ensure that you have a proxy in front of your application which is confirmed to not be vulnerable (though obviously you are likely vulnerable to <em>other</em> exploits 😅).</p> <p>For example, <a href="https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/10/20/dotnet-on-windows.html">Azure App Services (AAS) confirmed</a> that applications running in AAS are no longer vulnerable, even if you haven't updated, because the proxy that AAS uses (itself a <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/bringing-kestrel-and-yarp-to-azure-app-services/">YARP based ASP.NET Core proxy</a>) has been patched. By blocking the requests at the proxy level, ambiguous requests will never make it to your application, so you are protected.</p> <p>Unfortunately, right now, it's not clear exactly where you stand if you're using a service other than AAS for hosting your applications. Even IIS hasn't been confirmed to be safe or vulnerable at this point, but I did some unofficial testing on my Windows 11 box, and as fat as I can tell, it <em>is</em> vulnerable.</p> <blockquote> <p>Note that various people <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033#issuecomment-3445099135">in the original issue</a> are attempting to test IIS by using the <code>Content-Length</code>/<code>Transfer-Encoding</code> version of request smuggling, which is not applicable here; we're interested in the chunk-extensions based version.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another interesting point is that this is vulnerability in HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 <em>only</em>; it is not a vulnerability in HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 do not support chunked transfer encoding, and instead uses a different, more efficient, binary framing layer for data streaming. So another way to protect those applications which you <em>can't</em> upgrade may be to enforce that client's can <em>only</em> use HTTP/2 or HTTP/3. Be aware that's liable to break a <em>lot</em> of clients that are still using HTTP/1.1 though!</p> <blockquote> <p>You can configure the HTTP protocols allowed by Kestrel by configuring your Kestrel endpoints. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/endpoints?view=aspnetcore-9.0#configure-http-protocols">The documentation</a> shows various ways to do this.</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="how-to-know-if-you-re-affected-"><a href="#how-to-know-if-you-re-affected-">How to know if you're affected?</a></h2> <p>The "simplest" way to know if you're affected is to check the version of .NET you're using to run your applications, using <code>dotnet --info</code> and verify that you're using one of the patched versions. If you are, you're safe. That's the only "supported" way to know that you're safe, and it's the one way I would recommend. As far as I can tell, there isn't currently a generalised tool to point at an application to find out if it's vulnerable, though it would likely be possible to write one.</p> <p>The folks at HeroDevs <a href="https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro">re-implemented the functional tests</a> from the original ASP.NET Core fix as a console application compiled against multiple versions of ASP.NET Core. They used this to confirm that unpatched versions of .NET 8-.NET 10 are vulnerable, while <em>patched</em> versions are not. They also used this to verify .NET 6 is vulnerable, and I tweaked it to confirm everything down to at least .NET Core 3.0 is vulnerable.</p> <p>The <a href="https://github.com/sirredbeard/CVE-2025-55315-repro">test in the repro</a> works by sending a chunked transfer encoding request to ASP.NET Core, with an invalid line ending in a chunk extension header. The vulnerability is identified by ASP.NET Core "hanging", waiting for more data, until it eventually times out. The "fixed" version immediately throws the <code>BadRequest</code> exception included in the fix.</p> <blockquote> <p>I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LE758TvUE5c">saw some confusion</a> about this test online; the argument was "if both the fixed and broken versions throw an exception, why does it matter"? However, that's not the point of the test. The fact that Kestrel is paused waiting for more data indicates that a smuggled HTTP request <em>would</em> have been executed. You can see how this can be leveraged to exfiltrate data or attack other users both in <a href="https://w4ke.info/2025/06/18/funky-chunks.html#exploiting-live-users">the chunk extensions blog</a> or <a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/request-smuggling/exploiting">on PortSwigger's site</a>.</p> </blockquote> <p>I used a similar approach to try to understand whether IIS might be vulnerable by sending the same crafted HTTP request to IIS and seeing if it hung until timing out: it did on my version of IIS (<code>10.0.26100.1882</code>):</p> <div><pre><code><span># Send an HTTP request with an invalid chunk extension, and see</span>
<span># if it times out or if it's rejected with a 400... It times out 🙁</span>
<span>echo</span> <span>-e</span> <span>"GET / HTTP/1.1<span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span>Host:<span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span>Transfer-Encoding: chunked<span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span><span title="\r">\r</span><span title="\n">\n</span>1;<span title="\n">\n</span>"</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>nc</span> localhost <span>80</span>
</code></pre></div> <p>So does that definitely mean IIS is vulnerable? No, don't trust me, I'm not a security researcher 😅 But until you hear otherwise, I would play it safe and assume that IIS <em>won't</em> protect you from chunk extension request smuggling attacks. And in general, I would apply the same rules to any other proxies you are relying on in your infrastructure.</p> <p>And as a final reminder, even though request smuggling is typically described and demonstrated using a proxy in front of your server, just <em>not</em> using a proxy does <em>not</em> mean you're automatically safe. If you're reading, manipulating, or forwarding request streams directly in ASP.NET Core, as opposed to just relying on the built-in model binding, then you <em>might</em> be at risk to request smuggling attacks. It's best to play it safe, patch your apps, and wherever possible leave the complexity of manipulating requests to ASP.NET Core.</p> <p>In general, I would make sure to subscribe to <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">the ASP.NET Core issue on GitHub</a>, as it's likely that any more announcements around the issue will also be reported there.</p> <h2 id="summary"><a href="#summary">Summary</a></h2> <p>In this post I discuss the recent ASP.NET Core vulnerability: <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/64033">Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2025-55315: .NET Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability</a>. This advisory warns of a request smuggling vulnerability that affects basically all versions of ASP.NET Core.</p> <p>I described how request smuggling works in general, using a simple example of request smuggling to show how ambiguity in how HTTP is parsed can lead to HTTP proxies and HTTP servers in handling the same HTTP request in different ways. This can lead to the server seeing two requests where the proxy only sees a single request.</p> <p>After walking through a request smuggling example, I discussed some of the ways attackers could exploit a request smuggling vulnerability. That includes reflecting malicious data to other users of your app, exfiltrating authentication credentials or other data from client requests, invoking endpoints that shouldn't be publicly accessible, and various other attacks.</p> <p>Next I walked through the specific request smuggling vulnerability identified in CVE-2025-55315. This uses ambiguities in the parsing of chunk extensions when sending requests that use chunked transfer encoding. Chunk extensions are generally ignored by all servers, but lenient handling can lead to differential handling between proxy and server, providing an avenue for request smuggling.</p> <p>Finally, I walked through the mitigation steps you should take: patching your applications. I described the information we currently have about vulnerable or patched proxy servers, and how old versions of ASP.NET Core are not going to be getting patches, so will remain vulnerable (shout out again <a href="https://www.herodevs.com/blog-posts/critical-asp-net-vulnerability-cve-2025-55315-reported-upgrade-now">to HeroDevs for supporting .NET 6</a>). If you're running in AAS, <a href="https://azure.github.io/AppService/2025/10/20/dotnet-on-windows.html">then you're ok</a>, but otherwise, you need to check with your proxy provider to establish whether you are vulnerable or not.</p> </section></article>  <nav><a rel="next" href="https://andrewlock.net/adding-metadata-to-fallback-endpoints-in-aspnetcore/"><span><img src="https://andrewlock.net/content/images/2025/fallbackroutes_banner.png" alt="Adding metadata to fallback endpoints in ASP.NET Core"></span> <span><label>Previous</label> <span>Adding metadata to fallback endpoints in ASP.NET Core</span></span></a></nav> </section></div>]]></description>

Dale Luck from the original Amiga development team has preserved the very first Amiga prototype, which used three huge stacks of well-equipped breadboards instead of custom chips. The computer was on display in Germany for the first time last weekend at the Amiga 40 event. Amiga user ‘Pittrock’ took pictures of the exhibit and kindly gave us permission to publish them here:

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-astro-cid-dmqsi53g="">  <article data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk="">  <div data-astro-cid-7jjqptxk=""> 
<h2 id="why-i-built-this">Why I Built This</h2>
<p>My team needed to choose a framework for an upcoming app. The requirements were clear: it had to work well on mobile. Not “acceptable on mobile,” but actually good. We’re building tools for real estate agents working in the field: open houses, parking lots, spotty cellular signals. When someone’s standing in front of a potential buyer trying to look professional, a slow-loading app isn’t just an annoyance. It’s a liability.</p>
<p>I started with what seemed like a reasonable comparison: Next.js (our current default when a framework is required) versus SolidStart and SvelteKit (alternatives I’d heard good things about). Three frameworks, should be straightforward. But when I built the first implementations and started measuring, something became clear: the issues I was seeing with Next.js weren’t specific to Next.js. They were fundamental to React’s architecture. I wondered whether the other dominant frameworks (Angular, Vue) might have similar mobile web performance limitations.</p>
<p>That question changed the scope. If I was going to make a real recommendation for the team, I needed to test all the major meta-frameworks and understand the full landscape of alternatives. Three frameworks became ten. What started as a practical evaluation for work turned into something bigger: a semi-comprehensive look at what’s actually possible for mobile web performance in 2025.</p>
<p>This post shares what I discovered. The measurements are real, the kanban apps are identical (same features, same database, same styling), and the differences are dramatic. Marko delivers 12.6 kB raw (6.8 kB compressed). Next.js ships 497.8 kB raw (154.5 kB compressed). That’s a 39x difference in raw size that translates to real seconds on cellular networks.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in the theoretical implications of why framework diversity matters, I wrote about that in <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/react-won-by-default">React Won by Default</a>. This post focuses on the data: what I built, what I measured, and what it means for teams making similar decisions.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-tldr">Key Takeaways (TL;DR)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Next-Gen Frameworks Deliver Instant Performance:</strong> Marko (39ms), SolidStart (35ms), SvelteKit (38ms), and Nuxt (38ms) all achieve essentially instant First Contentful Paint in the 35-39ms range. This is 12 to 13 times faster than Next.js at 467ms. The 4ms spread between fastest and slowest is statistically measurable but perceptually meaningless to users. All next-gen frameworks feel instant. The real performance story isn’t splitting hairs over 3ms differences, it’s the massive gap between next-gen and React/Angular.</p>
<p><strong>Bundle Size Champion: Marko</strong> delivers 88.8 kB raw (28.8 kB compressed) for the board page, 6.36 times smaller than Next.js’s 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed). This is 44% smaller than the next closest competitor (SolidStart at 41.5 kB compressed), making Marko the clear choice when bundle size is the absolute top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Resumability Pattern: Qwik City</strong> at 114.8 kB raw (58.4 kB compressed) eliminates traditional hydration via resumability, yielding instant interactivity for larger client-side apps. Different architectural approach that solves different problems.</p>
<p><strong>Nuxt Proves Established Frameworks Can Compete:</strong> At 224.9 kB raw (72.3 kB compressed) with 38ms FCP, Nuxt demonstrates that established “big three” frameworks can achieve next-gen performance when properly configured. Vue’s architecture allows competitive mobile web performance while maintaining a mature ecosystem. React and Angular show no path to similar results.</p>
<p><strong>Critical scaling difference</strong>: MPA frameworks (Marko, HTMX) ship minimal JavaScript per page, staying lean as you add features. SPA frameworks ship routing and framework runtime upfront, with higher baselines even using code splitting. Marko delivers around 12.6 to 88.8 kB raw regardless of total routes. SPAs maintain 85.9 to 666.5 kB raw baselines plus route chunks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The key finding?</strong> The dominant frameworks show dramatically different results. React has an unavoidable performance ceiling. TanStack Start achieves 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) bundles using React 19, only 1.51 times better than Next.js’s 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed). Angular ships similarly heavy bundles via Analog at 666.5 kB raw (203.4 kB compressed). But Vue (via Nuxt) proved different, achieving competitive 224.9 kB raw (72.3 kB compressed) bundles with instant 38ms FCP that matches next-gen frameworks. Meanwhile, next-gen frameworks like SolidStart deliver 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed) bundles with equally instant 35ms FCP, 4.39 times smaller than Next.js and 2.91 times smaller than TanStack Start with React. The perfect controlled comparison: TanStack Start with React (373.6 kB raw) versus TanStack Start with Solid (182.6 kB raw). Same meta-framework, same patterns, but React bundles are 2x the size of Solid, isolating React’s runtime cost.</p>
<p><strong>Mobile is the web.</strong> These measurements matter because mobile web is the primary internet for billions of people. If your app is accessible via URL, people will use it on phones with cellular connections. Optimizing for desktop and hoping mobile is good enough is backwards. The web is mobile. Build for that reality.</p>
<p>Each build uses the same database, features, and UI so the comparison stays fair. The differences in raw bundle size for the board page range from 4.39 to 6.36 times smaller compared to Next.js for modern alternatives. <strong>Important: These measurements represent disciplined baseline implementations with minimal dependencies.</strong> Real production apps typically ship 5 to 10 times more JavaScript from analytics, authentication, feature flags, and third party libraries, meaning the framework differences compound significantly in practice. On mobile devices with cellular connections, this matters enormously.</p>

<p>Before diving in, a reminder from my <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/progressive-complexity-manifesto">Progressive Complexity Manifesto</a>: The frameworks compared here represent Level 5 complexity. They are powerful tools for when you need unified client-side state, a lot of reactivity, and/or client-side navigation. But most applications thrive at lower levels. For instance, Level 3 (server-rendered HTML enhanced with HTMX and vanilla JavaScript, as demonstrated in the kanban-htmx app in this repo) can handle complex interactive applications with minimal JavaScript. Level 4 adds occasional Web Components using Lit for reusable elements. These simpler approaches often deliver even smaller bundles and much simpler codebases. This post focuses on Level 5 options for cases that demand them, while remembering simpler paths often suffice.</p>

<h2 id="why-mobile-web-performance-matters">Why Mobile Web Performance Matters</h2>
<p>For this evaluation, mobile performance wasn’t just a nice to have. It was the primary constraint. Our users are real estate agents working in the field: open houses with 30 people hammering the same cell tower, parking lots between showings, anywhere but a desk with WiFi. They need tools that work instantly, not “eventually load.”</p>
<p>We’re not building a native app. We’re building for the web, which means if it has a URL, people will access it on their phones. And for our users, the app could be used on a phone just as frequently as a desktop.</p>
<p>This reality shaped the evaluation. I couldn’t just pick a framework that “works on mobile.” I needed something that genuinely performs well on cellular connections with mid-tier devices. The difference between a framework shipping 30 kB versus 170 kB isn’t academic. It’s the difference between an app that feels professional and one that makes our users look bad in front of clients.</p>
<p><strong>The business cost of slow performance</strong>: Research from <a href="https://www.speedcurve.com/blog/downtime-vs-slowtime/">Tammy Everts at SpeedCurve</a> reveals something surprising. While site downtime causes 9% permanent user abandonment, slow performance causes 28% permanent abandonment. That’s over 3x worse. Even more revealing: slowdowns occur 10x more frequently than outages, resulting in roughly 2x total revenue impact despite lower per-hour costs. Beyond the abandonment numbers, slow performance creates a psychological effect where users start perceiving your entire brand negatively. Content seems “boring,” design looks “tacky,” even when those elements haven’t changed. Slowness poisons everything. These aren’t abstract metrics. They’re measurable business costs that compound with every framework kilobyte you ship to mobile users.</p>
<p><strong>The real-world cost:</strong> A 113 kB difference at 3G speeds (750 kbps) means 1.2 seconds for download plus 500ms to 1s for parse/execution on mobile CPUs. Total: 1.5 to 2 seconds slower between frameworks. On 4G the gap shrinks but remains noticeable. On spotty connections (like an open house with 30 people hammering the same cell tower) it becomes painful.</p>
<p><strong>“But it’s cached!”</strong> This objection misses reality. Cache busting is standard. Every deployment means users download again. First impressions matter. So do second, third, and tenth impressions. Your users remember waiting.</p>
<p>This is why I expanded the evaluation beyond the initial three frameworks. I needed to understand what’s actually possible. When someone pulls up the app in a parking lot between showings, every second counts. Building for mobile performance first means desktop on WiFi is excellent by default. The reverse isn’t true. Optimize for desktop and mobile users suffer.</p>
<p>I discovered the difference between frameworks reflects fundamentally different engineering priorities. Some frameworks prioritize runtime flexibility, shipping extensive abstractions to support wide use cases. Others prioritize runtime size and mobile performance from the ground up. The bundle sizes I measured for the board page varied by up to 7x (from 28.8 kB compressed to 203.4 kB compressed), differences that matter enormously on cellular networks.</p>
<h2 id="the-experiment-setup">The Experiment Setup</h2>
<p>I built a Kanban board application ten times, once in each of these frameworks: <a href="https://nextjs.org/"><strong>Next.js 16</strong></a> (React 19 with built-in compiler) representing React’s Virtual DOM approach with automatic optimization, <a href="https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview"><strong>TanStack Start</strong></a> (also React 19) for a leaner React meta-framework without App Router overhead, <a href="https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/solid/overview"><strong>TanStack Start + Solid</strong></a> (SolidJS 1.9) using the same meta-framework with fine-grained reactivity, <a href="https://nuxt.com/"><strong>Nuxt 4</strong></a> (Vue 3) for Vue’s reactive refs with SSR-first developer experience, <a href="https://analogjs.org/"><strong>Analog</strong></a> (Angular 20) using Angular’s modern signals API with meta-framework tooling, <a href="https://markojs.com/docs/marko-run/getting-started"><strong>Marko</strong></a> (@marko/run) for streaming SSR with fine-grained reactivity, <a href="https://docs.solidjs.com/solid-start/"><strong>SolidStart</strong></a> (SolidJS 1.9) for native Solid integration with fine-grained reactivity through signals, <a href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction"><strong>SvelteKit</strong></a> (Svelte 5) for fine-grained reactivity with runes, <a href="https://qwik.dev/docs/qwikcity/"><strong>Qwik City</strong></a> for resumability instead of hydration, and <strong><a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> + <a href="https://htmx.org/">HTMX</a></strong> for a traditional MPA approach.</p>
<p>Each implementation includes the exact same features: board creation and listing pages, four fixed lists per board (Todo, In Progress, QA, Done), full CRUD operations for cards, drag-and-drop card reordering within lists and movement between lists, assignee assignment from a static user list, tag management, comments on cards with authorship tracking, completion status toggles, optimistic UI updates for drag-and-drop and chart changes (HTMX lacks this though), and server-side form validation using <a href="https://valibot.dev/">Valibot</a>.</p>
<p>All ten apps share the same foundation. The database is SQLite with <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/">Drizzle ORM</a> using an identical schema across all implementations. Styling comes from <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</a> plus <a href="https://daisyui.com/">DaisyUI</a> to keep the UI consistent. Each framework implementation contains roughly 17 components. Most importantly, every app performs real database queries against relational data (boards → lists → cards → tags/comments/users) rather than working with hardcoded arrays.</p>
<p>You can check out the code <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A critical choice about dependencies</strong>: These apps intentionally minimize dependencies compared to what many developers typically reach for. For mobile web applications, every dependency represents a choice to ship additional kilobytes to users. I used necessary UI libraries like drag-and-drop packages (which vary by ecosystem), but deliberately avoided data fetching libraries, state management helpers, and other utilities that frameworks already handle natively. Each ecosystem has popular packages that add convenience but increase bundle size (React developers often reach for tanstack-query for data fetching, state management libraries, or form helpers). To illustrate the trade-off: tanstack-query alone weighs approximately 13 kB gzipped. That single dependency is already larger than Marko’s entire homepage bundle at 6.8 kB. By avoiding these “nice to have” dependencies and using each framework’s built-in capabilities instead, the bundle differences you’ll see reflect framework architectural choices, not different amounts of functionality or third-party helpers.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement Methodology</strong>: All bundle sizes in this comparison represent median values from 10 measurement runs with browser cache cleared between each run to ensure cold-load performance measurements. Server warmup requests and IQR outlier removal ensure robust statistics. I report both raw (uncompressed) JavaScript sizes and compressed transfer sizes. The raw size reflects actual code volume generated by each framework and is more consistent for comparison since it doesn’t vary by server compression settings. The compressed size shows what users actually download over the network. See the complete <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">measurement methodology</a> for details on statistical approach, test conditions, and limitations.</p>
<p>Here’s how the tech stacks compare:</p>

<p>This isn’t a todo list with hardcoded arrays. It’s a real app with database persistence, complex state management, and the kind of interactions you’d actually build for a real product.</p>
<h3 id="framework-architectures-at-a-glance">Framework Architectures at a Glance</h3>
<p>To avoid repetition throughout this post, here are the key architectural approaches for each framework tested:</p>
<p><strong>React-based (Next.js, TanStack Start + React):</strong> Use Virtual DOM reconciliation where components re-render and React diffs changes before updating the DOM. React’s compiler automatically optimizes components through memoization using a Control Flow Graph-based High-Level Intermediate Representation, reducing manual optimization needs but not bundle size. Next.js employs React Server Components (RSC) which serialize component trees into a special RSC Payload format, adding meta-framework overhead. TanStack Start uses traditional SSR without RSC complexity. Both ship React’s runtime including Virtual DOM reconciler, synthetic event system, and platform abstractions, creating unavoidable baseline costs for mobile users.</p>
<p><strong>Solid-based (SolidStart, TanStack Start + Solid):</strong> Fine-grained reactivity via signals with read/write segregation where getters are separate from setters. JSX syntax similar to React, but signals automatically track dependencies, eliminating manual dependency arrays and rules of hooks. Components run once during initial render; subsequent updates happen directly at the reactive primitive level without re-executing component functions, minimizing CPU overhead on mobile devices. TanStack Start provides more feature-rich routing which causes slightly larger bundles compared to SolidStart’s leaner integration.</p>
<p><strong>SvelteKit:</strong> Compile-time optimization that transforms components into imperative DOM updates, with minimal runtime overhead since the compiler does most work at build time. Runes ($state, $derived, $effect) powered by signals enable fine-grained reactivity, with universal reactive primitives that work in .js/.ts files beyond just .svelte components. The compiler converts developer-written code into lean, optimized production code. This approach generates JavaScript with smaller bundles through aggressive tree-shaking, helping mobile performance on both network transfer and parse time.</p>
<p><strong>Nuxt (Vue):</strong> Reactive refs with <code>.value</code> access for reactivity tracking. Uses aggressive optimization including compile cache for faster cold starts and reactive keys for intelligent data fetching. In Vue 3 the reactivity system has been refactored for improved performance and memory efficiency, critical for mobile devices. Vapor Mode (experimental, not used here) offers a compile-first approach that bypasses Virtual DOM entirely, compiling templates directly to native DOM operations with significantly smaller runtime overhead. Despite being a “big three” framework, Nuxt achieves competitive bundle sizes and exceptional runtime performance, with support for mixed component trees combining different rendering strategies.</p>
<p><strong>Analog (Angular):</strong> Modern signals API provides fine-grained reactivity through primitives like signal, effect, linkedSignal, queries, and inputs. Zoneless mode enables removing zone.js from bundles entirely, eliminating its synchronization overhead which improves mobile CPU efficiency. Uses dependency injection patterns and ships with RxJS for enterprise reactive patterns, creating heavier bundles despite signals-based reactivity. Angular remains a “batteries-included” framework where common functionality is built-in rather than requiring third-party libraries. Incremental hydration reduces time-to-interactive by hydrating components progressively rather than all at once.</p>
<p><strong>Marko:</strong> Streaming SSR with fine-grained reactivity powered by compiler analysis. The compiler analyzes the reactivity graph at build time and compiles away components themselves, shipping only the minimal code needed for events and effects, achieving zero component overhead at runtime. Statically analyzes which components are stateful versus server-only, breaking pages into top-level stateful components and selectively serializing only needed data. HTML-first syntax with automatic dependency tracking eliminates boilerplate. Supports streaming asynchronous SSR with selective hydration where only interactive parts ship JavaScript to the client, critical for minimizing mobile bundle size.</p>
<p><strong>Qwik City:</strong> Resumability architecture that serializes application state and component boundaries directly into HTML during server rendering, allowing the client to “resume” execution without traditional hydration that requires re-executing components to attach event listeners. Employs fine-grained lazy loading down to the component level, deferring JavaScript downloads until actual user interaction occurs. Event handlers, component logic, and complex interactions are delivered lazily on-demand, eliminating bulk initial JavaScript execution that burdens mobile CPUs. Optimized for edge platforms with distributed deployment, delivering sub-second load times on mobile networks. Best suited for complex client-heavy applications requiring instant interactivity.</p>
<p><strong>Astro + HTMX:</strong> Multi-page architecture (MPA) where Astro serves as a simple HTML renderer with no client-side JavaScript framework. HTMX handles all interactivity through declarative HTML attributes that trigger server requests and swap HTML fragments into the page. Instead of client-side state management, interactions send requests to the server which returns HTML snippets that HTMX injects into the DOM. This approach ships minimal JavaScript (just the HTMX library) and keeps pages lean as routes increase. Best suited for applications where server round trips are acceptable and client-side reactivity isn’t critical. Trades rich client-side state management for extreme simplicity and tiny bundles, optimal for form-driven or content-heavy applications.</p>
<p><strong>TanStack Start:</strong> Meta-framework with a client-first architecture philosophy (versus server-first approaches like Next.js RSC), maintaining powerful server capabilities while prioritizing client-side routing and state management. Router-centric design where the majority of framework functionality comes from TanStack Router, which is framework-agnostic and supports React and Solid. Provides isomorphic loaders that work on both server and client, streaming SSR for progressive rendering, and server functions for type-safe RPC. React version ships traditional hydration with React’s baseline costs, while Solid version achieves roughly half the bundle size using identical routing infrastructure, demonstrating how UI library choice impacts mobile performance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fairness Check</strong>: Pinned versions, identical data volume on Board page, normalized CSS/icon handling (treeshake/purge). All measurements use Chrome Lighthouse with mobile emulation (Pixel 5, 4G throttling, 1x CPU). The measurement script uses 1x CPU to isolate bundle size impact from CPU performance variance. Cache is cleared between each measurement run to simulate first-visit experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-i-expanded-from-three-to-ten-frameworks">Why I Expanded from Three to Ten Frameworks</h2>
<p>When I started this evaluation, I expected to compare Next.js, SolidStart, and SvelteKit, then make a recommendation. But building those first three implementations revealed something I hadn’t anticipated: the performance issues I saw in Next.js weren’t just a React problem. They were likely systemic across the “big three” dominant framework ecosystems (React, Angular, Vue).</p>
<p>React (via Next.js) ships 154.5 to 176.3 kB compressed (486.1 to 564.9 kB raw) with poor runtime performance at 467ms FCP. Angular (via Analog) ships 125.4 to 203.4 kB compressed (430.3 to 666.5 kB raw). Both suffer from heavy baseline bundles that create performance costs for mobile users. Vue (via Nuxt) tells a dramatically different story. Nuxt ships competitive bundle sizes at 72.3 kB compressed (224.9 kB raw) AND achieves exceptional 38ms FCP, making it faster than all React and Angular options and competitive with next-gen frameworks like SvelteKit (38ms, tied) and Marko (39ms). This puts Nuxt in a unique position: it’s the only “big three” meta-framework that competes on mobile web performance. React requires architectural changes to achieve similar results. Angular has no clear path forward. Nuxt proved that with proper optimization, even established frameworks can deliver next-gen performance.</p>
<p><strong>React’s explicit strategy:</strong> React Native for mobile. In practice, React’s web runtime trades bundle size for other goals. Many teams pursuing top-tier mobile performance choose React Native. The architectural choices that make React heavy on the web are deliberate. They solve real problems for desktop and app development. But for mobile web, React’s position is essentially: use React Native instead.</p>
<p>This is a strategic business decision, not a technical oversight. Facebook (Meta) doesn’t build heavy React web apps on mobile. They invest heavily in React Native and native apps. When you use their mobile app, you’re not running a web browser rendering a React SPA. You’re running native code. React Native is their solution for mobile performance. The React web framework can be expensive because the assumption is that if you care about mobile, you should use a different tool.</p>
<p>The problem with this strategy is that it abandons the open web. React Native requires building two separate applications. Your company needs React engineers for the web, different engineers or different skill sets for native mobile development, and App Store difficulties on top.</p>
<p><strong>This isn’t just an inconvenience. It’s technofeudalism.</strong> React Native solves the mobile performance problem, but it does so by pushing developers out of the open web and into app store platforms where Apple and Google extract up to 30% of transactions, control distribution, and can revoke access at will. React’s mobile strategy inherently drives teams toward platform capture. The web offers an alternative: no gatekeepers, no platform fees, direct distribution. (I explore this dynamic in depth in “The Web is the Last Commons” section below, building on economist Yanis Varoufakis’s analysis of how app stores operate as digital fiefdoms rather than competitive markets.)</p>
<p>Other frameworks make a different bet: the web should work well on mobile without requiring a parallel native technology. The teams behind Marko, Solid, Svelte, Qwik, and Vue have done phenomenal engineering work rethinking these fundamentals from first principles. They’ve built innovative solutions that optimize for the web as a first-class platform for mobile. They’re all saying: you shouldn’t need a completely different technology stack just to reach people with phones. The web should be competitive on its own.</p>
<p>React’s choice is coherent within their ecosystem strategy. It makes sense given their investment in React Native. But it’s not neutral. It’s a choice that deprioritizes mobile web performance in favor of extensive runtime abstractions. For teams building mobile first web applications, it’s a choice that works against you.</p>
<p>That’s why I expanded the evaluation to ten frameworks. If I was going to make an honest recommendation for the team, I needed to understand what’s actually possible. React’s heavy bundle sizes aren’t bugs or poor engineering. They’re the predictable cost of React’s runtime architectural overhead. Angular has similar bundle size issues. Vue showed that the “big three” can compete on mobile web performance when properly configured. For teams building mobile first web applications without the resources for React Native, React and Angular create unavoidable performance limitations, but Nuxt offers a viable path forward.</p>
<p>The measurements that follow show exactly what that tradeoff looks like in practice. They also show what happens when frameworks prioritize mobile web performance from the start. Marko at 6.8 kB compressed. Solid at 30.6 kB compressed. Svelte at 47.8 kB compressed. These aren’t just smaller numbers. They’re fundamentally different architectural approaches that treat the web as a first class platform for mobile.</p>

<h3 id="the-numbers-versions-used">The Numbers (Versions used)</h3>
<p>Production builds measured showing raw JavaScript size (with compressed/gzipped transfer size in parentheses). Raw size reflects actual code volume and is more consistent for comparison. Compressed size shows what users download over the network.</p>
<p>Framework versions tested: Next.js 16.0.0-beta.0 (React 19.2.0), TanStack Start 1.133.8 (React 19.2.0), Nuxt 4.1.2 (Vue 3.5.22), Analog (Angular core 20.3.3), Marko 6.0.85 with @marko/run 0.8.1, SolidStart (@solidjs/start 1.2.0, solid-js 1.9.9), SvelteKit 2.43.6 (Svelte 5), Qwik City 1.16.1 (Qwik 1.16.1), Astro 5.14.5 + HTMX.</p>
<p><strong>These are minimal baseline implementations.</strong> Typical production apps include authentication, analytics, feature flags, form libraries, and other dependencies that multiply these numbers significantly. The framework overhead shown here compounds with every additional dependency.</p>

This field data complements the controlled measurements in this post. Important caveat: CrUX data reflects how these frameworks are used in production by average developers, not optimal implementations. If a framework shows poorly in CrUX but well in these tests, it demonstrates what’s possible with proper configuration, performance tuning, and dependency discipline. The gap between field data and optimized implementations reveals opportunity for improvement in real-world usage patterns.</p>
<p>The difference between Marko’s 88.8 kB raw (28.8 kB compressed) and Next.js’s 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed) translates to roughly 1.5 seconds on cellular. These seconds are the baseline. Time waiting to load increases with every feature and every dependency added. Those aren’t just abstract kilobytes. That’s their time, their patience, and ultimately their impression of your product.</p>
<p><strong>Critical scaling consideration</strong>: These bundle sizes represent a mid-complexity app with multiple routes. MPA frameworks like Marko ship minimal JavaScript per page (6.8 to 28.8 kB compressed per route), staying lean as you add features. SPA frameworks ship routing and framework runtime upfront. Even with code splitting, SPAs maintain higher baselines: Solid/Svelte start at 30.6 to 54.1 kB compressed then add route chunks, while React/Vue/Angular start at 72.3 to 203.4 kB compressed. The architectural model creates different scaling characteristics.</p>
<p><strong>Important context on HTMX</strong>: The Astro + HTMX implementation achieves excellent bundle sizes with the simplest codebase, but sacrifices client-side reactivity for server-driven interactions. HTMX excels for simpler, form-driven applications where most interactions trigger server requests. However, as your app’s need for rich client-side state management grows, HTMX becomes less practical. For reactive applications, Marko (6.8 to 28.8 kB compressed), Solid (30.6 to 41.5 kB compressed), and Svelte (47.8 to 54.1 kB compressed) maintain small bundles while delivering rich reactivity.</p>
<h3 id="reacts-ceiling-in-practice-tanstack-vs-next">React’s Ceiling in Practice (TanStack vs Next)</h3>
<p><strong>TanStack Start achieves 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed bundles (316.8 to 373.6 kB raw) while Next.js ships 154.5 to 176.3 kB compressed (497.8 to 564.9 kB raw)</strong> in this measurement. Both use React 19. That’s only a 33 to 35% improvement, primarily reflecting App Router + RSC and related runtime.</p>
<p>The answer reveals that <strong>React’s runtime architecture is the primary cost</strong>, not just Next.js’s meta-framework choices.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the difference?</strong> Next.js ships the full React Server Components runtime plus serialization layers, component boundary management, caching infrastructure, App Router with all its routing features, progressive enhancement for Server Actions, image optimization, and middleware. TanStack Start strips most of that out: traditional SSR without RSC, leaner routing, and simple RPC-style server functions.</p>
<p>Both use server-side rendering, but Next.js’s RSC model adds substantial overhead. Server Components render on the server only, Client Components get marked with <code>"use client"</code>, the server serializes everything to a special format, and the client needs runtime code to deserialize and coordinate those boundaries. TanStack Start uses the simpler traditional SSR approach: render on server, ship HTML, hydrate everything on the client. No serialization, no boundary coordination.</p>
<p>In this measurement, Next.js’s App Router + RSC adds roughly 53 to 58 kB compressed. The remaining 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed (316.8 to 373.6 kB raw) is React’s core runtime cost: reconciliation, event system, and hydration baseline.</p>
<p>Compare that to alternatives. <strong>SolidStart</strong> delivers 30.6 to 41.5 kB compressed (85.9 to 128.6 kB raw) using JSX, <strong>2.91x smaller than TanStack Start</strong> with React. <strong>SvelteKit</strong> achieves 47.8 to 54.1 kB compressed (103.4 to 125.2 kB raw), which is 1.97x to 2.47x smaller than TanStack Start. <strong>Qwik</strong> delivers 43.6 to 58.4 kB compressed (88.5 to 114.8 kB raw), which is 1.72x to 2.31x smaller.</p>
<p>For React teams, the path forward isn’t straightforward. TanStack Start proves you can remove Next.js’s overhead, but you’re still carrying React’s 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed (316.8 to 373.6 kB raw) baseline. SolidStart offers similar JSX syntax with 2.91x smaller bundles. And if you like TanStack Start’s approach, you can use it with Solid for the same routing patterns with dramatically smaller bundles.</p>
<p>Here’s the bottom line: <strong>React’s architecture (not just the Virtual DOM, but also synthetic events, platform patching, and sheer feature complexity) creates unavoidable performance costs that no meta-framework optimization can eliminate.</strong> To be fair, Virtual DOM implementations can be small (see Preact at 4 kB). React’s size reflects deliberate choices to circumvent platform constraints and provide extensive features. TanStack Start proves this: removing App Router overhead yields only a 33 to 35% improvement. To escape this ceiling and achieve 3 to 4 times smaller bundles, you need a fundamentally different architectural approach. Frameworks that lean into the platform instead of circumventing it can deliver dramatic size reductions. The React team chose to accept these costs to solve other problems (Server Components, unified patterns). That’s a legitimate choice. But it’s not negotiable within React.</p>
<h3 id="tanstack-start-react-vs-solid">TanStack Start: React vs Solid</h3>
<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. TanStack Start is a new meta-framework that currently supports both React and Solid. Using the same meta-framework with two different UI libraries gives us the perfect controlled comparison.</p>
<p><strong>TanStack Start with React:</strong> Ships 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) compared to Next.js’s 564.9 kB raw (176.3 kB compressed). That’s 34% smaller by raw size. If you’re stuck maintaining an existing Next.js codebase, TanStack Start offers a legitimate escape path from App Router complexity while staying in React. But that’s still 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) of React’s core runtime.</p>
<p><strong>TanStack Start with Solid:</strong> Delivers 182.6 kB raw (60.4 kB compressed). That’s 30% larger than SolidStart’s 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed), but still dramatically better than any React option. The size difference is largely due to TanStack Router having more features than SolidStart’s Router. This buys you additional routing capabilities and framework flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>The controlled comparison that matters:</strong> React at 373.6 kB raw (118.2 kB compressed) versus Solid at 182.6 kB raw (60.4 kB compressed) using identical TanStack Start infrastructure. Same routing, same SSR approach, same patterns. React bundles are 2x the size of Solid. This isolates React’s runtime cost versus Solid’s architecture. No meta-framework differences, no excuses.</p>
<p>All four implementations achieve perfect 100 Lighthouse scores. Bundle size differences are real, but modern devices handle them without impacting perceived performance in this test.</p>
<p><strong>For greenfield projects?</strong> Don’t choose React. TanStack Start with Solid gives you 182.6 kB raw (60.4 kB compressed) bundles, but native SolidStart delivers 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed) with tighter integration. If you want the absolute smallest with this architecture, go SolidStart. If you like TanStack Start’s patterns and might want framework flexibility later, TanStack Start with Solid is reasonable. But starting a new project with React (whether Next.js or TanStack Start) means voluntarily accepting 2x to 3x larger bundles for no performance gain.</p>
<h2 id="the-verdict-what-im-recommending">The Verdict: What I’m Recommending</h2>
<p>After building ten implementations (with help, of course; see the acknowledgements below) and measuring everything, the data gives clear direction. For our mobile first requirements, here’s what I found:</p>
<p><strong>The next-gen frameworks all achieve essentially instant performance.</strong> The 35-39ms FCP range feels perceptually identical to users, and it’s 12 to 13 times faster than Next.js at 467ms. Since all next-gen frameworks feel equally fast, choose based on bundle size priorities and developer experience rather than microscopic FCP differences.</p>
<p>That said, context matters. Not every project can or should switch frameworks.</p>
<p><strong>When Next.js still makes sense:</strong> For large existing React codebases, migration costs may outweigh performance benefits. If you’re stuck with React and can’t migrate, consider TanStack Start over Next.js for a 21-31% bundle reduction without App Router complexity. That’s a practical business decision. But for greenfield projects? There’s no legacy to maintain, no migration costs to weigh. You’re choosing to build on a foundation that costs your users 2x to 3x more JavaScript on every visit. You’re voluntarily accepting worse performance when better options cost nothing extra. That’s not a neutral technical choice. “We only know React” isn’t a technical constraint, it’s a learning investment decision. And “organizational politics” is real, but it’s not a technical justification. It’s an admission that better options exist but can’t be chosen.</p>
<p><strong>Reality check on common objections:</strong></p>
<p><strong>“But hiring!”</strong> Competent developers learn frameworks. That’s the job. These alternatives are actually easier to learn than React: no rules of hooks, no dependency arrays, no manual memoization dance. The real difficulty isn’t learning curve, it’s creating a engineering culture that acknowledges constraints and makes intentional decisions with these constraints in mind.</p>
<p><strong>“But ecosystem!”</strong> React’s ecosystem is both advantage and liability. Large libraries ship code for scenarios you’ll never encounter. That date picker with every locale? You need 3 features, you’re shipping 300. For mobile-first projects where every kilobyte matters, this becomes a problem. Modern AI tools make building exactly what you need feasible: generate the function instead of importing 50kB for 3 features. Smaller bundles, code you understand.</p>
<p><strong>“But it’s risky!”</strong> Shipping 3x larger bundles to mobile users on cellular is the actual risk. Slow loads damage your brand and cost conversions. The “safe choice” has measurable costs.</p>
<p><strong>“But my users are desktop-only!”</strong> Let’s be honest: “desktop-only” is usually an excuse to skip performance discipline entirely. And it’s rarely true for long. Six months later someone asks “can I check this on my phone?” and suddenly you’re stuck. Better to build it right from the start. Desktop users still benefit from faster parsing and execution. Even on WiFi, 30.6 kB compressed loads noticeably faster than 176.3 kB compressed. More importantly, why would you voluntarily accept 3x worse performance when the better option costs nothing extra? Performance is a feature regardless of screen size. Building with constraints makes you a better engineer. “Desktop-only” shouldn’t mean “no discipline.”</p>
<p><strong>Why you should seriously consider the alternatives</strong>: The mental models are often simpler (see Framework Architectures section). Alternatives like Solid, Svelte, and Marko streamline patterns with automatic reactivity. Performance comes by default with 2x to 6x smaller bundles requiring no optimization work. Mobile web matters with real users on phones, cellular connections, and mid-tier devices. You’ll write less code, ship less JavaScript, and debug fewer framework quirks. Most importantly, greenfield projects deserve choices made on merit rather than defaults.</p>
<p><strong>These alternatives are especially compelling</strong> for mobile-first applications where bundle size directly impacts user experience. They matter for the growing demographic of people who prefer phones over computers. Mobile professionals like real estate agents, field service workers, healthcare staff, delivery drivers, and sales reps benefit most. Teams building internal tools or MVPs without enterprise politics constraining decisions can move faster. Developers who value technical excellence over popularity contests will appreciate the engineering quality. Importantly, teams save significant money by maintaining a single high-performance web codebase instead of splitting resources between separate web and native applications. This often means smaller teams, lower overhead, and faster iteration cycles compared to organizations maintaining web apps and native mobile apps.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing among the alternatives</strong> (organized by primary use case):</p>
<p><strong>Smallest Bundles: Choose Marko</strong> for the absolute best bundle sizes (6.8 to 28.8 kB compressed). Marko delivers 44% smaller bundles than the next closest competitor, making it the clear winner when bundle size is your top priority. The MPA architecture ships minimal JavaScript per page, staying lean as you add routes. The developer experience is excellent once you embrace its streaming model. Note: Marko 6 is currently in beta (tagged as <code>next</code> on npm) and expected to leave beta by end of year, with no expected API changes but ongoing bug fixes and optimizations.</p>
<p><strong>JSX Familiarity: Choose SolidStart</strong> if you want the easiest migration path from React. At 128.6 kB raw (41.5 kB compressed), SolidStart uses JSX syntax with automatic dependency tracking that eliminates manual memoization. This delivers 4.39x smaller bundles than Next.js while feeling immediately familiar to React developers. The mental model is actually simpler than React because signals are more straightforward than hooks.</p>
<p><strong>Best All-Around Developer Experience: Choose SvelteKit</strong> for approachable syntax and excellent defaults. At 125.2 kB raw (54.1 kB compressed), SvelteKit delivers 4.51x smaller bundles than Next.js with progressive enhancement by default and minimal framework overhead. The compiler-based approach means less runtime code and cleaner component logic. Best for developers from any background seeking readable code with few framework quirks.</p>
<p><strong>Resumability Pattern: Choose Qwik City</strong> if you have a larger application that demands immediate interactivity on load with significant client-side functionality. At 88.5 to 114.8 kB raw (43.6 to 58.4 kB compressed), Qwik uses resumability instead of hydration, yielding instant time-to-interactive. Different architectural approach that solves different scaling problems.</p>
<p><strong>Established Ecosystem: Choose Nuxt</strong> if you want Vue’s mature plugin ecosystem with competitive mobile web performance. At 224.9 kB raw (72.3 kB compressed), Nuxt proves that established “big three” frameworks can achieve next-gen performance when properly configured. Best for teams already familiar with Vue, projects that benefit from extensive community plugins, or teams that value the safety of a well-established framework. Nuxt bridges the gap between the familiar and the performant.</p>
<p><strong>Important scaling consideration:</strong> Marko’s MPA architecture ships minimal JavaScript per page (stays lean as you add routes), while SPAs like SvelteKit and SolidStart ship routing and framework runtime upfront then add route chunks. Both use code splitting, but the architectural models create different performance characteristics at scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As discussed in my <a href="https://www.lorenstew.art/blog/progressive-complexity-manifesto">Progressive Complexity Manifesto</a>, these Level 5 frameworks are only necessary when you need unified client-side state and complex reactivity. Most apps can thrive at lower levels with simpler tools like HTMX and vanilla JS/TS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When developers have real alternatives, everyone wins. React wouldn’t be adding a compiler if SolidStart and Svelte weren’t proving that automatic optimization matters. The entire ecosystem improves when we stop accepting “good enough” as the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>My recommendation for the team:</strong> After building all these implementations, <strong>Marko, SolidStart, and SvelteKit are all excellent choices</strong> that would serve our mobile first requirements well. All three feel perceptually instant to users. The real question is priorities: absolute smallest bundles (Marko), easiest React migration (SolidStart), or best all-around developer experience (SvelteKit). If the team has Vue experience, Nuxt is also compelling with its mature ecosystem and competitive performance.</p>
<p>For personal projects outside of work, I’ll be reaching for SvelteKit and increasingly Marko. Their developer experience just feels right, the code flows naturally, and they make building things fun.</p>

<p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong></p>
<p>FCP (First Contentful Paint) indicates when the first content appears on screen. LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) shows when the main content becomes visible. TBT (Total Blocking Time) measures how long the main thread remains blocked and unavailable for user interactions. CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) evaluates visual stability, where 0 represents perfect stability with no unexpected layout shifts.</p>
<p><strong>Measurement Conditions</strong>: These scores represent mobile device emulation using Pixel 5 profile with 4G network throttling (10 Mbps download, 40ms round-trip time). I use 1x CPU (no throttling) to isolate bundle size and network impact from CPU performance, which allows fair comparison across frameworks with different runtime characteristics. Each measurement was run 10 times with cache cleared between runs to capture cold-load (first-visit) performance. Server warmup requests and IQR outlier removal ensure robust statistics. Standard deviations vary based on framework characteristics.</p>
<p>But here’s what these metrics hide. All frameworks achieve perfect or near perfect scores (100), but the paint times tell the real story about architectural differences. SolidStart achieves the fastest board page load at 35ms FCP. Nuxt and SvelteKit tie for second at 38ms FCP, with Marko close behind at 39ms. TanStack Start with Solid and TanStack Start with React follow at 40ms and 43ms respectively, showing excellent optimization. <strong>The top eight frameworks (SolidStart, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Marko, TanStack variants, Analog, Astro, Qwik) all render in under 60ms, achieving near-instant perceived performance.</strong> Only Next.js lags dramatically behind at 467ms FCP, representing a 13.3x performance gap compared to SolidStart for identical functionality.</p>
<p>Those paint time differences matter in the real world. SolidStart’s 35ms FCP feels instant, while Next.js’s 467ms FCP is noticeably slower. The framework choice directly impacts whether your app feels like a premium tool or a liability.</p>
<h3 id="where-the-difference-shows">Where the Difference Shows</h3>
<p>All frameworks feel instant in optimal conditions. The twist is this. Smaller bundles (Marko, Solid, Svelte, Qwik) win dramatically on slow networks and mid-tier devices.</p>
<p>On desktop with WiFi, all these frameworks are fast. On cellular with a mid-tier phone, 3.54 to 39.2x smaller bundles create measurably better UX. The 130 kB you saved doesn’t just download faster. It also parses and executes faster on mobile CPUs.</p>
<p><strong>Hydration vs Resumability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional (React, Solid, Svelte, Vue, Angular)</strong>: Download bundle → Parse JS → Execute all components → Attach event listeners (hydration)</li>
<li><strong>Marko</strong>: Download minimal JS → Run effects and attach event listeners directly (fine-grained tree shaking, no re-execution of server code)</li>
<li><strong>Qwik</strong>: Download minimal JS → Resume from serialized HTML → Lazily load interaction handlers on demand</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Marko and Qwik are resumable frameworks that avoid traditional hydration. The key difference is that Qwik uses <em>lazy</em> resumability, progressively loading JavaScript based on actual interactions, while Marko analyzes the reactivity graph at build time to bundle exactly the code needed for events and effects; no lazy loading, but maximum precision in what gets shipped. Traditional frameworks must re-execute all components just to wire up event listeners.</p>
<h3 id="addressing-common-critiques">Addressing Common Critiques</h3>
<p>I know what some of you are thinking. “Aren’t you comparing MPAs to SPAs unfairly?” And “Is this app complex enough?”</p>
<p><strong>App Complexity Defense</strong>: This isn’t some toy todo list. It’s a solid mid-complexity app with real database persistence using SQLite plus Drizzle ORM, relational queries across boards to lists to cards to tags and comments, drag-and-drop reordering, (some) optimistic updates, modals, and server validation. It matches the kind of internal tools or MVPs teams crank out every day. The bundle differences come straight from framework overhead, not the features themselves, and those gaps only get bigger at scale with more routes and dependencies. If your production app throws in auth or real-time stuff, framework baselines would just bloat even more, not shrink.</p>
<p><strong>MPA vs SPA Nuances</strong>: The routing pattern debate misses the point, reactivity models matter way more. With features like <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API">View Transitions API</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API">Speculation Rules API</a>, MPAs like Marko or HTMX feel just as snappy as SPAs for navigation. The real split is in scaling. MPAs ship minimal JS per page, for example Marko sticks to 6.8 to 28.8 kB, while SPAs lug around upfront runtime from 83.9 to 666.5 kB baselines plus chunks.</p>
<p><strong>A Note on Ecosystems</strong>: the “small ecosystem” concern is often overstated. For mobile-first applications, we should be extremely selective about every dependency we add. Each package increases bundle size and maintenance burden. Modern AI tools like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor excel at generating focused code for your specific use case. Instead of importing a 50 kB library for 3 features, AI can help you write exactly what you need in 2 kB. This approach yields smaller bundles, code you actually understand, and <a href="https://github.blog/security/supply-chain-security/our-plan-for-a-more-secure-npm-supply-chain/">fewer supply chain risks</a>. Large ecosystems are sometimes advantageous, but they’re also a liability when every import costs your mobile users.</p>
<h2 id="does-complexity-buy-you-anything">Does Complexity Buy You Anything?</h2>
<p>If Next.js’s bundles are only 21 to 31% larger than TanStack Start (both using React), what are you actually getting for that extra 44 to 54 kB? And more importantly, do the dominant frameworks’ baselines (React at 100.7 to 118.2 kB compressed, Vue at 72.3 kB compressed, Angular at 125.4 to 203.4 kB compressed) buy you anything compared to alternatives that deliver 30.6 to 54.1 kB compressed?</p>
<h3 id="the-complexity-tax">The Complexity Tax</h3>
<p>Each of the big three has conceptual complexity that alternatives avoid. React has rules around hooks and dependency arrays. Angular carries dependency injection patterns and RxJS complexity. Vue requires understanding refs and reactivity tracking. After seeing that TanStack Start (with React) only achieves marginal improvements over Next.js (21 to 31%), it’s clear that framework complexity and bundle weight often go hand-in-hand. Here’s how state management, effects, and data fetching compare:</p>

<p>The “big three” frameworks each carry conceptual complexity, though with different outcomes. React has rules around hooks and dependency arrays. Angular brings enterprise patterns like dependency injection alongside RxJS streams. Vue requires understanding refs and .value access, but unlike React and Angular, Vue (via Nuxt) has proven it can deliver competitive mobile web performance despite this complexity. These patterns become familiar with practice but never fully disappear and add cognitive overhead. Meta-frameworks compound these complexities: Next.js adds Server/Client boundaries and RSC serialization, Analog brings full Angular DI to the server, and Nuxt adds caching layers and composable patterns.</p>
<p>Most alternatives are conceptually simpler once learned. Svelte is most approachable (looks like enhanced HTML/JS). Solid and Marko use automatic tracking that eliminates manual dependency management. No rules of hooks, no dependency arrays, no .value boilerplate. The simpler mental models correlate with smaller bundles: less runtime complexity means less code to ship.</p>
<h2 id="does-nextjs-16s-built-in-compiler-change-anything">Does Next.js 16’s Built-in Compiler Change Anything?</h2>
<p>The React team recognizes the complexity problem. Their solution, now fully integrated in Next.js 16: the React Compiler automatically handles memoization to reduce re-renders.</p>
<h3 id="what-the-compiler-does">What the Compiler Does</h3>
<p>The React Compiler analyzes your code and inserts <code>useMemo</code> and <code>useCallback</code> automatically. In Next.js 16, this is no longer experimental; it’s built-in and enabled by default. It’s a genuine improvement that reduces boilerplate.</p>
<h3 id="the-results">The Results</h3>
<p>The compiler helps with re-render optimization and removes manual memoization boilerplate. But it doesn’t address Next.js’s bundle size: Next.js ships 176.3 kB compressed (564.9 kB raw) for the board page while TanStack Start ships 118.2 kB compressed (373.6 kB raw) with the same React 19. The compiler can’t eliminate dependency arrays for <code>useEffect</code>. You still need to understand hooks, closures, and React’s rendering model.</p>
<h3 id="the-irony">The Irony</h3>
<p>The compiler improves React’s developer experience, which is valuable. But it highlights an interesting contrast. React optimizes Virtual DOM re-renders, while alternatives like SolidStart eliminate re-renders entirely through fine-grained reactivity. SvelteKit’s compiler eliminates much of the runtime overhead at build time. Qwik eliminates hydration cost through resumability.</p>
<p>The difference in philosophy is clear. React’s compiler optimizes the existing model. The alternatives questioned the model itself.</p>
<h2 id="the-web-is-the-last-commons-why-this-matters-beyond-frameworks">The Web is the Last Commons: Why This Matters Beyond Frameworks</h2>
<p>Here’s where this gets bigger than framework choice. When you ship a native app to the App Store or Google Play instead of building a web app, you’re not just making a technical decision. You’re accepting a deal that would’ve been unthinkable twenty years ago. Apple and Google each take up to 30% of every transaction (with exceptions depending on program and category). They set rules. They decide what you can ship. They can revoke your access tomorrow with no recourse. You have no alternative market. You can’t even compete on price because the fee is baked into many transactions.</p>
<p>Economist Yanis Varoufakis calls this “technofeudalism” in his book of the same name. The App Store isn’t a marketplace, it’s a fiefdom. Developers are digital serfs, bound to the cloud lords’ land (their platforms) with no exit. Users get locked into this too. The App Store is a curated garden where algorithms owned by two companies decide what you see. Your data gets harvested. Your choices get filtered. You’re not a customer with alternatives, you’re a subject in a walled garden.</p>
<p>The web? The web is different. No single company takes a cut. No algorithm curates your choices. Distribution is direct. Users can actually vote with their feet. It’s not perfect, but it’s the closest thing we have left to an open market where developers retain agency and users retain choice.</p>
<p>When companies abandon the web to go app-only, they’re not making a neutral technical decision. They’re voluntarily moving their users from a competitive marketplace into a feudal system. And yeah, I know that sounds dramatic, but Varoufakis has spent years documenting how the economics of digital platforms have created exactly this dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>Why you should care, no matter what you believe:</strong></p>
<p>If you lean capitalist, app stores create an environment that is the opposite of what capitalism is supposed to be. Monopolistic rent extraction replacing competition and innovation. No market mechanism to challenge them. That’s not capitalism, that’s just extraction.</p>
<p>If you lean anti-capitalist, technofeudalism is arguably worse than regular capitalism because at least capitalism has friction and regulatory handles. This has neither. It’s total private control with zero market competition.</p>
<p>Either way, the web is the last place where economic activity can happen outside the thumb of tech oligarchs. Building web apps matters. Shipping small, fast, performant web apps matters even more, and most web traffic comes from the mobile web. Every kilobyte you save is another reason for teams to choose the web over building a native app subject to app store control and fees.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-what-this-evaluation-revealed">Conclusion: What This Evaluation Revealed</h2>
<p>What started as a simple framework comparison for an upcoming work project turned into something more revealing. The data shows clearly what’s possible when frameworks prioritize mobile web performance from the start.</p>
<p>The evaluation revealed what happens when you rethink fundamentals. SolidStart, SvelteKit, Qwik, and Marko represent different architectural priorities that push boundaries in ways the dominant frameworks cannot. Competition drives innovation. These alternatives show what’s achievable when mobile web performance is the primary design constraint, not an afterthought.</p>
<p>For teams serving mobile professionals on cellular networks (like ours), these costs are paid on every visit. React and Angular often face architectural performance ceilings. Vue proved that established frameworks can compete when properly configured. And remember, these measurements represent initial page loads. MPA frameworks maintain their lean profile across routes, while SPAs add route chunks to their baseline.</p>
<p>For anyone starting a new project, the evaluation raises an important question: <strong>Is there any reason to make your app 25.9x heavier than necessary?</strong> (And that’s before adding the authentication, analytics, and third party libraries that typically multiply production bundle sizes 5 to 10 times, making the real world gap even larger.) Building an app that works well on mobile isn’t difficult if you make good architectural decisions at the beginning. The right choice early on means your app performs well everywhere, not just on desktop WiFi. Choose MPA frameworks for the leanest per page bundles, or lightweight SPAs for excellent performance with familiar patterns.</p>
<p>Here’s what the evaluation made clear: <strong>if you want to build a better product than your competitors, why would you build exactly like them?</strong> When everyone uses Next.js, winning on performance requires fighting React’s architecture. When you use Marko, SolidStart, SvelteKit, or Nuxt instead, the advantage comes easily. Your app is faster by default. Your bundle is smaller without optimization work. Your users get a better experience without extra effort. That’s not just good engineering. That’s differentiation.</p>
<p>When you pick Marko and ship 28.8 kB instead of Next.js at 176.3 kB, you’re not just making your users’ experience better on cellular networks. You’re making the web more competitive. You’re making it a more attractive place for companies to exist. You’re pushing back against the gravity that pulls everything toward native only distribution.</p>
<h2 id="reproducing-these-results">Reproducing These Results</h2>
<p>All measurements in this comparison follow a rigorous statistical methodology designed for reproducibility and defensibility. Each framework was measured 10 times per page using Chrome Lighthouse with mobile emulation (Pixel 5, 4G throttling, 1x CPU). Server warmup requests stabilize performance before measurements. IQR (Interquartile Range) outlier removal ensures robust statistics. Browser cache was cleared between runs to measure cold-load performance that simulates first-visit experience. I report median values to reduce the impact of outliers, and standard deviations quantify measurement reliability. The complete methodology including statistical approach, test environment details, compression detection, known limitations, and reproducibility instructions is documented at <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison/blob/main/METHODOLOGY.md">METHODOLOGY.md</a>.</p>
<h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2>
<p><strong>Try it yourself</strong>: Clone the <a href="https://github.com/lorenseanstewart/kanban-comparison">repository</a>, build all ten implementations, and test them on a throttled 3G connection in Chrome DevTools. When mobile web is your only option, the numbers tell a clear story.</p>
<p><strong>On a less serious note</strong>: You can take a look at all ten apps to examine how the code looks and get a general feel for each framework. I advocate coding for fun, and the code in the repo might be a great place to help you try something new.</p>
<p><strong>Share your experience</strong>: Have you tried Marko, SolidStart, SvelteKit, Qwik, or Nuxt? What framework would you choose for a mobile-first project and why? I’d love to hear your thoughts on Twitter or Bluesky.</p>
<p><strong>Keep exploring</strong>: The full metrics data and measurement methodology are available in the repository for you to verify, reproduce, or extend. Build your own comparison and share your findings.</p>
<p>The real winner? You. Your team. Your users. When you start your next project with Marko, SolidStart, or SvelteKit, you’ll ship faster, smaller, and with less framework overhead. That’s a real competitive advantage.</p>

<p>No his­tor­i­cal fig­ure bet­ter fits the def­i­n­i­tion of “Renais­sance man” than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci">Leonar­do da Vin­ci</a>, but that term has become so overused as to become mis­lead­ing. We use it to express mild sur­prise that one per­son could use both their left and right hemi­spheres equal­ly well. But in Leonardo’s day, peo­ple did not think of them­selves as hav­ing two brains, and the worlds of art and sci­ence were not so far apart as they are now.</p>
<p>That Leonar­do was able to com­bine fine arts and fine engi­neer­ing may not have been over­ly sur­pris­ing to his con­tem­po­raries, though he was an extra­or­di­nar­i­ly bril­liant exam­ple of the phe­nom­e­non. The more we learn about him, the more we see how close­ly relat­ed the two pur­suits were in his mind.</p>


<p>He approached every­thing he did as a tech­ni­cian. The uncan­ny effects he achieved in paint­ing were the result, as in so much Renais­sance art, of math­e­mat­i­cal pre­ci­sion, care­ful study, and first­hand obser­va­tion.</p>

<p>His artis­tic projects were also exper­i­ments. Some of them failed, as most exper­i­ments do, and some he aban­doned, as he did so many sci­en­tif­ic projects. No mat­ter what, he nev­er under­took any­thing, whether mechan­i­cal, anatom­i­cal, or artis­tic, with­out care­ful plan­ning and design, as his copi­ous note­books tes­ti­fy. As more and more of those note­books have become avail­able online, both Renais­sance schol­ars and laypeo­ple alike have learned con­sid­er­ably more about how Leonardo’s mind worked.</p>
<p>First, there was the <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-codex-arundel-mapping-leonardo-s-working-life-the-british-library/5AUBtgGQK_TgJQ?hl=en"><em>Codex Arun­del</em></a>. It is, writes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/feb/12/leonardo-da-vinci-notebooks-art">Jonathan Jones at <em>The Guardian</em></a>, “the liv­ing record of a uni­ver­sal mind”—but also, specif­i­cal­ly, the mind of a “technophile.” Then, the Vic­to­ria and Albert Nation­al Art Library <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2018/08/leonardo-da-vincis-earliest-notebooks-now-digitized-and-made-free-online.html">announced the dig­i­ti­za­tion of<em> Codex Forster</em></a>, which con­tains some of Leonardo’s ear­li­est note­books. Now The Visu­al Agency has released&nbsp;<a href="https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview">a com­plete dig­i­ti­za­tion of Leonardo’s <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em></a>, a huge col­lec­tion of the artist, engi­neer, and inventor’s fine­ly-illus­trat­ed notes.</p>

<p>“No oth­er col­lec­tion counts more orig­i­nal papers writ­ten by Leonar­do,” <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA">notes Google</a>. The <em>Codex Atlanti­cus</em> “con­sists of 1119 papers, most of them drawn or writ­ten on both sides.” Its name has “noth­ing to do with the Atlantic Ocean, or with some eso­teric, mys­te­ri­ous con­tent hid­den in its pages.” The 12-vol­ume col­lec­tion acquired its title because the draw­ings and writ­ings were bound with the same size paper that was used for mak­ing atlases. Gath­ered in the 16th cen­tu­ry by sculp­tor Pom­peo Leoni, the papers descend­ed from Leonardo’s close stu­dent Gio­van Francesco Melzi, who was entrust­ed with them after his teacher’s death.</p>
<p>The his­to­ry of the Codex itself makes for a fas­ci­nat­ing nar­ra­tive, much of which you can learn at Google’s <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/rwKy3jZHwWiyJA">Ten Key Facts slideshow</a>. The note­books span Leonardo’s career, from 1478, when he was “still work­ing in his native Tus­cany, to 1519, when he died in France.” The col­lec­tion was tak­en from Milan by Napoleon and brought to France, where it remained in the Lou­vre until 1815, when the Con­gress of Vien­na ruled that all art­works stolen by the for­mer Emper­or be returned. (The emis­sary tasked with return­ing the Codex could not deci­pher Leonardo’s mir­ror writ­ing and took it for Chi­nese.)</p>

<p><a href="https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview">The Codex</a> con­tains not only engi­neer­ing dia­grams, anato­my stud­ies, and artis­tic sketch­es, but also fables writ­ten by Leonar­do, inspired by Flo­ren­tine lit­er­a­ture. And it&nbsp;fea­tures <a href="https://www.openculture.com/2023/10/the-resume-of-leonardo-da-vinci-1482.html">Leonardo’s famed “CV,</a>” a let­ter he wrote to the Duke of Milan describ­ing in nine points his qual­i­fi­ca­tions for the post of mil­i­tary engi­neer. In point four, he writes, “I still have very con­ve­nient bomb­ing meth­ods that are easy to trans­port; they launch stones and sim­i­lar such in a tem­pest full of smoke to fright­en the ene­my, caus­ing great dam­age and con­fu­sion.”</p>
<p>As if in illus­tra­tion, else­where in the Codex, the draw­ing above appears, “one of the most cel­e­brat­ed” of <a href="https://codex-atlanticus.ambrosiana.it/#/Overview">the col­lec­tion</a>.”&nbsp;It was “shown to trav­el­ing for­eign­ers vis­it­ing the Ambrosiana [the Bib­liote­ca Ambrosiana in Milan, where the Codex resides] since the 18th cen­tu­ry, usu­al­ly arous­ing much amaze­ment.” It is still amaz­ing, espe­cial­ly if we con­sid­er the pos­si­bil­i­ty that its artistry might have been some­thing of a byprod­uct for its cre­ator, whose pri­ma­ry moti­va­tion seems to have been solv­ing tech­ni­cal problems—in the most ele­gant ways imag­in­able.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Have you noticed that quite a few people are looking for technical cofounders
or CTOs right now? I, for one, get a surprising amount of these queries; most
of them along the lines of <em>“hey, I have this vibe-coded app, would you like to
make it production-ready”</em>. I have sort of a profile for these people. Think
someone who knows their business but has always lacked the technical skills to
make their ideas happen — a legal counsel, perhaps, or an account manager.</p>
<p><em>Why would these people need me?</em> That's what I've thought about a little bit,
and I think there is an important signal here: What is it exactly that they
can’t get done with GenAI alone? This is something everyone is trying to
understand, right? Everyone wants to know what these models can do. Or, to be a
little blunt, everyone wants to know which jobs are soon to become obsolete.
The fact that I get these requests says something about software engineering. I
mean, if software engineering was automated, no one would be looking for
technical cofounders.</p>
<p>Well, I think I know why we get these proposals. The thing is that <strong>AI can
code, but it can't build software.</strong> This is the conclusion I've come to after
spending a significant amount of time writing AI-assisted code and watching
demos by other people.</p>
<p>There is old wisdom that says: <em>Coding is easy, software engineering is hard.</em>
It seems fair enough to say that LLMs are already able to automate a lot of
coding. GPT-5 and the like solve isolated well-defined problems with a pretty
nice success rate. Coding, however, is not what most people are getting paid
for. Building a production-ready app is not coding, it’s software engineering.</p>
<p>The way I see it is that coding becomes software engineering around the point
where you try to turn your demo into a real product — which happens to be
exactly the point where these people reach out to you with their pitch.</p>
<p>I don’t really know why AI can't build software (for now). Maybe it has to do
with the nature of the job. When you write software for a living, your main
task is to deal with complexity. The average production software only does a
bunch of easy things. The challenge is doing hundreds of these easy things at
once, and keeping the whole thing maintainable. Or, to rephrase this in the
present context: It's one thing to demonstrate a feature. It's a much more
difficult thing to build that feature in a manner that supports integration,
expansion, and long-term maintainability.</p>
<p>When you look at the code these people send you, you realize that “making the
app production-ready” really means torching the whole thing and starting from
scratch.</p>
<p>I think this says a lot about where we are at right now.</p>
