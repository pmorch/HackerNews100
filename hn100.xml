Logpoints are breakpoints that log to the console without pausing execution. While Microsoft Edge has had logpoints built-in for a while and Chrome just added them in v73, Firefox does not. But, we can use conditional breakpoints to simulate them in any browser.</p><p><img alt="Conditional Breakpoint - console.log" loading="lazy" width="756" height="337" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" srcset="https://alan.norbauer.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconditional-breakpoint-console-log.2d18d3e4.gif&amp;w=828&amp;q=75 1x, https://alan.norbauer.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconditional-breakpoint-console-log.2d18d3e4.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75 2x" src="https://alan.norbauer.com/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fconditional-breakpoint-console-log.2d18d3e4.gif&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75"></p><p>Use <code>console.count</code> instead of <code>console.log</code> if you also want a running count of how many times the line is executed.</p><p>UPDATE (May 2020): All the major browsers now directly support logpoints/tracepoints (<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/01/devtools#logpoints" alt="Chrome Logpoints Documentation">Chrome Logpoints</a>, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide/debugger#breakpoints" alt="Edge Tracepoint Documentation">Edge Tracepoints</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Set_a_logpoint" alt="Firefox Logpoint Documentation">Firefox Logpoints</a>)</p><section><h4 id="watch-pane"><a href="#watch-pane">Watch Pane</a></h4><p>You can also use <code>console.log</code> in the watch pane.

Now, after any DOM subtree modification, the debugger will pause execution and the new DOM snapshot will be at the end of the <code>window.doms</code> array. (There is no way to create a DOM mutation breakpoint that doesn’t pause execution.)</p></section><section><h4 id="tracing-callstacks"><a href="#tracing-callstacks">Tracing Callstacks</a></h4><p>Let’s say you have a function that shows a loading spinner and a function that hides it, but somewhere in your code you’re calling the show method without a matching hide call.

In your starting point set a breakpoint with the condition <code>console.time('label')</code> and at the end point set a breakpoint with the condition <code>console.timeEnd('label')</code>.

<p>Apple illegally discriminated against US citizens and other US residents in its hiring and recruitment practices for certain types of positions that went to foreign workers, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-25-million-landmark-agreement-apple-resolve-employment">said yesterday</a>. Apple agreed to pay up to $25 million in back pay and civil penalties to settle the DOJ allegations.</p>
<p>Apple discriminated "against US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire," the agency said. The $25 million payment was called the largest ever collected by the Justice Department under the anti-discrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).</p>
<p>Apple is required to pay $6.75 million in civil penalties and create an $18.25 million fund to provide back pay to those harmed by its hiring practices. Apple did not admit guilt in the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-11/ier-apple_settlement_agreement_signed_2023-11-08_fully_executed.pdf">settlement</a>. But the company acknowledged in a statement that it had "unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard," <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-agrees-25-million-settlement-with-us-over-hiring-immigrants-2023-11-09/">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
<p>"We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US," Apple said. We contacted Apple and will update this article if it provides any further statement.</p>
<p>As Reuters noted, "Foreign labor can often be cheaper than hiring US workers, and immigrants who rely on their employers for green card sponsorship are seen as less likely to leave for a different job."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>DOJ investigation</h2>
<p>The DOJ said it began investigating in February 2019 and determined "that Apple violated the INA's anti-discrimination requirements during Apple's recruitment for positions falling under the permanent labor certification program (PERM)." The agency said the discrimination began no later than January 1, 2018, and continued until at least December 31, 2019.</p>
<p><span>Under this program, a "permanent labor certification issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) allows an employer to hire a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States," the DOL </span><span><a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent"><span>says</span></a></span><span>. But the employer must also obtain a certification "that there are not sufficient US workers able, willing, qualified and available to accept the job opportunity in the area of intended employment and that employment of the foreign worker will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed US workers."</span></p>
<p>The DOJ said its investigation "found that Apple engaged in a pattern or practice of citizenship status discrimination in recruitment for positions it hired through PERM, and that the company's unlawful discrimination prejudiced US citizens, US nationals, lawful permanent residents, and those granted asylum or refugee status. These less effective recruitment practices deterred protected workers from applying to positions that Apple preferred to fill instead with PERM beneficiaries."</p>
<p>Apple did not advertise PERM positions on its external job website like it does with other positions, the DOJ said. "It also required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications, even though the company permitted electronic applications for other positions," the DOJ said.</p>
<p>In some cases, "Apple did not consider certain applications for PERM positions from Apple employees if those applications were submitted electronically, as opposed to paper applications submitted through the mail," the agency said. "These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire."</p>
<h2>Apple changes hiring practices</h2>
<p>The settlement requires Apple to make its PERM recruitment practices match its standard recruitment practices more closely. Apple will have to "conduct more expansive recruitment for all PERM positions, including posting PERM positions on its external job website, accepting electronic applications, and enabling applicants to PERM positions to be searchable in its applicant tracking system."</p>
<p>Apple has already implemented some of the changes and agreed to "train its employees on the INA's anti-discrimination requirements and be subject to departmental monitoring for the three-year period of the agreement," the DOJ said.</p>

<div>
<p>NEW YORK – Mr Danny Taing’s 55,000 Kit Kats began their long, twisted, and sometimes obscure journey in Japan.</p>
<p>Mr Taing is the founder of Bokksu, a New York company that sells Japanese snacks in subscription boxes, and he intended to make a tidy sum by flipping the sweets in the United States. </p>
<p>The KitKat shipment, which included sought-after flavours such as melon, matcha latte, and daifuku mochi, had cost US$110,000 (S$149,000), but Bokksu expected to make about US$250,000 in total revenue.</p>

<p>“You can fit a lot of KitKats into two containers,” Mr Taing said.</p>
<p>And they are a booming business. In Japan, enthusiasts clamour for the rarer flavours, with some sold for just a few weeks or only in a specific region. In the United States, obsessives fawn over the collectibles, comparing reviews on Japanese snack blogs and shelling out for limited editions.</p>
<p>These particular KitKats would become key players in an ultimately frustrating saga of shell e-mail accounts, phantom truckers, supply-chain fraud and one seriously bewildered cargo freight broker.</p>


<p>Interviews and e-mails shared with The New York Times tell the story of just one instance of “strategic theft”, a growing corner of the criminal world that the Federal Bureau of Investigation has said accounts for some US$30 billion in losses a year – with food being among the top targets.</p>

<p>The precious sweets landed safely enough in California, and were trucked about 48km across Los Angeles County to a temporary storage facility in South El Monte, run by a company called Japan Crate Acquisition.</p>
<p>After weeks of chugging across the Pacific Ocean, they just needed to make the remaining leg of their journey to Bokksu’s warehouse in Carlstadt, New Jersey, and then into the hands of avid candy fans.</p>
<p>That was where Mr Shane Black came in.</p>

<p>Mr Black, who runs a freight brokering company called Freight Rate Central in Sarasota, Florida, is part of an invisible army of professionals who coordinate and marshal the fleets of trucks that criss-cross the country, carrying everything from chickens to smartphones. For this job, Bokksu would pay him about US$13,000.</p>
<p>Mr Black got to it. He posted the job on a trucking board that is something like a Craigslist for freight. Someone named Tristan with HCH Trucking accepted the job (though he was using a Gmail account), and said he would have the shipment picked up shortly.</p>
<p>On Aug 9, Tristan wrote in an e-mail: “Hey man, The first one is loaded and rolling, the second one we’ll pick it up tomorrow first thing in the morning.”</p>
<p>“There was nothing out of the ordinary,” Mr Black said in an interview.</p>
<h2>Coming clean</h2>
</div>

    <div>
<p>When the shipments failed to reach New Jersey days after any cross-country trip should have been completed, Mr Black started to have visions of KitKats melting in the summer heat.</p>
<p>“Please tell me the freight is in good order and has been refrigerated this whole time?” he e-mailed Tristan.</p>
<p>Tristan replied that one of the trucks had broken down in Washington, Pennsylvania, a small city just south-west of Pittsburgh. Tristan reassured him that the Kit Kats were cool and intact, but “if it’s not fixed by today we will have to head back to the shipper and re-unload them there”.</p>
<p>That sent up all kinds of red flags for Mr Black. If the truck was in good enough shape to drive over 3,800km back to California, why could it not make it fewer than 650km to New Jersey? So Mr Black called HCH Trucking.</p>
<p>“That’s when everything kind of hit the fan,” he said.</p>
<p>When he reached the HCH headquarters in Jersey City, New Jersey, he heard chaos in the background, sounds of panic. The representative told him that their information appeared to have been compromised. They had never heard of any Tristan.</p>
<p>If Mr Black was not dealing with HCH Trucking, who was he dealing with? And most important, where were the six figures’ worth of KitKats?</p>
<p>Seemingly on cue, Tristan followed up. “Time for some coming clean,” he confessed. “I’m actually a scammer and the owner of HCH doesn’t have anything to do with this.”</p>
<p>“Why though?” Mr Black replied plaintively. “What would you stand to gain? Can I please get access to the loads so I can get them to New Jersey? We’re not a big company at all. It‘s just me... I’m the owner and everything else.”</p>
<p>Tristan wrote back: “We’re trying to make money sir, I told you we’re scammers, really sorry I didn’t know your story, and hopefully the loads get to New Jersey.”</p>
<p>Tristan included the addresses of two warehouses, both just east of Los Angeles, where he had dropped the loads.</p>
</div>

  
  <div>
<p>The strange thing was that Mr Black had never paid Tristan any money; the shipping fee was due on delivery. If this was a con, so far it did not seem to be a very profitable one. In any case, Mr Black couldn’t believe his luck.</p>
<p>“When I found out they were at a cold-storage facility, I mean, I was just so happy,” he said. “I thought, ‘OK, we got the freight.’”</p>
<h2>Out of service</h2>
<p>Mr Black spun back into action. According to Tristan, one load was at Inland Empire Cold Storage in Jurupa Valley, California. The other was nearby, at Anytime Crossdock in Ontario, California. Tristan then went silent, and did not respond to repeated e-mails from NYTimes seeking comment.</p>
<p>Anytime was eager to get the load out of its warehouse and to be paid for nearly two weeks of storage.</p>
<p>It turned out that the KitKats had never left California. They had simply been driven about 50km east, put on ice and left to rack up storage fees.</p>
<p>“We would like to know when you are going to get this picked up,” Anytime wrote, “as we anticipated this to be a short-term storage request.”</p>
</div>

    <div>
<p>The outstanding balance for the storage was US$3,830. Mr Black said he paid US$2,000 of that out of his own pocket to secure the release of the freight, with the promise to pay the rest later. Anytime did not respond to repeated requests for comment from NYTimes.</p>
<p>Daunted but determined, he started the process over, posting the job again on the freight board. This time he said he got a bite from ‘Manny’ from MVK Transport.</p>
<p>According to Mr Black, Manny had the KitKats picked up. At least this half of the shipment was on its way to New Jersey, Mr Black believed. After a few days, though, communications turned spotty.</p>
<p>“I’ve been writing you for days now,” Mr Black e-mailed a few days later. “I called yesterday and you hung up and now your phone says it’s out of service.”</p>
<p>The next morning, he followed up, now furious: “How do you make money on this??? Are you going to sell KitKats on the corner???”</p>
<p>He had been had again. This time, the KitKats had disappeared for good into the expanse of Southern California’s freewayland. Requests for comment sent to MVK went unanswered.</p>
<h2>‘We cannot release the freight’</h2>
</div>

    <div>
<p>Inland Cold Empire Storage, at least, still had the other half of the KitKats, and Mr Black, by now frantic to salvage what he could of the candy, was still on the case.</p>
<p>“This load was stolen from us, and placed in your storage facility,” he wrote to Inland on Aug 21. Inland replied that its contract was with a man named Harry Centa.</p>
<p>“There is no ‘Harry’,” Mr Black explained. Bokksu, cc’ed on the e-mail, was the rightful owner. “‘Harry’ is a fictitious name.”</p>
<p>Harry Centa, however, is not a fictitious name. Mr Harry Centa lives in Ohio, and works in shipping. But the entire KitKat affair was news to him. “This is totally fraudulent and not me,” Mr Centa said in an e-mail to the NYTimes. “Good luck and hope they find the KitKats LOL.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Inland was unmoved: “Without proof that you are the rightful owner and payment for storage we cannot release the freight.”</p>
<p>Mr Black said he reached out to the sheriff’s departments of Riverside and San Bernardino counties, but said he was told<strong> </strong>jurisdictional issues kept them from getting involved, and no reports were filed.</p>
<p>He also turned to the team at Bokksu. Did they have anything that he could use to prove their ownership?</p>
<p>But Bokksu had essentially fired Mr Black in the meantime, stopped payment on his fee, filed a report with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department for insurance purposes, and decided to move on. The KitKats were dead to them.</p>
</div>

    <div>
<p>“I don’t know if I would be comfortable selling these to customers,” said Mr Taing, Bokksu’s founder. “What if something actually happens to customers that eat this, and we get sued?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the KitKats are still at Inland, according to the company’s chief executive officer Kevin Sacalas.</p>
<p>“We have no use for this product and would happily release it to anyone who would show proof of proper ownership and pay the storage fees,” Mr Sacalas wrote in an e-mail to NYTimes.</p>
</div>

  
  <div>
<h2>Chess v checkers</h2>
<p>The Bokksu KitKats are just one instance of an increasingly common computer-based form of fraud that some experts call “fictitious pickups” or “strategic theft”. It is part identity theft, part extortion. The freight, sometimes called a “hostage load”, can vanish if the extortion demands are not met.</p>
<p>“The more you unpeel the onion, the worse it gets,” said Mr Keith Lewis, vice-president of operations at CargoNet, which is part of the global data analytics and technology provider Verisk. He said that strategic cargo theft is up 700 per cent in 2023.</p>
<p>“The supply chain is moving at the speed of light,” he said, adding: “The bad guys are playing chess and we’re playing checkers. We’re two or three steps behind them.”</p>
<p>As for Bokksu, its insurance claim has been denied. So the blame is now flowing backward along that supply chain.</p>
<p>Bokksu holds Mr Black responsible. He fell for an obvious scam, they said, and the Gmail addresses should have been a red flag.</p>
<p>Mr Black said truckers do not always use company domains. Ultimately, he blames Japan Crate Acquisition, which originally released the KitKats to ‘Tristan’.</p>
<p>“Obviously it didn’t go to an HCH truck,” Mr Black said, and whoever loaded the shipment “should’ve been suspicious.”</p>
<p>In possibly the strangest twist on the KitKat trail, Bokksu announced in September that it had acquired Japan Crate. But NYTimes discovered that the acquisition had actually been completed back in June. So Bokksu, through a wholly owned subsidiary, had in effect overseen the loading of its own KitKats onto the original two fraudulent trucks.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing this for over two decades now, and I’ve never come across anything like this, anything of this magnitude,” Mr Black said. “It’s beyond crazy, it really is. Because there’s no answers.”</p>
<p>“I do feel cheated,” he added. “I just don’t know who is doing the cheating.” NYTIMES</p>

Often, as we've covered, these notifications and reminders ignore or actively push back against user intent—prompting you to sign up for Microsoft 365 if you already said no, or trying to make you use Edge or Bing after you've already installed Chrome.</p>

<p>Microsoft took another step down this path this week when it began testing a new addition to the Windows OneDrive app that would force users to explain themselves when quitting the app. <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/microsoft-wont-let-you-close-onedrive-in-windows-without-you-explaining-it-first/">Initially spotted by NeoWin</a>, the survey took the form of a drop-down menu, not unlike the ones you sometimes see when you try to unsubscribe from marketing or fundraising mailing lists.</p>
<p>Until you chose an answer from the drop-down, the "quit" button would be grayed out, preventing you from actually closing OneDrive.</p>
<p>This was an escalation from the previous behavior, which would ask you if you were sure before allowing you to quit but allowing you to actually click the "quit" button without interacting with any other menus. The old prompt was an explanation; the newer one was an imposition.</p>

<p>For its part, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/8/23952878/microsoft-onedrive-windows-close-app-notification">told The Verge</a> that the new prompt was a test that was only rolled out to a subset of OneDrive users and that the change has been reverted as of a couple of days ago.</p>
<p>"Between Nov. 1 and 8, a small subset of consumer OneDrive users were presented with a dialog box when closing the OneDrive sync client, asking for feedback on the reason they chose to close the application," reads Microsoft's statement. "This type of user feedback helps inform our ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of our products."</p>
<p>Reverted or not, the OneDrive prompt is of a piece with other things Microsoft does to encourage the usage of Edge, Bing, OneDrive, Microsoft 365, Game Pass, and its other services in Windows. You can always choose to avoid this kind of thing by declining to sign in to OneDrive or by uninstalling the app entirely. But it's just one more annoying default you need to change to make sure that modern Windows stays out of your way.</p>

<p>Leaders command people. That’s kind of what a leader is: someone with the authority to direct the actions of others. </p>



<p>But people don’t often appreciate being commanded. When you step into leadership you face this challenge: how do you direct the members of your team without offending them? How do you become a good boss, but not be “bossy”?</p>



<p>It’s worth starting this discussion with the reminder that most of what bosses do isn’t bossing at all. Although a leader <em>can</em> tell people what to do, we should be slow to do so. Most team discussions are dynamic and interactive. They should involve everyone without imposing much hierarchy. As a team we cultivate ideas. We imagine solutions. We consider potential tasks. We settle on a plan. The best work happens when the whole team is involved in understanding the problem, the chosen solution, and each person’s role in making it happen. Then each member has the knowledge and ownership to handle tasks skillfully and with passion. The leader’s primary job is to nurture this discussion, to make sure there is a divergence of options and then a convergence to a solid choice. Often this leadership involves no “bossing” at all.</p>



<p>But sometimes we should and must tell people what to do. Sometimes people need the clarity, the unambiguity of a direct instruction. Sometimes we do assign tasks. “You do this.”</p>



<p>We should rarely say it like that.</p>



<p>Usually there are better ways to give a command, ways that make our purpose clear while honoring and respecting the listener. It is possible to issue a command without it feeling like a command.</p>



<p>Even the word “command” can feel abrasive. But I’m going to use that term in this article. Technically, if you as a person in authority direct someone else to perform a task, you are commanding them.</p>



<p>The question we’ll answer today, then, is: how do you give a command in a way your team members will accept, won’t reject as “bossy,” and might even feel good about?</p>



<p>We’re going to focus on words. When you know you have to give a command (or directive or instruction or assignment), what words should you use?</p>



<p>Body language matters too. Tone of voice matters. The conversation that surrounds the command—what comes before and after—matters a lot.  But today let’s dive into the nitty-gritty. What are the <em>best words</em> to use?</p>



<p>Here’s a couple of examples.</p>



<p><em>“Get this done!”</em> That’s pretty harsh. Maybe sometimes this level of directness is necessary, but it’s no way to win friends or influence people.</p>



<p><em>“Do you think we could maybe see about possibly…”</em> That’s pretty cagey. You may come across sounding weak, and your directive may get lost.</p>



<p>The English language offers a wealth of options for how to give a command. Let’s look at them and consider which work best in this or that situation and which, if any, are never good for any situation. We’ll consider the example of telling someone to take out the trash—something most of us have been asked or told to do at some point. We’ll consider different ways you might command someone to take out the trash, see how it feels, and consider how <em>clear</em> the command is and how <em>harsh</em> it may feel.</p>

<p>From this menu of command forms you can build your own style of how, when the occasion warrants, you direct members of your team to do things.</p>



<h2>A Taxonomy of Commands</h2>



<p>“<strong>Take out the trash.”</strong> The simplest and most direct way to give a command is to use a straightforward imperative verb. “<em>Drive</em> me to the airport.” “<em>Send</em> me the report by the end of the day.” “<em>Turn in</em> your homework.” These are uncomplicated, bald directives that state the intended action plainly and make no bones about who’s the boss and who’s the bossed.</p>



<p>The benefit of using a direct imperative is that your intention is perfectly clear. The listener knows what you want done and who you want to do it. The downside is harshness. Although there are more abrasive ways to give a command (we’ll get to those), the imperative feels pretty in-your-face in most business cultures. Usually (but not always) there’s a better choice.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Please take out the trash.”</strong> The word “please” has an interesting and hard-to-define role in English usage. “Please” breaks down hierarchy and puts you on the same footing as your listener. It reaffirms the listener’s choice in the matter. Between friends, family members, and other peers it’s a crucial word, converting a command into an appeal. </p>



<p>You must judge for yourself what its effect is on the lips of a leader in a business setting. The effect varies widely based on circumstances and persons. </p>



<p>In general it has the advantage of coming across as appealing and polite. It has the disadvantage of not quite making the command definite. “Please” gives the listener an option. Do they really have an option? If the command really is indefinite—if you’re willing for the listener to say “no”—then “please” is just the right word to add. But if the listener is really obligated to obey, “please” might either make everyone feel better by preserving the public honor of the listener—the <em>illusion</em> of choice—or make everyone feel worse by exposing the leader as manipulative.</p>



<p>On balance, when giving your listener a real choice, adding “please” makes your request both clearer and more polite.</p>



<p>And keep “please” in mind while considering the other forms of command in this list. “Please” can be sprinkled into almost statement with similar, polite-ifying effects as the ones we discovered here.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Maybe take out the trash?” </strong>With the addition of one little word—”maybe”—and perhaps an upturned note at the end of the sentence to make it a question, the straightforward imperative becomes a much gentler request. The benefit is that you sound less bossy. The downside is that the command has lost its teeth, and the person you’re speaking to may simply ignore you. Leaders who direct others with “maybe” generally appear weak. You might make it work for your leadership style. Probably not.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“You’d better take out the trash.” </strong>Adding “you’d better” to the start of any imperative adds a note of menace, a threat. Whether you say it or not, the phrase “or else…” creeps onto the back of the command.</p>



<p>This is almost never a good move. Tossing a threat, however implied, toward someone you want or need to have a lasting relationship with is always counterproductive. The threat weakens the relationship. </p>



<p>There’s a further problem: the threat actually weakens the command itself. The fact that you have to invoke “you’d better” to get this person to do something shows that you don’t really have the innate authority to compel them to do it. The threat, not your own leadership, holds the power. With a command like this you might get someone to do something <em>once,</em> but your authority over this person—and anyone observing the exchange—now lives on borrowed time.</p>



<p>“You’d better” tends to be the weapon of choice of bullies and demagogues. You’d better avoid it.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★★</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“You will take out the trash.”</strong> One of the English language’s favorite ways of softening an imperative is to turn it into the <em>future tense.</em></p>



<p>On the face of it the future tense looks as if it’s expecting us to predict what the listener will do. “I am Carmac the Magnificent and I foresee that you will…<em>take out the trash!”</em> But we know that in fact this is a directive rather than a prediction, yet a slightly softer directive than the bare imperative.</p>



<p>How does it come across to the listener? The answer varies. If you stress the word “will” (or, heaven forbid, transmogrify it to “shall”), the directive is quite harsh and even threatening. But good leaders can say, “You will…” in a calm and inoffensive tone and convey a sense of solidity rather than threat. “What you’re going to do is to get the kitchen cleaned up. After that you’ll take out the trash.” In effect they’re directing: “Get the kitchen cleaned up. After that, take out the trash.” But the future tense with the proper tone comes across a little more gently.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I want you to take out the trash.” </strong>To my ear this is slightly gentler than a stark, “Take out the trash,” but tone of voice can make all the difference.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★★☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I need you to take out the trash.” </strong>The differences between these various ways of asking someone to do something may strike you as overly subtle, but often a grain of change can make a heap of difference. The shift here from “want” to “need” makes this command much more forceful, yet without seeming particularly harsh. </p>



<p>“I need you to…” is a very popular way of commanding. Many leaders prefer it over any other form. I’ve even seen it taught in assertiveness training classes. </p>



<p>The reason it works so well is that it makes an appeal to the listener that is very forceful yet neither threatening nor invasive. In essence you’re asking for help: “I have this need, you see? Would you meet my need?” It’s not <em>you</em> that demands so loudly that this person obey your request, it’s your <em>need</em> that makes the demand. “I have this need, and you can help me meet my need by doing <em>this.” </em>The phrase “I need you to” gives the directive a softer, less “bossy” quality than some alternatives.</p>



<p>Yet it is forceful. A listener will find it very difficult to evade this form of command. To do so they must in essence respond with, “No, you don’t <em>need</em> that.” That kind of response takes brass. It means making a higher claim about your needs than you yourself are making. The listener must say, in effect, “You <em>say</em> that you need me to do that, but you’re wrong. What you <em>really</em> need is….” Only a very well-informed and knowledgable—or else stupid and insubordinate—listener will reply like this. Sometimes it <em>is</em> the right reply, and if you as a leader are telling people that you need them to do something, you’d better actually need it. This is a bluff that can be called.</p>



<p>In normal circumstances “I need you to…” is a tried-and-true way of issuing a command that carries great force without seeming excessively harsh, and is therefore quite common.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★★</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆ (and yet forceful)</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Would you mind taking out the trash?” </strong>Here is one of the most common—and grammatically vexing—of English request forms, but also among the most effective. The fact that the listener must answer with “no” in order to agree to your request never ceases to befuddle. </p>



<p>As with adding “please” to a request, “would you mind” softens by transforming a demand into a plea. It is virtually illegal, culturally speaking, to answer with “yes,” as if you minded (even if you would). Instead the listener is obligated to refuse the request in some more deliberate way: “Well, actually I’m tied up just now” or something similar. Consequently this is one of those magic request forms (like “I need you to…”) that applies more force with less harshness.</p>



<p>“Would you mind” gives a less clear command than the bare imperative in that the user may refuse. The “answer yes by saying no” twisteroo also adds a little mental complication.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I</strong>‘<strong>m going to get you to take out the trash.” </strong>By prefacing the imperative with several filler words, we dull the edge of the command while keeping the meaning fairly clear (though not as clear as the bare imperative). There’s not much mistaking what is supposed to be done or who is to do it, yet a little wiggle room has been left to the listener. Several of the phrases on this list use this technique: make the command longer to make it less harsh, but also less clear. </p>



<p>Personally I find this phraseology irritating. It can perhaps feel more gentle than a bare imperative but it also sounds more toadying and manipulative. For my own preference, a leader tempted to hedge with “I’m going to get you to…” would do better to skip the rigmarole and just say what they want.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★★☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I’ll let you take out the trash.” </strong>Another softening-by-lengthening technique, now with the added twist of implying that the listener <em>wants</em> to do the task. To me it sounds manipulative, but it has the further disadvantage of lost clarity. The listener may reply (mentally or aloud), “You’re <em>letting </em>me? So if I don’t want to, I don’t have to?” The task may not get done, and you as leader won’t have much of an excuse for why you didn’t make your requirement clearer.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“I’d like for the trash to be taken out.” </strong>It’s remarkable how often you’ll hear phrases like this in meetings at every level of an organization. A leader knows what they want done and who they want to do it, but by omitting the subject of the command—<em>“you”</em>—they hope to make it less bossy. Indeed, they hope the listener will reply, “Okay, I’ll take out the trash.” Sometimes this works. More often, everyone sits on their hands, waits for the moment to pass, and the command is ambiguously lost as the meeting moves on.</p>



<p>There is a time for leaders to suggest a task and allow followers to volunteer to take it on. But it’s best to make that dance explicit. “Somebody needs to take the trash out. Who’ll do it?” Trying to hedge your command as an invitation for volunteerism is usually just weak and ineffective. If you know that you’re speaking to John, and everyone knows that you’re speaking to John, then speak to John. Don’t imply commands.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Will you/Would you take out the trash?” </strong>On the face of it, it looks as if the English language, by offering this form of request, is inviting the listener to proclaim a prophetic oracle. A cheeky reply would be, “I don’t know whether I’ll take out the trash—am I supposed to be able to see the future?” In reality, of course, the future tense of the verb is a softer way to frame an imperative mood. Phrasing the command in the form of a question softens it further. The question implies—truly or falsely—that the listener has a choice.</p>



<p>This is a good and of course very common way of asking people to do things, quite clear and not terribly harsh. Your parents and teachers probably used it with you. Don’t be too shy about using it with your team.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★★☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Could you/Can you take out the trash?”</strong> Likewise, “could you/can you” feels slightly quaint, almost archaic, and holds a note of appeal (as opposed to command) that might work well for your style of leadership. Or not. Something to experiment with?</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★★☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>“Let’s take out the trash.”</strong> Another way of softening a command is to put it into the plural first person (“we/us”) instead of the second person (“you”). “Let’s…” is very commonly used by leaders and probably shouldn’t be. It tries to avoid harshness by sacrificing clarity, but usually loses more than it gains. The real subject of the command—<em>you</em>—is hidden, and unless the context has made the subject clear, the command will be lost. When you mean “you,” say “you.”</p>



<p>Still, “Let’s…” has its place in a leader’s toolbox, as for example when the person responsible for the task has already been made explicit and the leader’s significant choice is not <em>who</em> will do it but <em>what</em> they will do. In that case, “Let’s take out the trash” may not be a hedging way of saying “You take out the trash,” but rather, “You’ll take out the trash instead of taking out the recycling.”</p>



<p>Clarity: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★★☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Why don’t we take out the tras</strong><strong>h?”</strong> Again an overused hedge but not without its place. It is extremely soft but also extremely unclear. Are you actually asking someone to do something? In the middle of an exploratory discussion, asking “why don’t we” or “what if” questions is helpful in cultivating new options or narrowing toward a final choice. But as a final choice, “Why don’t we…” is too cautious and vague. Make a clear choice of who is to do what and then tell them clearly to do it.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>Could we take out the trash?”</strong> Similar in form and effect to “Why don’t we…?” See the discussion there.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>“<strong>If you would just take out the trash…”</strong> Couches the command in the form of an “if” statement, usually with disastrous results. </p>



<p>Sometimes leaders let the ellipsis dangle, just like that: “If you would just take out the trash…”—followed by an uncomfortable silence in the room. This is bad.</p>



<p>Sometimes they fill the ellipsis with some convenient apodosis: “If you would just take out the trash, we could wash out the bin and maybe it wouldn’t smell so much.” This is equally bad. What little imperative force was implied by the initial “If you would…” becomes lost in the succeeding drivel.</p>



<p>“If you would…” simply fails as a means of commanding (or even asking) someone to do something. It stages a desperate ploy to sound less bossy, but still comes across as bossy, yet in an evasive and pandering manner. Avoid it.</p>



<p>A common variant has “could” in place of “would.” I don’t see a great difference.</p>



<p>Clarity: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<p>Harshness: ★☆☆☆☆</p>



<hr>



<p>If you want to be a good boss without being seen as bossy, mull over this list. Watch how other leaders use phrases like these and what effect they have. Try out new ways of issuing commands, see how they feel to you, see how people respond. The key is to find a way of directing people that suits your personality, your team, and your organization’s culture. Once you settle on a comfortable style and make it consistent, then you’ll be seen as a leader who knows how to get people to do things without coming across as obnoxious.</p>

<p>Apple and Amazon are once again facing scrutiny for their 2018 agreement that saw Apple finally establish an <a href="https://amzn.to/3sm9MUy">official Amazon storefront</a>. A report <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gives-apple-special-treatment-while-others-suffer-junk-ads-2023-11">from <em>Insider</em> today</a> goes in-depth on the details of this agreement, with one source saying that Apple is getting “massive preferential treatment” from Amazon.</p>



<p>The deal between Apple and Amazon has <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/08/02/apple-amazon/">faced quite a bit</a> of regulatory pushback over the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/10/29/apple-amazon-deal-germany/">past several years</a>. The two companies are also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/11/09/apple-amazon-lawsuit-price-fixing/">battling a price-fixing lawsuit</a> that alleges they colluded to raise iPhone and iPad prices.</p>



<p>As detailed by today’s report, the agreement between Apple and Amazon includes a carveout that reduces the number of ads and recommendations that appear on product pages for Apple devices. While Amazon product pages are generally full of ads, sponsored results, and recommendations, Apple’s product pages show only one banner ad at the very bottom of the page.</p>



<p>In contrast, product pages for Apple competitors like Samsung are riddled with ads from competitors, recommendations, and other sponsored banners. <em>Insider</em> says that other companies, including Samsung, have complained about the preferential treatment given to Apple.</p>



<p>It’s unclear whether Amazon has made similar offers to companies like Samsung. <em>Insider</em> cites “least half a dozen salespeople on Amazon’s advertising team” who say that “they were not able to extend this Apple-style special treatment to their clients.”</p>



<p>Emails revealed as part of an FTC lawsuit against Amazon reveal that the company initially pushed back against Apple’s demands for special treatment before eventually caving in. In a statement today, Apple explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Apple also told Insider that the 2018 agreement with Amazon “sought to address significant counterfeit and safety issues” on Amazon’s marketplace. Prior to the deal, Apple sent “hundreds of thousands of take-down notices” to Amazon to reduce counterfeits, and the company conducted test purchases on Amazon that “consistently returned high counterfeit rates,” Apple added.</p>



<p>By providing “accurate, relevant and qualitative content on Apple Product pages,” Apple has been able to address much of the counterfeit issues on Amazon, the iPhone maker said.</p>



<p>“The 2018 Agreements significantly reduced the sale of counterfeit and unsafe Apple products on Amazon’s marketplaces and have materially improved customer experience,” Apple also wrote in a statement to Insider.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-gives-apple-special-treatment-while-others-suffer-junk-ads-2023-11">full report at <em>Insider</em></a> includes additional details on the early negotiations between Apple and Amazon. For instance, at one point, Amazon insisted that Apple “compensate Amazon for the lost ad revenue” from the deal. Still, it’s unclear if that was included in the final agreement.</p>

  <h2>What is the unix time stamp?</h2>
    <p>The unix time stamp is a way to track time as a running total of seconds. This count starts at the Unix Epoch on January 1st, 1970 at UTC. Therefore, the unix time stamp is merely the number of seconds between a particular date and the Unix Epoch. It should also be pointed out (thanks to the comments from visitors to this site) that this point in time technically does not change no matter where you are located on the globe.  This is very useful to computer systems for tracking and sorting dated information in dynamic and distributed applications both online and client side.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
	<th>Human Readable Time</th>
	<th>Seconds</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
	<td>1 Hour</td>
	<td>3600 Seconds</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>1 Day</td>
	<td>86400 Seconds</td>

<tr>
	<td>1 Week</td>
	<td>604800 Seconds</td>

  <h2>What happens on January 19, 2038?</h2>
    <p>On this date the Unix Time Stamp will cease to work due to a 32-bit overflow. Before this moment millions of applications will need to either adopt a new convention for time stamps or be migrated to 64-bit systems which will buy the time stamp a "bit" more time. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
     

<p>Hello! I was trying to explain to someone how <code>git cherry-pick</code> works the other
day, and I found myself getting confused.</p>

<p>What went wrong was: I thought that <code>git cherry-pick</code> was basically applying a
patch, but when I tried to actually do it that way, it didn’t work!</p>

<p>Let’s talk about what I thought <code>cherry-pick</code> did (applying a patch), why
that’s not quite true, and what it actually does instead (a “3-way merge”).</p>

<p>This post is extremely in the weeds and you definitely don’t need to understand
this stuff to use git effectively. But if you (like me) are curious about git’s
internals, let’s talk about it!</p>

<h3 id="cherry-pick-isn-t-applying-a-patch">cherry-pick isn’t applying a patch</h3>

<p>The way I previously understood <code>git cherry-pick COMMIT_ID</code> is:</p>

<ul>
<li>calculate the diff for <code>COMMIT_ID</code>, like <code>git show COMMIT_ID --patch &gt; out.patch</code></li>
<li>Apply the patch to the current branch, like <code>git apply out.patch</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Before we get into this – I want to be clear that this model is mostly
right, and if that’s your mental model that’s fine. But it’s wrong in some
subtle ways and I think that’s kind of interesting, so let’s see how it works.</p>

<p>If I try to do the “calculate the diff and apply the patch” thing in a case
where there’s a merge conflict, here’s what happens:</p>

<pre><code>$ git show 10e96e46 --patch &gt; out.patch
$ git apply out.patch
error: patch failed: content/post/2023-07-28-why-is-dns-still-hard-to-learn-.markdown:17
error: content/post/2023-07-28-why-is-dns-still-hard-to-learn-.markdown: patch does not apply
</code></pre>

<p>This just fails – it doesn’t give me any way to resolve the conflict or figure
out how to solve the problem.</p>

<p>This is quite different from what actually happens when run <code>git cherry-pick</code>,
which is that I get a merge conflict:</p>

<pre><code>$ git cherry-pick 10e96e46
error: could not apply 10e96e46... wip
hint: After resolving the conflicts, mark them with
hint: "git add/rm &lt;pathspec&gt;", then run
hint: "git cherry-pick --continue".
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems like the “git is applying a patch” model isn’t quite right. But the
error message literally does say “could not <strong>apply</strong> 10e96e46”, so it’s not quite
<em>wrong</em> either. What’s going on?</p>

<h3 id="so-what-is-cherry-pick-doing">so what is cherry-pick doing?</h3>

<p>I went digging through git’s source code to see how <code>cherry-pick</code> works, and
ended up at <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/dadef801b365989099a9929e995589e455c51fed/sequencer.c#L2353-L2358">this line of code</a>:</p>

<pre><code>res = do_recursive_merge(r, base, next, base_label, next_label, &amp;head, &amp;msgbuf, opts);
</code></pre>

<p>So a cherry-pick is a… merge? What? How? What is it even merging? And how does merging even work in the first place?</p>

<p>I realized that I didn’t really know how git’s merge worked, so I googled it
and found out that git does a thing called “3-way merge”. What’s that?</p>

<h3 id="how-git-merges-files-the-3-way-merge">how git merges files: the 3-way merge</h3>

<p>Let’s say I want to merge these 2 files. We’ll call them <code>v1.py</code> and <code>v2.py</code>.</p>

<pre><code>def greet():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "julia"
    return greeting + " " + name
</code></pre>

<pre><code>def say_hello():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "aanya"
    return greeting + " " + name
</code></pre>

<p>There are two lines that differ: we have</p>

<ul>
<li><code>def greet()</code> and <code>def say_hello</code></li>
<li><code>name = "aanya"</code> and <code>name = "julia"</code></li>
</ul>

<p>How do we know what to pick? It seems impossible!</p>

<p>But what if I told you that the original function was this (<code>base.py</code>)?</p>

<pre><code>def say_hello():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "julia"
    return greeting + " " + name
</code></pre>

<p>Suddenly it seems a lot clearer! <code>v1</code> changed the function’s name to <code>greet</code>
and <code>v2</code> set <code>name = "aanya"</code>. So to merge, we should make both those changes:</p>

<pre><code>def greet():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "aanya"
    return greeting + " " + name
</code></pre>

<p>We can ask git to do this merge with <code>git merge-file</code>, and it gives us exactly
the result we expected: it picks <code>def greet()</code> and <code>name = "aanya"</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git merge-file v1.py base.py v2.py -p
def greet():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "aanya"
    return greeting + " " + name⏎
</code></pre>

<p>This way of merging where you merge 2 files + their original version is called
a <strong>3-way merge</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out yourself in a browser, I made a little playground at
<a href="https://jvns.ca/3-way-merge/">jvns.ca/3-way-merge/</a>. I made it very quickly so it’s not mobile friendly.</p>

<h3 id="git-merges-changes-not-files">git merges changes, not files</h3>

<p>The way I think about the 3-way merge is – git merges <strong>changes</strong>, not files.
We have an original file and 2 possible changes to it, and git tries to combine
both of those changes in a reasonable way. Sometimes it can’t (for example if
both changes change the same line), and then you get a merge conflict.</p>

<p>Git can also merge more than 2 possible changes: you can have an original file
and 8 possible changes, and it can try to reconcile all of them. That’s called
an octopus merge but I don’t know much more than that, I’ve never done one.</p>

<h3 id="how-git-uses-3-way-merge-to-apply-a-patch">how git uses 3-way merge to apply a patch</h3>

<p>Now let’s get a little weird! When we talk about git “applying a patch” (as you
do in a <code>rebase</code> or <code>revert</code> or <code>cherry-pick</code>), it’s not actually creating a
patch file and applying it. Instead, it’s doing a 3-way merge.</p>

<p>Here’s how applying commit <code>X</code> as a patch to your current commit corresponds to
this <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code>, and <code>base</code> setup from before:</p>

<ol>
<li>The version of the file <strong>in your current commit</strong> is <code>v1</code>.</li>
<li>The version of the file <strong>before commit X</strong> is <code>base</code></li>
<li>The version of the file <strong>in commit X</strong>. Call that <code>v2</code></li>
<li>Run <code>git merge-file v1 base v2</code> to combine them (technically git does not
actually run <code>git merge-file</code>, it runs a C function that does it)</li>
</ol>

<p>Together, you can think of <code>base</code> and <code>v2</code> as being the “patch”: the diff between
them is the change that you want to apply to <code>v1</code>.</p>

<h3 id="how-cherry-pick-works">how cherry-pick works</h3>

<p>Let’s say we have this commit graph, and we want to cherry-pick <code>Y</code> on to <code>main</code>:</p>

<pre><code>A - B (main)
 \
  \
   X - Y - Z
</code></pre>

<p>How do we turn that into a 3-way merge? Here’s how it translates into our <code>v1</code>, <code>v2</code> and <code>base</code> from earlier:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>B</code> is v1</li>
<li><code>X</code> is the base, <code>Y</code> is v2</li>
</ul>

<p>So together <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> are the “patch”.</p>

<p>And <code>git rebase</code> is just like <code>git cherry-pick</code>, but repeated a bunch of times.</p>

<h3 id="how-revert-works">how revert works</h3>

<p>Now let’s say we want to run <code>git revert Y</code> on this commit graph</p>

<pre><code>X - Y - Z - A - B
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>B</code> is v1</li>
<li><code>Y</code> is the base, <code>X</code> is v2</li>
</ul>

<p>This is exactly like a cherry-pick, but with <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> reversed. We have to
flip them because we want to apply a “reverse patch”.</p>

<p>Revert and cherry-pick are so closely related in git that they’re actually
implemented in the same file:
<a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/dadef801b365989099a9929e995589e455c51fed/builtin/revert.c">revert.c</a>.</p>

<h3 id="this-3-way-patch-is-a-really-cool-trick">this “3-way patch” is a really cool trick</h3>

<p>This trick of using a 3-way merge to apply a commit as a patch seems really
clever and cool and I’m surprised that I’d never heard of it before! I don’t
know of a name for it, but I kind of want to call it a “3-way patch”.</p>

<p>The idea is that with a 3-way patch, you specify the patch as 2 files: the file
before the patch and after (<code>base</code> and <code>v2</code> in our language in this post).</p>

<p>So there are 3 files involved: 1 for the original and 2 for the patch.</p>

<p>The point is that the 3-way patch is a much better way to patch than a normal
patch, because you have a lot more context for merging when you have
both full files.</p>

<p>Here’s more or less what a normal patch for our example looks like:</p>

<pre><code>@@ -1,1 +1,1 @@:
- def greet():
+ def say_hello():
    greeting = "hello"
</code></pre>

<p>and a 3-way patch. This “3-way patch” is not a real file format, it’s just
something I made up.</p>

<pre><code>BEFORE: (the full file)
def greet():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "julia"
    return greeting + " " + name
AFTER: (the full file)
def say_hello():
    greeting = "hello"
    name = "julia"
    return greeting + " " + name
</code></pre>

<h3 id="building-git-talks-about-this">“Building Git” talks about this</h3>

<p>The book <a href="https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/">Building Git</a> by James Coglan
is the only place I could find other than the git source code explaining how
<code>git cherry-pick</code> actually uses 3-way merge under the hood (I thought Pro Git might
talk about it, but it didn’t seem to as far as I could tell).</p>

<p>I actually went to buy it and it turned out that I’d already bought it in 2019
so it was a good reference to have here :)</p>

<h3 id="merging-is-actually-much-more-complicated-than-this">merging is actually much more complicated than this</h3>

<p>There’s more to merging in git than the 3-way merge – there’s something
called a “recursive merge” that I don’t understand, and there are a bunch of
details about how to deal with handling file deletions and moves, and there are
also multiple merge algorithms.</p>

<p>My best idea for where to learn more about this stuff is Building Git, though I
haven’t read the whole thing.</p>

<h3 id="so-what-does-git-apply-do">so what does <code>git apply</code> do?</h3>

<p>I also went looking through git’s source to find out what <code>git apply</code> does, and it
seems to (unsurprisingly) be in <code>apply.c</code>. That code parses a patch file, and
then hunts through the target file to figure out where to apply it. The core logic
seems to be <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/dadef801b365989099a9929e995589e455c51fed/apply.c#L2684">around here</a>:
I think the idea is to start at the line number that the patch suggested and
then hunt forwards and backwards from there to try to find it:</p>

<pre><code>	/*
	 * There's probably some smart way to do this, but I'll leave
	 * that to the smart and beautiful people. I'm simple and stupid.
	 */
	backwards = current;
	backwards_lno = line;
	forwards = current;
	forwards_lno = line;
	current_lno = line;
  for (i = 0; ; i++) {
     ...
</code></pre>

<p>That all seems pretty intuitive and about what I’d naively expect.</p>

<h3 id="that-s-all">that’s all!</h3>

<p>I was pretty surprised to learn that I didn’t actually understand the core way
that git applies patches internally – it was really cool to learn about!</p>

<p>I have <a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/11/01/confusing-git-terminology/">lots of issues</a> with git’s UI but I think this particular thing is not
one of them. The 3-way merge seems like a nice unified way to solve a bunch of
different problems, it’s pretty intuitive for people (the idea of “applying a
patch” is one that a lot of programmers are used to thinking about, and the
fact that it’s implemented as a 3-way merge under the hood is an implementation
detail that nobody actually ever needs to think about).</p>

<p><small>
Also a very quick plug: I’m working on writing a
<a href="https://wizardzines.com/">zine</a> about git, if you’re interested in getting an email when it comes out you can
sign up to my <a href="https://wizardzines.com/zine-announcements/">very infrequent announcements mailing list</a>.

      <h2>Why Protégé</h2>
      <h2>
        Protégé’s plug-in architecture can be adapted to build 
        both simple and complex ontology-based applications. 
        Developers can integrate the output of Protégé with rule 
        systems or other problem solvers to construct a wide range 
        of intelligent systems.  Most important, the Stanford team 
        and the vast Protégé community are here to help.

where ChatGPT basically did all the work —you're at the highest risk here.</p><p>On the other end, if you actually built some substantial technology and LLMs where OpenAI has only assisted with a small but crucial piece, then you may be in a better position, but you're still going to run into two other major issues.</p></span></p><p builder-id="builder-06838a9809ca4e5da934bb9e4af517a8"><a

The best part of a large language model is their broad versatility, but they achieve this by being exceptionally large and complex, which makes them incredibly costly to run.</p><p>As an example, per the Wall Street Journal, recently GitHub Copilot was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ais-costly-buildup-could-make-early-products-a-hard-sell-bdd29b9f" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">losing money per user</a>, charging $10, but on average cost $20, and some users cost GitHub up to $80 <span><span><em>per month</em></span></span>.</p><p>And the worst part is you probably don't need such a large model. Your use case probably doesn't need a model trained on the entirety of the Internet because 99.9% of that training covers topics that have nothing to do with your use case.</p><p>So, while the ease of this approach might be tempting, you could run into this common issue where what your users want to pay is less than what it costs to run your service on top of large language models.</p></span></p><p builder-id="builder-51387a2017d64e1ba34cee8b2d0577fd"><a href="#issue-3-ll-ms-are-painfully-slow" id="issue-3-ll-ms-are-painfully-slow"><span><h3>Issue #3: LLMs are painfully slow</h3></span></a></p><p><span><p>Even if you're the rare case where the cost economics might work out okay for you, you're still going to hit one more major issue: LLMs are painfully slow.</p><p>Now, this isn't a huge problem for all applications. For use cases such as ChatGPT, where reading one word at a time is the norm, this might be okay.</p></span></p><p><span><p><span>However, in applications where text isn't meant to be read word-for-word, and the entire response is expected before proceeding to the next step in the workflow, this can pose a significant issue.</span><br></p><p>As an example, when we started working on Builder's <a href="https://www.builder.io/blog/figma-to-code-visual-copilot" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Visual Copilot</a>, where we wanted one button click to turn any design into high-quality code, one of the approaches we explored was using an LLM for the conversion.</p></span></p><p><span><p><span>One of the key issues we encountered was the significant time delay. When passing an entire design specification into an LLM and receiving a new representation token by token, generating a response would take several minutes, making it impractical.</span><br></p><p>And because the representation returned by the LLM is not what a human would perceive, the loading state was just a spinner — not ideal.</p></span></p><p builder-id="builder-8b2942d781514858b7c538ba5b6fa773"><a href="#issue-4-ll-ms-cannot-be-customized-strong-that-strong-much" id="issue-4-ll-ms-cannot-be-customized-strong-that-strong-much"><span><h3>Issue #4: LLMs cannot be customized <strong>that</strong> much</h3></span></a></p><p><span><p>If for some reason, performance still isn't an issue for you, and your users don't care about having a slow and expensive product that's easy for your competitors to copy, you're still likely to run into another major issue — LLMs can't be customized that much.</p><p>Yes, they all support fine-tuning, and fine-tuning can incrementally help the model get closer to what you need. But in our case, we tried using fine-tuning to provide Figma designs and get code out the other side.</p><p>But no matter how many examples we gave the model, it didn't improve. We were left with something slow, expensive, and inferior quality. And that's when we realized we had to take a different approach.</p></span></p><p builder-id="builder-88d0ae6c15e04a0280eafb3a98df99e3"><a href="#the-solution-create-your-own-toolchain" id="the-solution-create-your-own-toolchain"><span><h2>The solution: create your own toolchain</h2></span></a></p><p><span><p>What did we have to do instead?

We aren't just wrapping somebody else's model.</p><p>If you're fully dependent only on someone else's model, like OpenAI, there's no guarantee it's going to get smarter, faster, or cheaper for your use case in any guaranteed timeline. And your ability to control that with prompt engineering and fine-tuning is severely limited.</p><p>But since we own our own model, we're making significant improvements every day.</p><p>When new designs come in that don't import well — which still happens as it's in beta — we rely on user feedback to improve at a rapid cadence, shipping improvements every single day.</p></span></p><p builder-id="builder-cbae2fe07d9b4985942d8bcbba828ffe"><a href="#benefit-2-you-control-privacy" id="benefit-2-you-control-privacy"><span><h3>Benefit #2: you control privacy</h3></span></a></p><p><span><p>With this approach, we never have to worry about a lack of control. For instance, when we started talking to some large and privacy-focused companies as potential early beta customers, one of the most common pieces of feedback was that they were not able to use OpenAI or any products using OpenAI.</p><p>Their privacy requirements prioritize making sure their data never goes into systems that they don't allow.</p><p>In our case, because we control the entire technology, we can hold our models to an extremely high privacy bar. Thank goodness, because we would’ve lost out on some serious business had we been dependent on other companies (like many others are).</p><p>And for the LLM step, we can either turn it off (because it's purely nice to have) or companies can plug in their own LLM. Those LLMs might be an entirely in-house built model, a fork of <code>llama2</code>, their own enterprise instance of OpenAI, or something else entirely.</p></span></p><p builder-id="builder-6ac7cf62e70d4d348c50a07599a499d9"><a href="#conclusion" id="conclusion"><span><h3>Conclusion</h3></span></a></p><p><span><p>So, if you want to build AI products, I highly recommend taking a similar approach as Builder.</p><p>As strange as it sounds, avoid using AI for as long as possible in your project.

At the end of the day, “normal” code is the fastest, most reliable, most deterministic, most easy to debug, easy to fix, easy to manage, and easy to test code you will ever have.</p><p>But the magic will come from the small but critical areas you use AI models for.</p><p>Can’t wait to see the awesome things you build.</p></span></p><div data-name="symbol" data-source="Rendered by Builder.io" data-model="symbol" builder-id="builder-cd61df2407824553be2497e03d87073a" builder-type="blocks" data-builder-component="symbol" data-builder-content-id="02714711c4b647959d015e34679ca6ee" builder-content-id="02714711c4b647959d015e34679ca6ee" builder-model="symbol"><template data-template-variant-id="6d0b491a00e64dce9781e3c0a9839b71"><div class="builder-content" builder-content-id="6d0b491a00e64dce9781e3c0a9839b71" builder-model="symbol"><div data-builder-component="symbol" data-builder-content-id="de784470c6884829b5e7c7603f4c51ed"><div class="builder-blocks css-h47494" builder-type="blocks"><style data-emotion-css="kf99zz">.css-kf99zz.builder-block{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;position:relative;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;-ms-flex-negative:0;flex-shrink:0;box-sizing:border-box;margin-left:-130px;margin-right:-260px;margin-top:10px;z-index:11px;}@media only screen and (max-width:991px){.css-kf99zz.builder-block{margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}}</style><div class="builder-block builder-7c77e4f236f848b48c79a96f49072518 css-kf99zz" builder-id="builder-7c77e4f236f848b48c79a96f49072518"><style data-emotion-css="jgc6i5">.css-jgc6i5.builder-block{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;position:relative;-webkit-flex-shrink:0;-ms-flex-negative:0;flex-shrink:0;box-sizing:border-box;margin-top:50px;width:100%;min-height:20px;min-width:20px;overflow:hidden;mix-blend-mode:multiply;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:405px;}@media only screen and (max-width:991px){.css-jgc6i5.builder-block{margin-top:10px;}}</style><div class="builder-block builder-661f4bd90a3547fa85f50126d1418c87 dark-mode-invert css-jgc6i5" builder-id="builder-661f4bd90a3547fa85f50126d1418c87"><picture><source srcset="https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=100 100w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=200 200w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=400 400w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=800 800w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=1200 1200w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=1600 1600w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=2000 2000w, https://cdn.builder.io/api/v1/image/assets%2FYJIGb4i01jvw0SRdL5Bt%2F83677fb912dd4a539a3f3bb5c0c82de1?format=webp&amp;width=405 405w" type="image/webp"></picture><style data-emotion-css="1sn22t4">.css-1sn22t4{width:100%;padding-top:35.4%;pointer-events:none;font-size:0;}</style><div class="builder-image-sizer css-1sn22t4"> </div></div><div class="builder-block builder-296e83c56835496a896d380e22d2fbd9 builder-has-component css-logohe" builder-id="builder-296e83c56835496a896d380e22d2fbd9"><style data-emotion-css="1fuo4gk">.css-1fuo4gk{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;}@media (max-width:991px){.css-1fuo4gk{-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;}}</style><div class="builder-columns css-1fuo4gk"><style data-emotion-css="15p9q9i">.css-15p9q9i{display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-flex;display:-ms-flexbox;display:flex;-webkit-flex-direction:column;-ms-flex-direction:column;flex-direction:column;-webkit-align-items:stretch;-webkit-box-align:stretch;-ms-flex-align:stretch;align-items:stretch;line-height:normal;width:calc(58.333% -

   <p>A U.S.-bound plane took off from London last month with four damaged window panes, including two that were completely missing, according to U.K. air accident investigators. </p>   <p>No one was injured by the window malfunctions, which appear to have been caused by high-power lights used in a film shoot, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6544b3089e05fd0014be7c9b/S2-2023__Airbus_A321-253NX_G-OATW.pdf">the U.K.'s Air Accident Investigation Branch</a> reported in a special bulletin published Nov. 4. </p>   <p><strong>T</strong>he aircraft departed from London's Stansted Airport on the morning of Oct. 4 carrying 11 crew members and nine passengers, all of whom are employees of the "tour company or the aircraft's operating company," the report states, without elaborating on the tour company.</p>

   <p><a href="https://aircraft.airbus.com/en/aircraft/a320-the-most-successful-aircraft-family-ever/a321ceo">The single-aisle aircraft</a>, an Airbus A321, can seat more than 170 passengers, but the small group of passengers were all seated in the middle of the cabin, just ahead of the overwing exits. </p>   <p>The missing windows weren't discovered until the plane was climbing at an altitude of 13,000 feet, according to the AAIB report.</p>   <p>"Several passengers recalled that after takeoff the aircraft cabin seemed noisier and colder than they were used to," investigators wrote. A crew member walked towards the back of the aircraft, where he spotted a window seal flapping on the left side of the aircraft. </p>   <p>"The windowpane appeared to have slipped down," the report reads. "He described the cabin noise as 'loud enough to damage your hearing.' " </p>   <p>As the plane approached 14,000 feet, the pilots reduced speed and stopped their ascent. An engineer and co-pilot went back to take a look at the window and agreed the aircraft should turn around immediately.</p>

   <p>The plane landed safely back at Stansted after 36 minutes of total flying time, during which the plane had remained "pressurized normally," investigators wrote. </p>   <p>After inspecting the plane from the ground, the crew discovered that a second window pane was also missing and a third was dislodged. A fourth window appeared to be protruding slightly from its frame. </p>   <p>One shattered window pane was later recovered from the runway during a routine inspection. </p>   <p>The windows may have been damaged by high-power flood lights used during filming the day before the flight, according to the AAIB's assessment. </p>   <div id="res1212158802">

   <p>The lights, which were intended to give the illusion of a sunrise, were placed about 20 to 30 feet from the aircraft, shining on first the right, then the left side of the craft for over nine hours in total. </p>   
   <p>A foam liner had melted away from at least one of the windows and several window panes appeared to have been warped by the thermal heat. </p>   <p>"A different level of damage by the same means might have resulted in more serious consequences, especially if window integrity was lost at higher differential pressure," the AAIB wrote.

                    News / 11.5.2021
                </p>
                <h2>Gigantic heat caverns in Mustikkamaa have now been filled with water</h2>
                <div>
    <p>The filling of underground heat caverns in Mustikkamaa with water has been completed this week, and the use of the heat caverns for heating homes in Helsinki is a step closer.</p>
</div>
                
            </div><div>
<p>Helen started to fill the heat caverns with tap water in early December. The filling of the caverns took more than three months due to their enormous total volume of 320 million litres. The caverns have such a large capacity that filling them from an ordinary kitchen tap would have taken more than 50 years.</p>
<p>The current estimated temperature of the water storage facility is about +30 degrees. Slow heating of the bedrock has started, and actual heating of water in the heat cavern will start in April. The aim is to connect the heat caverns into the current district heating system of Helsinki in July.</p>
<p>The heat caverns balance the consumption peaks in the district heating network throughout the year. For example, waste heat from waste waters and properties can be stored in the heat cavern and released for use as and when required. In future, the temperature of the water in the heat cavern will vary between +45 and +100 degrees according to usage situation.</p>
<p>- Helen is proceeding fast towards a carbon-neutral future, and the underground heat caverns are an important step on this path. The use of old oil caverns as an energy storage facility is a good example of Finnish innovation that is unique even on a global scale. The emission-free energy system of the future is made up of many pieces, and storage is an important element in the system. The heat caverns support all heat production forms, says Helen’s Director Timo Aaltonen.</p>
<p>Carbon-neutral production is also currently built at Helen’s heating and cooling plant in Sörnäinen with the arrival of two new heat pumps. A seawater heat pump and a bioenergy heating plant are being built in Vuosaari. The construction of the geothermal heating plant in Ruskeasuo will start this spring. Helen is also investigating, for example, waste heat from the Kilpilahti industrial area and extensive utilisation of seawater heat pumps.</p>
<p><strong> Facts</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The heat contained in the water in the Mustikkamaa cavern heat storage facility corresponds to the heating of 25,000 one-bedroom apartments all year round.</li>
<li>Heat will not escape from the heat caverns because the bedrock that is tens of metres deep acts as an excellent insulator.</li>
<li>The rock caverns will decrease Helen’s carbon dioxide emissions by 21,000 tonnes per year.</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Svalbard has an ideal geographical location for downloading data from satellites in polar orbits. SvalSat, the Svalbard satellite ground station at 78 degrees north, is the northernmost ground station in the world and started operation in 1997. However, development of the business depended on efficient transfer of large volumes of data to the mainland.</p>







<p>The station is located at Platåberget outside Longyearbyen. Satellite data were initially transmitted to customers via a geostationary satellite. However, small capacity for data transmission via satellite was a limiting factor. Around 2001, it became clear that SvalSat’s future development was entirely dependent on the efficient transfer of large volumes of data to the mainland.</p>







<figure><img src="https://spacenorway.no/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DJI_0709_web-768x1024.jpg" alt="KSATs stasjon på Svalbard, SvalSat har i dag over 100 operative antenner.
Foto: KSAT" width="501" height="668"><figcaption><sup>SvalSat, KSAT’s station on Svalbard, currently has more than 100 operational antennas. Photo: KSAT</sup></figcaption></figure>



<p>At this time, SvalSat was part of Norsk Romsenter Eiendom AS (later renamed Space Norway AS), a company owned by Stiftelsen Norsk Romsenter (NRS). NRS was concerned that SvalSat would lose out on commercial opportunities because of the lack of fibre connection to mainland Norway. NRS believed that a subsea fibre connection would be essential to ensure the future development of SvalSat’s activities. The telecommunications operator at Svalbard saw no commercial basis for investing in an approximately 1,400-kilometre subsea fibre optic cable connection. In 2002, NRS initiated its own assessment and planning of a fibre connection from Longyearbyen to the mainland, with the objective of establishing such connection without any government financing.</p>







<p>With Space Norway as a tool, NRS succeeded in this project. Financing was secured through a combination of long-term contracts, debt, prepayments from key customers, and funding from Space Norway. Customers and partners included NASA, NOAA, KSAT, Andøya Rocket Range (today Andøya Space Center), Telenor and Uninett8. The construction was done in 2003 and the fibre connection became operational in January 2004.</p>

<p>The fibre connection has been of important strategic value for the growth and development of KSAT. SvalSat is now the world’s largest ground station for downloading data from satellites in polar orbits. Today, both KSAT and Space Norway are two successful spin-off businesses from NRS (Norwegian Space Agency).</p>







<p>The fibre connection consists of two separate cables that connect Longyearbyen to mainland Norway. The distance of approx. 1,400 km corresponds roughly to the distance between Oslo and Paris. The cables are buried approximately 2 metres in selected areas to protect against destruction by fish trawling and anchoring of ships. The sea depth reaches as much as 1,670 metres just west of Svalbard. At the time of construction, it was the world’s deepest fibre-optic cable. Tyco Communications (now SubCom) was the contractor for the project. The anticipated technical service life of the cables is 25 years. It is now 17 years since the cables became operational. The operating track record of the Svalbard connection has been excellent with few incidents that have led to interruptions of the service. During the period 2018-20, Space Norway carried out significant security related upgrades to the fibre connection.</p>







<p>The primary motivation for establishing the fibre-optic cable in 2004 was to ensure the growth and development of the satellite business at SvalSat. Today, the fibre connection also represents a critical resource for the society at Svalbard and enables modern electronic communication services. These are services necessary to maintain and develop society as well as Norwegian presence on the archipelago. The fibre connection is considered part of the national critical infrastructure.</p>

<p>National and international companies and entities depend on a functioning fibre connection to Svalbard. Information downloaded at SvalSat and distributed via the fibre connection is important for a number of purposes such as weather forecasting services, surveillance of ship traffic, environmental monitoring, development of ice maps for the Arctic and communication services in the critical phases of rocket launches9. The connection is also important for KSAT’s contribution to Galileo, Europe’s satellite-based navigation system10. Space Norway offer transmission capacity at wholesale level to a small number of customers, who in turn provide communication services in the retail and commercial markets. End customers and users of the fibre connection include a wide spectre of businesses: the society in general, the coastal radio service, Helsenett, Avinor, the Governor of Svalbard, including police and SAR (Search And Rescue) resources, local government in Longyearbyen, the Norwegian Coastal Administration with services for maritime security, EUMETSAT11, NASA, NOAA, Galileo, Iridium, ESA, the Norwegian Mapping Authority as well as university and research units on the archipelago such as UNIS, the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research etc.</p>

<p><strong><em>Andrew Gregory of <a href="https://hackspace.raspberrypi.com/">HackSpace magazine</a> sat down with the one and only Jeff Geerling to chat about the wholesome corner of the internet he created. </em></strong></p>


<div>

<p>If you want to cut through the buzzwords and find out what tech actually does, you could do a lot worse than listen to Jeff Geerling. He’s built an utterly wholesome corner of the internet in which he explains, demonstrates, and demystifies the latest thing that everybody else pretends to know about. Linux, single-board computers, open source, developer tools, home automation – Jeff does the lot, and he wants to teach you how to do it, too. We thought we’d talk to him about what he’s been getting up to with his new Raspberry Pi 5. </p>



<h3><strong>HackSpace:&nbsp; Morning Jeff! You’ve done loads of Pi projects over the last couple of years. What do you still have running at the moment?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>Jeff Geerling</strong>:&nbsp; Things that are practical, really. I have Pis running all of my home network stuff, all the home lab-type things; I have a Pi running internet monitoring, so I can keep my ISP honest. I have a Pi running my VPN.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have no cloud services for my light bulbs, or for my HVAC or anything. It’s all running through Pis. I don’t have any cloud account tie-in. If the internet goes down here, the only thing is I can’t access it remotely, but everything’s still running. I love the privacy aspects of it. And I love the ability to learn new things through it – industrial automations, and controls, and APIs with these different systems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think one of the things that fascinates me the most is all these different IOT devices. Before I knew much about Pis and microcontrollers, I always thought IoT was magic. And then you open one of these up, and you just see a little microcontroller inside. It might just be an ESP board, or a Pico, or something else. But I know that I could hack it, and that opens up a new world. You could build one of those on your own to just about the same quality; you can’t get injection-moulded plastic, but everything else you can do on your own, and 3D printing has made it so that enclosures can be so much nicer. It’s just cool to see. It’s like taking down the wall of magic that you thought existed between really cool products and your own abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The projects that I do are typically rehashes of what other people have done; I might make the documentation a little better or I might package it up a little nicer. But really, I would say that I’m beginner-level electronics and beginner-level microcontrollers. I just have the ability to relate what I’m doing a little better than a lot of people who are experts at it.</p>



<p>A year or two ago, I talked to [Linux YouTuber] NetworkChuck about recording a podcast episode. He does a lot of stuff with Raspberry Pis, too, with red hat hacking and black hat stuff. And, you know, fun things. So we recorded the podcast. And it never went up because one of the microphones was messed up, and it sounded terrible. I didn’t hear from him for a while, and then on 01 March this year, he’s just like, ‘Hey, Jeff, do you want to work with me on a Mr. Beast project? At like, 9 am, right now?’ I had no travel planned and no deadlines, so I said yes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that was terrible, but also awesome. So many people who make things, especially if you make it for production use, want to make sure it actually works. So there’s a deadline attached to it. There are problems; there are always challenges, things you didn’t even think about. And that’s what happened on the Mr. Beast project. But that’s also kind of the addiction that drives us forward. Because while I would say I don’t want to ever do that again, I also say that was a fun experience. And getting to meet all the people there. And all of us going through that at the same time, solving all the challenges. It’s a weird kind of addiction that we have, I think, building software, building hardware, and working on something so big as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any time we solved a problem with a five-minute fix, the sheer number of computers we were using turned that into a multiple-hour fix.&nbsp;</p>


<div>

<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; Why Raspberry Pi? What’s so good about it?</strong></h3>



<p><strong>JG:&nbsp;</strong> Raspberry Pi devotes a lot of time to testing and to making sure manufacturing is better. And manufacturing in the UK is a pretty cool thing. How many computer companies manufacture things in their home country – there’s not many, and Raspberry Pi does on a huge scale. So there’s a lot of those things that some people don’t assign value to – not just the bits and the little circuits on the board and all that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open source is another balance that Raspberry Pi has to offer. There’s the Broadcom chip [which isn’t open-source] versus you’re building the operating system based on Debian, which is like one of the most open-source Linux distributions. And it’s a weird balance. In the hardware world, it seems like there’s a lot less open source, because if you put out an open-source design and someone else makes it, all of a sudden you have zero revenue. Versus software, there’s sales and support and services, and there’s a lot more revenue opportunities that can’t just be immediately consumed by another company. Although, recently we’ve seen Amazon doing that sometimes, and leading to licences like the BSL, which is not really open-source.</p>

And he loves open source software and hardware</figcaption></figure></div>


<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; I’ve heard of the BSD licence, but not BSL.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>JG:&nbsp;</strong> Most open-source licences don’t care if you’re a government or a spy or a bad person or a good person – it’s free. It’s unencumbered. But the BSL imposes a restriction: if you’re a big business, you can’t use it. Philosophically I can understand that stance, but don’t call it </p>



<p>open source: call it ‘source available’ or, you know, ‘maker friendly’. But on the flip side, there’s so many companies that start as a maker, somebody who designs a little thing, that thing becomes popular, and all of a sudden you’re a big business and your licence is void, just because you hit a revenue number. And it doesn’t matter if it’s 50 bucks or $5 billion, it’s a restriction and it’s a philosophical thing that’s not compatible with my understanding of the term ‘open source’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think Raspberry Pi offers a little bit of a different take on it. Early on, a lot of the hardware was super locked down and there weren’t datasheets. And one by one, they start making things better at release. So, you know, my hope is that someday we could get more open firmware and stuff for the Broadcom chips. I don’t know if that’ll ever happen. But it would be cool. Unlike many companies, where they start out open source and then start closing things, Raspberry Pi has always gotten better, even if it’s not perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; Hopefully people will like the new power button.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>JG:</strong> For me, the power button on the Pi 5 is the most appreciated new feature. It’s just so handy. Like, if I’m running a Raspberry Pi headless, with no keyboard, I can just do a quick shut down. I mean, I put power buttons on GPIO before, but it’s cumbersome. This is nice to have it on the board.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; And have you looked into the dual camera possibilities?</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>JG:&nbsp;</strong> So machine vision has gotten really interesting in the past year, to the point where there are open-source tools to do so many things that used to require tons of expensive I/O. You can do stereo camera depth vision with all open-source tools, and [I’m] hoping to use Google Coral TPU to do some of this stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Again, it breaks down that barrier between you and the magic. You pick up an iPhone 15 and it can do depth mapping with whatever that sensor is. And you’re like, man, I’ll never be able to do that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then you get a Pi 5 with Wi-Fi and two cameras, and you’re like, oh, I can plug these open-source libraries together. And we get this – it might not be as high resolution, and it might not be 60 frames per second, but you could do depth mapping and 3D stuff with a little board, and everything’s under 200 bucks, all in, including power supplies and everything. That’s a big difference.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I was a kid, you could go to RadioShack and buy an electronics hobbyist kit. And that’s how I learned the basics of resistors and all that. You put them together with little spring contacts, and it was really fun. And you could make buzzers and radios and all kinds of stuff – they don’t really exist anymore. All those hobbies that were big when I was a kid, a lot of them are superseded just by how amazing the technology we have today is. But the Raspberry Pi brings that back.</p>

<p>What’s funny is that the Raspberry Pi is actually better at IoT stuff than most IoT companies. Mostly because of the open source philosophy. If we all work together, all these individuals around the world can write plug-ins and do stuff where you can put home assistant at your house. And you can interact with any light bulb, any doorbell, any camera, any washing-machine controller. Whereas if you get Philips, you get the Philips stuff and if you get Sony, you get the Sony stuff.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s like the tool world: I use DEWALT mostly, because the first tool I bought was a DEWALT. So you gotta use the DEWALT battery, and then you’re like, well, I could buy this cheaper tool, it’s better. But then it won’t work with my battery. So now I have something like 25 DEWALT tools. I think that’s dumb. It’s ridiculous. And that’s how IoT people want to be: you have the smart hub from this company, and you buy all their stuff. But we’ve already seen companies fail, and then all of your smart stuff becomes dumb. And it’s worse than dumb because you can’t even turn on a light bulb, you know – their server goes down and your lights turn off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is an area where instead of just seeing behind the curtain how it’s done, you can do it better. That’s one thing that I love about the Raspberry Pi ecosystem and the open-source ecosystem together.</p>



<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; A slightly less practical, though no less awesome build of yours is the Pi cluster. Just one question: why?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>JG:&nbsp;</strong> For me, it’s fun. You get something out of it when you’re doing all this work on a cluster. And the first time you see all the nodes come up together, that’s kind of magic. And then also seeing the fact that, like, you can actually program things to scale. It’s useful for a job, especially if you’re gonna build software for the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a springboard for learning. And for a lot of us, we love that. We love hacking with things, and a Pi cluster is just a fun thing to do it. It also has the side benefit of being able to develop skills that might be incredibly useful. There are still a lot of companies that will pay good money for Kubernetes developers, and a lot of people have learned Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi. The shortage really built into that. And a lot of people started using small PCs that they got on eBay, which is perfectly fine. I think that’s awesome. The hard thing was, like, the reason the Pi was great was because it’s a $35 computer –&nbsp;now a $60 computer – but you can still get the Pi 4, and hopefully there’ll be more available now that Pi 5 has been announced. But it was a quick way to get into that whole ecosystem of learning. And, you know, it’s not necessary at all for a home lab. But it’s fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And it translated into me getting a better job and doing consulting, which also helped me with that opportunity that I got in the pandemic: I was consulting and making extra money from doing all the work I was doing on Pis, learning clustering, because the clustering skills got me a better-paying job. And it gave me the opportunity to save up some money over the next year. I went to full-time YouTube in 2021, so maybe the Pi cluster was the reason I got into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I did my first Pi cluster in 2016. And I had a cluster running from 2016 to 2020 24/7 at my house, and I think had something like two hours of downtime in that time period.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; You said that you’re not a hardware guy. Does that mean that you have a background in software?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p><strong>JG:&nbsp;</strong> I started off doing web design. The first ever project I did was helping a radio station. They just transitioned to computers instead of CDs for their music playback, and in their system it had a file that would write to with the current song. My dad had the idea of taking this data and putting the song name on the website, so people could be listening, go to the website, on their laptop, or in an office, back then people did not have smartphones. It was ahead of its time. So I built a little interface that had, like, a car radio with the song title in it in a little, I think it was in Courier font or something, because there were only ten or so fonts that you could use back then. It worked for five or six years, until they got a real website. But, that was my first-ever project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I learned electronics from my dad, who’s a radio engineer. And I, you know, I soldered together an FM radio. I still have the voltmeter that I soldered together when I was, like, eight years old or something. It still works, and I keep using it, even though it’s not as accurate as it could be. And I’m excited to do more of that since the Pico came out. I’ve done some more projects: I built a garage door sensor thing, and I’m working on some software for the Pimoroni Galactic Unicorn to write some stuff on the wall. And now I have a new office that I’m gonna go into. So there’s a lot of opportunities to build stuff for that.</p>



<h3><strong>HS:&nbsp; That’s a majestic piece of kit.</strong></h3>



<p><strong>JG:&nbsp;</strong> Yeah. And they put in little things like a button. You know, it’s nice to have a button here – now you can do, like, modes for the display. And you can even make a little game on the LEDs matrix. That’s the other thing that I love about the Pi ecosystem: Raspberry Pi works directly with some of these companies to make things better for everyone. And these companies work back with them. It’s a relationship that has been built up over the course of the past decade. It’s bearing more fruit with the Pico, and I think the Pi 5 will drive some of that, too. I’m really excited to see what people come up with with HATs for the Pi 5 with PCI Express. If anybody comes out with a dual 2.5 gigabit network cat, I’m gonna buy that thing the second I see it.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Europe's government watchdog has found that the European Commission's refusal to disclose which experts it consulted on the proposal to scan encrypted communication for child sexual abuse material amounted to maladministration.</p>
<p>The decision by the European ombudsman, made last month and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ombudsman.europa.eu/en/decision/en/176658">published</a> this week, stems from a complaint filed in December 2022 by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), an advocacy organization.</p>
<p>The European Commission has been trying to formulate rules for preventing the sharing of online child sexual abuse material, rules known as the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/proposal-regulation-laying-down-rules-prevent-and-combat-child-sexual-abuse_en">Regulation on Child Sexual Abuse</a> (CSA). But critics contend the proposed legislation would have to compromise private encrypted communication.</p>

    

<p>"The commission’s legislation would enable member states to compel online platforms, including those offering end-to-end encrypted messaging, to scan users' content and metadata for CSA images or 'grooming' conversations and behavior, and where appropriate report them to public authorities and delete them from their platforms," a coalition of advocacy groups, technology companies, and technical experts explained in <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2022/05/joint-statement-on-the-dangers-of-the-eus-proposed-regulation-for-fighting-child-sexual-abuse-online/">an open letter</a> last year.</p>

        


        

<p>"Such a requirement is fundamentally incompatible with end-to-end encrypted messaging because platforms that offer such service cannot access communications content."</p>
<p>Apple came to a similar conclusion when it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/12/08/apple_encryption_icloud/">abandoned</a> its own <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/15/clientside_side_scanning/">proposal</a> to implement a system to scan for CSA material on its devices. The UK, meanwhile, passed its own Online Safety Bill that authorizes telecom regulator Ofcom <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/uk_online_safety_bill_passes/">to demand decryption</a> – even as officials have acknowledged that's not technically feasible at the moment.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/13/clientside_scanning_csam_anderson/">Scanning phones to detect child abuse evidence is harmful, 'magical' thinking</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/29/eu_mandated_messaging_interop_paper/">EU mandated messaging platform love-in is easier said than done: Cambridge boffins</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/05/29/crypto_wars_fipr/">GCHQ bod tells privacy advocates: Most of our work is making sure we operate within the law</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/08/europe_eidas_browser/">Bad eIDAS: Europe ready to intercept, spy on your encrypted HTTPS connections</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Yet the European Commission still appears to believe there's a way to have bypassable strong end-to-end encryption while respecting privacy rights and maintaining operational security, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2015/04/28/us_politicians_complain_that_silicon_valley_cant_create_encryption_unicorn/">flying in the face</a> of mathematics. And it has evidently persisted in that belief based on consultations with so-called experts.</p>
<p>But the commission refused to identify the experts who helped draft the text related to scanning encrypted communications – which prompted the ICCL complaint.</p>

        

<p>"Numerous experts have warned that it is not technically feasible," the ICCL <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/ombudsman-european-commissions-concealment-of-secret-expert-list-on-csam-regulation-constitutes-maladministration/">said</a> in response to the Ombudsman's decision.</p>
<p>"Public <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://cdt.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-05-16-Letter-from-Public-Interest-Technologists.pdf">interest technologists</a> and more than <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Aeex72MtFBjKhExRTooVMWN9TC-pbH-5LEaAbMF91Y/edit">450 academics</a> have warned in public that 'technology to detect CSAM in encrypted content is currently not mature and will not be mature in the next two to five years.' This is in stark contrast to the views put forward by experts relied upon by the Commission, whose names the Commission is refusing to reveal."</p>
<p>The ICCL expressed concern about the commission's lack of transparency because of allegations about ties between the commission and commercial lobbyists.</p>

        

<p>In September, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/09/25/who-benefits-inside-the-eus-fight-over-scanning-for-child-sex-content/">a report</a> from Balkan Insight – an investigative non-governmental organization – traced how the European CASM proposal has been supported by organizations like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.thorn.org/">Thorn</a> that stand to benefit by providing content-scanning software.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the commission's coyness became less of an obstacle. Member of the European Parliament Patrick Breyer published <a href="https://digitalcourage.social/@echo_pbreyer/111364497308411817" rel="nofollow">the list</a> of experts on Mastodon, and Berlin-based advocacy group Netzpolitik <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://netzpolitik.org/2023/geheime-liste-wie-der-sicherheitsapparat-die-chatkontrolle-praegt/#dokument">also did so</a>.</p>
<p>The list of consultants includes five individuals from an organization providing CSAM scanning tools. It also features academics from the Stanford Internet Observatory; industry technologists from Google and Microsoft; representatives from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC); and agents of the Australian Federal Police, the Spanish Civil Guard, the UK's National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) and Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), and Europol.</p>
<p>Pointing to the findings of the Balkan Insights report, Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the UK's University of Cambridge, characterized the European Commission's refusal to publish the names of consulting experts as part of an broad attempt to undermine encryption by businesses that would benefit from content scanning contracts. This was aided by government intelligence services that fear being unable to listen in on important conversations happening through encrypted communications tools, such as Signal.</p>
<p>"We now have crypto war 3.0 coming upon us," Anderson told <em>The Register</em> in an interview, "because His Majesty the King advanced yesterday in his speech from the throne that there's going to be an Investigatory Powers Bill amendments act which, among other things, will give his majesty's ministers the powers to demand that … if you want to sell your wares in Britain and you propose to include any see new security features, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/07/ukgov_wants_prior_notice_of/">you've got to</a> disclose them to His Majesty's government first." ®</p>

<p>The new Outlook is not what it seems at first glance: a replacement for Microsoft Office Outlook - at least not yet. What it definitely is, however: way too curious.</p>
<p>Microsoft is singing the praises of the new Outlook and wants to persuade users to switch. But beware: if you try out the new Outlook, you risk transferring your IMAP and SMTP credentials of mail accounts and all your emails to Microsoft servers. Although Microsoft explains that it is possible to switch back to the previous apps at any time, the data will already be stored by the company. This allows Microsoft to read the emails.</p>

<p>The new Outlook now appears as a recommended app in the Windows Start menu of Windows 11 devices with the 2023 update. The Outlook client itself also offers to test the new Outlook version with a "The new Outlook" switch. This is still under development, but is set to replace the mail program and the calendar included in Windows in 2024. In a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">recent tech community article, Microsoft employee Caitlin Hart</a> also explains that it will also replace the classic Outlook. However, unlike the Windows Mail and Calendar apps, the timetable for this has not yet been set.</p>

  





<h3 id="nav_new_outlook__0">New Outlook: Warning about data transfers</h3>
<p>When adding a mail account in the new Outlook that is not hosted by Microsoft but is located on company mail servers, for example, the program displays a message. It <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/sync-your-account-in-outlook-to-the-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">links to a support article</a> that simply states that non-Microsoft accounts are synchronized with the Microsoft cloud, whereby Gmail, Yahoo, iCloud and IMAP accounts are currently supported. The new Outlook also does this in the versions for Android, iOS and Mac. This means that copies "of your email, calendar, and contacts will be synchronized between your email provider and Microsoft data center". This gives the company full access to all emails and allows it to read and analyze them. Microsoft wants to provide functions that way that Gmail and IMAP do not offer.</p>

<p>The note makes you wonder: What does Microsoft transfer where? When creating an IMAP account, c't was able to sniff the traffic between new Outlook and the Microsoft servers. It contained the target server, log-in name and password which were sent to those Servers of Microsoft. Although TLS-protected, the data is sent to Microsoft in plain text within the tunnel. Without informing or inquiring about this, Microsoft grants itself access to the IMAP and SMTP login data of users of the new Outlook.</p>

<h3 id="nav_other_accounts_1">Other accounts</h3>
<p>When switching from the old Outlook to the new one, it is installed the new software in parallel. Previously set up IMAP accounts are not automatically transferred, but the account stored in Windows is. During the test with Google accounts, authentication with OAuth2 was used. Users receive an authentication request and Microsoft does not receive any specific access data, but only an access token that users can revoke again.</p>
<p>An answer to our request for a statement from Microsoft is still pending. At this point in time, however, we must warn against trying out the new Outlook without thinking. In addition to all the emails, some credentials may even end up with Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft already attracted attention with such data redirections at the beginning of the year. After Office updates were applied on Mac computers, Outlook redirected the data to Microsoft's cloud servers without any user notification. At that time, the remedy was to delete IMAP accounts and set them up again. However, this is obviously no longer helpful with the new Outlook.</p>
<h3 id="nav_eu_data__2">EU Data Protection Institutions get involved</h3>
<p>The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information of Germany, Professor Ulrich Kelber, is alarmed by the data detour in Microsoft's new Outlook. <a href="https://social.bund.de/@bfdi/111381793883035665" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">He posted on Mastodon that he wants</a> to ask for a report from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who is responsible for companies like Microsoft, during a meeting of the European data protection supervisory authorities on Tuesday of the coming week.</p>

<p>Nordic recently <span><a href="https://www.nordicsemi.com/Nordic-news/2023/08/Leading-Semiconductor-Industry-Players-Join-Forces-to-Accelerate-RISC-V" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a></span> that it is joining an industry consortium of semiconductor companies to drive the adoption of an open source chip architecture called RISC-V. Why?</p>
<h2><!--more--><strong>RISC-V versus Arm</strong></h2>
<p>At first glance, Nordic announcing that it is putting its full technological and commercial weight behind the development and adoption of an open-source chip architecture might raise questions about how strong the company’s on-going relationship with Arm is.</p>
<p>After all, Arm provides a commercial chip architecture that is anything but open source, and has been used on Nordic's semiconductor wireless connectivity products since the 2012 launch of Nordic's nRF51 Series Systems-on-Chip (SoCs).</p>
<p>The nRF51 Series redefined the leading-edge of the Bluetooth LE market once and for all. And one of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of a powerful on-board Arm processor for the very first time on a Bluetooth chip. Nothing like it had ever been seen before in the Bluetooth LE market. In fact, the nRF51 Series literally sent Nordic's competitors scrambling back to the drawing board when it came to how to design a Bluetooth LE chip.</p>
<h2><strong>RISC-V will complement Arm</strong></h2>
<p>RISC-V was developed about 10 years ago at <span><a href="https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/riscv.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">UC Berkeley</a></span> in the U.S. and at first glance would seem to be competitive with Arm.</p>
<p>But I think this is way too narrow a view. I see RISC-V in a similar way to how I see the proliferation of wireless IoT connectivity standards: no one technology can be all things to (solve) all application problems. So does Bluetooth LE really compete with Thread or cellular IoT ? Of course not. Each is designed to do different things well, but not everything.</p>
<p>What RISC-V is in reality, therefore, is a complimentary alternative to Arm, and not a threat. And this is particularly true in power consumption-critical mobile and IoT applications where Arm has traditionally been dominant.</p>
<h2><strong>Optimizing for lowest power</strong></h2>
<p>At its heart, RISC-V is all about promoting innovation by giving users the ability to develop leading-edge, customized hardware based on an open-source chip architecture.</p>
<p>What RISC-V will do for Nordic's customers is give them the freedom and flexibility, in certain specific and highly specialized applications, to strip down the instruction set to ensure extreme levels of low power consumption.</p>
<p>To me, this is no different to how you can strip down a 2.4GHz proprietary wireless protocol to optimize for the ultra lowest power consumption in a way you simply could not match at such extremes with a standards-based protocol such as Bluetooth low energy.</p>
<p>Now RISC-V isn't of course proprietary. But just like a Nordic proprietary 2.4GHz protocol, if you are the developer behind it, you get far more control over every line of code to customize for the specific needs of your specific application.</p>
<h2><strong>Lowest power counts at the edge</strong></h2>
<p>So where might the ability to develop an ultra lowest power instruction set really come into its own?</p>
<p>To me it's at the edge in, for example, simpler embedded chips for sensors that require a small bit of processing power in order to deliver localized machine learning.</p>
<p>In such applications having an Arm core would be complete overkill. But that sensor may still need to communicate with and work alongside an Arm core-based Nordic device.</p>
<h2><strong>More options</strong></h2>
<p>What RISC-V will do is give our customers an extra option when seeking to minimize power consumption in certain applications where the (many) tradeoffs of not using an Arm-based core are acceptable.</p>
<p>RISC-V will also lower the barriers-to-entry and level the playing field when it comes to developing IoT applications. This will encourage even greater innovation in the IoT market.</p>
<p>What RISC-V will not do is conflict with Nordic's long-established use of Arm cores in its wireless IoT connectivity devices.</p>
<p>RISC-V will simply further enhance the design options for Nordic customers and particularly in simpler, ultra lowest power applications where every Joule and Watt counts.</p>

            <p>Obviously, I'm talking about Elon Musk. (He named SpaceX's drone ships after Iain M. Banks spaceships, thereby proving that irony is dead). But he's not the only one. There's Peter Thiel (who funds research into artificial intelligence, life extension, and seasteading. <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood">when he's not getting blood transfusions from 18 year olds</a> in hope of living forever). Marc Andreesen of Venture Capitalists Andreesen Horowitz recently published a self-proclaimed "<a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">techno-optimist manifesto</a>" promoting the bizarre accelerationist philosophy of Nick Land, among other weirdos, and hyping the current grifter's fantasy of large language models as "artificial intelligence". Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, is another. He's another space colonization enthusiast like Elon Musk, but while Musk wants to homestead Mars, Bezos is a fan of Gerard K. O'Neill's 1970s plan to build giant orbital habitat cylinders at the Earth-Moon L5 libration point. And no tour of the idiocracy is complete without mentioning Mark Zuckerberg, billionaire CEO of Facebook, who blew through ten billion dollars trying to create the Metaverse from Neal Stephenson's novel <em>Snow Crash</em>, only for it to turn out that his ambitious commercial virtual reality environment had no legs.</p>

<p>(That was a deliberate pun.)</p>

<p>It'd be amusing if these guys didn't have a combined net worth somewhere in the region of half a trillion euros and the desire to change the human universe, along with a load of unexamined prejudices and a bunch of half-baked politics they absorbed from the predominantly American SF stories they read in their teens. I grew up reading the same stuff but as I also write the modern version of the same stuff for a living I've spent a lot of time lifting up the rocks in the garden of SF to look at what's squirming underneath.</p>

<p>Science fiction influences everything this century, both our media and our physical environment. Media first: about 30% of the big budget movies coming out of the US film industry these days are science fiction or fantasy blockbusters, a massive shift since the 1970s. Computer games are wall-to-wall fantasy and SF—probably a majority of the field, outside of sports and simulation games. (Written fiction is another matter, and SF/F combined amount to something in the range 5-10% of books sold. But reading novels is a minority recreation this century, having to compete with the other media I just named. The golden age of written fiction was roughly 1850 to 1950, give or take a few decades: I make my living in an ageing field, kind of like being a classical music composer or an 8-bit games programmer today.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile the influence of science fiction on our environment seems to have been gathering pace throughout my entire life. The future is a marketing tool. Back in the early 20th century it was anything associated with speed—recall the fad for streamlining everything from railway locomotives to toasters, or putting fins on cars. Since about 1970 it becme more tightly associated with communication and computers. </p>

<p>For an example of the latter trend:  a decade or two ago there was a fad for cellular phones designed to resemble the original Star Trek communicator. The communicator was movie visual shorthand for "a military two-way radio, but make it impossibly small". But it turns out that enough people <em>wanted</em> an impossibly small clamshell telephone that once semiconductor and battery technology got good enough to make one, they made the Motorola Razr a runaway bestseller. </p>

<p>"Artificial intelligence" and "computer controlled" became marketing buzzwords decades ago. They're used to mis-sell cars described as "self-driving" and technologies like Tesla's so-called "autopilot". In reality, aircraft autopilots don't do what most people think they do (they require constant monitoring by pilots). And self-driving car software is dangerously insufficient to do the job, as witness the recent revelation that self-driving taxi firm Cruise—recently banned from San Fracisco after a pedestrian was dragged under one of their cars—requires constant human supervision. But as long as it sells cars to customers who think it means they can relax and watch a movie while they commute, why should Elon Musk care? Science fictional TV shows like "Knight Rider" in the 1980s primed those of us who grew up in the 1970s and 1980s to expect intelligent self-driving cars in the near future, and there has been a gold rush to sell self-driving cars, even though the technology isn't ready yet and has lethal failure modes. Because anything that tastes of the future is marketing gold.</p>

<p>It's becoming increasingly unusual to read a report of a new technology or scientific discovery that <em>doesn't</em> breathlessly use the phrase "it seems like science fiction".  The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies—which turned out to be a financial services bubble that drained a lot of small investors' savings accounts into the pockets of people like convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried. </p>

<p>It's also driving politics and law. Recently in the UK, Elon Musk paid a visit to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Last week we were given a preview of the government's legislative program for the coming year, and guess what it contained? Yes: new laws to permit self-driving vehicles on the roads, and regulation of artificial intelligence. And while some degree of government monitoring and regulation of these sectors is welcome, the UK has much bigger problems right now—and I'd rather the laws weren't drafted by an Elon Musk fanboy.</p>

<p>Now I've shouted as passing clouds for a bit—or dangerous marketing fads based on popular entertainment of decades past—I'd like to talk about something that I personally find much more worrying: a political ideology common among silicon valley billionaires of a certain age—known by the acronym TESCREAL—that is built  on top of a shaky set of assumptions about the future of humanity. It comes straight out of an uncritical reading of the bad science fiction of decades past, and it's really dangerous. </p>

<p>TESCREAL stands for "transhumanism, extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, rationalism (in a very specific context), Effective Altruism, and longtermism." It was identified by Timnit Gebru, former technical co-lead of the Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team at Google and founder of the Distributed Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (DAIR), and Émile Torres, a philosopher specialising in existential threats to humanity. These are separate but overlapping beliefs that are particularly common in the social and academic circles associated with big tech in California. Prominent advocates on the transhumanist and AI side include Ray Kurzweil, a notable technology evangelist and AI researcher at Google, philosophers Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky, and going back a long way earlier, Russian rocket scientist Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, whose writings brought Russian Cosmism to America. Sam Bankman-Fried is an outspoken advocate of Effective Altruism, another element of this overlapping web of beliefs. Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, as noted, both seem to be heavily influenced by Tsiolkovsky's advocacy of space colonization. Musk's Neuralink venture, attempting to pioneer human brain-computer interfaces, seems intent on making mind uploading workable, which in turn points to the influences of Kurzweil and other singularitarians. And hiding behind these 20th and early 21st century thinkers are older influences—notably the theological speculation of 19th century Russian Orthodox priest Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov.</p>

<p>How did this ideology come about, and why do I think it's dangerous?</p>

<p>(Longtermism is the belief that we should discount short-term harms to real existing human beings—such as human-induced climate change—if it brings us closer to the goal of colonizing the universe, because the needs of trillions of future people <em>who don't actually exist yet</em> obviously outweigh the needs of today's global poor. If you accept that it's our destiny as a species to take over the cosmos, then it follows that longtermist entrepreneurs are perfectly justified in moving fast, breaking things, and ruthlessly maximizing profit extraction, as long as they spend their wealth on colonizing Mars. Which is just the first step on the road to conquering the galaxy and a bunch of other stuff like mind uploading, becoming immortal, creating artificial intelligences to do all the tedious work, resurrecting the dead, and taking over the universe. It posits a destiny for humanity, which of necessity makes it a secular religion. It means that if you don't believe in their plans, then you're some kind of anti-science backsliding reactionary heretic. And if this sounds just slightly insane to you, well, that's probably because you're not Elon Musk or Peter Thiel.)</p>

<p>Speaking as a science fiction writer, I'd like to offer a heartfelt apology for my part in the silicon valley oligarchy's rise to power. And I'd like to examine the toxic role of science fiction in providing justifications for the craziness.</p>

<p>So, here's the thing: science fiction is <em>fiction</em>. And while we can dress it up in fancy clothes and declare that fiction is an artistic form for exploring the human condition, we're tip-toeing past the slaughterhouse with attached sausage factory—the industry that takes the raw material and puts it in front of us. As an editor once told me, "you can write anything you want, but we don't have to publish it." And without publishers, or some mechanism for replicating and advertising the existence of your text, you won't have any readers.</p>

<p>[[ 
Publishers, incidentally, are not monolithic. They're hives of human activity where people working in different departments each do their bit to try and turn the product they're taking in at one end—raw book manuscripts are about as appetizing as a raw animal carcass, they take a lot of work to make them appealing—into saleable books or tasty-looking sausages. I'm not going to get into the minutiae of trade publishing or we'd be here for the rest of the year, but as an author, my job is to convince an editor to buy my book. The editor's job is then to convince the marketing department that this book is commercially viable. And the marketing department try to push it in the very specific media channels that bookshop staff read to decide what products to order in next month. So there's a long chain of whispers between the author and the reader, and because a book that doesn't sell will cost each intermediary money, and there are hundreds of books per month to choose between, it's easier for them to say "no" than to say "yes".</p>

<p>I'm focussing here on a very specific channel, namely novels that are written and sold via traditional big publishing companies. Different constraints apply to different formats and different sales channels -- say, short fiction or web serials, sold via anthologies or self-published direct to Kindle or other ebook storefronts. But there's almost always a middle-man, even if you're self-publishing (the middle-man in this case is Patreon or Ko-Fi or Amazon an ad exchange somewhere: it's whoever processes payments for you). The only way to completely avoid middle-men is to give your work away for free. </p>

<p>The same is true of other media, such as film, TV, music, and games. If you refuse to compromise with your audience's expectations they will put the book down, flip channel, or leave a one-star review on Steam.</p>

<p>So I exist in a symbiotic relationship with my readers. They keep buying my books as long as they remain enjoyable. And my publishers keep publishing my books as long as the readers keep buying them. So like other SF writers I've got a financial incentive to write books that readers find enjoyable, and that usually means conforming to their pre-existing biases. Which are rooted in the ideas they absorbed previously. Science fiction as a genre has <em>inertia</em>, and it's hard to get new ideas to stick if they force the readers out of their comfort zone. </p>

<p>The science fiction genre that today's billionaires grew up with—the genre of the 1970s—has a history going back to an American inventor and publisher called Hugo Gernsback. Gernsback founded the first magazine about electronics and radio in the United States, <em>Modern Electrics</em>, in 1908, but today he's best remembered as the founder of the pulp science fiction magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em> in 1926. </p>

<p>The early 1908 issues of <em>Modern Electrics</em> would be instantly recognizable to a teenage personal computing enthusiast of the 1970s and early 1980s—the same generation as the tech billionaires this talk is really about. The first two decades of the 20th century saw a huge explosion of interest in the field of wireless—radio broadcasting as we know it today, but also amateur radio. Radio sets back then were hand-built and repaired by local enthusiasts, much like many early personal computers. Gernsback founded <em>Modern Electrics</em> to carry adverts for radio components and to promote the amateur radio hobby. He curated a directory of amateur radio users and their call signs and equipment, published articles about building and operating your own wireless set, and editorialized  about the future of radio. Amateur radio grew explosively in the nineteen-teens, and just like computer hobbyists half a century later, many of the radio hobbyists ended up working in the industry. </p>

<p>Gernsback began to publish general articles about science and technology, then fiction  with a focus on the science—including some of his own stories—culminating in starting the magazine <em>Amazing Stories</em> as a vehicle for fantastic tales about a technological future. And as a runaway commercial success, <em>Amazing Stories</em> spawned imitators and, eventually, an industry.</p>

<p>(We can skip over the details of how SF publishing developed from the earnest technophiliac visions of Gernsback to the two-fisted planetary romances of the pulp magazines in the 1920s, survived the collapse of the pulp magazine distribution network in the 1950s and migrated to paperback novels sold in wire racks in supermarkets, then colonized the heights of the publishing industry bestseller lists from the 1960s onwards.)</p>

<p>American SF was bootstrapped by a publisher feeding an engineering subculture with adverts for tools and components. There was an implicit ideology attached to this strain of science fiction right from the outset: the American Dream of capitalist success, mashed up with progress through modern technology, and a side-order of frontier colonialism. It's not a coincidence that the boom in planetary romances occured shortly after the American frontier was finally closed: the high frontier had a natural appeal and gradually replaced the western frontier in the popular imagination.</p>

<p>(As futurist and SF author Karl Schroeder remarks, every technology has political implications. If you have automobiles you will inevitably find out that you need speed limits, drunk driving laws, vehicle and driver licensing to ensure the cars and their drivers are safe ... and then jaywalking laws, the systematic segregation of pedestrians and <em>non</em>-automotive traffic from formerly public spaces, air pollution, and an ongoing level of deaths and injuries comparable to a small war. You also get diversion of infrastructure spending from railways to road building, and effective limits on civil participation by non-drivers.</p>

<p>The new radio enthusiast magazine readers Gernsback was cultivating didn't ask about the politics of radio, although it would come back to bite them in the 1930s with increased  regulation, then state censorship and the use of wireless broadcasts for wartime propaganda. They were just having fun and maybe trying to build a local radio repair shop. But there's been a tendency in American SF, ever since those early days, to be wilfully blind to the political implications of the shiny toys.)</p>

<p>There is a darker element to this era of science fiction. Gernsback's publishing empire arose around the time the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti published his Manifesto of Futurism (in 1909). Futurism <em>was</em> an explicitly ideological program—an artistic movement that  rejected of the past and celebrated speed, machinery, violence, youth and industry, and argued for the modernization and cultural rejuvenation of the Italian state. In 1918 Marinetti founded a Futurist Party, but a year later it merged with Benito Mussolini's movement, and Marinetti is credited as the co-author of the Fascist Manifesto of 1919. </p>

<p>Hugo Gernsback didn't consciously bring fascism into American SF, but the field was open to it by the 1930s. Possibly the most prominent contributor to far right thought in American science fiction was the editor John W. Campbell. Campbell edited <em>Astouding Science Fiction</em>, one of <em>Amazing Stories</em> rivals, from 1937 until 1971. (<em>Astounding</em> is still with us today, having changed its name to <em>Analog</em> in 1960.) Campbell discovered or promoted many now-famous authors, including Robert Heinlein, Isaac Asimov, E. E. Smith, and Jack Williamson. But Campbell was also an anti-communist red-baiter. He was overtly racist, an anti-feminist, and left his imprint on the genre as much by what he <em>didn't</em> publish as by what he did—and how he edited it. For example, Tom Godwin's classic short story <em>The Cold Equations</em> was sent back with editorial change requests three times before Godwin finally gave Campbell the ending he wanted: one that, as Cory Doctorow put it, turned the story "into a parable about the foolishness of women and the role of men in guiding them to accept the cold, hard facts of life". </p>

<p>Later in his career, Campbell fell victim to just about every pseudoscientific grift that was going. (If he was alive today he'd probably be selling NFTs.) He had a weakness for perpetual motion machines, was an enthusiast for Dianetics (which L. Ron Hubbard later turned into the Church of Scientology), and he was a firm believer in paranormal powers -- telepathy, telekinesis, and astral projection, (all now thoroughly disproven by research at the Koestler Institute of Parapsychology). </p>

<p>(Confirmation bias may have been at work here: a belief in psi powers implicitly supports an ideology of racial supremacy, and indeed, that's about the only explanation I can see for Campbell's publication of the weirder stories of A. E. Van Vogt.)</p>

<p>Campbell wasn't the only wellspring of right-wing thought in golden age SF. No quick tour would be complete without mentioning Ayn Rand, the Russian emigre and bestselling author who invented the far right philosophy of Objectivism. This centred (quote) "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute". Reason which, of course, was positioned as emotionless, neutral, factually grounded, and thereby  exempt from accusations of bias and subjectivity. Rand held that the only social system compatible with this obviously-correct philosophy was laissez-faire capitalism: you can probably see why this appeals to sociopathic billionaires and their fans.</p>

<p>Perhaps the weirdest ingredient in the mix of ideas that gave rise to what became known in the 1990s as the Californian Ideology is Russian Cosmism, the post-1917 stepchild of the mystical theological speculation of a Russian Orthodox theologian, Nikolai Fyodorovitch Fyodorov. </p>

<p>The Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy is your one-stop shop for batshit philosophers who unduly influenced the space program and gave rise to modern Transhumanism. As it notes: "Nikolai Fedorovich Fedorov (born 1829, died 1903), was founder of an immortalist (anti-death) philosophy emphasizing "the common task" of resurrecting the dead through scientific means."</p>

<p>The illegitimate son of a Russian prince, Federov grew up a devout Russian Orthodox Christian. He worked as a librarian and as a teacher, and through his writings he was the formative influence on the Russian cosmists, a Russian philosophical movement that prefigured transhumanism (and specifically extropianism). The cosmists in turn influenced Tsiolkovsky, who was a major inspiration for Soviet attitudes to space exploration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Fedorov found the widespread lack of love among people appalling. He divided these non-loving relations into two kinds. One is alienation among people: 'non-kindred relations of people among themselves.' The other is isolation of the living from the dead: 'nature's non-kindred relation to men.'" ... "A citizen, a comrade, or a team-member can be replaced by another. However a person loved, one's kin, is irreplaceable. Moreover, memory of one's dead kin is not the same as the real person. Pride in one's forefathers is a vice, a form of egotism. On the other hand, love of one's forefathers means sadness in their death, requiring the literal raising of the dead."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Federov believed in a teleological explanation for evolution, that mankind was on a path to perfectibility determined by god: human mortality was the biggest sign of our imperfection. He argued that the struggle against death would give all humanity a common enemy -- and a victory condition that could be established, in the shape of (a) achieving immortality for all, and (b) resurrecting the dead to share in that immortality. Quite obviously immortality and resurrection for all would lead to an overcrowded world, so Federov also advocated colonisation of the oceans and space: indeed, part of the holy mission would inevitably be to bring life (and immortal human life at that) to the entire cosmos.</p>

<p>(The wikipedia article on Federov discusses his transhumanist program in somewhat more detail than the IEP entry.)</p>

<p>The final word probably deserves to go to Nicholas Berdyaev (secondary source here) who in 1928 wrote, in a collection of liturgical essays on the Orthodox church:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The novelty of Fedorov's idea, one which frightens so many people, lies in the fact that it affirms an activity of man incommensurably greater than any that humanism and progressivism believe in. Resurrection is an act not only of God's grace but also of human activity. We now come to the most grandiose and bewildering idea of N. Fedorov. He had a completely original and unprecedented attitude towards apocalyptic prophecies, and his doctrine represents a totally new phenomenon in Russian consciousness and Russian apocalyptic expectation. Never before in the Christian world had there been expressed such an audacious, such an astounding concept, concerning the possibility of avoiding the Last Judgement and its irrevocable consequences, by dint of the active participation of man. If what Fedorov calls for is achieved, then there will be no end to the world. Mankind, with a transformed and definitively regulated nature, will move directly into the life eternal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm going to confess, at this point, to having in my youth read translations of Tsiolkovsy's writing, but not Federov—he was relatively obscure in the west until recently. The forebears of the American space program—Robert Goddard, Jack Parsons, and of course Wernher Von Braun—also read Tsiolkovsky. And through their writings, his plans for space colonization (and the ideas of Russian cosmism) leaked directly into the minds of science fiction authors like Robert Heinlein, Hal Clement, and Arthur C. Clarke.</p>

<p>Finally, I haven't really described Rationalism. It's a rather weird internet mediated cult that has congealed around philosopher of AI Eliezer Yudkowski over the past decade or so. Yudkowski has taken on board the idea of the AI Singularity—that we will achieve human-equivalent intelligence in a can, and it will rapidly bootstrap itself to stratospheric heights of competence and render us obsolete—and terrified himself with visions of paperclip maximizers, AIs programmed to turn the entire universe into paperclips (or something equally inhospitable to human life) with maximum efficiency. He and his followers then dived into a philosophical rabbit maze of trying to reason their way into minimizing harms arising from a technology that does not yet exist and may not even be possible. (In contrast, Nick Bostrom focussed on the philosophical implications of digitizing human brains so we can all be raptured up to live in the great cloud computer in the sky, a very modern riff on the Christian eschatological theory of resurrection.)</p>

<p>American SF from the 1950s to the 1990s contains all the raw ingredients of what has been identified as the Californian ideology (evangelized through the de-facto house magazine, WIRED). It's rooted in uncritical technological boosterism and the desire to get rich quick. Libertarianism and it's even more obnoxious sibling Objectivism provide a fig-leaf of philosophical legitimacy for cutting social programs and advocating the most ruthless variety of dog-eat-dog politics. Longtermism advocates overlooking the homeless person on the sidewalk in front of you in favour of maximizing good outcomes from charitable giving in the far future. And it gels neatly with the Extropian and Transhumanist agendas of  colonizing space, achieving immortality, abolishing death, and bringing about the resurrection (without reference to god). These are all far more fun to contemplate than near-term environmental collapse and starving poor people. Finally, there's accelerationism: the right wing's version of Trotskyism, the idea that we need to bring on a cultural crisis as fast as possible in order to tear down the old and build a new post-apocalyptic future. (Tommasso Marinetti and Nick Land are separated by a century and a paradigm shift in the definition of technological progress they're obsessed with, but hold the existing world in a similar degree of contempt.)</p>

<p>The hype and boosterism of the AI marketers collided with the Rationalist obsession in the public perception a couple of weeks ago, in the Artificial Intelligence Safety Summit at Bletchley Park. This conference hatched the Bletchley Declaration, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence. It featured Elon Musk being interviewed by Rishi Sunak on stage, and was attended by Kamala Harris, vice-president of the United States, among other leading politicians. And the whole panicky agenda seems to be driven by an agenda that has emerged from science fiction stories written by popular entertainers like me, writers trying to earn a living.</p>

<p>Anyway, for what my opinion is worth: I think this is bullshit. There are very rich people trying to manipulate investment markets into giving them even more money, using shadow puppets they dreamed up on the basis of half-remembered fictions they read in their teens. They are inadvertently driving state-level policy making on subjects like privacy protection, data mining, face recognition, and generative language models, on the basis of assumptions about how society <em>should</em> be organized that are frankly misguided and crankish, because there's no crank like a writer idly dreaming up fun thought experiments in fictional form. They're building space programs—one of them is up front about wanting to colonize Mars, and he was briefly the world's richest man, so we ought to take him as seriously as he deserves—and throwing medical resources at their own personal immortality rather than, say, a wide-spectrum sterilizing vaccine against COVID19. Meanwhile our public infrastructure is rotting, national assets are being sold off and looted by private equity companies, their social networks are spreading hatred and lies in order to farm advertising clicks, and other billionaires are using those networks to either buy political clout or suck up ever more money from the savings of the poor.</p>

<p>Did you ever wonder why the 21st century feels like we're living in a bad cyberpunk novel from the 1980s?</p>

<p>It's because these guys read those cyberpunk novels and mistook a dystopia for a road map. They're rich enough to bend reality to reflect their desires. But we're not futurists, we're entertainers! We like to spin yarns about the Torment Nexus because it's a cool setting for a noir detective story, not because we think Mark Zuckerberg or Andreesen Horowitz should actually pump several billion dollars into creating it. And that's why I think you should always be wary of SF writers bearing ideas.</p>

        <p>Idag har Målarna beslutat att i sympati och solidaritet med IF Metall varsla om blockad mot allt arbete på Teslabilar vid Lackverkstäder som är knutna till Lackavtalet. Blockaden berör samtliga billackeringsföretag och kommer att genomföras i två steg, 53 företag varslas idag den 10 november 2023 och om inget avtal mellan Tesla och IF Metall kommit på plats läggs ytterligare varsel på 56 företag under måndag till tisdag den 13-14 november. (109st sammanlagt).</p>
<p>För Målarna är det en självklarhet att stå sida vid sida med våra systrar och bröder i IF Metall och vi ser även faran i att en så stor och etablerad arbetsgivare utmanar den svenska kollektivavtalsmodellen, därför lägger vi dessa massiva varsel utan motstycke på avtalsområdet.</p>
<p>Målarnas Ordförande Mikael Johansson:” IF Metall företräder oss alla i den här konflikten, det är därför oerhört viktigt att hela fackföreningsrörelsen sluter upp som en och tillsammans tar den här fighten”.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Why are people so concerned with hardware power consumption nowadays? Some common answers to this question are that <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/3/9/8178213/apple-macbook-all-batteries">power is critically important for phones, tablets, and laptops</a> and that <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.utexas.edu/pub/dburger/papers/ISCA11.pdf">we can put more silicon on a modern chip than we can effectively use</a>. In 2001 <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=912412&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D912412">Patrick Gelsinger observed that if scaling continued at then-current rates</a>, chips would have the power density of a nuclear reactor by 2005, a rocket nozzle by 2010, and the surface of the sun by 2015. Needless to say, that didn't happen. The importance of portables and scaling limits are both valid and important reasons, but since they're widely discussed, I'm going to talk about an underrated reason.</p> <p>People often focus on the portable market because it's cannibalizing desktop market, but that's not the only growth market -- servers are also becoming more important than desktops, and power is really important for servers. To see why power is important for servers, let's look at some calculations about how what it costs to run a datacenter from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/012383872X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=012383872X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;linkId=Y6Z2OBCUCR72ALEB">Hennessy &amp; Patterson</a>.</p>  <p>One of the issues is that you pay for power multiple times. Some power is lost at the substation, although we might not have to pay for that directly. Then we lose more storing energy in a UPS. This figure below states 6%, but smaller scale datacenters can easily lose twice that. After that, we lose more power stepping down the power to a voltage that a server can accept. That's over a 10% loss for a setup that's pretty efficient.</p> <p>After that, we lose more power in the server's power supply, stepping down the voltage to levels that are useful inside a computer, which is often about another 10% loss (not pictured in the figure below).</p> <p><img src="https://danluu.com/images/datacenter-power/power_conversion.png" alt="Power conversion figure from Hennessy &amp; Patterson, which reproduced the figure from Hamilton" width="640" height="383"></p> <p>And then once we get the power into servers, it gets turned into waste heat. To keep the servers from melting, we have to pay for power to cool them. <a href="http://www.morganclaypool.com/doi/abs/10.2200/S00193ED1V01Y200905CAC006">Barroso and Holzle</a> estimated that 30%-50% of the power drawn by a datacenter is used for chillers, and that an additional 10%-20% is for the <a href="http://www.dchuddle.com/2011/crac-v-crah/">CRAC</a> (air circulation). That means for every watt of power used in the server, we pay for another 1-2 watts of support power.</p> <p>And to actually get all this power, we have to pay for the infrastructure required to get the power into and throughout the datacenter. Hennessy &amp; Patterson estimate that of the $90M cost of an example datacenter (just the facilities -- not the servers), 82% is associated with power and cooling<sup id="fnref:E"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:E">1</a></sup>. The servers in the datacenter are estimated to only cost $70M. It's not fair to compare those numbers directly since servers need to get replaced more often than datacenters; once you take into account the cost over the entire lifetime of the datacenter, the amortized cost of power and cooling comes out to be 33% of the total cost, when servers have a 3 year lifetime and infrastructure has a 10-15 year lifetime.</p> <p>If we look at all the costs, the breakdown is:</p>  <table> <tbody><tr> <th>category</th><th>%</th></tr> <tr> <td>server machines</td><td>53</td></tr> <tr> <td>power &amp; cooling infra</td><td>20</td></tr> <tr> <td>power use</td><td>13</td></tr> <tr> <td>networking</td><td>8</td></tr> <tr> <td>other infra</td><td>4</td></tr> <tr> <td>humans</td><td>2</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p>Power use and people are the cost of operating the datacenter (OPEX), whereas server machines, networking, power &amp; cooling infra, and other infra are capital expenditures that are amortized across the lifetime of the datacenter (CAPEX).</p> <p>Computation uses a lot of power. <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/05/19/microsoft-building-new-data-center-in-quincy/">We used to build steel mills near cheap sources of power</a>, but <a href="http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/05/19/microsoft-building-new-data-center-in-quincy/">now that's where we build datacenters</a>. As companies start considering the full cost of applications, we're seeing a lot more power optimized solutions<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">2</a></sup>. Unfortunately, this is really hard. On the software side, with the exceptions of toy microbenchmark examples, <a href="http://arcade.cs.columbia.edu/energy-oopsla14.pdf">best practices for writing power efficient code still aren't well understood</a>. On the hardware side, Intel recently released a new generation of chips with significantly improved performance per watt that doesn't have much better absolute performance than the previous generation. On the hardware accelerator front, some large companies are building dedicated power-efficient hardware for specific computations. But with existing tools, hardware accelerators are costly enough that dedicated hardware only makes sense for the largest companies. There isn't an easy answer to this problem.</p> <p><small> If you liked this post, you'd probably like chapter 6 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/012383872X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=012383872X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=abroaview-20&amp;linkId=Y6Z2OBCUCR72ALEB">Hennessy &amp; Patterson</a>, which walks through not only the cost of power, but a number of related back of the envelope calculations relating to datacenter performance and cost.</small></p> <p>Apologies for the quickly scribbled down post. I jotted this down shortly before signing an NDA for an interview where I expected to learn some related information and I wanted to make sure I had my thoughts written down before there was any possibility of being contaminated with information that's under NDA. </p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <div id="textcore-aa1eae23b3">
    <p>Using data from the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb">International Database</a>, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates the world population hit 8 billion on September 26.</p>
<p>Emphasis on the word <i>estimates</i>.<br>
</p>
<p>There are many sources of uncertainty in estimating the global population, and it’s unlikely this population milestone was reached on that exact date.</p>
<p>For example, the United Nations (U.N.) Population Division estimates the world population <a href="https://www.un.org/en/dayof8billion" target="_blank">reached 8 billion on November 15, 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Only around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility — above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.</p>

    

</div>
<div id="textcore-55f540f016">
    <p>Why the discrepancy? Many of the world’s most populous countries (such as India and Nigeria), haven’t conducted a census in over 10 years, and many countries lack civil registration and vital statistics systems that accurately record births and deaths among their population.</p>
<p>Given the lack of precise population data worldwide, the U.N. and Census Bureau estimates are not that far apart, and both imply similar overall trends.&nbsp;</p>

 <h3>Population Growing at Slower Pace</h3>
</p>

    

</div>
<div id="textcore-d1f3f15fdd">
    <p>The rate of growth peaked decades ago in the 1960s and has been declining since and is projected to continue declining.</p>
<p>While it took 12.5 years for the world to go from 7 billion to 8 billion people, we project it will likely take 14.1 years to go from 8 billion to 9 billion, and another 16.4 years to go from 9 billion to 10 billion.</p>
<p>Despite a slowdown, we project the world population will reach 10.2 billion by 2060.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These broad global trends mask wide diversity. Population growth is the result of fertility, mortality, migration and the share of the population at certain ages. These trends all differ from country to country and, as a result, population growth varies around the world.</p>

 <h3>Declining Fertility Continues </h3>
</p>

    

</div>
<div id="textcore-aa2d2fe088">
    <p>Nearly three quarters (74%) of the earth’s population reside in countries where fertility is around or below the replacement level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is widely believed that 2.1 is the replacement-level fertility rate — the number of births a woman would need to have in her lifetime to replace herself and the father. However, the precise level of fertility necessary for long-term replacement varies between countries due to different mortality rates.</p>
<p>Around 33% of the world population — approximately 1 in 3 people — lives in a country with a fertility rate close to replacement, including diverse countries such as India, Tunisia and Argentina. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Demographers once assumed fertility would stop declining once it reached replacement levels. But it has continued to decline below replacement levels in many countries.</p>
<p>Around 15% of the world’s population lives in a country with low fertility of 1.6 to 1.8 children per woman. This includes a diverse range of countries like Brazil, Mexico, the United States and Sweden.</p>
<p>Another 26% — about 1 in 4 people — lives in a country with very low fertility at 1.5 children or fewer per woman. Such countries include China, South Korea and Spain.</p>
<p>Another 23% lives in a country with moderately high fertility between 2.3 and 5.0 children.&nbsp;This broad category includes a diverse range of countries like Papua New Guinea, Israel and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Only around 4% of the world population (all in Africa) lives in a country with very high fertility — above 5 children per woman. Even in countries with very high fertility, fertility is generally lower than it was in the past.</p>

<p>It’s projected that Benin will have the world’s highest projected total fertility rate (3.8) in 2060. There will, of course, still be women who have four or more children, but it is unlikely entire countries will average four or more children per woman.&nbsp;</p>

 <h3>Most Growth Will Come From Adult Populations </h3>

    <p>The world population is projected to keep growing despite declining fertility rates. In fact, we estimate the number of infants already peaked in 2017. Instead, population growth in the future will come from larger groups of people at adult ages. Demographers call this phenomenon population momentum.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows the world population by age in 2023 and the projected population by age in 2060. Population growth between now and 2060 will be from the population pyramid “filling up” previously sparse older age groups, not from growing numbers of births.&nbsp;</p>

 <h3>Global Aging</h3>
</p>

    

</div>
<div id="textcore-3f3e606aa6">
    <p>As fertility declines, there are proportionally fewer younger people and more older people.</p>
<p>The share of the population at young ages has been declining. Today, 32% of people are 19 or younger. By 2060, that number is projected to slip to 26%.</p>
<p>As the share of young people declines, the proportion of people at older ages increases. Today, 10% of the world is 65 or older and their share is projected to double to 20% by 2060.</p>
<p>As a result, the median age is changing. Today, the global median age is 32 (half the population is younger and half older). By 2060, however, the global median age is projected to climb to 39 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These general trends vary by country. Niger is the world’s youngest country, with a median age of 15 in 2023. Monaco, by contrast, is the oldest, with a median age of 56 in 2023.&nbsp;</p>

 <h3>Increasing Life Expectancy </h3>
</p>

    

</div>
<div id="textcore-564af52f88">
    <p>In many countries where young-age mortality is already low, gains in life expectancy come from improving conditions at older ages.</p>
<p>Canada, for instance, did not experience big declines in <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/table?YR_ANIM=2020&amp;COUNTRY_YEAR=2023&amp;COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2023&amp;menu=tableViz&amp;quickReports=CUSTOM&amp;CUSTOM_COLS=E0,MR0_4&amp;FIPS=CA&amp;TABLE_RANGE=2000,2023&amp;TABLE_YEARS=2000,2023&amp;TABLE_USE_RANGE=N&amp;TABLE_USE_YEARS=Y&amp;TABLE_STEP=1&amp;TABLE_ADD_YEARS=2000,2023&amp;CCODE=CA&amp;CCODE_SINGLE=CA">young-age mortality</a> between 2000 and 2023, but its total life expectancy increased by an average of about 4 years, largely from reduced mortality at older ages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For many other countries, however, life expectancy trends are driven more by dramatic declines in child mortality. In Niger, for example, <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/table?COUNTRY_YEAR=2023&amp;COUNTRY_YR_ANIM=2023&amp;CCODE_SINGLE=NE&amp;CCODE=NE&amp;menu=tableViz&amp;quickReports=CUSTOM&amp;CUSTOM_COLS=MR0_4&amp;TABLE_YEARS=2000,2023&amp;TABLE_USE_RANGE=N&amp;TABLE_USE_YEARS=Y&amp;TABLE_STEP=1&amp;TABLE_ADD_YEARS=2000,2023">child mortality declined</a> from around 224 deaths of children under 5 per 1,000 births in 2000 to 103 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023.</p>
<p>As a result, the country’s average life expectancy at birth increased from 45 years in 2000 to 60 years in 2023. We project that Niger will continue this trend and that child mortality will drop to 45 deaths per 1,000 births by 2060.</p>
<p>Life expectancy gains from reducing mortality at young ages make populations younger. As fewer children die, there are more children in the population.</p>
<p>While life expectancy is generally increasing, there are some exceptions. Many countries saw a decline in life expectancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are gradually incorporating COVID-19 mortality into the population estimates available in the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/idb/#/country?COUNTRY_YEAR=2023">International Database (IDB)</a> as more recent mortality data become available.&nbsp;</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p id="paragraph-0">One windy night at Elon Musk’s SpaceX facility in McGregor, Texas, Lonnie LeBlanc and his co-workers realized they had a problem.</p>
<p id="paragraph-1">They needed to transport foam insulation to the rocket company’s main hangar but had no straps to secure the cargo. LeBlanc, a relatively new employee, offered&nbsp;a solution to hold down the load: He sat on it.</p>
<p id="paragraph-2">After the truck drove away, a gust blew LeBlanc and the insulation off the trailer, slamming him headfirst into the pavement. LeBlanc, 38, had retired nine months&nbsp;earlier from the U.S. Marine Corps. He was <a href="https://www.legacy.com/funeral-homes/obituaries/name/lonnie-leblanc-obituary?pid=171515410&amp;v=batesville&amp;view=guestbook" id="article-link-0">pronounced dead</a> from head trauma at the scene.</p>

    <figure id="3MDV3GA4SO_0" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">Lonnie LeBlanc died after a wind gust blew him off a truck that was moving insulation at SpaceX’s McGregor, Texas, facility. U.S. regulators cited the company for “serious” safety lapses contributing to the accident. This photo, posted with his obituary, was provided by the family to a funeral home and a local newspaper. </figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-4">Federal inspectors with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) later determined&nbsp;that SpaceX had failed to protect LeBlanc from a clear hazard, noting the gravity and severity of the violation.&nbsp;LeBlanc’s co-workers told OSHA that SpaceX had no convenient access to tie-downs and no process or oversight for handling such loads. SpaceX acknowledged the problems, and the agency instructed the company to make seven specific safety improvements, including more training and equipment, according to the inspection report.</p>
<p id="paragraph-5">It was hardly the last serious accident at SpaceX. Since LeBlanc’s death in June 2014, which hasn’t been previously reported, Musk’s rocket company has disregarded worker-safety regulations and standard practices at its inherently dangerous rocket and satellite facilities&nbsp;nationwide, with workers paying a heavy price, a Reuters investigation found. Through interviews and government records, the news organization documented at least 600 injuries of SpaceX workers since 2014.</p>
<p id="paragraph-6">Many were serious or disabling. The records included reports of more than 100 workers suffering cuts or lacerations, 29 with broken bones or dislocations, 17 whose hands or fingers were “crushed,” and nine with head injuries, including one skull fracture, four concussions and one traumatic brain injury. The cases also included five burns, five electrocutions, eight accidents that led to amputations,&nbsp;12 injuries involving multiple unspecified body parts, and seven workers with eye injuries. Others were relatively minor, including more than 170 reports of strains or sprains.</p>
<p id="paragraph-7">Current and former employees said such injuries reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk’s aggressive deadlines for space missions. SpaceX, founded by Musk more than two decades ago, takes the stance that workers are responsible for protecting themselves, according to more than a dozen current and former employees, including a former senior executive.</p>
<p id="paragraph-8">Musk himself at times appeared cavalier about safety on visits to SpaceX sites: Four employees said he sometimes played with a novelty flamethrower and discouraged workers from wearing safety yellow&nbsp;because he dislikes bright colors.</p>
<p id="paragraph-9">The lax safety culture, more than a dozen current and former&nbsp;employees said, stems in part from Musk’s disdain for perceived bureaucracy and a belief inside SpaceX that it’s leading an urgent quest to create a refuge in space from a dying Earth.</p>
<p id="paragraph-10">“Elon’s concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company,” said Tom Moline, a former SpaceX senior avionics engineer who was among a group of employees fired after raising workplace complaints. “The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-12">One severe injury in January 2022 resulted from a series of safety failures that illustrate systemic problems at SpaceX, according to eight former&nbsp;SpaceX employees familiar with the accident. In that case, a part flew off during pressure testing of a Raptor V2 rocket engine – fracturing the skull of employee Francisco Cabada and putting him in a coma.</p>
<p id="paragraph-13">The sources told Reuters that senior managers at the Hawthorne, California site were repeatedly warned about the dangers of rushing the engine’s development, along with inadequate training of staff and testing of components. The part that failed and struck the worker had a flaw that was discovered, but not fixed, before the testing, two of the employees said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-14">Cabada’s wife told Reuters the company has ignored the family’s attempts to find out why he wasn’t protected.&nbsp;“It would have been nice to get a call from Elon Musk,” Ydy Cabada said. “But I guess workers are just disposable to them.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-15">In all, Reuters interviewed more than three dozen people with knowledge of SpaceX safety practices, including more than two dozen current or former employees. Many of the sources spoke on condition of anonymity, citing concerns about career or legal repercussions.</p>
<p id="paragraph-16">SpaceX did not respond to questions from Reuters and a detailed description of this article’s findings.</p>
<p id="paragraph-17">The more than 600 SpaceX injuries Reuters documented&nbsp;represent only a portion of the total case count, a figure that is not publicly available. OSHA has required companies to report their total number of injuries annually since 2016, but SpaceX facilities failed to submit reports for most of those years. About two-thirds of the injuries Reuters uncovered came in years when SpaceX did not report that annual data, which OSHA collects to help prioritize on-site inspections of potentially dangerous workplaces.</p>

    <blockquote id="1OL66Q324O_2">
        <p>“Elon’s concept that SpaceX is on this mission to go to Mars as fast as possible and save humanity permeates every part of the company. The company justifies casting aside anything that could stand in the way of accomplishing that goal, including worker safety.”</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-19">Reuters unearthed details about the 600-plus injuries by examining court documents in worker lawsuits, employee medical records, state workers’ compensation claims and emergency-call records. The news agency also obtained, through public records requests, internal SpaceX injury logs that the company turned over to federal and state&nbsp;safety inspectors following serious safety incidents. Such logs are rarely made public. Regulators require companies to keep the records, which include descriptions of individual injuries, and to produce them upon request.</p>
<p id="paragraph-20">After years of failing to report annual injury-and-illness statistics to regulators, some SpaceX sites started filing the data in 2021 or 2022. The data for 2022, which are more complete, reveal injury rates at three major SpaceX industrial facilities that far exceeded the space-industry average.</p>
<div id="0X4SUIHW4I_3">
<p id="paragraph-22">SpaceX injury data reporting failures</p>
<p id="paragraph-23">SpaceX facilities failed to submit injury data annually, as required by regulators, for most years since 2016.&nbsp;When they did report, three major sites’ injury rates far exceeded industry averages. <strong id="5XH6WGIWWM_4">The average was 0.8 injuries per 100 workers for 2022</strong>&nbsp;and has been relatively stable for many years.</p>

    
</div>
<p id="paragraph-26">The 2022 injury rate at the company’s manufacturing-and-launch facility near Brownsville, Texas, was 4.8 injuries or illnesses per 100 workers – six times higher than the space-industry average of 0.8. Its rocket-testing facility in McGregor, Texas, where LeBlanc died, had a rate of 2.7, more than three times the average. The rate at its Hawthorne, California, manufacturing facility was more than double the average at 1.8 injuries per 100 workers. The company’s facility in Redmond, Washington, had a rate of 0.8, the same as the industry average.</p>

        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A portion of the OSHA report on an inspection that uncovered safety failures contributing to the 2014 death of worker Lonnie LeBlanc.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-28">Two other SpaceX facilities in Florida, at Kennedy Space Center and Cape Canaveral, could not be compared to the industry average in 2022. Kennedy didn’t report injury data that year. And the company labeled Cape Canaveral as part of a different industry subcategory for which the government doesn’t calculate an average rate.</p>
<p id="paragraph-29">The Kennedy site did report injury data for 2016, the first year it was required to do so – but hasn’t reported since. For that year, the facility reported data amounting to an injury rate of 21.5 injuries per 100 workers, about 27 times the industry average. The facility employed only 50 people at the time; it had just taken over a launch pad from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Sixteen of those workers were injured, SpaceX reported. By 2021, employment at Kennedy had grown to more than 1,100 workers, NASA said.</p>

    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-32">A dozen worker-safety experts said SpaceX’s poor safety record underscores the perils of working in the lightly regulated and fast-expanding U.S. space industry. Other major space companies have also failed to report annual injury data to OSHA in some recent years.</p>
<p id="paragraph-33">Reuters reviewed state and federal safety violation records&nbsp;on SpaceX and found no sanctions for its data-reporting failures. For safety&nbsp;violations that inspectors found after SpaceX worker accidents, state and federal regulators levied only small fines, typically ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p id="paragraph-34">In a written response to questions from Reuters, OSHA did not comment on SpaceX’s worker safety record or its enforcement decisions involving the company. The agency did not address why it never cited SpaceX for failing to report injury data for many years, saying it would be “unfair to draw a conclusion” because it didn’t know “the specifics.” Reuters documented the safety reporting lapses using the agency’s own records.</p>
<p id="paragraph-35">The agency did say it has recently increased inspections of companies generally and issued more of its stiffest penalties in egregious cases.</p>
<p id="paragraph-36">California OSHA, a state-run workplace safety regulator, did not comment in response to Reuters’ questions.</p>

    <blockquote id="KRU4RKID0P_10">
        <p>Current and former employees said SpaceX’s high injury rates reflect a chaotic workplace where often under-trained and overtired staff routinely skipped basic safety procedures as they raced to meet Musk’s aggressive deadlines for space missions.</p>
        
    </blockquote>
<p id="paragraph-38">NASA said it has paid SpaceX $11.8 billion to date as a private space contractor. The agency did not comment on the company’s safety record but said it has the option of enforcing contract provisions that require SpaceX to “have a robust and effective safety program and culture.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-39">SpaceX has defended its safety practices in written responses to OSHA and CalOSHA. In response to an inquiry into the Cabada accident, SpaceX argued to CalOSHA that it shouldn’t be held responsible for such injuries because it provides extensive safety training and the malfunction was not reasonably foreseeable. Accountability for such part failures and any resulting injuries falls instead on a cadre of employees known as “responsible engineers,” or REs, the company wrote.</p>
<p id="paragraph-40">“REs are ultimately responsible for all aspects of their components and systems,” including safety, the company wrote.&nbsp;“Put simply, the RE is the delegated SpaceX representative.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-41">Safety specialists dismissed SpaceX’s contention that it can off-load the company’s duty to ensure worker safety to specific engineers it employs. Jordan Barab, who served as an OSHA deputy assistant secretary between 2009 and 2017, called the notion “ludicrous.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-42">OSHA told Reuters that employers, not designated employees, are responsible for ensuring a hazard-free workplace.</p>
<p id="paragraph-43">Travis Carson, a former Brownsville welder and production&nbsp;supervisor, said SpaceX generally left staffers in charge of their own safety, with little training or oversight.</p>
<p id="paragraph-44">“SpaceX’s idea of safety is: ‘We’ll let you decide what’s safe for you,’ which really means there was no accountability,” said Carson, who has worked for more than two decades in dangerous jobs such as building submarines. “That’s a terrible approach to take in industrial environments.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-46">‘No accountability’</p>
<p id="paragraph-47">Since Musk co-founded SpaceX in 2002, his free-wheeling entrepreneurism has proved a powerful draw for young skilled workers. Some SpaceX employees described eagerly joining the company as it outpaced competitors and offered perks including in-house medical clinics and private company stock that has shot up in value. The company, which employs 13,000 workers, had an estimated value of $150 billion as of earlier this year. Musk has a 42% stake and 79% of the company’s voting power, according to a company filing.</p>
<p id="paragraph-48">SpaceX has achieved major breakthroughs. It was the first private company to send humans into orbit. Its Starlink unit is now the world’s largest satellite operator. Competitors including Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin&nbsp;have struggled to keep pace with SpaceX’s reusable rockets, which have slashed launch costs.</p>
<p id="paragraph-49">Some SpaceX engineers say they relish collaborating with creative coworkers in an environment with little bureaucracy. “There’s a certain amount of red tape that SpaceX avoids, which allows it to move faster” than NASA or private competitors, said Chris Cunnington, a former engineer in McGregor, Texas. He said he believed SpaceX struck a good balance between speed and safety.</p>
<p id="paragraph-50">Other current and former employees at the company’s Brownsville site, which had the highest 2022 injury rate, said the company’s disdain for structured processes came at a high cost to workers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-51">SpaceX started building its Brownsville site in 2014, and it has since become the epicenter of Musk’s Mars mission. The facility employs more than 1,600 workers on the Texas-Mexico border and combines manufacturing, testing and launching. It’s the base of SpaceX’s Starship program, a project aiming to build cheaper rockets faster.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-53">Brownsville managers, many of them in their 20s, worked grueling hours trying to meet Musk’s deadlines, according to six current or former&nbsp;employees familiar with the site’s operations, including Moline and Carson. Some workers slept overnight at the facility at times so they could work more than 80 hours a week, according to four of those employees.</p>
<p id="paragraph-54">Carson worked at the Brownsville site as a welder in 2019 and 2020 and returned as a production supervisor in 2021 and 2022. He said some employees took Adderall, the stimulant typically used to treat attention-deficit disorder, without a prescription. Others fell asleep in bathrooms, said Carson and three other current or former Brownsville workers.</p>
<p id="paragraph-55">To speed work and cut costs, SpaceX started manufacturing rockets in tents next to an undeveloped Gulf of Mexico beach. Workers welded rocket parts up to 12 hours a day, six days a week, often in temperatures over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the SpaceX workers said. When overcome by heat, they were given IV fluids and sent back to work.</p>
<p id="paragraph-56">When high winds disrupted the work, supervisors shut the tents, closing off ventilation that is essential for safe welding, according to the six current and former workers. <a href="https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/OSHA_FS-3647_Welding.pdf" id="article-link-2">OSHA warns</a> that welding stainless steel can generate a highly toxic, cancer-causing dust. The agency told Reuters it requires companies to assess the danger of such environments through air sampling and to implement a “respiratory protection program” when needed. One former welder, Phillip Fruge, said he asked managers for respirators commonly used to protect welders’ lungs, but they weren’t provided.</p>
<p id="paragraph-57">“We could see the clouds of the dust filling the tent,” Fruge recalled. “Everyone was just breathing it in, day after day.”</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-59">Carson said he pressed superiors for better safety measures but was ignored. He recalled stepping into the interior of a rocket under construction in 2021 on his first day as a supervisor. Another manager, working 20 feet above him, carelessly dropped a nearly 100-pound hoist, barely missing Carson.</p>
<p id="paragraph-60">“That’s like a firing offense at other places, but not at SpaceX,” Carson said. “They needed bodies, and Elon needed stuff done.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-61">Carson himself eventually was fired in January 2022 after getting into a scuffle with a boss. Carson, who is African American, said he shoved the manager, a younger man, because he had repeatedly called Carson “boy,” despite Carson’s requests that he stop. “Boy” is widely considered a racial epithet by Americans when used to refer to a Black man. The supervisor, who could not be reached for comment, was not disciplined, according to Carson. Reuters could not independently confirm how SpaceX handled the incident.</p>
<p id="paragraph-62">SpaceX sometimes rushed to hire workers and regularly failed to properly train or equip new recruits, more than a dozen current and former employees said. Workers with no experience, for instance,&nbsp;were handed welding tools without training, they said. Four of these employees, who were managers fresh out of college, described making tough calls on the safety of dangerous activities with little guidance.</p>
<p id="paragraph-63">In November 2021, two Brownsville technicians were moving square steel tubing weighing 500 pounds, using a crane with a lifting magnet, according to OSHA inspection records. The tubing fell and crushed a worker’s hand because the crane was only designed to hoist 300 pounds, OSHA concluded.</p>
<p id="paragraph-64">The employee, whose name was redacted in the inspection report the agency gave Reuters, required long-term treatment after surgery, including the partial amputation of the worker’s ring finger, according to the report. The agency faulted the company for failing to ensure employees tested whether the crane could lift the load.&nbsp;SpaceX appealed the resulting $43,506 fine and got it knocked down to $8,701 after agreeing to remedy the worker-safety problems identified in the report.</p>

<p id="paragraph-66">Florentino Rios suffered a severe eye injury at SpaceX’s Brownsville site one summer night in 2021, as he worked about 25 feet off the ground attaching two beams to a launch pad. A crane operator missed a hand signal from Rios and mistakenly tried to move the beams after they were fixed in place, Rios said in an interview. That error caused a chain connecting the crane to the beams to snap and strike Rios in the face. Another worker who was present confirmed Rios’ account.</p>
<p id="paragraph-67">The team should have had walkie-talkies, Rios said, and had previously asked management for better lighting.</p>
<p id="paragraph-68">As blood trickled down his face, Rios inched along a beam to a platform where he was lowered down, he said. SpaceX employees who examined him at an on-site medical clinic told him he could return to work on the next shift, although he still couldn’t see well, said his attorney, Richard Hinojosa. Reuters could not independently confirm the SpaceX medical clinic’s assessment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-69">Rios went to the hospital that night. A medical scan revealed a traumatic injury in his swollen left eye, according to medical and workers’ compensation records reviewed by Reuters.&nbsp;He continued to work anyway for a few days.&nbsp;When he sought further treatment, doctors told him he had lost vision in the eye and was legally blind, the records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-70">Rios, 55, said he can no longer drive or work construction. He sued SpaceX alleging its negligence caused the injury by failing to implement or follow worker-safety procedures. “It wasn’t safe,” Rios said, adding that management never addressed the problems.</p>
<p id="paragraph-71">The company, in court records, argued that Rios’ own negligence was to blame. The case is ongoing.</p>
<p id="paragraph-72">“I used to be someone who didn’t like sitting around,” said Rios. “I worked day and night to give my children what they needed. And now, I can’t.”</p><figure id="video-title" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">

<p id="paragraph-74">Shortcutting safety</p>
<p id="paragraph-75">On Jan. 18 of last year, part of a Raptor V2 engine broke away during pressure testing at the SpaceX facility in Hawthorne, California. The part, a fuel-controller assembly cover, careened into the head of Cabada, a SpaceX technician. Nearly two years later, the father of three young children remains in a coma with a hole in his skull, family members said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-76">The accident generated <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/10/18/2022/space-x-technician-accident" id="article-link-3">news</a> last year but little has emerged until now about the causes. The incident stemmed from several safety lapses at the Hawthorne site, according to Reuters interviews with eight former SpaceX employees familiar with the incident and the testing preparations.</p>
<p id="paragraph-77">Two of the employees said the mishap resulted in part from a simple mistake: An engineer started the test when Cabada was still too close to the engine and unprotected from explosions or flying debris.</p>
<p id="paragraph-78">Senior managers were repeatedly warned for at least a year before the accident that pressure-testing crews were not following standard worker-safety protocols, such as providing protective barriers or clearing personnel from the testing area, according to a former employee&nbsp;familiar with the matter. Such testing should be conducted with a “boom box” covering the whole engine to protect workers, the employee said.&nbsp;At one point, managers rejected a new training program, written and proposed by pressure-testing staff, on the grounds that it would cause delays, according to the source and a document reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-79">Another key contributing factor: SpaceX senior managers, in the months leading up to the accident, had instructed engineers to end or limit the testing of individual rocket parts before they are assembled into an engine, two staffers said. The managers were reacting to Musk’s demands for&nbsp;faster progress on the Raptor engine program, the workers said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-80">The team normally would have conducted more extensive testing on the cover that malfunctioned and struck Cabada, they said.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-82">The limited testing nonetheless revealed a potentially dangerous flaw in the cover, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The component was redesigned to correct the problem, they said, but the new part wasn’t ready before the pressure testing that hurt Cabada. Reuters could not determine the precise nature of the flaw.</p>
<p id="paragraph-83">SpaceX’s rejection of a more rigorous training program, its moves to limit testing, and the discovery of the cover’s defect before the accident haven’t been previously reported.</p> 
<p id="paragraph-89">In a written response to CalOSHA’s inspection, SpaceX said it had conducted ample analysis and testing of the part before it failed.</p>
<p id="paragraph-90">More than a dozen current and former workers said SpaceX’s willingness to cut corners and skip some worker safeguards has helped keep it well ahead of competitors and score lucrative government contracts. SpaceX last year surpassed Boeing to become NASA’s second-largest vendor.</p>
<p id="paragraph-91">The company also boosts development speed through a structure that gives managers high levels of autonomy but raises safety risks, the dozen current and former SpaceX workers said. The company is split into three teams: engineering, manufacturing, and testing. The engineering leadership includes the “responsible engineers” SpaceX designates as accountable for safety in manufacturing.&nbsp;But those engineers have little control of other teams, including the one that stress-tests the engines and parts they develop, according to two staffers with knowledge of the matter.</p>
<p id="paragraph-92">In the case of the test that injured Cabada, this loose structure meant the testing team never coordinated with the responsible engineer team, the workers said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-93">After the Cabada accident, CalOSHA&nbsp;inspectors detailed other safety lapses. One employee involved in the pressure checks told them that the company generally didn’t do full safety inspections before such testing, agency records show. Another said the engine should have undergone more testing “without personnel around,” according to the records.</p>
<p id="paragraph-94">SpaceX pushed back on the agency’s finding&nbsp;that the company failed to protect Cabada, the records show. The company blamed a particular responsible engineer, who it said was accountable for the safety of the defective cover “through the lifecycle of development, testing and production.” SpaceX fired the engineer and a manager on the same team over the incident, according to&nbsp;three employees with knowledge of the situation.</p>

    
<p id="paragraph-96">Cabada’s wife, Ydy,&nbsp;said SpaceX hasn’t responded to the family’s attempts to find out how he was injured. Michael Sanchez, a Los Angeles attorney representing her, said the company has never answered his inquiries, including a March 2022 certified letter requesting a copy of any surveillance footage of the accident and advising SpaceX to preserve any other relevant records. Ydy Cabada has considered a lawsuit but has not filed one.</p>
<p id="paragraph-97">“SpaceX has not returned a single call,” Sanchez said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-98">Francisco’s sister, Evelyn Cabada, said the accident devastated the family.&nbsp;In addition to the severe head injury, she said, her brother caught pneumonia and meningitis in the hospital.</p>
<p id="paragraph-99">Ydy Cabada said the family still holds out hope he’ll emerge from the coma.</p>
<p id="paragraph-100">“The doctors keep saying nothing has changed,” she said. “It’ll take a miracle for him to get out of that bed.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-101">Flamethrowers and safety yellow</p>
<p id="paragraph-102">Musk is well-known as a hands-on manager. He was directly involved in handing down sometimes unrealistic deadlines, said current and former employees. Musk’s heavy involvement in scheduling resulted in “significantly more unsafe working conditions than would have existed otherwise,” said Moline, the engineer.</p>
<p id="paragraph-103">One former SpaceX executive defended Musk, saying he would listen to employees who were willing to go “toe-to-toe” with him on safety issues and took them seriously.</p>
<p id="paragraph-104">Another former executive said Musk cared about his workers and was bothered when they got hurt, but that safety was not one of Musk’s priorities. Musk, the ex-manager said, thought that “workers take care of their safety themselves.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-105">This former executive said that top company officials knew its injury rates ran high but attributed the problem to employing a largely young&nbsp;workforce in a dangerous industry. SpaceX leaders also believed the company shouldn’t be held to the same standard as competitors because SpaceX oversees more missions and manufacturing, the two former executives said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-106">That attitude is a red flag that a company is rationalizing a fundamentally unsafe environment, according to four worker-safety experts interviewed by Reuters, including Barab, the former OSHA deputy assistant secretary.</p>
<p id="paragraph-107">“SpaceX shouldn’t be exempt from protecting workers from being injured or killed,” Barab said, “just because they’re doing innovative work.”</p>

    <figure id="video-flamethrower" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
        
        <figcaption itemprop="caption">A video posted widely online shows Elon Musk playing with a novelty flamethrower produced by his tunneling firm, the Boring Company.</figcaption>
    </figure>
<p id="paragraph-109">Four SpaceX employees told Reuters they were disturbed by Musk’s habit of playing with a flamethrower when he visited the SpaceX site in Hawthorne. The device was marketed to the public&nbsp;in 2018 as a $500 novelty item by Musk’s tunnel-building firm, the Boring Company. Videos posted online show it can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMPR7k9DWlw" id="article-link-4">shoot a thick flame</a> more than five feet long. Boring later renamed the device the “Not-A-Flamethrower” amid reports of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/19/elon-musk-said-it-was-not-a-flamethrower/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACtBIGuSTxh0ThWaD78TfHNKtEyblgoZ5PfRP--M-Ooc3ozDYISB2m87XA0dpV3Djx6gSE_MU4u0bi13SWiEgwqbwT9yPtvjHlUj-7AUAkih3BH7mQHoXh9oeIcUnRvy8X9o4LMI0B_XPuejKcm2Iksv0J8kG68pp_NEy5COwdEB" id="article-link-5">confiscations by authorities</a>.</p>
<p id="paragraph-110">For years, Musk and his deputies found it “hilarious” to wave the flamethrower around, firing it near other people and giggling “like they were in middle school,” one engineer said. Musk tweeted in 2018 that the flamethrower was “guaranteed to liven up any party!” At SpaceX, Musk played with the device in close-quarters office settings, said the engineer, who at one point feared Musk would set someone’s hair&nbsp;on fire.</p>
<p id="paragraph-111">Musk also became known in California and Texas&nbsp;for ordering machinery that was painted in industrial safety yellow to&nbsp;be repainted black or blue because of his aversion to bright colors, according to three former SpaceX supervisors. Managers also sometimes told workers to avoid wearing safety-yellow vests around Musk, or to replace yellow safety tape with red, the supervisors said.</p>
<p id="paragraph-112">Workers often walked too close to engine-testing and rocket-building facilities because the company failed to cordon off areas or put up&nbsp;warning signs, said Paige Holland-Thielen, a former operations and automation&nbsp;engineer in Hawthorne.</p>
<p id="paragraph-113">“One time I walked out the door of my building, and there was a giant crane there,” she recalled. “A bunch of people in hard hats started screaming at me to get back inside.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-114">Holland-Thielen and Moline, who also worked in Hawthorne, were among nine workers fired in the summer of 2022 after raising workplace complaints in an open letter that was ultimately signed by hundreds of employees. The letter criticized Musk’s flippant social-media responses to sexual-harassment allegations against him, which he denied. It also criticized a management culture of dismissing employee concerns and unevenly enforcing discipline policies. Eight workers who drafted the letter have since filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board against SpaceX alleging unfair labor practices.</p>
<p id="paragraph-115">Moline said SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell told him he was being fired for distracting workers from getting to Mars. “Please focus on your job and the mission of SpaceX – to get humanity to Mars as quickly as possible,” Shotwell told him and Holland-Thielen, among others, in an email reviewed by Reuters.</p>
<p id="paragraph-116">Shotwell did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p id="paragraph-117">A death and a $7,000 fine</p>
<p id="paragraph-118">SpaceX has faced few consequences from safety regulators for its failure to report annual safety data and to protect workers in incidents reviewed by federal and state inspectors, agency records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-119">OSHA and CalOSHA&nbsp;have fined the billionaire’s rocket company a total of&nbsp;$50,836&nbsp;for violations stemming from one worker’s death and seven serious safety incidents, regulatory records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-120">OSHA did not comment on the modest penalties that resulted from inspections of SpaceX.</p>
<p id="paragraph-121">SpaceX’s history of injuries and regulatory run-ins in California underscores the limits of worker-safety regulation. Fines are capped by law and pose little deterrent for major companies,&nbsp;experts in U.S. worker safety regulation said. Federal and state regulators also suffer from chronic understaffing of inspectors, they said. OSHA did not address questions about staffing levels but said it “focuses its resources on hazardous workplaces.”</p>
<p id="paragraph-122">CalOSHA levied a fine of $18,475 for the violation that resulted in Cabada’s skull fracture. SpaceX unsuccessfully disputed the agency’s classification of the violation as “serious” and appealed the penalty as excessive, asking for a reduction to $475.</p>
<p id="paragraph-123">In another case, CalOSHA never inspected the company following a serious accident resulting in a leg amputation. But the agency may not have known the accident happened at all: A Reuters review of agency documents indicated it had no record of the 2016 incident.</p>
<p id="paragraph-124">Federal and state law require companies to immediately report all employee deaths, amputations and injuries resulting in hospital admissions.&nbsp;It isn’t clear whether SpaceX ever reported the injury. Neither the company nor CalOSHA commented on why the agency had no report on it.</p>
<p id="paragraph-125">If SpaceX didn’t report the case, “I don’t think they have any excuse,” said Ann Rosenthal, a former OSHA associate solicitor, who handled legal matters for the agency until 2018.</p>
<p id="paragraph-126">The incident resulted in Steven Trollinger’s leg being crushed during a mission to recover a rocket that landed in the Pacific Ocean, according to records in a lawsuit Trollinger filed. The accident occurred when he and other SpaceX employees were being transferred between two vessels. SpaceX knew that one of the vessels wasn’t properly equipped with a transfer platform designed to ensure the workers’ safety, but proceeded anyway, Trollinger’s lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p id="paragraph-127">Trollinger, who declined to comment, settled with SpaceX for an undisclosed sum, court records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-128">In inspections following two other serious California injuries – the amputation of two fingers in 2017 and a serious knee injury in 2021 – CalOSHA levied fines of $750 and $5,060, respectively. When a worker’s finger was amputated this March, inspectors took no action and did not visit the site, records show.</p>
<p id="paragraph-129">After Texas worker Lonnie LeBlanc&nbsp;fell off a trailer and died in 2014, OSHA came to what it called an informal settlement with the company after inspectors found the safety lapses, OSHA records show. The settlement allowed SpaceX to pay a $7,000 fine.</p>
<p id="paragraph-130">LeBlanc’s brother, Chris Weimer, and an uncle, Ron Weimer, said the family didn’t know that OSHA had investigated the death and found violations until Reuters told them.</p>
<p id="paragraph-131">Ron Weimer said the hazardous nature of rocket-building is no excuse for his nephew’s death.</p>
<p id="paragraph-132">“There’s a way to do dangerous work,” he said, “without people dying.”</p>

      <p>Das neue Outlook ist nicht, was es auf den ersten Blick scheint: ein Ersatz für das Outlook von Microsoft Office – jedenfalls noch nicht. Was es aber auf jeden Fall ist: entschieden zu neugierig.</p>

<p>Microsoft lobt das neue Outlook in höchsten Tönen und will Nutzerinnen und Nutzer zum Umstieg bewegen. Doch Achtung: Wer das neue Outlook ausprobiert, riskiert die Übertragung seiner IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten zu Mailkonten sowie sämtlicher Mails an Microsoft-Server. Zwar erklärt Microsoft, der Wechsel zurück auf die bisherigen Apps sei jederzeit möglich – die Daten liegen dann aber schon beim Unternehmen. Microsoft kann dadurch die Mails mitlesen.</p>

<p>Im Windows-Startmenü von <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Jetzt-da-Windows-11-2023-Update-fuer-alle-oder-auch-nicht-9350212.html">Windows-11-Geräten mit 2023-Update</a> taucht inzwischen das neue Outlook als empfohlene App auf. Auch der Outlook-Client selbst bietet den Test der neuen Outlook-Version mit einem Schalter "Das neue Outlook" an. Die befindet sich noch in der Entwicklung, soll aber 2024 in Windows etwa das Mail-Programm und den mitgelieferten Kalender in Windows ersetzen. In einem <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/things-to-look-forward-to-in-the-new-outlook-for-windows/ba-p/3975602" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">aktuellen Techcommunity-Beitrag erklärt die Microsoft</a>-Angestellte Caitlin Hart zudem, dass auch das klassische Outlook damit ersetzt werden soll. Anders als bei den Windows-Apps Mail und Kalender steht der Zeitplan dafür jedoch noch nicht.</p>




<h3 id="nav_neues_outlook__0">Neues Outlook: Warnung vor Datenübertragungen</h3>
<p>Beim Hinzufügen eines Mail-Kontos im neuen Outlook, das nicht von Microsoft gehostet wird, sondern etwa auf Firmen-Mail-Servern liegt, zeigt das Programm einen Hinweis. Er <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/de-de/office/synchronisieren-ihres-kontos-in-outlook-mit-der-microsoft-cloud-985f9e19-d308-4e85-9d1d-0c6f32f8e981?ui=de-de&amp;rs=de-de&amp;ad=de" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">verlinkt auf einen Support-Artikel</a>, der lediglich ausformuliert, dass Nicht-Microsoft-Konten mit der Microsoft-Cloud synchronisiert werden, wobei bislang Gmail-, Yahoo-, iCloud- und IMAP-Konten unterstützt werden. Das macht das neue Outlook auch in den Fassungen für Android, iOS und Mac. Das bedeutet demnach, dass Kopien der "E-Mails, Kalender und Kontakte zwischen Ihrem E-Mail-Anbieter und Microsoft-Rechenzentren synchronisiert" werden. Damit erhält das Unternehmen vollen Zugriff auf alle Mails und kann diese lesen und auswerten. Damit wolle Microsoft Funktionen bereitstellen, die Gmail und IMAP nicht bieten würden.</p>

<p>Der Hinweis macht stutzig: Was überträgt Microsoft dadurch wohin? Beim Anlegen eines IMAP-Kontos konnte die c't mitschneiden, dass Ziel-Server, Log-in-Name und Passwort an Microsofts Server übertragen werden. Zwar TLS-geschützt, aber im Tunnel laufen die Daten im Klartext zu Microsoft. Ohne darüber zu informieren oder nachzufragen, genehmigt sich Microsoft selbst Vollzugriff auf die IMAP- und SMTP-Zugangsdaten von Nutzern des neuen Outlooks.</p>

<h3 id="nav_andere_zugänge_1">Andere Zugänge</h3>
<p>Bei dem Schwenk vom alten Outlook auf das neue wird es parallel dazu installiert. Bislang eingerichtete IMAP-Konten werden nicht übernommen, aber das in Windows hinterlegte Konto schon. Bei der Prüfung mit Google-Konten kam die Authentifizierung mit OAuth2 zum Zuge. Dabei erhalten Nutzerinnen und Nutzer eine Authentifizierungsrückfrage und es landen immerhin keine konkreten Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft, sondern ein Zugriffstoken, den Nutzer auch wieder zurückziehen können.</p>
<p>Die Antwort auf unsere Anfrage zu einer Stellungnahme von Microsoft steht noch aus. Zum jetzigen Zeitpunkt müssen wir jedoch davor warnen, unbedacht das neue Outlook auszuprobieren. Neben den ganzen Mails landen dadurch teils sogar Zugangsdaten bei Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft fiel bereits <a href="https://www.heise.de/news/Microsoft-IMAP-Umleitung-in-Outlook-nach-Office-Update-jetzt-auch-auf-Macs-7477743.html">Anfang des Jahres mit solchen dreisten Datenumleitungen auf.</a> Nach Office-Updates auf Mac-Rechnern leitete das Outlook dort die Daten ohne etwaige Rückfragen auf Microsofts Cloud-Server um. Damals schaffte Abhilfe, IMAP-Konten zu löschen und neu einzurichten. Das ist mit dem neuen Outlook derzeit offensichtlich jedoch nicht mehr hilfreich.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><time datetime="2023-11-10T09:03:20.562804Z">November 10, 2023</time> <a href="https://mullvad.net/en/blog/tag/system-transparency">System Transparency</a>&nbsp;</p>  <p>We recently <a href="https://mullvad.net/blog/2023/9/20/we-have-successfully-completed-our-migration-to-ram-only-vpn-infrastructure/">announced the completion</a> of our migration to remove all traces of disks in use on our VPN infrastructure.</p>

<p>Today we can announce more steps forward - our Encrypted DNS service has also been converted to run from RAM!</p>

<h2>Encrypted DNS for all - paying customers or not</h2>

<p>Encrypted DNS (also known as DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS) protects your DNS queries from being snooped on by third parties when <strong>not</strong> connected to our VPN service. DNS queries are encrypted between your device and our DNS servers.</p>

<p>Primarily as a service to be used when not connected to our VPN servers, this service is completely cost-free, and available to anyone that wishes to have a trustworthy, audited Encrypted DNS service with <a href="http://github.com/mullvad/dns-blocklists">optional content blocking</a>. This service is available from servers located worldwide, and can be configured by using the <a href="https://mullvad.net/help/dns-over-https-and-dns-over-tls/">following guide</a> on our website.</p>

<p>This service can be used in conjunction with our VPN service, but is discouraged, as it will always be slower than using the DNS resolver on the VPN server that you are connected to.</p>

<p>All of these Encrypted DNS servers are configured using the same Linux kernel, with the same level of security and privacy as the as our VPN infrastructure. This is the next step towards running our stateless infrastructure from RAM.</p><!-- HTML_TAG_END --></div></div>]]></description>
