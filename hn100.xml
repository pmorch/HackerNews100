<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you know migratory birds and sea turtles are able to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field? It's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoreception" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetoreception</a>.

</ul>
<p>It would seem evolution <em>adores</em> detecting magnetic fields. And it makes sense! A literal "sense of direction" is quite useful in staying alive - nearly all life benefits from it, including us.</p>
<p>We don't totally understand how our magnetoreception works yet, but we know that it does. In 2019, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6494972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some Caltech researchers</a> put some people in a room shielded from the Earth's magnetic field, with a big magnetic field generator in it. They hooked them up to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EEG</a>, and watched what happened in their brains as they manipulated the magnetic field. The result: some of those people showed a response to the magnetic fields on the EEG!</p>
<p>That gets my noggin joggin. Our brain responds to magnetic field changes, but we aren't aware of it? What if it affects our mood? Would you believe me if I told you <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-022-01913-4.epdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lunar gravity influences the Earth's magnetosphere</a>? Perhaps I was too dismissive of astrology.</p>
<h3>But seriously</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biomagnetism" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biomagnetism</a> is "the phenomenon of magnetic fields produced by living organisms". Hold up. Produced by? I made another list for you:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, <em>right</em>. We run on electricity, so we generate magnetic fields. Makes sense. But wait. We can detect magnetic fields AND we produce them? That's...hmm. Interesting. Let's read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoencephalography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetoencephalography</a> (insane word).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not the interesting thing about MEG. The interesting thing about MEG is that researchers at Meta, using MEG, were able to decode the brains magnetic fields into actual <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/brain-ai-image-decoding-meg-magnetoencephalography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">images</a> and <a href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/ai-speech-brain-activity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words</a>. Who else forgot we successfully read people's minds in 2023? I know I did.</p>
<p>Here's how it worked: they trained models <em>on public MEG datasets</em>, and then used those models to decode the thoughts of study participants.</p>
<p>In their words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall, our results show that MEG can be used to decipher, with millisecond precision, the rise of complex representations generated in the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this back when it happened, but then I read it again the other day and it struck me that it's actually an insane line of research. Like, we can train a model to understand the information that underlies <em>human brain waves</em>. They were able to translate brain activity, from the magnetic field alone, into images and text.</p>
<p>So our brain's magnetic field is like a constant (with millisecond precision) readout of the current state of our brain? That's...HUH?</p>
<p>So, okay. Research has established that humans can sense magnetic fields, and Meta was able to show that our own brain's magnetic field represents a high-enough-fidelity-to-read-data analog representation of our current "state" of mind. To such an extent that we've been able to decode it across many different brains, despite barely understanding it.</p>
<p>So, couldn't our own brain be reading it's own field? I mean, what are the chances evolution <em>wouldn't</em> take advantage of an available wireless summary of the global state of the brain? Wouldn't that answer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the binding problem</a>?</p>
<h2>They're minerals, Marie!</h2>
<p>The question becomes <em>how does the brain read the field</em>? Well, let's go back to <em>magnetoreception</em> for a minute. How does that work again?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Magnetite biomineralization is a genetically-controlled biochemical process through which organisms make perfect ferrimagnetic crystals, usually of single magnetic domain size. This process is an ancient one, having evolved about 2 billion years ago in the magnetotactic bacteria, and presumably was incorporated in the genome of higher organisms, including humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our brains <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996APS..MAR.M2002K/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>manufacture ferrimagnetic crystals</em></a>. Table stakes. Established science.</p>
<p>But let's not get too excited. The Earth's magnetic field is quite strong. In fact it's 50 to 500 MILLION times stronger than the brain's magnetic field. So these magnets could detect the Earth's magnetic field for sure, but could they detect the brain's own much weaker fields?</p>
<p>I'm here to tell you: hell yeah they could. Those ferrimagnetic crystals created by our brains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-07988-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tend to be in a tight size range that could resonate with <em>and potentially modulate</em> the specific spectrum of known neural oscillations</a> (A.K.A. brain waves). This "stochastic resonance", which is mathematically possible in the brain, would allow for these tiny crystals to <em>locally overcome the Earth's magnetic field</em>.</p>
<p>So now we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain's magnetic field can be read to extract the actual high-fidelity thoughts a person is having</li>
<li>The brain creates magnetic crystals that just so happen to be the perfect size to interact with it's own magnetic field</li>
</ul>
<p>Feels like we're getting somewhere. Let's pull the thread.</p>
<h2>Everything is computer</h2>
<p>If those crystals can <em>read</em> the brain's magnetic field, they can also certainly <em>write</em> to it. The brain's hardwiring/neurochemistry could manipulate the crystals much more easily than the magnetic field could.</p>
<p>So, using those biological magnets, could the brain...self-tune itself?</p>
<p>Let me zoom out. Here's how I'm thinking about it: the magnetic field seems to represent a current "state" of your thoughts. Nature loves analog systems. What if the brain used it's own magnetic field as a sort of analog compression of all of the underlying information? It definitionally represents the the sum total of all of the electrical activity in the neurons in the brain. It's as low-latency as it gets, limited only by the speed of light. We know our thoughts are encoded within it. Why not?</p>
<p>Let's imagine how this might work. We have this global state vehicle, we can read it with magnetic crystals, but how do we complete the loop? There would need to be some global write system, right?</p>
<h3>The blue spot</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_coeruleus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locus coeruleus (LC)</a> (latin for "blue spot") is a tiny but obscenely important little part of our brain. It synthesizes "norepinephrine, which is a chemical that changes how alert, focused, and "plastic" (malleable) your brain is. I'll quote the Wiki:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The projections of this nucleus reach far and wide. For example, they innervate the spinal cord, the brain stem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, the hippocampus, the thalamic relay nuclei, the amygdala, the basal telencephalon, and the cortex. The norepinephrine from the LC has an excitatory effect on most of the brain, mediating arousal and priming the brain's neurons to be activated by stimuli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The page continues to list all of the functions the LC-NA system is known to influence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arousal and sleep-wake cycle</li>
<li>Attention and memory</li>
<li>Behavioral and cognitive flexibility, creativity, personality, behavioral inhibition, and stress</li>
<li>Cognitive control</li>
<li>Decision making and utility maximization</li>
<li>Emotions</li>
<li>Neuroplasticity</li>
<li>Posture and balance</li>
<li>Global model failure where predictions about the world are strongly violated</li>
</ul>
<p>That sure sounds like a global write system.</p>
<p>Did I mention it's located at the center of the brain?</p>
<h3>Compacting...</h3>
<p>Let's summarize again.</p>
<ul>
<li>The brain's magnetic field can be read to extract the actual high-fidelity thoughts a person is having</li>
<li>The brain creates magnetic crystals that just so happen to be the perfect size to interact with it's own magnetic field</li>
<li>The brain has a single system that can, in response to stimuli, release a chemical that changes how the rest of the brain responds to stimuli</li>
</ul>
<p>So let's make this a causal loop.</p>
<ol>
<li>The brain creates a structured magnetic field pattern</li>
<li>Magnetic crystals, in reaction to that pattern, trigger neurons to send signals (some to the LC-NA system)</li>
<li>Based on the data the LC receives (danger, reward, big decision), it fires a burst of norepinephrine</li>
<li>That norephinephrine globally changes brain neurochemistry, which changes how magnetic crystals react to the magnetic field</li>
</ol>
<p>The brain could then use that process to heavily optimize itself <em>locally</em> based on <em>global</em> state.</p>
<h2>The easier-than-expected problem of consciousness</h2>
<p>So hold on, if the "brain computer" uses a lossy summary of <em>all neuron activity</em> to make decisions, doesn't that kind of sound familiar? Isn't a "lossy summary of all neuron activity" kind of equivalent to...what it feels like to be conscious?</p>
<p>Like, basically the brain is a computer, but imagine it has to compress all of this data into one dimension. "Feeling like" something is a compression artifact - it's a lossy representation of all of the underlying data. So, we're computers, but it feels like this to be a computer because of the way the data is compressed.</p>
<p>"What it feels like" to be conscious is the inevitable end result of...extremely optimized data compression. Incredible. Evolution is an unmatched engineer.</p>
<h2>Air pollution may be more serious than we realize</h2>
<p>The magnetic crystals created by our brains are not the only ones we've found in there. Among the perfectly shaped and sized biogenic crystals are <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1605941113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pollution-derived magnetic particles</a> of many shapes and sizes that are prolific in urban, airborne particulate matter. We breathe this in through the nose, and it enters the brain directly through the olfactory nerve.</p>
<p>Now, remember how the natural magnetic crystals are a very specific size and shape that allows them to resonate with the brain's magnetic field and ultimately overcome the Earth's magnetic field. Above a certain volume, pollution-derived particles would significantly change the math in that system, and could very easily impact the ability for the brain's magnetic field to interact with it's own natural magnetic crystals.</p>
<p>So, there should be evidence of a system breakdown among people who breathe enough sufficiently polluted air. We would see a breakdown of ability to learn - significant issues with memory. It would build up over time and it's progression would be slow at first. The locus coeruleus in particular would become less active as the brain lost the ability to send signals to "self-tune" itself.</p>
<p>Air pollution has been <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/industrial-air-pollution-leaves-magnetic-waste-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">significantly correlated with Alzheimer's disease</a>. They've even recently demonstrated <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412024000989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">evidence of causation</a>.</p>
<p>And critically, where have we (inexplicably thus far) seen some of the earliest signs of Alzheimer's pathology?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8900465/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">locus coeruleus</a>.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>If you found this interesting, I put together a <a href="https://cdn.1393.xyz/research/The_Pilot-Autopilot_Theory_of_the_Brain.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whitepaper</a> with a lot more digging on the Alzheimer's theory.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fil-c.org/seccomp">https://fil-c.org/seccomp</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46259064">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <main>


<p>Memory safety and sandboxing are two different things. It's reasonable to think of them as orthogonal: you could have memory safety but not be sandboxed, or you could be sandboxed but not memory safe.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Example of <strong>memory safe</strong> <em>but not</em> <strong>sandboxed</strong>: a pure Java program that opens files on the filesystem for reading and writing and accepts filenames from the user. The OS will allow this program to overwrite any file that the user has access to. This program can be quite dangerous even if it is memory safe. Worse, imagine that the program didn't have any code to open files for reading and writing, but also had no sandbox to prevent those syscalls from working. If there was a bug in the memory safety enforcement of this program (say, because of a bug in the Java implementation), then an attacker could cause this program to overwrite any file if they succeeded at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_machine">achieving code execution via weird state</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Example of <strong>sandboxed</strong> <em>but not</em> <strong>memory safe</strong>: a program written in assembly that starts by requesting that the OS revoke all of its capabilities beyond just pure compute. If the program did want to open a file or write to it, then the kernel will kill the process, based on the earlier request to have this capability revoked. This program could have lots of memory safety bugs (because it's written in assembly), but even if it did, then the attacker cannot make this program overwrite any file unless they find some way to bypass the sandbox.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, sandboxes have holes by design. A typical sandbox allows the program to send and receive messages to broker processes that have higher privileges. So, an attacker may first use a memory safety bug to make the sandboxed process send malicious messages, and then use those malicious messages to break into the brokers.</p>

<p><strong>The best kind of defense is to have both a sandbox and memory safety.</strong> This document describes how to combine sandboxing and Fil-C's memory safety by explaining what it takes to port OpenSSH's seccomp-based Linux sandbox code to Fil-C.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p><a href="https://fil-c.org/how.html">Fil-C is a memory safe implementation of C and C++</a> and this site <a href="https://fil-c.org/documentation.html">has a lot of documentation about it</a>. Unlike most memory safe languages, Fil-C enforces safety down to where your code meets Linux syscalls and the <a href="https://fil-c.org/runtime.html">Fil-C runtime</a> is robust enough that it's possible to use it in <a href="https://fil-c.org/pizlix.html">low-level system components like <code>init</code> and <code>udevd</code></a>. <a href="https://fil-c.org/programs_that_work.html">Lots of programs work in Fil-C</a>, including OpenSSH, which makes use of seccomp-BPF sandboxing.</p>

<p>This document focuses on how OpenSSH uses seccomp and other technologies on Linux to build a sandbox around its <a href="http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html">unprivileged <code>sshd-session</code> process</a>. Let's review what tools Linux gives us that OpenSSH uses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>chroot</code> to restrict the process's view of the filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Running the process with the <code>sshd</code> user and group, and giving that user/group no privileges.</p></li>
<li><p><code>setrlimit</code> to prevent opening files, starting processes, or writing to files.</p></li>
<li><p>seccomp-BPF syscall filter to reduce the attack surface by allowlisting only the set of syscalls that are legitimate for the unprivileged process. Syscalls not in the allowlist will crash the process with <code>SIGSYS</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0e94f26e8/docs/linux_sandboxing.md">The Chromium developers</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Sandbox/Seccomp">the Mozilla developers</a> both have excellent notes about how to do sandboxing on Linux using seccomp. <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.19/userspace-api/seccomp_filter.html">Seccomp-BPF is a well-documented kernel feature</a> that can be used as part of a larger sandboxing story.</p>

<p>Fil-C makes it easy to use <code>chroot</code> and different users and groups. The syscalls that are used for that part of the sandbox are trivially allowed by Fil-C and no special care is required to use them.</p>

<p>Both <code>setrlimit</code> and seccomp-BPF require special care because the Fil-C runtime starts threads, allocates memory, and performs synchronization. This document describes what you need to know to make effective use of those sandboxing technologies in Fil-C. First, I describe how to build a sandbox that prevents thread creation without breaking Fil-C's use of threads. Then, I describe what tweaks I had to make to OpenSSH's seccomp filter. Finally, I describe how the Fil-C runtime implements the syscalls used to install seccomp filters.</p>

<h2>Preventing Thread Creation Without Breaking The Fil-C Runtime</h2>

<p>The Fil-C runtime uses <a href="https://fil-c.org/fugc.html">multiple background threads for garbage collection</a> and has the ability to automatically shut those threads down when they are not in use. If the program wakes up and starts allocating memory again, then those threads are automatically restarted.</p>

<p>Starting threads violates the "no new processes" rule that OpenSSH's <code>setrlimit</code> sandbox tries to achieve (since threads are just lightweight processes on Linux). It also relies on syscalls like <code>clone3</code> that are not part of OpenSSH's seccomp filter allowlist.</p>

<p>It would be a regression to the sandbox to allow process creation just because the Fil-C runtime relies on it. Instead, I added a new API to <a href="https://fil-c.org/stdfil.html"><code>&lt;stdfil.h&gt;</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>void zlock_runtime_threads(void);
</code></pre>

<p>This forces the runtime to immediately create whatever threads it needs, and to disable shutting them down on demand. Then, I added a call to <code>zlock_runtime_threads()</code> in OpenSSH's <code>ssh_sandbox_child</code> function before either the <code>setrlimit</code> or seccomp-BPF sandbox calls happen.</p>

<h2>Tweaks To The OpenSSH Sandbox</h2>

<p>Because the use of <code>zlock_runtime_threads()</code> prevents subsequent thread creation from happening, most of the OpenSSH sandbox just works. I did not have to change how OpenSSH uses <code>setrlimit</code>. I did change the following about the seccomp filter:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Failure results in <code>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS</code> rather than <code>SECCOMP_RET_KILL</code>. This ensures that Fil-C's background threads are also killed if a sandbox violation occurs.</p></li>
<li><p><code>MAP_NORESERVE</code> is added to the <code>mmap</code> allowlist, since the Fil-C allocator uses it. This is not a meaningful regression to the filter, since <code>MAP_NORESERVE</code> is not a meaningful capability for an attacker to have.</p></li>
<li><p><code>sched_yield</code> is allowed. This is not a dangerous syscall (it's semantically a no-op). The Fil-C runtime uses it as part of its lock implementation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing else had to change, since the filter already allowed all of the <code>futex</code> syscalls that Fil-C uses for synchronization.</p>

<h2>How Fil-C Implements <code>prctl</code></h2>

<p>The OpenSSH seccomp filter is installed using two <code>prctl</code> calls. First, we <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0) == -1) {
        debug("%s: prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS): %s",
            __func__, strerror(errno));
        nnp_failed = 1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This prevents additional privileges from being acquired via <code>execve</code>. It's required that unprivileged processes that install seccomp filters first set the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit.</p>

<p>Next, we <code>PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if (prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &amp;preauth_program) == -1)
        debug("%s: prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP): %s",
            __func__, strerror(errno));
else if (nnp_failed)
        fatal("%s: SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER activated but "
            "PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS failed", __func__);
</code></pre>

<p>This installs the seccomp filter in <code>preauth_program</code>. Note that this will fail in the kernel if the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit is not set, so the fact that OpenSSH reports a fatal error if the filter is installed without <code>no_new_privs</code> is just healthy paranoia on the part of the OpenSSH authors.</p>

<p>The trouble with both syscalls is that they affect the calling <em>thread</em>, not all threads in the process. Without special care, Fil-C runtime's background threads would not have the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit set and would not have the filter installed. This would mean that if an attacker busted through Fil-C's memory safety protections (in the unlikely event that they found a bug in Fil-C itself!), then they could use those other threads to execute syscalls that bypass the filter!</p>

<p>To prevent even this unlikely escape, the Fil-C runtime's wrapper for <code>prctl</code> implements <code>PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS</code> and <code>PR_SET_SECCOMP</code> by <em>handshaking</em> all runtime threads using this internal API:</p>

<pre><code>/* Calls the callback from every runtime thread. */
PAS_API void filc_runtime_threads_handshake(void (*callback)(void* arg), void* arg);
</code></pre>

<p>The callback performs the requested <code>prctl</code> from each runtime thread. This ensures that the <code>no_new_privs</code> bit and the filter are installed on all threads in the Fil-C process.</p>

<p>Additionally, because of ambiguity about what to do if the process has multiple user threads, these two <code>prctl</code> commands will trigger a Fil-C safety error if the program has multiple user threads.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The best kind of protection if you're serious about security is to combine memory safety with sandboxing. This document shows how to achieve this using Fil-C and the sandbox technologies available on Linux, all without regressing the level of protection that those sandboxes enforce or the memory safety guarantees of Fil-C.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                                <p>A former Dyson engineer is rolling out a revolution for household chores in deprived communities after inventing an off-grid, flat-packable washing machine</p>
                
                                
    		    <div>
        <p><span>Some five billion people in remote and developing regions still wash their clothes by hand. It’s a task that unfairly burdens women and young girls, who can spend up to 20 hours a week on the chore.</span></p>
<p><span>Enter Navjot Sawhney, who founded the UK-based social enterprise </span><a href="https://www.thewashingmachineproject.org/"><span>The Washing Machine Project</span></a><span> (TWMP) to tackle this, and has now shipped almost 500 of his hand-crank Divya machines to 13 countries, including Mexico, Ghana, Iraq and the US.</span></p>
<p><span>The Divya washing machine, made up of an outer drum and an inner one which rotates, operates a 30-minute wash cycle where it completes a 5kg load needing only a few minutes of manual turning. </span></p>

    </div>



                    
    		    <p><a href="https://www.positive.news/product/christmas-gift-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.positive.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PN_Xmas2025_STANDARD_WEB_03-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="850" srcset="https://www.positive.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PN_Xmas2025_STANDARD_WEB_03-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.positive.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PN_Xmas2025_STANDARD_WEB_03-1-300x255.jpg 300w, https://www.positive.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PN_Xmas2025_STANDARD_WEB_03-1-768x653.jpg 768w, https://www.positive.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PN_Xmas2025_STANDARD_WEB_03-1-500x425.jpg 500w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></a></p>



                    
    		    <div>
        <p><span>It works </span><span>like this</span><span>: after loading the clothes, detergent and water, and letting it sit for 10-15 minutes, users can close the lid and turn the handle for two minutes, repeating this twice more after ten minutes of letting the clothes sit in between spins. And voila — the machine can then be drained using the tap at the front.</span></p>
<p><span>This saves up to 75% of time for its user, and halves water consumption. “The machine takes a task that is exhausting and time-consuming and transforms it into something simple, easier to manage, and time saving,” said Sawhney.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Divya project’s development didn’t end with its invention. “We went back to the drawing board and really listened to the people we were designing for, for the context in which they lived. That research changed everything,” said Laura Tuck, the organisation’s R&amp;D Lead.</span></p>

    </div>



                    
    		

                    
    		    <div>
        <p><span>One crucial consideration was making sure Divyas were fit for the locations where they would be used. For example, in Uganda, machines were delivered to a small island on Lake Victoria using a fishing boat. Repairs or replacements could not get there easily, so the TWMP team needed to rethink how the originally complex gear-system machine could work in these conditions. The solution? Designing a product that was simpler, more intuitive, and repairable locally using the skills and infrastructure available.</span></p>
<p><span>Guided by feedback from real users during workshops and focus groups, TWMP improved the machine’s durability, physical strain, and usability, with the team introducing robust metal frames, simplified workflows, and improved seals and taps.</span></p>
<p><span>The innovation has already impacted the lives of almost 50,000 people – and Sawhney is just getting started.</span></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>
🥐 At least 2 days ago
</p>
<p>
Loved reading through <em>GReg TeChnoLogY</em> <a href="https://bourdain.greg.technology/" title="">Anthony Bourdain’s Lost Li.st’s</a> and seeing the list of lost Anthony Bourdain li.st’s made me think on whether at least <strong>some</strong> of them we can recover.
</p>
<p>
Having worked in security and crawling space for majority of my career—I don’t have the access nor permission to use the proprietary storages—I thought we might be able to find something from publicly available crawl archives.
</p>

<h2 id="common-crawl">Common Crawl</h2>
<p>
If <em>Internet Archive</em> had the partial list that Greg published, what about the <em>Common Crawl</em>? Reading through their <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/get-started" title="">documentation</a>, it seems straightforward enough to get prefix index for Tony’s lists and grep for any sub-paths.
</p>
<p>
Putting something up with help of Claude to prove my theory, we have <code>commoncrawl_search.py</code> that makes a single index request to a specific dataset and if any hits discovered, retrieve them from the public s3 bucket—since they are small straight-up HTML documents, seems even more feasible than I had initially thought.
</p>
<p>
Simply have a python version around 3.14.2 and install the dependencies from <code>requirements.txt</code>. Run the below and we are in business. Now, below, you’ll find the command I ran and then some manual archeological effort to prettify the findings.
</p></div><div>

<div>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>Images <strong>have been lost</strong>. Other avenues had struck no luck. I’ll try again later.</p>
</div>
<p>
Any and all emphasis, missing punctuation, cool grammar is all by Anthony Bourdain. The only modifications I have made is to the layout, to represent <code>li.st</code> as closely as possible with <strong>no changes to the content.</strong>
</p>
<div>
<p>NOTE</p>
<p>If you see these blocks, that’s me commenting if pictures have been lost.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="recovering-what-we-lost">Recovering what we lost</h2>
<p>
From Greg’s page, let’s go and try each entry one by one, I’ll put the table of what I wasn’t able to find in <strong>Common Crawl</strong>, but I would assume exists elsewhere—I’d be happy to take another look. And no, none of this above has been written by AI, only the code since I don’t really care about <code>warcio</code> encoding or writing the same python requests method for the Nth time. Enjoy!

<h2 id="objects-of-desire">Objects of Desire</h2>

<p>
material things I feel a strange, possibly unnatural attraction to and will buy (if I can) if I stumble across them in my travels. I am not a paid spokesperson for any of this stuff .
</p>
<div>
<ol>

<li>
<p>
Vintage Persol sunglasses : This is pretty obvious. I wear them a lot. I collect them when I can. Even my production team have taken to wearing them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
19th century trepanning instruments: I don’t know what explains my fascination with these devices, designed to drill drain-sized holes into the skull often for purposes of relieving "pressure" or "bad humours". But I can’t get enough of them. Tip: don’t get a prolonged headache around me and ask if I have anything for it. I do.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Montagnard bracelets: I only have one of these but the few that find their way onto the market have so much history. Often given to the indigenous mountain people ’s Special Forces advisors during the very early days of America’s involvement in Vietnam .
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Jiu Jitsi Gi’s: Yeah. When it comes to high end BJJ wear, I am a total whore. You know those people who collect limited edition Nikes ? I’m like that but with Shoyoroll . In my defense, I don’t keep them in plastic bags in a display case. I wear that shit.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Voiture: You know those old school, silver plated (or solid silver) blimp like carts they roll out into the dining room to carve and serve your roast? No. Probably not. So few places do that anymore. House of Prime Rib does it. Danny Bowein does it at Mission Chinese. I don’t have one of these. And I likely never will. But I can dream.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Kramer knives: I don’t own one. I can’t afford one . And I’d likely have to wait for years even if I could afford one. There’s a long waiting list for these individually hand crafted beauties. But I want one. Badly. http://www.kramerknives.com/gallery/
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
R. CRUMB : All of it. The collected works. These Taschen volumes to start. I wanted to draw brilliant, beautiful, filthy comix like Crumb until I was 13 or 14 and it became clear that I just didn’t have that kind of talent. As a responsible father of an 8 year old girl, I just can’t have this stuff in the house. Too dark, hateful, twisted. Sigh...
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS : THE UNCUT, ORIGINAL ORSON WELLES VERSION: It doesn’t exist. Which is why I want it. The Holy Grail for film nerds, Welles’ follow up to CITIZEN KANE shoulda, coulda been an even greater masterpiece . But the studio butchered it and re-shot a bullshit ending. I want the original. I also want a magical pony.

<h2 id="four-spy-novels-by-real-spies-and-one-not-by-a-spy">Four Spy Novels by Real Spies and One Not by a Spy</h2>

<p>
I like good spy novels. I prefer them to be realistic . I prefer them to be written by real spies. If the main character carries a gun, I’m already losing interest. Spy novels should be about betrayal.
</p>
<div>
<ol>

<li>
<p>
Ashenden–Somerset Maugham<br>Somerset wrote this bleak, darkly funny, deeply cynical novel in the early part of the 20th century. It was apparently close enough to the reality of his espionage career that MI6 insisted on major excisions. Remarkably ahead of its time in its atmosphere of futility and betrayal.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Man Who Lost the War–WT Tyler<br>WT Tyler is a pseudonym for a former "foreign service" officer who could really really write. This one takes place in post-war Berlin and elsewhere and was, in my opinion, wildly under appreciated. See also his Ants of God.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Human Factor–Graham Greene<br>Was Greene thinking of his old colleague Kim Philby when he wrote this? Maybe. Probably. See also Our Man In Havana.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The Tears of Autumn -Charles McCarry<br>A clever take on the JFK assassination with a Vietnamese angle. See also The Miernik Dossier and The Last Supper
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Agents of Innocence–David Ignatius<br>Ignatius is a journalist not a spook, but this one, set in Beirut, hewed all too closely to still not officially acknowledged events. Great stuff.

<h2 id="hotel-slut--that-s-me">Hotel Slut (That’s Me)</h2>

<p>
I wake up in a lot of hotels, so I am fiercely loyal to the ones I love. A hotel where I know immediately wher I am when I open my eyes in the morning is a rare joy. Here are some of my favorites
</p>
<div>
<ol>

<li>
<p>
CHATEAU MARMONT ( LA) : if I have to die in a hotel room, let it be here. I will work in LA just to stay at the Chateau.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
CHILTERN FIREHOUSE (London): Same owner as the Chateau. An amazing Victorian firehouse turned hotel. Pretty much perfection
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
THE RALEIGH (Miami): The pool. The pool!
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
LE CONTINENTAL (Saigon): For the history.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
HOTEL OLOFSSON (Port au Prince): Sagging, creaky and leaky but awesome .
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
PARK HYATT (Tokyo): Because I’m a film geek.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
EDGEWATER INN (Seattle): kind of a lumber theme going on...ships slide right by your window. And the Led Zep "Mudshark incident".
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
THE METROPOLE (Hanoi): there’s a theme developing: if Graham Greene stayed at a hotel, chances are I will too.
</p>
</li>

<p>
RANDOM STREET FAIRS: (Anywhere tube socks and stale spices are sold. ) New York street fairs suck. The same dreary vendors, same bad food. But those nasty sausage and pepper hero sandwiches are a siren song, luring me, always towards the rocks. Shitting like a mink almost immediately after is guaranteed but who cares?

        <h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar</a></h2>
<p>Microservices is a service-oriented software architecture in which server-side applications are constructed by combining many single-purpose, low-footprint network services. The touted benefits are improved modularity, reduced testing burden, better functional composition, environmental isolation, and development team autonomy. The opposite is a Monolithic architecture, where a large amount of functionality lives in a single service which is tested, deployed, and scaled as a single unit.</p>
<p>Twilio Segment&nbsp;adopted this as a best practice&nbsp;early-on, which served us well in some cases, and, as you’ll soon learn, not so well in others.</p>
<p>In the early days of Twilio Segment, we reached a tipping point with a core piece of <a href="https://segment.com/product?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twilio.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fdevelopers%2Fbest-practices%2Fgoodbye-microservices" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twilio&nbsp;Segment’s product</a>. It seemed as if we were falling from the microservices tree, hitting every branch on the way down. Instead of enabling us to move faster, the small team found themselves mired in exploding complexity. Essential benefits of this architecture became burdens. As our velocity plummeted, our defect rate exploded.</p>
<p>Eventually, the team found themselves unable to make headway, with 3 full-time engineers spending most of their time just keeping the system alive. Something had to change. This post is the story of how we took a step back and embraced an approach that aligned well with our product requirements and needs of the team.</p>
<h2 id="why-microservices-worked"><a href="#why-microservices-worked">Why Microservices worked</a></h2>
<p>Twilio Segment’s customer data infrastructure ingests hundreds of thousands of events per second and forwards them to partner APIs, what we refer to as <b>server-side destinations</b>. There are <a target="_blank" href="https://segment.com/docs/connections/destinations/catalog/?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twilio.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fdevelopers%2Fbest-practices%2Fgoodbye-microservices" data-dynamic-link="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">over one hundred types of these destinations</a>, such as Google Analytics, Optimizely, or a custom webhook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Years back, when the product initially launched, the architecture was simple. There was an API that ingested events and forwarded them to a distributed message queue. An event, in this case, is a JSON object generated by a web or mobile app containing information about users and their actions. A sample payload looks like the following:</p>
<p>As events were consumed from the queue, customer-managed settings were checked to decide which destinations should receive the event. The event was then sent to each destination’s API, one after another, which was useful because developers only need to send their event to a single endpoint, Twilio Segment’s API, instead of building potentially dozens of integrations. Twilio Segment handles making the request to every destination endpoint.</p>
<p>If one of the requests to a destination fails, sometimes we’ll try sending that event again at a later time. Some failures are safe to retry while others are not. Retry-able errors are those that could potentially be accepted by the destination with no changes. For example, HTTP 500s, rate limits, and timeouts. Non-retry-able errors are requests that we can be sure will never be accepted by the destination. For example, requests which have invalid credentials or are missing required fields.</p>

        <p>At this point, a single queue contained both the newest events as well as those which may have had several retry attempts, across all destinations, which resulted in <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-of-line_blocking" data-dynamic-link="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">head-of-line blocking</a>. Meaning in this particular case, if one destination slowed or went down, retries would flood the queue, resulting in delays across <i>all</i> our destinations.</p>
<p>Imagine destination X is experiencing a temporary issue and every request errors with a timeout. Now, not only does this create a large backlog of requests which have yet to reach destination X, but also every failed event is put back to retry in the queue. While our systems would automatically scale in response to increased load, the sudden increase in queue depth would outpace our ability to scale up, resulting in delays for the newest events. Delivery times for all destinations would increase because destination X had a momentary outage. Customers rely on the timeliness of this delivery, so we can’t afford increases in wait times anywhere in our pipeline.</p>

<div>
        
    
    <p>To solve the head-of-line blocking problem, the team created a separate service and queue for each destination. This new architecture consisted of an additional router process that receives the inbound events and distributes a copy of the event to each selected destination. Now if one destination experienced problems, only it’s queue would back up and no other destinations would be impacted. This microservice-style architecture isolated the destinations from one another, which was crucial when one destination experienced issues as they often do.</p>

        <h2 id="the-case-for-individual-repos"><a href="#the-case-for-individual-repos">The Case for Individual Repos</a></h2>
<p>Each destination API uses a different request format, requiring custom code to translate the event to match this format. A basic example is destination X requires sending birthday as&nbsp;traits.dob&nbsp;in the payload whereas our API accepts it as&nbsp;traits.birthday. The transformation code in destination X would look something like this:</p>
<p>Many modern destination endpoints have adopted Twilio Segment’s request format making some transforms relatively simple. However, these transforms can be very complex depending on the structure of the destination’s API. For example, for some of the older and most sprawling destinations, we find ourselves shoving values into hand-crafted XML payloads.</p>
<p>Initially, when the destinations were divided into separate services, all of the code lived in one repo. A huge point of frustration was that a single broken test caused tests to fail across all destinations. When we wanted to deploy a change, we had to spend time fixing the broken test even if the changes had nothing to do with the initial change. In response to this problem, it was decided to break out the code for each destination into their own repos. All the destinations were already broken out into their own service, so the transition was natural.</p>
<p>The split to separate repos allowed us to isolate the destination test suites easily. This isolation allowed the development team to move quickly when maintaining destinations.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-microservices-and-repos"><a href="#scaling-microservices-and-repos">Scaling Microservices and Repos</a></h2>
<p>As time went on, we added over 50 new destinations, and that meant 50 new repos. To ease the burden of developing and maintaining these codebases, we created shared libraries to make common transforms and functionality, such as HTTP request handling, across our destinations easier and more uniform.</p>
<p>For example, if we want the name of a user from an event,&nbsp;event.name()&nbsp;can be called in any destination’s code. The shared library checks the event for the property key&nbsp;name&nbsp;and&nbsp;Name. If those don’t exist, it checks for a first name, checking the properties&nbsp;firstName,&nbsp;first_name, and&nbsp;FirstName. It does the same for the last name, checking the cases and combining the two to form the full name.</p>
<p>The shared libraries made building new destinations quick. The familiarity brought by a uniform set of shared functionality made maintenance less of a headache.</p>
<p>However, a new problem began to arise. Testing and deploying changes to these shared libraries impacted all of our destinations. It began to require considerable time and effort to maintain. Making changes to improve our libraries, knowing we’d have to test and deploy dozens of services, was a risky proposition. When pressed for time, engineers would only include the updated versions of these libraries on a single destination’s codebase.</p>
<p>Over time, the versions of these shared libraries began to diverge across the different destination codebases. The great benefit we once had of reduced customization between each destination codebase started to reverse. Eventually, all of them were using different versions of these shared libraries. We could’ve built tools to automate rolling out changes, but at this point, not only was developer productivity suffering but we began to encounter other issues with the microservice architecture.</p>
<p>The additional problem is that each service had a distinct load pattern. Some services would handle a handful of events per day while others handled thousands of events per second. For destinations that handled a small number of events, an operator would have to manually scale the service up to meet demand whenever there was an unexpected spike in load.</p>
<p>While we did have auto-scaling implemented, each service had a distinct blend of required CPU and memory resources, which made tuning the auto-scaling configuration more art than science.</p>
<p>The number of destinations continued to grow rapidly, with the team adding three destinations per month on average, which meant more repos, more queues, and more services. With our microservice architecture, our operational overhead increased linearly with each added destination. Therefore, we decided to take a step back and rethink the entire pipeline.</p>
<h2 id="ditching-microservices-and-queues"><a href="#ditching-microservices-and-queues">Ditching Microservices and Queues</a></h2>
<p>The first item on the list was to consolidate the now over 140 services into a single service. The overhead from managing all of these services was a huge tax on our team. We were literally losing sleep over it since it was common for the on-call engineer to get paged to deal with load spikes.</p>
<p>However, the architecture at the time would have made moving to a single service challenging. With a separate queue per destination, each worker would have to check every queue for work, which would have added a layer of complexity to the destination service with which we weren’t comfortable. This was the main inspiration for&nbsp;Centrifuge. Centrifuge would replace all our individual queues and be responsible for sending events to the single monolithic service. (Note that Centrifuge became the back-end infrastructure for <a href="https://segment.com/product/connections/?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.twilio.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fdevelopers%2Fbest-practices%2Fgoodbye-microservices" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connections</a>.)</p>

        <h2 id="moving-to-a-monorepo"><a href="#moving-to-a-monorepo">Moving to a Monorepo</a></h2>
<p>Given that there would only be one service, it made sense to move all the destination code into one repo, which meant merging all the different dependencies and tests into a single repo. We knew this was going to be messy.</p>
<p>For each of the 120 unique dependencies, we committed to having one version for all our destinations. As we moved destinations over, we’d check the dependencies it was using and update them to the latest versions. We fixed anything in the destinations that broke with the newer versions.</p>
<p>With this transition, we no longer needed to keep track of the differences between dependency versions. All our destinations were using the same version, which significantly reduced the complexity across the codebase. Maintaining destinations now became less time consuming and less risky.</p>
<p>We also wanted a test suite that allowed us to quickly and easily run all our destination tests. Running all the tests was one of the main blockers when making updates to the shared libraries we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the destination tests all had a similar structure. They had basic unit tests to verify our custom transform logic was correct and would execute HTTP requests to the partner’s endpoint to verify that events showed up in the destination as expected.</p>
<p>Recall that the original motivation for separating each destination codebase into its own repo was to isolate test failures. However, it turned out this was a false advantage. Tests that made HTTP requests were still failing with some frequency. With destinations separated into their own repos, there was little motivation to clean up failing tests. This poor hygiene led to a constant source of frustrating technical debt. Often a small change that should have only taken an hour or two would end up requiring a couple of days to a week to complete.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-resilient-test-suite"><a href="#building-a-resilient-test-suite">Building a Resilient Test Suite</a></h2>
<p>The outbound HTTP requests to destination endpoints during the test run was the primary cause of failing tests. Unrelated issues like expired credentials shouldn’t fail tests. We also knew from experience that some destination endpoints were much slower than others. Some destinations took up to 5 minutes to run their tests. With over 140 destinations, our test suite could take up to an hour to run.</p>
<p>To solve for both of these, we created Traffic Recorder. Traffic Recorder is built on top of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/flickr/yakbak" data-dynamic-link="true" rel="noopener noreferrer">yakbak</a>, and is responsible for recording and saving destinations’ test traffic. Whenever a test runs for the first time, any requests and their corresponding responses are recorded to a file. On subsequent test runs, the request and response in the file is played back instead requesting the destination’s endpoint. These files are checked into the repo so that the tests are consistent across every change. Now that the test suite is no longer dependent on these HTTP requests over the internet, our tests became significantly more resilient, a must-have for the migration to a single repo.</p>
<p>It took milliseconds to complete running the tests for all 140+ of our destinations after we integrated Traffic Recorder. In the past, just one destination could have taken a couple of minutes to complete. <i>It felt like magic.</i></p>
<h2 id="why-a-monolith-works"><a href="#why-a-monolith-works">Why a Monolith works</a></h2>
<p>Once the code for all destinations lived in a single repo, they could be merged into a single service. With every destination living in one service, our developer productivity substantially improved. We no longer had to deploy 140+ services for a change to one of the shared libraries. One engineer can deploy the service in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>The proof was in the improved velocity. When our microservice architecture was still in place, we made 32 improvements to our shared libraries. One year later,&nbsp; we’ve made 46 improvements.</p>
<p>The change also benefited our operational story. With every destination living in one service, we had a good mix of CPU and memory-intense destinations, which made scaling the service to meet demand significantly easier. The large worker pool can absorb spikes in load, so we no longer get paged for destinations that process small amounts of load.</p>
<h2 id="trade-offs"><a href="#trade-offs">Trade Offs</a></h2>
<p>Moving from our microservice architecture to a monolith overall was huge improvement, however, there are trade-offs:</p>
<ol><li><p><b>Fault isolation is difficult.</b> With everything running in a monolith, if a bug is introduced in one destination that causes the service to crash, the service will crash for all destinations. We have comprehensive automated testing in place, but tests can only get you so far. We are currently working on a much more robust way to prevent one destination from taking down the entire service while still keeping all the destinations in a monolith.</p>
</li><li><p><b>In-memory caching is less effective.</b> Previously, with one service per destination, our low traffic destinations only had a handful of processes, which meant their in-memory caches of control plane data would stay hot. Now that cache is spread thinly across 3000+ processes so it’s much less likely to be hit. We could use something like Redis to solve for this, but then that’s another point of scaling for which we’d have to account. In the end, we accepted this loss of efficiency given the substantial operational benefits.</p>
</li><li><p><b>Updating the version of a dependency may break multiple destinations.</b> While moving everything to one repo solved the previous dependency mess we were in, it means that if we want to use the newest version of a library, we’ll potentially have to update other destinations to work with the newer version. In our opinion though, the simplicity of this approach is worth the trade-off. And with our comprehensive automated test suite, we can quickly see what breaks with a newer dependency version.</p>
</li></ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Our initial microservice architecture worked for a time, solving the immediate performance issues in our pipeline by isolating the destinations from each other. However, we weren’t set up to scale. We lacked the proper tooling for testing and deploying the microservices when bulk updates were needed. As a result, our developer productivity quickly declined.</p>
<p>Moving to a monolith allowed us to rid our pipeline of operational issues while significantly increasing developer productivity. We didn’t make this transition lightly though and knew there were things we had to consider if it was going to work.</p>
<ol><li>We needed a rock solid testing suite to put everything into one repo. Without this, we would have been in the same situation as when we originally decided to break them apart. Constant failing tests hurt our productivity in the past, and we didn’t want that happening again.</li><li>We accepted the trade-offs inherent in a monolithic architecture and made sure we had a good story around each. We had to be comfortable with some of the sacrifices that came with this change.</li></ol>
<p>When deciding between microservices or a monolith, there are different factors to consider with each. In some parts of our infrastructure, microservices work well but our server-side destinations were a perfect example of how this popular trend can actually hurt productivity and performance. It turns out, the solution for us was a monolith.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 13 Dec 2025</p>
<p>
  Yesterday I shared a little program called <em>Mark V. Shaney
  Junior</em> at
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs">github.com/susam/mvs</a>.  It
  is a minimal implementation of a Markov text generator inspired by
  the legendary Mark V. Shaney program from the 1980s.  If you don't
  know about Mark V. Shaney, read more about it on the Wikipedia
  article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_V._Shaney">Mark
  V. Shaney</a>.
</p>
<p>
  It is a very small program with only about
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs/blob/main/mvs">30 lines of
  Python</a> that favours simplicity over efficiency.  As a hobby, I
  often engage in exploratory programming where I write computer
  programs not to solve a specific problem but simply to explore a
  particular idea or topic for the sole purpose of recreation.  I must
  have written small programs to explore Markov chains for various
  kinds of state spaces over a dozen times by now.  Every time, I just
  pick my last experimental code and edit it to encode the new state
  space I am exploring.  That's usually my general approach to such
  one-off programs.  I have hundreds of tiny little experimental
  programs lying on my disk at any given time.
</p>
<p>
  Once in a while, I get the itch to take one of those exploratory
  programs, give it some finishing touches, wrap it up in a nice Git
  repo along with a <code>README.md</code>, <code>CHANGES.md</code>
  and the whole shebang and share it on
  <a href="https://github.com/susam">github.com/susam</a> and
  <a href="https://codeberg.org/susam">codeberg.org/susam</a>.  The
  Mark V. Shaney Junior program that I shared yesterday happened to be
  one such exercise.
</p>
<p>
  If you scroll down the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs#readme">README</a> of this
  project, you'll find some nice examples of the gibberish produced by
  this program.  The first few examples there are the result of
  training the model on <em>A Christmas Carol</em> by Charles Dickens,
  one of my favourite authors.  It is often said that Dickens never
  used fewer words when more would suffice.  So I thought there
  couldn't be a better piece of text when it comes to testing out my
  tiny Markov model.  I'll not reproduce the generated text examples
  here for the sake of brevity.  If you are interested to take a look,
  just head over to the
  <a href="https://github.com/susam/mvs#gibberish-examples">Gibberish</a>
  section of the README.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after sharing the project, I wondered what kind of gibberish it
  would produce if I fed all 24 years of my blog
  <a href="https://susam.net/pages.html">posts and pages</a> into the program.
  Well, here's one of the results:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>./mvs &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
while a query replace operation is approved by the user. The above
variable defines the build job. It can be incredibly useful while
working on assembly language and machine code. In fact, all internal
resources like the result to refine the search prompt changes from
bck-i-search: to fwd-i-search:. Now type C-SPC (i.e. ctrl+space) to
set a mark causes Emacs to use 32-bit registers like EBP, ESP,
etc. Thus the behaviour is undefined. Such code may behave differently
when compiled with the readily available GNU tools like the shape
of 8. Flipping "P" horizontally makes it a proper quine: cat $0</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  This is the text that comes out after the program consumes over 200
  posts consisting of about 200,000 words.  My blog also has
  a <a href="https://susam.net/comments/">comments section</a> with over 500
  comments consisting of about 40,000 words.  All comments were
  excluded while training the model.  Here is another output example:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>./mvs &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
enjoy asking "what happens if" and then type M-x zap-up-to-char RET
b. The buffer for this specific video, the actual fare for 8.3 km and
11 are all written from scratch. No prior knowledge is expected to
slow down in future. For now, I will add a statement like x =
0.999... , the inner corner square as discussed in the code segment
into the REPL window. Unlike Slimv, Vlime can work with and debug
executable files, it can be more convenient. M-x: Execute Extended
Command The key sequence M-q invokes the command cat and type TAB to
indent the</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Here is a particularly incoherent but amusing one:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>./mvs &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
Then open a new Lisp source file and the exact answer could harm
students' self-esteem. Scientists have arbitrarily assumed that an
integral domain. However, the string and comment text. To demonstrate
how a build job can trigger itself, pass input to standard output or
standard error), Eshell automatically runs the following command in
Vim and Emacs will copy the message length limit of 512 characters,
etc. For example, while learning to play the game between normal mode
to move the point is on an old dictionary lying around our house and
that is moving to the small and supportive community</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  No, I have never said anywhere that opening a Lisp source file could
  harm anyone's self-esteem.  The text generator has picked up the
  'Lisp source file' phrase from my
  <a href="https://susam.net/lisp-in-vim.html">Lisp in Vim</a> post and the
  'self-esteem' bit from the <a href="https://susam.net/from-perl-to-pi.html">From Perl
  to Pi</a> post.
</p>
<p>
  By default, this program looks at trigrams (all sequences of three
  adjacent words) and creates a map where the first two words of the
  trigram are inserted as the key and the third word is appended to
  its list value.  This map is the model.  In this way, the model
  captures each pair of adjacent words along with the words that
  immediately follow each pair.  The text generator then chooses a key
  (a pair of words) at random and looks for a word which follows.  If
  there are multiple followers, it picks one at random.  That is
  pretty much the whole algorithm.  There isn't much more to it.  It
  is as simple as it gets.  For that reason, I often describe a simple
  Markov model like this as the 'hello, world' for language models.
</p>
<p>
  Of course, in 2025, given the overwhelming popularity of large
  language models (LLMs), Markov models like this look unimpressive.
  Unlike LLMs, a simple Markov model cannot capture global structure
  or long-range dependencies within the text.  It relies entirely on
  local word transition statistics.  Also, these days, one hardly
  needs a Markov model to generate gibberish; social media provides an
  ample supply.  Nevertheless, I think the simplicity of its design
  and implementation serves as a good entry point into language
  models.
</p>
<p>
  In my implementation, the number of words in the key of the map can
  be set via command line arguments.  By default, it is 2 as described
  above.  This value is also known as the order of the model.  So by
  default the order is 2.  If we increase it to, say, 3 or 4, the
  generated text becomes a little more coherent.  Here is one such
  example:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>./mvs 4 &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
It is also possible to search for channels by channel names. For
example, on Libera Chat, to search for all channels with 'python' in
its name, enter the IRC command: /msg alis list python. Although I
have used Libera Chat in the examples above, there are plenty of
infinite fields, so they must all be integral domains too. Consider
the field of rational numbers Q. Another quick way to arrive at this
fact is to observe that when one knight is placed on a type D square,
only two positions for the second knight such that the two knights
attack</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Except for a couple of abrupt and meaningless transitions, the text
  is mostly coherent.  We need to be careful about not increasing the
  order too much.  In fact, if we increase the order of the model to
  5, the generated text becomes very dry and factual because it begins
  to quote large portions of the blog posts verbatim.  Not much fun
  can be had with that.
</p>
<p>
  Before I end this post, let me present one final example where I ask
  it to generate text from an initial prompt:
</p>
<pre><samp>$ <kbd>./mvs 2 100 'Finally we' &lt; susam.txt</kbd>
Finally we divide this number by a feed aggregrator for Emacs-related
blogs. The following complete key sequences describe the effects of
previous evaluations shall have taken a simple and small to contain
bad content. This provides an interactive byte-compiled Lisp function
in MATLAB and GNU bash 5.1.4 on Debian is easily reproducible in
Windows XP. Older versions might be able to run that server for me it
played a significant burden on me as soon as possible. C-u F: Visit
the marked files or directories in the sense that it was already
initiated and we were to complete the proof.</samp>
</pre>
<p>
  Apparently, this is how I would sound if I ever took up speaking
  gibberish!

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><em>Author’s note: I originally intended for this post to cover adventure games, computer role-playing games, wargames and other simulations, a brief look at the home video game market, and finally the rise of hybrids that fused home video game systems with personal computers. In the grand scheme of the story about personal computers that I am trying to tell, it probably does not make sense to lavish nearly 7,000 words on early adventure games alone, but it’s a topic of personal interest to me and the tale grew in the telling.</em></p>



<p>Play was central to the formation of personal computer culture. For the early hobbyists who were fascinated by the guts of the machine, the computer was a plaything in and of itself. Many of those who joined the hobby in 1975 or 1976 did so because of games: they had experience with the extensive BASIC game culture that circulated in the time-sharing systems of universities, high schools, and even corporations, and wanted to keep playing at home.</p>



<p>Even after the rise of commercial personal computer software, when the first truly useful applications began appearing, games remained by far the most popular software category (counting by number of titles produced and number of units sold, although not by dollar value). One 1980 catalog of Apple II software, for example, lists 265 titles, of which roughly two-thirds are games, from <em>Ack-Ack </em>(an anti-aircraft target shooter)to <em>Wipe Off</em> (a <em>Breakout </em>clone). The rest of the catalog comprises demos, educational programs, and a smattering of business software. Whatever they might say about the practical value of the personal computer, buyers had an evident hunger for games.<a href="#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>



<h3>The Early Games and Their Market</h3>



<p>Computer owners got their hands on games in one of three ways. In the early years, the most common means would be simply copying a paper or cassette tape from a friend or colleague, whether with the permission of the original author or not. In the early years, most hobbyists treated game software as a commons to be freely shared, just as it had been in the time-sharing culture through cooperatives like DECUS. This peer-to-peer copying would never entirely go away, despite the commercialization of game software and various schemes by publishers to try to prevent it.</p>



<p>Many magazines and books also published “type-ins,” complete computer programs (almost always written in BASIC) intended to be manually entered at the keyboard (and then saved to tape or disk), and these, too, were most often games. Dave Ahl’s <em>BASIC Computer Games </em>(first published in 1973 by Digital Equipment Corporation), a collection of over 100 type-ins, reputedly sold one million copies by 1979. Though type-in publication continued through the 1980s, the inherent limits on the length of such programs (only the most dedicated would tackle a type-in that was more than a few hundred lines long) and their reliance on the universality of BASIC (rather than more performant compiled languages) meant that their significance waned as the sophistication of the game market increased. They could serve as fun demos or educational tools for learning to code, but could not compare to similar games available commercially.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Finally, of course, there were the commercial titles offered by software publishers. The game business began in the same way as the personal computer hardware business: with hobby-entrepreneurs selling their creations to fellow hobbyists. In July 1976, for example, D.E. Hipps of Miami, Florida offered a Star Trek game written for MicroSoft’s Altair BASIC for $10 (no one at this stage of the industry paid any attention to niceties such as licensing agreements for the use of the Star Trek name). No common standard data storage standard existed; hobbyists employed a mix of paper teletype tapes, cassette storage, and (for the most extravagant) floppy disks. So Hipps opted to distribute his game as printed source code: a type-in! SCELBI (creators of one of the early, pre-Altair hobby computers), offered another Star Trek variant called <em>Galaxy</em> in the same form. By the late 1970s, the convergence of the industry on a small number of popular storage standards (with CP/M dominant) resolved this problem, and most games were distributed in plastic baggies containing instructions and a cassette or floppy disk.<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>

<p>It didn’t take long for other entrepreneurs to see a business opportunity in making it easier for software authors to publish their games. It took some time for clear business models and market verticals to emerge. No categorial distinction existed between publishers of games and publishers of utility and business software prior to 1980: Personal Software’s first big hit was <em>MicroChess</em>, followed by <em>VisiCalc</em>, followed by (as we’ll soon see) <em>Zork</em>. Programma International’s founder began as a hoarder of Apple II software, much of it acquired from copies unauthorized by the original author, then turned legitimate to sell those authors’ software instead. Softape tried selling bundles of software by subscription, and then started its own newsletter for subscribers, <em>Softalk</em>.</p>



<p>Some magazines went the other way around: <em>Softside </em>magazine (located the next town over from <em>BYTE’s </em>Peterborough, New Hampshire headquarters) created The Software Exchange (TSE), while Dave Ahl’s <em>Creative Computing </em>set up a label called Sensational Software. Type-ins printed in the magazines became a gateway drug to more convenient (and often more complex and interesting) software available for sale on cassette or diskette.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>



<p>Figure 21: Creative Computing heavily advertised the Sensational Software brand in the pages of the magazine, as in this July 1980 example describing some of their most popular hits and offering a free catalog of their full offering of 400 titles.</p>



<p>The early personal computer game culture imitated what came before it. The boundary between mini- and microcomputer culture was permeated by thousands who used time-sharing systems at work or school and then went home to a hobby computer. Prior to 1977, a game written for a personal computer was almost invariably based on a game drawn from the other side of that boundary.</p>



<p>Barring a few exceptions (such as the PLATO system available at some universities), users interacted with such computer systems through teletypes or video teletypes that alternated sending and receiving text. So, the resulting games were turn-based, purely textual, and relied on strategy and calculation (or pure luck) to win, not timing and reaction speed. These textual games suited the early hobbyists perfectly, since almost all of their computers also had text-only interfaces, whether mechanical teletypes or video displays like the TV Typewriter.</p>



<p>Other than simple quizzes, demos, and guessing games, popular titles included simulations such as <em>Hammurabi</em>, <em>Civil War</em> and <em>Lunar Lander</em>; statistical recreations of sports contests (baseball, basketball, golf, etc.); or classic games or puzzles from the physical world, like checkers, Yahtzee, and the towers of Hanoi. By far the most popular by far, however, judging by the number of variations published and references in hobby magazines, were descendants of Mike Mayfield’s 1971 <em>Star Trek</em>, a strategic game of galactic war against the Klingons.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>

<p>Some early personal computers, however, had video controllers with built-in memory, which allowed for more sophisticated interfaces than the simple back-and-forth exchanges of a teletype. Processor Technology, whose VDM-1 display interface could paint characters at arbitrary points on the screen, sold real-time textual games by Steve Dompier like <em>Trek-80 </em>(released in 1976, despite the name). Its interface (including a galactic sector map made of text characters and readouts of the <em>Enterprise</em>’s weapon and shield status) updated in real-time in response to player and (simulated) enemy actions, rather than scrolling by one turn at a time. Cromemco, maker of the Dazzler, an Altair-compatible graphics board, offered the only personal computer games to use pixel graphics prior to the Apple II, starting with a version of the seminal <em>Spacewar </em>in early 1977. They followed with a suite of similar games such as <em>Tankwar</em> and <em>Dogfight</em>.<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>

<p>After 1977, when computers with graphical displays became more widely available (especially the full-color Apple II), computer games tapped a new vein of inspiration (and imitation): arcade games. Originally commercialized by Atari and its imitators as standalone arcade cabinets in the early 1970s, then moving into homes by the mid-1970s, these games were typically real-time and focused on action. Relatively cheap and easy-to-make, and relatively disposable to the user (few took more than a few minutes to play a complete game), computer action games proliferated by the hundreds and thousands, many of them direct or near clones of pre-existing arcade or home video games.</p>



<p>By 1980, however, there were major innovations that set personal computer games apart from other game media. In-depth simulations, expansive adventures that took hours to solve, and dungeon crawls teeming with a variety of monsters, treasures, and traps provided immersive experiences that the action-oriented video game consoles, did not, and (given their limited memory and storage capacity) could not provide. Once combined with full-color, bitmapped graphics, these games also surpassed anything previously available on their time-sharing predecessors. The era of imitation was definitively over.</p>



<h3>Adventure</h3>



<p>For several years of my childhood, for reasons that I no longer recall, our family’s Apple IIe computer, equipped with a green-and-black monochrome monitor, resided in my bedroom. Though much of my autobiographical memory is quite hazy, I can clearly remember each of the Apple II games we owned, stored on 5 ¼-inch-square floppy disks: <em>Syzygy</em> (a space shooter in the vein of <em>Asteroids</em>), <em>One on One: Dr. J vs. Larry Bird</em>, <em>Winter Games</em>, and <em>Arcticfox </em>(a sci-fi tank simulator with wireframe graphics).</p>



<p>But the game that truly captured my imagination, the game whose opening sequence and imagery remain etched (monochromatically) in my mind, was <em>King’s Quest II: Romancing the Throne</em>, a 1985 title by Sierra On-Line. The forty-nine-screen, hand-drawn fairy tale kingdom that you explore in the game (via your avatar, King Graham) felt like a vast world of endless possibility compared to the cramped half-court of <em>One on One</em>, the endlessly repeating monotony of a biathlon course in <em>Winter Games</em>, or the sterile polygonal landscape of <em>Arcticfox</em>’s Antarctica. That open-ended feeling was enhanced by the lure of hidden secrets just out of reach, and a freeform text interface that accepted English commands like “THROW APPLE” (though only a tiny subset of the commands you could imagine would actually work). Despite its limitations and many, many frustrations (at age seven or eight, with no hint book and no Internet walkthroughs, I certainly never came close to completing it), it made me feel that I was truly experiencing an adventure.</p>

<p>The adventure game genre originated in a freely shared, text-driven game created in the time-sharing world. The game, which I will call <em>Adventure </em>(it is variously called <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em>, <em>Colossal Cave</em>, <em>Adventure</em>, or simply ADVENT, after the game’s PDP-10 file name)challenged players to find five treasures within a cave complex by navigating a maze, solving puzzles, and defeating a band of axe-wielding dwarves &nbsp;Its author was Will Crowther, a programmer at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), where he had written core infrastructural software for ARPANET, the first nationwide computer network.</p>

<p>In 1975, Crowther went through a painful divorce. He had always enjoyed playing games with his school age daughters, so he began crafting a game on the company’s DEC PDP-10 to help him stay connected with them. Crowther copied the physical structure of <em>Adventure</em>’s cave directly from a portion of the Mammoth complex in Kentucky. (He had met his wife through caving, and they had explored Mammoth together, so the game was also, in a sense, a means of staying connected to his former, married life.) It is probable (though not certain) that Crowther also drew some inspiration from a popular 1973 time-sharing game called <em>Hunt the Wumpus</em>, which required users to use textual clues to find and kill a Wumpus hidden in a system of caves without falling into a pit. But the conceptual structure of <em>Adventure </em>(delving into the earth to find treasure and magical artifacts in the face of devious obstacles and armed foes) came from a new game of pencil, paper, and imagination that Crowther was playing with some of his BBN friends, called <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>.<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>



<p>In Crowther’s words:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>…the caving had stopped, because that had become awkward, so I decided I would fool around and write a program that was a re-creation in fantasy of my caving, and also would be a game for the kids, and perhaps had some aspects of the <em>Dungeons and Dragons </em>that I had been playing.<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Just as in the later <em>King’s Quest II</em>, the player used simple verb-noun commands (such as “TAKE LAMP”) to interact with the world, but lacking a graphical screen with a visible avatar, he or she also used text commands to move about the world, from one room of the cave to the next (e.g., “SOUTH” or “EAST”). Crowther showed the game off to his D&amp;D buddies and his daughters, then took a new job in California, and forgot about it.<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> &nbsp;</p>



<p>Time-sharing games had once propagated gradually from computer to computer via collectives like the Digital Equipment Computer Users’ Society or colleagues and friends mailing paper tapes to one another. But BBN was on the ARPANET, and Crowther had put his game on a public directory in the BBN computer. From there, someone copied it across the network to a computer in a Stanford lab, where a graduate student, Don Woods, found it in early 1977.</p>

<p>Fascinated by Crowther’s game, Woods contacted him for the FORTRAN source code, and set about expanding it. He increased the scope by adding more rooms, more puzzles, more foes, and more ways to interact with the world; but he also added the ability to save your progress and a point-tracking system with a final objective: to find fifteen treasures and return them to the starting location. Woods’ larger, more polished version of <em>Adventure </em>spread rapidly across the time-sharing world, and became an obsession for some, keeping them at the office past midnight in search of that last treasure. (One of Woods’ additions was a setting to allow admins to disable the game during working hours.)<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>



<h3>Adventureland</h3>



<p>A frizzy-haired Florida man, Scott Adams, was the first to commercialize a version of <em>Adventure </em>for the personal computer. He had first fallen in love with computers on a time-sharing terminal at his Miami high school in the late 1960s. He went on to earn a computer science degree and by the late 1970s, was working as a programmer at telecom manufacturer Stromberg-Carlson. On the side he had become an avid home computer hobbyist, purchasing a Sphere computer in 1975 and then a TRS-80 in 1977. Shortly thereafter he discovered <em>Adventure </em>on the company time-sharing system and, like many before and after, could not quit playing until he had beaten it.</p>



<p>Adams decided that it would be an interesting challenge to build something similar for the TRS-80. It would have to be much smaller to fit in the sixteen kilobytes of memory he had available. The Crowther-Woods <em>Adventure </em>contained 140 distinct locations and ran to eighty kilobytes of (uncompiled) FORTRAN and fifty-four kilobytes of data for the game text. Adams’ <em>Adventureland </em>was considerably smaller, with fewer than thirty-five locations—not necessarily to the detriment of gameplay; for example, the cutting lopped off most of <em>Adventure</em>’s huge and torturous mazes.<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>



<p>Adams’ local TRS-80 buddies were impressed enough with his game that he decided to sell it through both The TRS-80 Software Exchange and Creative Computing, who offered it on cassette for $24.95 and $14.95, respectively, in their January 1979 magazine issues. He followed up with a whole series of games, starting with <em>Pirate Adventure</em>, and ported the games from the TRS-80 to other popular computer platforms. His wife Alexis joined the venture as a business manager and game designer, co-authoring <em>Mystery Fun House</em> and <em>Voodoo Castle</em>.<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>

<p>The adventure game genre is often criticized for absurd and unfair puzzles, which can be guessed at only through trial-and-error, and tedious mazes or other navigational obfuscations. These early games from circa 1980 are among the worst offenders. In <em>Adventureland</em>, for example, a “very thin” black bear blocks your way, and the only way to get past it is to “yell” at it. Feeding this apparently hungry bear honey will prevent you from completing the game, because the honey is one of the treasures you must collect. You could easily get to state in these games where you have lost the game without knowing it.<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>

<p>But these criticisms are retrospective: the contemporary press and the buying public lapped up the Adams’ adventures and all of their imitators. We have to remember that the <em>appeal </em>of this genre lay in getting immersed (one might say “lost”) in the game for hours every evening, clawing your way forward towards ultimate triumph for weeks, or even months, on end. In a market full of arcade-like games that offered the convenient but shallow fun of a bag of potato chips, adventure games provided a rich and fulfilling meal for the imagination. As one lover of the genre put it:</p>



<p>Adventure is the product of imagination appealing to imagination. It is not just the puzzle, or the theme, or the nonplayer characters and their personalities. It is a verbal tapestry of interwoven phrases that whisk you away to magical kingdoms of the mind. The computer becomes a tool of reaching that conveys you where it will. You go along eagerly, breathlessly, awaiting what comes next.<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>



<p>The catch was that this delicacy was consumable only once: a solved adventure game was no more interesting to revisit than a solved crossword puzzle. So, they <em>had </em>to provide a challenge: no one wanted to pay $24.95 for a game on the way home from work and then breeze through it before bedtime. A game that was very fair would also risk being seen as a waste of money. Despite improvements in design in future years that would banish some of the worst practices of the genre, adventure games remained trapped on the horns of this dilemma.<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>



<h3>Zork</h3>



<p>The Adams’ “Adventure” line made them wealthy enough to build a faux-castle outside Orlando, and kicked off one of the most popular computer game genres of the 1980s. By late 1980, half-a-dozen other companies were putting out personal computer adventure games, from The Programmer’s Guild &nbsp;to Mad Hatter Software, as well as a version of Crowther-Woods <em>Adventure </em>put out by Microsoft. But they are overshadowed in the historical record by a competitor that subsequently dominated both sales of and critical attention to text adventure games. It began at MIT. In the spring of 1977, the Crowther-Woods <em>Adventure </em>arrived over the ARPANET at the PDP-10 at the Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS), and sank its claws into its employees. Impressed by what Crowther and Woods had done, but convinced that it could be made even better, a group of LCS staff set out in May 1977 to one-up <em>Adventure</em>.<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a></p>



<p>Dave Lebling, who had already worked on several games (including <em>Maze</em>, the first first-person shooter game), kicked off the project. Lebling played <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em> in the same Cambridge D&amp;D group as Crowther had (though not at the same time), and based the game’s combat system on the tabletop game. Then Marc Blank, Tim Anderson, and Bruce Daniels filled in most of the core structure of the program. They gave it the place-holder name of <em>Zork </em>(a term used as an inside-joke expletive at LCS, as in “why won’t this zorking thing work”), which ended up sticking permanently. The game reached its completed state in early 1979, by which point it greatly exceeded the original <em>Adventure </em>in scale, with 191 rooms and 211 items, occupying a full megabyte of memory.<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>



<p>Coded in a LISP-descendant called MUDDLE or MDL, <em>Zork </em>had an elegant design that encapsulated all the information about the possible interactions of each room and item in a single block of code and data, making it much easier to extend than <em>Adventure</em>. It also had a much richer text interface: both <em>Adventure </em>and <em>AdventureLand </em>accepted only “verb noun” commands, but <em>Zork </em>also allowed for conjunctions and prepositions (for example, “TAKE SWORD AND LANTERN FROM SACK”).Though aping the basic tropes of <em>Adventure</em> (a small overland area leading to an underground treasure-hunt), its more complex architecture allowed for a richer and more clever set of puzzles.<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>



<p>In the spring of 1979, several key staff members of LCS were poised to leave MIT. Their supervisor, Al Vezza, proposed to keep the band together by forming a company. Incorporated in June as Infocom, its new employees and shareholders included Lebling, Blank, and Anderson.</p>



<p>While the various partners mulled what exactly to do with their new business, Blank and a fellow LCS alum, Joel Berez, figured out how to cram <em>Zork </em>onto a microcomputer: they cut the number of rooms and items in the game in half and removed all the features of MDL not needed for the game, creating an interpreter for a simpler language they called <em>Zork </em>Implementation Language (ZIL). The resulting program occupied just seventy-seven kilobytes. To get this to fit into a microcomputer memory half that size, they had one last trick: a virtual memory system built into the interpreter, to swap chunks of the program on and off the disk as needed (typical floppy disk capacities at the time were over 100 kilobytes, and continued to grow). This meant that <em>Zork </em>could <em>only </em>run off of a floppy drive (whose rapidly spinning disk could sync to a new data location in a fraction of a second and supply data at fifteen kilobytes per second), never a cassette (which took a minute or more to fully unwind or rewind and supplied data at 300 bits per second). Or, to put it another way, the growing market prevalence of affordable floppy drives made larger personal computer adventure games feasible: it took about twenty minutes to load a Scott Adams adventure game from tape.<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>





<p>In late 1979, Blank and Berez convinced a reluctant Vezza (who wanted to get into business software) to make a microcomputer <em>Zork </em>Infocom’s first product. They initially published through Personal Software, co-owned by MIT’s own Dan Fylstra, which had just recently released <em>VisiCalc.</em> &nbsp;But after <em>VisiCalc’s </em>smash success, Fylstra no longer wanted to deal in mere games, so Infocom became its own publisher for subsequent games—including <em>Zork II </em>and <em>III</em>, built from the remaining unused material from the original PDP-10 <em>Zork</em>.</p>



<p><em>Zork </em>became available in December 1980 and sold 10,000 units in 1981, mostly on the Apple II, despite an eye-watering price of $39.95, at a time when most games cost fifteen to twenty-five dollars. Then, astonishingly, in an industry typically characterized by ephemerality and obsolescence, sales continued to grow, year after year. They peaked in 1984 with over 150,000 copies sold. No doubt Zork’s self-referential humor, its restrained but clever marketing, and the high quality of the game itself (certainly the most well-crafted adventure game to date) all helped to sell the game.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>

</div>


<p>But many sales also must have arisen from the startling impression given by sitting down in a store (or at a friend’s house) to interact with this remarkable piece of software. Bob Liddil, reviewing <em>Zork </em>for <em>BYTE </em>magazine, pointed to the fluency of the parser as the element that first pulled him in:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was eager to test Zork’s biggest selling point, intelligent input (ie: its ability to accept free-form instructions). I typed “OPEN THE BAG AND GET THE LUNCH,” in reference to a brown paper sack inside the house. The computer complied. There was water and food, so I typed “EAT THE LUNCH AND DRINK THE WATER,” to which the computer responded with gratitude for satisfying its hunger and thirst. I was hooked.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The game seemed to <em>understand </em>the user and to have an appropriate answer (or a witty retort) ready for everything they might try, from expletives (“FUCK &gt; SUCH LANGUAGE IN A HIGH-CLASS ESTABLISHMENT LIKE THIS!”) to attempts to outwit the command system (“FIND HANDS &gt; WITHIN SIX FEET OF YOUR HEAD, ASSUMING YOU HAVEN’T LEFT THAT SOMEWHERE.”), to questions about the imaginary world in which the game is played (“WHAT IS A ZORKMID? &gt; THE ZORKMID IS THE UNIT OF CURRENCY OF THE GREAT UNDERGROUND EMPIRE.”) Along with <em>VisiCalc </em>and <em>WordStar</em>, <em>Zork </em>functioned not just as a piece of software that did something, but also as an existence proof (for the owner and for skeptical friends and family) that the microcomputer could be more than merely a toy version of a real computer.<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a></p>



<p>Zork sales finally fell off in the mid-1980s, not because new text adventure games had surpassed it (Infocom continued to rule that particular roost, and <em>Zork </em>remained their flagship), but because of the steady improvement in personal computer graphics and the corresponding ascendancy of graphical games over textual ones.</p>



<h3>Mystery House</h3>



<p>The first graphical adventure game actually appeared several months before <em>Zork</em>: On-Line Systems’ <em>Mystery House, </em>created by Ken and Roberta Williams. Unlike Scott Adams and most of the early personal computer hobbyists, Ken Williams got into computers for money, not love. Raised in greater Los Angeles in an unhappy home, he was a driven and impatient young man, and graduated high school at just sixteen. Roberta Heuer, a dreamy young woman whom Williams met through a double date, was impressed enough by his intelligence and ambition to give in to his insistence that they marry in 1972, while they were both still teenagers.</p>



<p>With the expectation of children to come, Ken abandoned his physics program at Cal Poly Pomona for a more immediately lucrative career in data processing. His father-in-law helped him get a loan to attend Control Data Corporation’s training school (the Control Data Institute), and from there he went on to a series of positions working on “big iron” batch-processing systems, constantly bouncing from job to job and home to home in search of better opportunities and a fatter pay check.

</div>


<p>The Williamses took no notice of microcomputers until Ken and one of his co-workers, Robert Leff, concocted a way to make money off of them: selling fellow programmers a microcomputer implementation of FORTRAN, one of the most popular data processing languages. Not only could this venture make him and Roberta still richer (always a key consideration), it could free them to finally move away from the traffic and grind of Los Angeles and to live out their dream of rural life. Initially Ken planned to write FORTRAN for the TRS-80, but he redirected his energies to the more capable Apple II after he and Roberta got themselves one for a mutual Christmas present.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Roberta had gotten hooked on adventure games. Ken had an electromechanical teletype terminal in their home for one of his consulting jobs, and connected it to a computer with the Crowther-Woods <em>Adventure </em>available to play. He showed the game off to Roberta. For Ken it was a curiosity, but for Roberta it became an obsession: she would not quit until she had beaten the game, weeks later. Ken brought home a borrowed TRS-80 and cassette tapes for the Scott Adams adventure series, and she flew through those, too. Soon she had an idea for a game of her own: instead of a treasure hunt, it would be a murder mystery; a mix of <em>Clue </em>and <em>Ten Little Indians </em>set in a creepy old Victorian house.</p>



<p>She insisted that Ken help her create it, and, after putting her off several times, he finally relented. Roberta wanted to add pictures of each room as a way to make this new game better than what came before, taking advantage of the Apple II’s 280×192 pixel high-resolution graphics mode. Because storing dozens of bitmapped images on a floppy disk would be impossible, Ken bought a VersaWriter accessory, a tablet with a movable arm that let Roberta capture the (x, y) position of each line endpoint in her pictures and store them into the computer. He wrote code to re-create the pictures from these coordinates by drawing the lines at runtime.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> &nbsp;</p>

<p>Like Crowther and Adams, Ken split the data tables apart from the code that interpreted them. This allowed Roberta to work out all of the information about the rooms in the game, the items they contain, and the actions the player can perform, without needing to write any code. This division of labor between programming and design, quite novel to computer game software, came about from the accident of Roberta’s limited technical skills (she had worked briefly as COBOL programmer, at Ken’s insistence) and Ken’s lack of interest in the game: he was still focused on launching Apple FORTRAN.<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a></p>



<p>Then, while visiting local computer stores to pitch his computer language, Ken demoed an early version of Roberta’s game and everyone in the store gathered around to see it. The owners asked when they could have copies to sell. Ken realized he was backing the wrong horse: it was Roberta’s side project that would make them rich, not FORTRAN. Moreover, rather than give up a cut to a publisher like Programma International, they would take all the revenue for themselves, by publishing the game through the company name he had already registered for his never-to-be-released FORTRAN, On-Line Systems. On top of that, they could make even more money by distributing games into the stores they were already visiting on behalf of other software authors, like Scott Adams’ Florida-based Adventure International. Eventually unable to manage both publishing and distribution, he convinced his former colleague and erstwhile FORTRAN partner, Robert Leff, to buy out the distribution business, which grew into the industry behemoth Softsel.<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>



<p>After a month of development on nights and weekends (Ken’s pace was manic: in his memoir he writes that he always strove to be a “Triple-A” player, and his brother called him a “chronic workaholic”), the Williams’ started selling <em>Mystery House </em>in May 1980. It required forty-eight kilobytes of memory, but with chip prices falling continuously, this was not so stringent a requirement as it had been even a year before.</p>



<p>The game’s simplistic “mystery” ends with the player gunning down the <em>de facto</em> murderer: the only living character to be found in a houseful of victims. The puzzles are among the more poorly clued and arbitrary to be found in a genre full of such frustrations. But for adventure-starved gamers of the time it was enchanting: not only could they witness the virtual world which they were navigating, it actually changed in response to their actions (picking up an object, like the taunting note that kicked off the murders, would remove it from the scene). Roberta’s drawings, crude and child-like as they certainly are, gave the game a visual appeal that drew in new buyers, and more than justified its price of $24.95.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>

<p>That summer Ken and Roberta were pulling in $30,000 a month and shopping for a house far from Los Angeles, in Coarsegold, California, nestled in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada near Yosemite National Park. On-Line Systems became Sierra On-Line. A few months later a second “High-Res Adventure” followed, <em>The Wizard and the Princess, </em>which added visually-stunning color to <em>Mystery House’s </em>line drawings: Ken used dithering techniques to make the six colors available in high-res mode appear like twenty-one. Roberta’s <em>King’s Quest </em>series, which I encountered on my Apple II, did not begin until 1984. It became Sierra’s best seller: by 1987, the first three installments of the series had sold a combined 500,000 copies, at least according to Sierra’s own marketing.<a href="#_ftn28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>

<p>It stands out, in a story populated almost entirely with male characters, that two of the earliest adventure game designers (Alexis Adams and Roberta Williams) were women. The scope of Alexis’ contributions aren’t entirely clear, but Roberta was arguably the most successful adventure game designer of all time. There was an appeal in the adventure game genre, which had more in common with a mystery novel or a logic puzzle than an arcade game and typically eschewed violence (the summary execution of <em>Mystery House</em>’s killer notwithstanding), that attracted some women to an otherwise almost entirely masculine industry.<a href="#_ftn29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>

<p>In a world where multiple discovery and parallel invention are the norm, it is also remarkable that all of the games we have discussed (and indeed all the computer adventure games ever made) can trace their ancestry to the Crowther-Woods <em>Adventure</em>. In the meantime, though, many other computer game authors had drawn inspiration from <em>Dungeons and Dragons</em>, spawning an entirely different genre of computer games, more in tune with <em>D&amp;D</em>’s wargaming roots.</p>

The account in the previous paragraphs is interpolated from the above sources, which are partially contradictory. All differ about who got the Apple II and why. Levy never mentions the TRS-80 or any adventure games besides <em>Adventure</em>, and has Roberta finishing that game after the time the Apple II was purchased, implying she never played any other adventure games before deciding to write <em>Mystery House</em>: the timeline would simply be too tight. I believe this is wrong, and either an intentional elision or a false interpolation by Levy. It is unlikely that the Williamses would later entirely hallucinate having brought home and played the whole series of Scott Adams games. The accounts also differ on whose idea it was to add pictures to the game. I’m inclined to believe it was Roberta, to whom the game idea and all the passion for it belonged.</p>

<p><em>It's important to note that we used the most commonly and widely supported technologies in this research, to make comparison between providers as fair as possible while giving us significant data to analyze, so this will not be the full coverage for each provider.</em></p><p>These are some of the most visible names in the market. They also tend to have very long country lists on their websites. Notably, three well-known providers had zero mismatches across all the countries we tested: Mullvad, IVPN, and Windscribe<strong>.</strong></p><p>Country mismatches doesn’t automatically mean some providers offer “bad VPNs,” but it does mean that if you’re choosing a VPN because it claims “100+ countries,” you should know that a significant share of those flags may be labels, or virtual locations.</p><h2 id="what-%E2%80%9Cvirtual-locations%E2%80%9D-really-mean">What “Virtual Locations” Really Mean</h2><p>When a VPN lets you connect to, for example, “Bahamas” or “Somalia,” that doesn’t always mean traffic routes through there. In many cases, it’s somewhere entirely different, like Miami or London, but presented as if traffic is in the country you picked.</p><p>This setup is known as a virtual location:</p><ul><li>The VPN app shows “Country X” (e.g. Bahamas).</li><li>The IP registry data also says “Country X” — because the provider self-declared it that way.</li><li>But the network measurements (latency and routing) show the traffic actually exits in “Country Y” — often thousands of kilometers away.</li></ul><p>The problem? Without active network measurement, most IP datasets will rely on what the IP’s owner told the internet registry or published in WHOIS/geofeeds: a self-reported country tag. If that record is wrong or outdated, the mistake spreads everywhere. That’s where IPinfo’s ProbeNet comes in: by running live RTT tests from 1,200+ points of presence worldwide, we anchor each IP to its real-world location, not just its declared one.</p><p>Across the dataset, we found <strong>97 countries</strong> where at least one VPN brand only ever appeared as virtual or unmeasurable in our data. In other words, for a noticeable slice of the world map, some “locations” in VPNs never show up as true exits in our measurements.&nbsp;</p><p>We also found <strong>38 countries</strong> where every mention behaved this way: at least one VPN claimed them, but <strong>none</strong> ever produced a stable, measurable exit in that country in our sample.</p><p>You can think of these 38 as the “unmeasurable” countries in this study – places that exist in server lists, config files, and IP geofeeds, but never once appeared as the actual exit country in our measurements. They’re not randomly scattered – they cluster in specific parts of the map. By region, that includes:</p><figure><img src="https://ipinfo.io/blog/content/images/2025/12/VPN-research----unmeasurable--countries-map---Non-measurable.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1055" srcset="https://ipinfo.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2025/12/VPN-research----unmeasurable--countries-map---Non-measurable.png 600w, https://ipinfo.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2025/12/VPN-research----unmeasurable--countries-map---Non-measurable.png 1000w, https://ipinfo.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2025/12/VPN-research----unmeasurable--countries-map---Non-measurable.png 1600w, https://ipinfo.io/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2025/12/VPN-research----unmeasurable--countries-map---Non-measurable.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>This doesn’t prove there is zero VPN infrastructure in those countries globally. It does show that, across the providers and locations we measured, the dominant pattern is to serve those locations from elsewhere. Here are three of the most interesting examples of how this looks at the IP level.</p><h2 id="case-studies-two-countries-that-only-exist-on-the-map">Case Studies: Two Countries That Only Exist on the Map</h2><p>To make this concrete, let’s look at three countries where every provider in our dataset turned out to be virtual: <strong>Bahamas</strong>, and <strong>Somalia</strong>.</p><h3 id="bahamas-all-inclusive-hosted-in-the-us">Bahamas: All-Inclusive, Hosted in the US</h3><p>In our measurements, five providers offered locations labeled as “Bahamas”: NordVPN, ExpressVPN, Private Internet Access, FastVPN, and IPVanish.</p><p>For all of them, measured traffic was in the United States, usually with sub-millisecond RTT to US probes.</p>

But other IP data providers don’t run active RTT tests. They rely on self-declared IP data sources, and often assume that if an IP is tagged as “Country X,” it must actually be there.</p><p>In these cases, the IP legacy datasets typically “follow” the VPN provider’s story: if the VPN markets the endpoint as Country X, the legacy IP dataset also places it in Country X.</p><p>To quantify that, we looked at 736 VPN exits where ProbeNet’s measured country disagreed with one or more widely used legacy IP datasets.</p><p>We then compared the country IPinfo's ProbeNet measured (backed by RTT and routing) with the country reported by these other IP datasets and computed the distance between them.

There are technical reasons to use virtual or hubbed infrastructure:</p><ul><li><strong>Risk &amp; regulation.</strong> Hosting in certain countries can expose both the provider and users to local surveillance or seizure.</li><li><strong>Infrastructure quality.</strong> Some regions simply don’t have the same density of reliable data centers or high-capacity internet links, so running servers there is harder and riskier.</li><li><strong>Performance &amp; cost.</strong> Serving “Bahamas” from Miami or “Cambodia” from Singapore can be cheaper, faster, and easier to maintain.</li></ul><p>From this perspective, a virtual location can be a reasonable compromise: you get a regional IP and content unblocking without the downsides of hosting in a fragile environment.</p><h3 id="where-it-becomes-a-trust-problem">Where It Becomes a Trust Problem</h3><p>Three things change the picture:</p><ul><li><strong>Lack of disclosure. </strong>Marking something clearly as “Virtual Bahamas (US-based)” is transparent. Listing “Bahamas” alongside “Germany” without any hint that one is virtual and the other is physical blurs the line between marketing and reality.</li><li><strong>Scale of the mismatch. </strong>It’s one thing to have a few virtual locations in hard-to-host places. It’s another when dozens of countries exist only as labels across your entire footprint, or when more than half of your tested locations are actually somewhere else.</li><li><strong>Downstream reliance. </strong>Journalists, activists, and NGOs may pick locations based on safety assumptions. Fraud systems, compliance workflows, and geo-restricted services may treat “Somalia” vs “France” as a meaningful difference. If both the VPN UI and the IP data say “Somalia” while the traffic is physically in France, everyone is making decisions on a false premise.</li></ul><p>That last point leads directly into the IP data problem that we are focused on solving.</p><h2 id="so-how-much-should-you-trust-your-vpn">So How Much Should You Trust Your VPN?</h2><p>If you’re a VPN user, here are some practical takeaways from this work:</p><ul><li><strong>Treat “100+ countries” as a marketing number, not a guarantee. </strong>In our sample, 97 countries existed only as claims, not reality, across 17 providers.</li><li><strong>Check how your provider talks about locations. </strong>Do they clearly label “virtual” servers?

Or do they quietly mix virtual and physical locations in one long list?</li><li><strong>If you rely on IP data professionally, ask where it comes from. </strong>A static “99.x% accurate worldwide” claim doesn’t tell you how an IP data provider handles fast-moving, high-stakes environments like VPN infrastructure.</li></ul><p>Ultimately, this isn’t an argument against VPNs, or even against virtual locations. It’s an argument for honesty and evidence. If a VPN provider wants you to trust that map of flags, they should be willing, and able, to show that it matches the real network underneath.</p><h2 id="how-ipinfo-approaches-ip-data-differently">How IPinfo Approaches IP Data Differently</h2><p>Most legacy IP data providers rely on regional internet registry (RIR) allocation data and heuristics around routing and address blocks. These providers will often accept self-declared data like customer feedback, corrections, and geofeeds, without a clear way to verify them.&nbsp;</p><p>IPinfo takes a measurement-first approach:</p><ol><li><strong>Proprietary ProbeNet with 1,200+ points of presence</strong><br>We maintain an internet measurement platform of PoPs in locations around the world.</li><li><strong>Active measurements</strong><br>For each visible IP on the internet, including both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, we measure RTT from multiple probes.</li><li><strong>Evidence-based geolocation</strong><br>We combine these measurements with IPinfo’s other signals to assign a country (and more granular location) that’s grounded in how the internet actually behaves.</li></ol><p>This measurement-first approach is unique in the IP data space. Once we realized how much inaccuracy came from self-declared data, we started investing heavily in research and building ProbeNet to use active measurements at scale. Our goal is to make IP data as evidence-based as possible, verifying with observation on how the internet actually behaves.</p><h2 id="our-methodology-for-this-report">Our Methodology for This Report</h2><p>We approached this VPN investigation the way a skeptical but well-equipped user would: start from the VPNs’ own claims, then test them.</p><h3 id="step-1-collecting-what-providers-say">Step 1: Collecting What Providers Say</h3><p>For each of the <strong>20 VPN providers</strong>, we pulled together three kinds of data:</p><ul><li><strong>Marketing promises: </strong>The “servers in X countries” claims and country lists from their websites. When a country was clearly listed there, we treated it as the locations they actively promote.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Configurations and locations lists: </strong>Configurations from different protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard were collected along with location information available on provider command-line tools, mobile applications, or APIs.</li><li><strong>Unique provider–location entries: </strong>We ended up with over 6,000,000 data points and a list of provider + location combinations we could actually try to connect to with multiple IPs each.</li></ul><h3 id="step-2-observing-where-the-traffic-really-goes">Step 2: Observing Where the Traffic Really Goes</h3><p>Next, we used IPinfo infrastructure and ProbeNet to dial into those locations and watch what actually happens:</p><ul><li>We connected to each VPN “location” and captured the exit IP addresses.</li><li>For each exit IP address, we used IPinfo + ProbeNet’s active measurements to determine a measured country, plus:<ul><li>The nearest ProbeNet vantage point (e.g., US, Brazil, France)</li><li>The round-trip time (RTT) from that probe (often under 1 ms), which is a strong hint about physical proximity</li></ul></li></ul><p>Now we had two views for each location:</p><ul><li><strong>Expected/Claimed country</strong>: What the VPN claims in its UI/configs/website</li><li><strong>Measured country</strong>: Where IPinfo + ProbeNet actually see the exit IP</li></ul><h3 id="step-3-comparing-claims-vs-reality">Step 3: Comparing Claims vs Reality</h3><p>For each location where a country was clearly specified, we asked a very simple question: Does the expected country match the measured country?</p><p>If yes, we counted it as a match. If not, it became a mismatch: a location where the app says one country, but the traffic exits somewhere else.</p><h3 id="acknowledgements-limitations-and-constrains">Acknowledgements, Limitations, and Constrains</h3><p>We deliberately used a very narrow definition of “mismatch.” For a location to be counted, two things had to be true: the provider had to clearly claim a specific country (on their website, in their app, or in configs), and we had direct active measurements from ProbeNet for the exit IPs behind that location.</p><p>We ignored any locations where the marketing was ambiguous, where we hadn’t measured the exit directly, or where we only had weaker hints like hostname strings, registry data, or third-party IP databases. Those signals can be useful and true, but we wanted our numbers to be as hard-to-argue-with as possible.</p><p>The result is that the mismatch rates we show here are conservative. With a looser methodology that also leaned on those additional hints, the numbers would almost certainly be higher, not lower.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>

Van Dyke began his career performing for the troops in the second world war and proceeded to rub shoulders with the likes of Phil Silvers and Walt Disney. He had one foot in music-hall slapstick and the other in screwball comedy, and possibly splayed fingers in his midwestern hometown of Danville, Illinois.</p><p>In bridging these worlds, he perfected an outward-facing public image that was one part Stan Laurel to two parts Jimmy Stewart: a pratfalling clown who was decent and honest and smarter than he first appeared. And while he was already nearing 40 when The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mary Poppins made him an international star, the actor remained irrepressibly boyish. In 1968’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/chitty-chitty-bang-bang" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a>, he played Caractacus Potts, the madcap inventor who dreams up a flying car, while Lionel Jeffries - six months younger - played Potts’s addled and eccentric dad.</p><p>Van Dyke, by and large, has steered clear of dark films. He famously turned down the lead role in The Omen and insists that he mostly played a version of himself. “Wholesome,” he says. “An all-round good boy.” That’s true so far as it goes, although it’s probably only half the story, because Van Dyke’s interpretation conveniently sidesteps a 25-year struggle with alcoholism that spanned his professional heyday. Possibly it also glosses over the air of dancing mischief – even wildness – that animates his most feted, family-friendly performances.</p><figure id="cc826a94-2386-46e8-89cf-4c94a7d23457" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-4"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Sparring mutual respect … Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke in The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961)." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38f194ab146eb921724a564f5323e2535b15ab57/0_445_2436_2700/master/2436.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="493.2266009852217" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Sparring mutual respect … Mary Tyler Moore and Dick Van Dyke in The Dick Van Dyke Show (1961). </span> Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Or to put it more bluntly, Van Dyke may have been mainstream but he never once felt conservative, nor even cosy, exactly.

The evidence suggests that Bert isn’t cockney at all. He’s a spooky nature spirit, antic and mercurial, who is gamely attempting to pass himself off as a local.</p><figure id="d044bd79-0ffb-4f26-96c9-0ce0eaf31e72" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement"><div id="img-5"><picture><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1300px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=880&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1300px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 1140px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=800&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 1140px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 980px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=640&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 980px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 660px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=620&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 660px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=605&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 480px)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px) and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.25), (min-width: 320px) and (min-resolution: 120dpi)"><source srcset="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" media="(min-width: 320px)"><img alt="Campaigning for Bernie Sanders, 2020." src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/439b4bf60dc8bff6915613b026900f4f9f8cd8a0/0_0_5000_3333/master/5000.jpg?width=445&amp;dpr=1&amp;s=none&amp;crop=none" width="445" height="296.637" loading="lazy"></picture></div><figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline"><span><svg width="18" height="13" viewBox="0 0 18 13"><path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"></path></svg></span><span>Campaigning for Bernie Sanders, 2020.</span> Photograph: Étienne Laurent/EPA</figcaption></figure><p>Van Dyke is 100 and therefore no longer looks like Peter Pan. He looks, if anything, the platonic ideal of old age, with laughter lines and a thick white beard, the weathered embodiment of a life well lived. In his later years, he has grown used to people asking him for health advice, to the point where he even sat down and listed it all in a book (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/28/well/dick-van-dyke-health-habits.html" data-link-name="in body link">100 Rules for Living to 100</a>).</p><figure id="f508b87a-40e0-4d8b-8418-a57b479d78cc" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:13,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Porpoises rescue Dick Van Dyke&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;f508b87a-40e0-4d8b-8418-a57b479d78cc&quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/nov/11/dick-van-dyke-porpoises-rescue&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;design&quot;:10,&quot;display&quot;:2,&quot;theme&quot;:3}}"></gu-island></figure><p>The man is too self-aware to present himself as a paragon of good living. Instead he credits his longevity to a sprinkle of everyday magic – a combination of good genes, solid friendships and a positive mental outlook. “My life has been a magnificent indulgence,” he says. “I’ve been able to do what I love and share it with the world.”</p><p>It’s an arrangement that has sustained him for a full century on the planet. It’s fuelled a career so rewarding and fun that it barely felt like work at all. Van Dyke started out as showbusiness’s gawky gatecrasher, a controlled explosion of elastic limbs and rubber-faced double-takes, before maturing by degrees into Hollywood’s twinkling Father Time. He is ancient but evergreen, feted and cherished. And he’s altogether as lucky as lucky can be.</p></div></div>]]></description>

                                        <p><span data-contrast="none">A report from energy think tank Ember details how cost reductions in battery storage technology are enabling dispatchable solar power to compete with conventional power sources.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ember’s assessment draws on data from recent auctions across international markets, including Italy, Saudi Arabia, and India, supplemented by expert interviews conducted in October 2025. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This research indicates the industry is moving into a new environment where scaling of manufacturing capacity and competition have pushed costs down. The cost of core BESS equipment fell by 40% in 2024 compared with 2023, according to BloombergNEF’s global benchmark, reaching a record low of $165 per kWh. </span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ember’s October 2025 data said a further large fall in 2025 is on track. Over the last 10 years, installed costs have fallen by 20% per year on average, while deployment has increased by around 80% per year.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">According to the findings, the all-in capital expenditure for building a large, long-duration utility-scale battery energy storage system&nbsp;project in global markets outside of the U.S. and China is now approximately $125 per kWh. This figure reflects project pricing, comprising $75 per kWh for core equipment sourced from China, including battery enclosures, the power conversion system (PCS), and energy management system (EMS) and $50 per kWh for local installation, engineering, and grid connection activities.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">These capital costs translate into a levelized cost of storage (LCOS) of $65 per MWh. This LCOS reflects the cost of shifting electricity to a different time period.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_126618"><img decoding="async" src="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Ember121.png" alt="" width="706" height="474" srcset="https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Ember121.png 1132w, https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/Ember121-600x403.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px"><figcaption><i> Image: Ember </i> </figcaption></figure>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ember said this reduction in LCOS is driven by equipment costs and improved performance metrics, such as a 20-year design life for LFP technology, 90% efficiency, and lower project financing costs due to de-risked revenue models. Longer lifetimes, higher efficiency, and lower project risks reduce the LCOS by 35% even before accounting for the falling equipment prices, said the report.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The core implication of this analysis is the economic viability of dispatchable solar. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Storing 50% of a day’s solar output to meet night-time demand adds $33 per MWh to the generation cost. Using the 2024 global average solar price of $43 per MWh, the total cost for dispatchable solar is calculated at $76 per MWh. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">This positions dispatchable solar as a cost-effective alternative to new gas power plants, particularly in regions reliant on imported LNG.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">For the U.S., core equipment costs can reach $100 per kWh or higher in markets with higher tariffs or stricter standards. With the U.S. market facing various tariffs on Chinese imports and domestic content requirements via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), the $125 per kWh BESS project capex estimate is not directly applicable to the U.S. market. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">The total equipment costs are 10% to 15% cheaper for four-hour projects, a key project duration in the U.S., as some components are sized to power rather than energy. However, even with cost variations, the U.S. is the second biggest BESS market globally, behind China, and saw record growth in Q1 2025 across all segments. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">In 2024, Texas, California, Arizona, and Nevada all saw significant utility-scale battery growth, with the U.S. adding 10 GW of utility-scale batteries nationally, an 80% increase over the previous year. This growth is accelerating the integration of solar into the grid.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="none">Ember’s conclusion is that solar has evolved beyond daytime electricity; coupled with storage, it becomes dispatchable, anytime power, positioned to meet a substantial portion of the world’s future energy needs.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:0,&quot;335551620&quot;:0,&quot;335557856&quot;:1577488,&quot;335559738&quot;:240,&quot;335559739&quot;:240,&quot;335559740&quot;:360}">&nbsp;</span></p>

This year it felt like the puzzles were already demanding that toolbox while I was still building it.</p><p>That turned out to be a perfect setup for learning a new language.</p><h2 id="why-gleam-felt-like-a-good-aoc-language">Why Gleam felt like a good AoC language<a href="#why-gleam-felt-like-a-good-aoc-language" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Gleam is easy to like quickly.</p><p>The syntax is clean. The compiler is helpful, and the error messages are super duper good. Rust good.</p><p>Most importantly, the language strongly nudges you into a style that fits Advent of Code really well. Parse some text. Transform it a few times. Fold. Repeat.</p><p>Also, pipes. Pipes everywhere. I love pipes.</p><p>One thing I did not expect was how good the editor experience would be. The LSP worked much better than I expected. It basically worked perfectly the whole time. I used the Gleam extension for IntelliJ and it was great.</p><p><a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25254-gleam-language">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/25254-gleam-language</a></p><p>I also just like FP.</p><p>FP is not always easier, but it is often easier. When it clicks, you stop writing instructions and you start describing the solution.</p><h2 id="the-first-gleam-superpower-echo">The first Gleam superpower: <code>echo</code><a href="#the-first-gleam-superpower-echo" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>The first thing I fell in love with was <code>echo</code>.</p><p>It is basically a print statement that does not make you earn it. You can <code>echo</code> any value. You do not have to format anything. You do not have to build a string. You can just drop it into a pipeline and keep going.</p><p>This is the kind of thing I mean:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span>list<span>.</span><span>range</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>5</span>)
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> <span>echo</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> list<span>.</span><span>map</span>(int<span>.</span>to_string)
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> <span>echo</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You can quickly inspect values at multiple points without breaking the flow.</p><p>I did miss string interpolation, especially early on. <code>echo</code> made up for a lot of that.</p><p>It mostly hit when I needed to generate text, not when I needed to inspect values. The day where I generated an LP file for <code>glpsol</code> is the best example. It is not hard code, but it is a lot of string building. Without interpolation it turns into a bit of a mess of <code>&lt;&gt;</code>s.</p><p>This is a small excerpt from my LP generator:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span><span>"Minimize</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;&gt; <span>"  total: "</span>
</span></span><span><span>&lt;&gt; buttons
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> string<span>.</span><span>join</span>(<span>" + "</span>)
</span></span><span><span>&lt;&gt; <span>"</span><span>\n\n</span><span>Subject To</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It works. It is just the kind of code where you really feel missing interpolation.</p><h2 id="options-everywhere-and-why-that-matters-for-grid-puzzles">Options everywhere, and why that matters for grid puzzles<a href="#options-everywhere-and-why-that-matters-for-grid-puzzles" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>A lot of AoC is grids.</p><p>Grids are where you normally either crash into out of bounds bugs, or you litter your code with bounds checks you do not care about.</p><p>In my day 4 solution I used a dict as a grid. The key ergonomic part is that <code>dict.get</code> gives you an option-like result, which makes neighbour checking safe by default.</p><p>This is the neighbour function from my solution:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span><span>fn</span> <span>get_neighbours</span>(grid<span>:</span> <span>Grid</span>(<span>Object</span>), pos<span>:</span> <span>Position</span>) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>List</span>(<span>Object</span>) {

</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That last line is the whole point.</p><p>No bounds checks. No sentinel values. Out of bounds just disappears.</p><p>I expected to write parsers and helpers, and I did. What I did not expect was how often Gleam already had the exact list function I needed.</p><h3 id="listtranspose-saved-a-whole-day"><code>list.transpose</code> saved a whole day<a href="#listtranspose-saved-a-whole-day" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>Day 6 part 1 was basically a transpose problem in disguise.</p><p>I read the input, chunked it into rows, transposed it, and suddenly the rest of the puzzle became obvious.</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span>input
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> list<span>.</span>transpose

In Gleam it is already there.</p><h3 id="listcombination_pairs-is-a-cheat-code"><code>list.combination_pairs</code> is a cheat code<a href="#listcombination_pairs-is-a-cheat-code" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>Another example is <code>list.combination_pairs</code>.</p><p>In day 8 I needed all pairs of 3D points. In an imperative language you would probably write nested loops and then question your off by one logic.</p><p>In Gleam it is a one liner:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span>boxes
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> list<span>.</span>combination_pairs
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sometimes FP is not about being clever. It is about having the right function name.</p><h2 id="fold_until-is-my-favorite-thing-i-found"><code>fold_until</code> is my favorite thing I found<a href="#fold_until-is-my-favorite-thing-i-found" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>If I had to pick one feature that made me want to keep writing Gleam after AoC, it is <code>fold_until</code>.</p><p>Early exit without hacks is fantastic in puzzles.</p><p>In day 8 part 2 I kept merging sets until the first set in the list contained all boxes. When that happens, I stop.</p><p>The core shape looks like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> list<span>.</span><span>fold_until</span>(initial, <span>fn</span>(acc, pair) {
</span></span><span><span>  <span>case</span> done_yet {

</span></span><span><span>    <span>False</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Continue</span>(new_acc)
</span></span><span><span>  }
</span></span><span><span>})
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is small, explicit, and it reads like intent.</p><p>I also used <code>fold_until</code> in day 10 part 1 to find the smallest combination size that works.</p><h2 id="where-gleam-fought-me-a-bit">Where Gleam fought me a bit<a href="#where-gleam-fought-me-a-bit" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Even though I enjoyed Gleam a lot, I did hit a few recurring friction points.</p><p>None of these are deal breakers. They are just the kind of things you notice when you do 24 parts in a row.</p><h3 id="file-io-is-not-in-the-standard-library">File IO is not in the standard library<a href="#file-io-is-not-in-the-standard-library" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>This one surprised me on day 1.</p><p>For AoC you read a file every day. In this repo I used <code>simplifile</code> everywhere because you need something. It is fine, I just did not expect basic file IO to be outside the standard library.</p><h3 id="regex-is-a-dependency-too">Regex is a dependency too<a href="#regex-is-a-dependency-too" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>Day 2 part 2 pushed me into regex and I had to add <code>gleam_regexp</code>.</p><p>This is the style I used, building a regex from a substring:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span><span>let</span> <span>assert</span> <span>Ok</span>(re) <span>=</span> regexp<span>.</span><span>from_string</span>(<span>"^("</span> &lt;&gt; substring &lt;&gt; <span>")+$"</span>)
</span></span><span><span>regexp<span>.</span><span>check</span>(re, val)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Again, totally fine. It just surprised me.</p><h3 id="list-pattern-matching-limitations">List pattern matching limitations<a href="#list-pattern-matching-limitations" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>You can do <code>[first, ..rest]</code> and you can do <code>[first, second]</code>.</p><p>But you cannot do <code>[first, ..middle, last]</code>.</p><p>It is not the end of the world, but it would have made some parsing cleaner.</p><h3 id="comparisons-are-explicit">Comparisons are explicit<a href="#comparisons-are-explicit" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h3><p>In Gleam a lot of comparisons are not booleans. You get an <code>order</code> value.</p><p>This is great for sorting. It is also very explicit. It can be a bit verbose when you just want an <code>&lt;=</code> check.</p><p>In day 5 I ended up writing patterns like this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span><span>case</span> cmp_start, cmp_end {
</span></span><span><span>  order<span>.</span><span>Lt</span>, _ <span>-&gt;</span> <span>False</span>

</span></span><span><span>  _, _ <span>-&gt;</span> <span>True</span>
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="big-integers-and-targeting-javascript">Big integers, and targeting JavaScript<a href="#big-integers-and-targeting-javascript" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>I used <code>bigi</code> a few times this year.</p><p>On the Erlang VM, integers are arbitrary precision, so you usually do not care about overflow. That is one of the nicest things about the BEAM.</p><p>If you want your Gleam code to also target JavaScript, you do care. JavaScript has limits, and suddenly using <code>bigi</code> becomes necessary for some puzzles.</p><p>I wish that was just part of <code>Int</code>, with a single consistent story across targets.</p><h2 id="the-most-satisfying-part-xor-as-bitmasks">The most satisfying part: XOR as bitmasks<a href="#the-most-satisfying-part-xor-as-bitmasks" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Day 10 part 1 was my favorite part of the whole event.</p><p>The moment I saw the toggling behavior, it clicked as XOR. Represent the lights as a number. Represent each button as a bitmask. Find the smallest combination of bitmasks that XOR to the target.</p><p>This is the fold from my solution:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span>combination
</span></span><span><span><span>|&gt;</span> list<span>.</span><span>fold</span>(<span>0</span>, <span>fn</span>(acc, comb) {

It was clearly a system of linear equations.</p><p>In previous years I would reach for Z3, but there are no Z3 bindings for Gleam. I tried to stay in Gleam, and I ended up generating an LP file and shelling out to <code>glpsol</code> using <code>shellout</code>.</p><p>It worked, and honestly the LP format is beautiful.</p><p>Here is the call:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span><span>let</span> _ <span>=</span>
</span></span><span><span>  shellout<span>.</span><span>command</span>(
</span></span><span><span>    <span>"glpsol"</span>,

</span></span><span><span>    <span>"."</span>,
</span></span><span><span>    [],
</span></span><span><span>  )
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It is a hack, but it is a pragmatic hack, and that is also part of Advent of Code.</p><h2 id="memoization-keys-that-actually-model-the-problem">Memoization keys that actually model the problem<a href="#memoization-keys-that-actually-model-the-problem" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>Day 11 part 2 is where I was happy I was writing Gleam.</p><p>The important detail was that the memo key is not just the node. It is the node plus your state.</p><p>In my case the key was:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span>#(neighbour, new_seen_dac, new_seen_fft)

It just felt like it relied on assumptions about the input, and I am one of those people that does not love doing that.</p><p>I overthought it for a bit, then I learned it was more of a troll problem. The “do the areas of the pieces, when fully interlocked, fit on the board” heuristic was enough.</p><p>In my solution it is literally this:</p><div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="gleam"><span><span>heuristic_area <span>&lt;=</span> max_area
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Sometimes you build a beautiful mental model and then the right answer is a single inequality.</p><h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing thoughts<a href="#closing-thoughts" arialabel="Anchor">#</a></h2><p>I am very happy I picked Gleam this year.</p><p>It has sharp edges, mostly around where the standard library draws the line and a few language constraints that show up in puzzle code. But it also has real strengths.</p><p>Pipelines feel good. Options and Results make unsafe problems feel safe. The list toolbox is better than I expected. <code>fold_until</code> is incredible. Once you stop trying to write loops and you let it be functional, the solutions start to feel clearer.</p><p>I cannot wait to try Gleam in a real project. I have been thinking about using it to write a webserver, and I am genuinely excited to give it a go.</p><p>And of course, I cannot wait for next year’s Advent of Code.</p><p>If you want to look at the source for all 12 days, it is here:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/tymscar/Advent-Of-Code/tree/master/2025/gleam/aoc/src">https://github.com/tymscar/Advent-Of-Code/tree/master/2025/gleam/aoc/src</a></p></div></div>]]></description>

The main work is translating the UI templates into idiomatic SvelteKit while maintaining the original styling. This includes things like using semantic HTML instead of div-spamming, not wrapping divs in divs in divs, and replacing bootstrap with minimal tailwind. It also includes some logic refactors, to maintain the original functionality but rewritten to avoid years of code debt. Things like replacing templates using boolean flags for multiple views with composable Svelte components.</p><p>I've had a fairly steady process for doing this: look at each route defined in Django, build out my `+page.server.ts`, and then split each major section of the page into a Svelte component with a matching Storybook story. It takes a lot of time to do this, since I have to ensure I'm not just copying the template but rather recreating it in a more idiomatic style.</p><p>This kind of work seems like a great use case for AI assisted programming, but I've failed to use it effectively. At most, I can only get Claude Code to recreate some slightly less spaghetti code in Svelte. Simple prompting just isn't able to get AI's code quality within 90% of what I'd write by hand. Ideally, AI could get it's code to something I could review manually in 15-20 minutes, which would massively speed up the time spent on this project (right now it takes me 1-2 hours to properly translate a route).</p><p>Do you guys have tips or suggestions on how to improve my efficiency and code quality with AI?</p></div></td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr></tbody></table><br>
