<p>Movie companies have lost a third attempt to unmask Reddit users who posted comments discussing piracy. In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.423189/gov.uscourts.cand.423189.26.0.pdf">order</a> on Wednesday, the US District Court for the Northern District of California rejected movie copyright holders' demand for seven years' worth of "IP address log information" on six Reddit users.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.423189/gov.uscourts.cand.423189.1.0.pdf">motion to compel</a> that was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/film-studios-demand-ip-addresses-of-people-who-discussed-piracy-on-reddit/">filed last month</a>, movie companies Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures argued that "Reddit users do not have a recognized privacy interest in their IP addresses." But in Wednesday's ruling, US Magistrate Judge Thomas Hixson said, "The Court finds no reason to believe provision of an IP address is not unmasking subject to First Amendment scrutiny."</p>
<p>Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures previously sued the Internet service provider Frontier Communications, alleging that it is liable for its users' copyright infringement. Seeking evidence for that case, the movie companies subpoenaed Reddit in an attempt to prove that Frontier has no meaningful policy for terminating repeat copyright infringers and that this lack of enforcement drew customers to Frontier's service.</p>
<p>"Reddit argues the Court should deny the motion because it is an unmasking subpoena, targeting a potential witness rather than a potential defendant, and is therefore subjected to First Amendment scrutiny," Hixson's order noted. Reddit also argued that the evidence sought by movie companies can be obtained instead from Frontier and from Frontier subscribers.</p>
<p>Hixson's order, which was <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/reddit-doesnt-have-to-share-ip-addresses-of-piracy-commenters-court-rules-240208/">previously reported</a> by Torrent Freak, said that courts use a "higher standard for unmasking a non-party witness" than for potential defendants because "litigation can often continue without interfering with a non-party witness's First Amendment right to anonymity."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Reddit can protect First Amendment rights of users</h2>
<p>The ruling is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/judge-wont-force-reddit-to-identify-anonymous-users-who-discussed-piracy/">similar to previous</a> ones in which the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/reddit-beats-film-industry-wont-have-to-identify-users-who-admitted-torrenting/">same court denied</a> movie-industry attempts to unmask Reddit users. The fact that movie companies only sought IP addresses instead of names this time around wasn't enough to sway the court.</p>
<p>The previous cases are being called <em>Reddit I</em> and <em>Reddit II</em>. Voltage Holdings was one of the copyright holders involved in <em>Reddit I</em>, while both Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures were involved in <em>Reddit II</em>.</p>
<p>Hixson referred to the prior cases in this week's ruling, saying the third is similar in part because the "court adjudicating the copyright litigation has already ruled [the movie companies] can obtain identifying information from Frontier for IP addresses known to have pirated using Frontier's network." As in the previous cases, the movie companies "cannot show that the information they seek here is unavailable from other sources," Hixson wrote.</p>
<p>Voltage Holdings and Screen Media Ventures cited Reddit posts in which users say that Frontier didn't terminate their Internet service despite sending many copyright infringement notices about torrent downloads. One of the users wrote, "I got a total of 44 emails from frontier about downloading torrents and that it could terminate service. They haven't yet. And I kinda feel like if they didn't do it after 44 emails. That they won't… ."</p>
<p>The movie companies argued that getting these Reddit users' IP addresses is relevant and proportional to the needs of the case because the comments support the allegation "that the ability to pirate content efficiently without any consequences is a draw for becoming a Frontier subscriber... and that Frontier does not have an effective policy for terminating repeat infringers."</p>
<p>But Reddit has the right to refuse to provide that information, Hixson decided. "The Ninth Circuit has recognized that Internet platforms can assert the First Amendment rights of their users, based on the close relationship between the platform and its users and the 'genuine obstacles' users face in asserting their rights to anonymity," Hixson wrote.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nearly six years ago I wrote a blog post outlining <a href="https://pace.dev/blog/2018/05/09/how-I-write-http-services-after-eight-years.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how I write HTTP services in Go</a>, and I’m here to tell you, once again, how I write HTTP services.</p><p>That original post went a little viral and sparked some great discussions that have influenced how I do things today. And after years of hosting the <a href="https://changelog.com/gotime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Go Time podcast</a>, discussing Go on <a href="https://twitter.com/matryer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, and gaining more experience maintaining code like this over years, I thought it was time for a refresh.</p><p>(And for those pedants who notice Go isn’t exactly 13 years old, I started writing HTTP services in Go <a href="https://go.dev/doc/devel/pre_go1#r59" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version .r59</a>.)</p><p>This post covers a range of topics related to building services in Go, including:</p><ul><li>Structuring servers and handlers for maximum maintainability&nbsp;</li><li>Tips and tricks for optimizing for a quick startup and graceful shutdown&nbsp;</li><li>How to handle common work that applies to many types of requests</li><li>Going deep on properly testing your services&nbsp;</li></ul><p>From small projects to large, these practices have stood the test of time for me, and I hope they will for you too.</p><h2 id="who-is-this-post-for">Who is this post for?</h2><p>This post is for you. It’s for everybody who plans to write some kind of HTTP service in Go. You may also find this useful if you’re learning Go, as lots of the examples follow good practices. Experienced gophers might also pick up some nice patterns.</p><p>To find this post most useful, you’ll need to know the basics of Go. If you don’t feel like you’re quite there yet, I cannot recommend <a href="https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn Go with tests</a> by Chris James enough. And if you’d like to hear more from Chris, you can check out the episode of Go Time we did with Ben Johnson on <a href="https://changelog.com/gotime/278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The files and folders of Go projects</a>.</p><p>If you’re familiar with the previous versions of this post, this section contains a quick summary of what’s different now. If you’d like to start from the beginning, skip to the next section.</p><ol><li>My handlers used to be methods hanging off a server struct, but I no longer do this. If a handler function wants a dependency, it can bloody well ask for it as an argument. No more surprise dependencies when you’re just trying to test a single handler.</li><li>I used to prefer <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> over <code>http.Handler</code> — enough third-party libraries think about <code>http.Handler</code> first that it makes sense to embrace that. <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> is still extremely useful, but now most things are represented as the interface type. It doesn’t make much difference either way.</li><li>I’ve added more about testing including some Opinions™.</li><li>I’ve added more sections, so a full read through is recommended for everybody.</li></ol><h2 id="the-newserver-constructor">The <code>NewServer</code> constructor</h2><p>Let’s start by looking at the backbone of any Go service: the server. The&nbsp; <code>NewServer</code> function makes the main <code>http.Handler</code>. Usually I have one per service, and I rely on HTTP routes to divert traffic to the right handlers within each service because:</p><ul><li><code>NewServer</code> is a big constructor that takes in all dependencies as arguments</li><li>It returns an <code>http.Handler</code> if possible, which can be a dedicated type for more complex situations</li><li>It usually configures its own muxer and calls out to <code>routes.go</code></li></ul><p>For example, your code might look similar to this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func NewServer(
	logger *Logger
	config *Config
	commentStore *commentStore
	anotherStore *anotherStore
) http.Handler {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	addRoutes(
		mux,
		Logger,
		Config,
		commentStore,
		anotherStore,
	)
	var handler http.Handler = mux
	handler = someMiddleware(handler)
	handler = someMiddleware2(handler)
	handler = someMiddleware3(handler)
	return handler
}</code></pre></div><p>In test cases that don’t need all of the dependencies, I pass in <code>nil</code> as a signal that it won’t be used.</p><p>The <code>NewServer</code> constructor is responsible for all the top-level HTTP stuff that applies to all endpoints, like CORS, auth middleware, and logging:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>var handler http.Handler = mux
handler = logging.NewLoggingMiddleware(logger, handler)
handler = logging.NewGoogleTraceIDMiddleware(logger, handler)
handler = checkAuthHeaders(handler)
return handler</code></pre></div><p>Setting up the server is usually a case of exposing it using Go’s built-in <code>http</code> package:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>srv := NewServer(
	logger,
	config,
	tenantsStore,
	slackLinkStore,
	msteamsLinkStore,
	proxy,
)
httpServer := &amp;http.Server{
	Addr:    net.JoinHostPort(config.Host, config.Port),
	Handler: srv,
}
go func() {
	log.Printf("listening on %s\n", httpServer.Addr)
	if err := httpServer.ListenAndServe(); err != nil &amp;&amp; err != http.ErrServerClosed {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error listening and serving: %s\n", err)
	}
}()
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
	defer wg.Done()
	&lt;-ctx.Done()
	if err := httpServer.Shutdown(ctx); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "error shutting down http server: %s\n", err)
	}
}()
wg.Wait()
return nil</code></pre></div><h3 id="long-argument-lists">Long argument lists</h3><p>There must be a limit at which point it stops being the right thing to do, but most of the time I am happy adding lists of dependencies as arguments. And while they do sometimes get quite long, I find it’s still worth it.</p><p>Yes, it saves me from making a struct, but the real benefit is that I get slightly more type safety from arguments. I can make a struct skipping any fields that I don’t like, but a function forces my hand. I have to look up fields to know how to set them in a struct, whereas I can’t call a function if I don’t pass the right arguments.</p><p>It’s not so bad if you format it as a vertical list, like I’ve seen in modern frontend code:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>srv := NewServer(
	logger,
	config,
	tenantsStore,
	commentsStore,
	conversationService,
	chatGPTService,
)</code></pre></div><h2 id="map-the-entire-api-surface-in-routesgo">Map the entire API surface in <code>routes.go</code></h2><p>This file is the one place in your service where all routes are listed.</p><p>Sometimes you can’t help but have things spread around a bit, but it’s very helpful to be able to go to one file in every project to see its API surface.</p><p>Because of the big dependency argument lists in the <code>NewServer</code> constructor, you usually end up with the same list in your routes function. But again, it’s not so bad. And again, you soon know if you forgot something or got the order wrong thanks to Go’s type checking.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func addRoutes(
	mux                 *http.ServeMux,
	logger              *logging.Logger,
	config              Config,
	tenantsStore        *TenantsStore,
	commentsStore       *CommentsStore,
	conversationService *ConversationService,
	chatGPTService      *ChatGPTService,
	authProxy           *authProxy
) {
	mux.Handle("/api/v1/", handleTenantsGet(logger, tenantsStore))
	mux.Handle("/oauth2/", handleOAuth2Proxy(logger, authProxy))
	mux.HandleFunc("/healthz", handleHealthzPlease(logger))
	mux.Handle("/", http.NotFoundHandler())
}</code></pre></div><p>In my example, <code>addRoutes</code> doesn’t return an error. Anything that can throw an error is moved to the <code>run</code> function and sorted out before it gets to this point leaving this function free to remain simple and flat. Of course, if any of your handlers do return errors for whatever reason, then fine, this can return an error too.</p><h2 id="func-main-only-calls-run"><code>func main()</code> only calls <code>run()</code></h2><p>The <code>run</code> function is like the <code>main</code> function, except that it takes in operating system fundamentals as arguments, and returns, you guessed it, an error.</p><p>I wish <code>func main()</code> was <code>func main() error</code>. Or like in C where you can return the exit code: <code>func main() int</code>. By having an ultra simple main function, you too can have your dreams come true:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func run(ctx context.Context, w io.Writer, args []string) error {
	// ...
}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := signal.NotifyContext(ctx, os.Interrupt)
	defer cancel()
	if err := run(ctx, os.Stdout, os.Args); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>The code above creates a context, which is cancelled by <code>Ctrl+C</code> or equivalent, and calls down to the <code>run</code> function. If <code>run</code> returns <code>nil</code>, the function exits normally. If it returns an error, we write it to stderr and exit with a non-zero code. If I’m writing a command line tool where exit codes matter, I would return an int as well so I could write tests to assert the right one was returned.</p><p>Operating system fundamentals are passed into run as arguments. For example, you might pass in <code>os.Args</code> if it has flag support, and even <code>os.Stdin</code>, <code>os.Stdout</code>, <code>os.Stderr</code> dependencies. This makes your programs much easier to test because test code can call run to execute your program, controlling arguments, and all streams, just by passing different arguments.</p><p>The following table shows examples of input arguments to the run function:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Value</strong></th><th><strong>Type</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>os.Args</code></td><td><code>[]string</code></td><td>The arguments passed in when executing your program. It’s also used for parsing flags.</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Stdin</code></td><td><code>io.Reader</code></td><td>For reading input</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Stdout</code></td><td><code>io.Writer</code></td><td>For writing output</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Stderr</code></td><td><code>io.Writer</code></td><td>For writing error logs</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Getenv</code></td><td><code>func(string) string</code></td><td>For reading environment variables</td></tr><tr><td><code>os.Getwd</code></td><td><code>func() (string, error)</code></td><td>Get the working directory</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you keep away from any global scope data, you can usually use <code>t.Parallel()</code> in more places, to speed up your test suites. Everything is self-contained, so multiple calls to <code>run</code> don’t interfere with each other.</p><p>I often end up with <code>run</code> function signatures that look like this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func run(
	ctx    context.Context,
	args   []string,
	getenv func(string) string,
	stdin  io.Reader,
	stdout, stderr io.Writer,
) error</code></pre></div><p>Now that we’re inside the <code>run</code> function, we can go back to writing normal Go code where we can return errors like it’s nobody’s business. We gophers just love returning errors, and the sooner we admit that to ourselves, the sooner those people on the internet can win and go away.</p><h3 id="gracefully-shutting-down">Gracefully shutting down</h3><p>If you’re running lots of tests, it’s important for your program to stop when each one is finished. (Alternatively, you might decide to keep one instance running for all tests, but that’s up to you.)</p><p>The context is passed through. It gets cancelled if a termination signal comes into the program, so it’s important to respect it at every level. At the very least, pass it to your dependencies. At best, check the <code>Err()</code> method in any long-running or loopy code, and if it returns an error, stop what you’re doing and return it up. This will help the server to gracefully shut down. If you kick off other goroutines, you can also use the context to decide if it’s time to stop them or not.</p><h3 id="controlling-the-environment">Controlling the environment</h3><p>The <code>args</code> and <code>getenv</code> parameters give us a couple of ways to control how our program behaves through flags and environment variables. Flags are processed using the args (as long as you don’t use the global space version of flags, and instead use <code>flags.NewFlagSet</code> inside <code>run</code>) so we can call run with different values:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>args := []string{
	"myapp",
	"--out", outFile,
	"--fmt", "markdown",
}
go run(ctx, args, etc.)</code></pre></div><p>If your program uses environment variables over flags (or even both) then the <code>getenv</code> function allows you to plug in different values without changing the actual environment.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>getenv := func(key string) string {
	switch key {
	case "MYAPP_FORMAT":
		return "markdown"
	case "MYAPP_TIMEOUT":
		return "5s"
	default:
		return ""
}
go run(ctx, args, getenv)</code></pre></div><p>For me, using this <code>getenv</code> technique beats using <code>t.SetEnv</code> for controlling environment variables because you can continue to run your tests in parallel by calling <code>t.Parallel()</code>, which <code>t.SetEnv</code> doesn’t allow.</p><p>This technique is even more useful when writing command line tools, because you often want to run the program with different settings to test all of its behavior.</p><p>In the <code>main</code> function, we can pass in the real things:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := signal.NotifyContext(ctx, os.Interrupt)
	defer cancel()
	if err := run(ctx, os.Getenv, os.Stderr); err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%s\n", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}</code></pre></div><h2 id="maker-funcs-return-the-handler">Maker funcs return the handler</h2><p>My handler functions don’t implement <code>http.Handler</code> or <code>http.HandlerFunc</code> directly, they return them. Specifically, they return <code>http.Handler</code> types.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// handleSomething handles one of those web requests
// that you hear so much about.
func handleSomething(logger *Logger) http.Handler {
	thing := prepareThing()
	return http.HandlerFunc(
		func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
			// use thing to handle request
			logger.Info(r.Context(), "msg", "handleSomething")
		}
	)
}</code></pre></div><p>This pattern gives each handler its own closure environment. You can do initialization work in this space, and the data will be available to the handlers when they are called.</p><p>Be sure to only read the shared data. If handlers modify anything, you’ll need a mutex or something to protect it.</p><p>Storing program state here is not usually what you want. In most cloud environments, you can’t trust that code will continue running over long periods of time. Depending on your production environment, servers will often shut down to save resources, or even just crash for other reasons. There may also be many instances of your service running with requests load balanced across them in unpredictable ways. In this case, an instance would only have access to its own local data. So it’s better to use a database or some other storage API to persist data in real projects.</p><h2 id="handle-decodingencoding-in-one-place">Handle decoding/encoding in one place</h2><p>Every service will need to decode the request bodies and encode response bodies. This is a sensible abstraction that stands the test of time.</p><p>I usually have a pair of helper functions called encode and decode. An example version using generics shows you that you really are just wrapping a few basic lines, which I wouldn’t usually do, however this becomes useful when you need to make changes here for all of your APIs. (For example, say you get a new boss stuck in the 1990s and they want to add XML support.)</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func encode[T any](w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request, status int, v T) error {
	w.WriteHeader(status)
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	if err := json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(v); err != nil {
		return fmt.Errorf("encode json: %w", err)
	}
	return nil
}

func decode[T any](r *http.Request) (T, error) {
	var v T
	if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;v); err != nil {
		return v, fmt.Errorf("decode json: %w", err)
	}
	return v, nil
}</code></pre></div><p>Interestingly, the compiler is able to infer the type from the argument, so you don’t need to pass it when calling encode:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>err := encode(w, r, http.StatusOK, obj)</code></pre></div><p>But since it is a return argument in decode, you will need to specify the type you expect:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>decoded, err := decode[CreateSomethingRequest](r)</code></pre></div><p>I try not to overload these functions, but in the past I was quite pleased with a simple validation interface that fit nicely into the decode function.</p><h2 id="validating-data">Validating data</h2><p>I like a simple interface. Love them, actually. Single method interfaces are so easy to implement. So when it comes to validating objects, I like to do this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// Validator is an object that can be validated.
type Validator interface {
	// Valid checks the object and returns any
	// problems. If len(problems) == 0 then
	// the object is valid.
	Valid(ctx context.Context) (problems map[string]string)
}</code></pre></div><p>The <code>Valid</code> method takes a context (which is optional but has been useful for me in the past) and returns a map. If there is a problem with a field, its name is used as the key, and a human-readable explanation of the issue is set as the value.</p><p>The method can do whatever it needs to validate the fields of the struct. For example, it can check to make sure:</p><ul><li>Required fields are not empty</li><li>Strings with a specific format (like email) are correct</li><li>Numbers are within an acceptable range</li></ul><p>If you need to do anything more complicated, like check the field in a database, that should happen elsewhere; it’s probably too important to be considered a quick validation check, and you wouldn’t expect to find that kind of thing in a function like this, so it could easily end up being hidden away.</p><p>I then use a type assertion to see if the object implements the interface. Or, in the generic world, I might choose to be more explicit about what’s going on by changing the decode method to insist on that interface being implemented.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func decodeValid[T Validator](r *http.Request) (T, map[string]string, error) {
	var v T
	if err := json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(&amp;v); err != nil {
		return v, nil, fmt.Errorf("decode json: %w", err)
	}
	if problems := v.Valid(r.Context()); len(problems) &gt; 0 {
		return v, problems, fmt.Errorf("invalid %T: %d problems", v, len(problems))
	}
	return v, nil, nil
}</code></pre></div><p>In this code, <code>T</code> has to implement the <code>Validator</code> interface, and the <code>Valid</code> method must return zero problems in order for the object to be considered successfully decoded.</p><p>It’s safe to return <code>nil</code> for problems because we are going to check <code>len(problems)</code>, which will be <code>0</code> for a <code>nil</code> map, but which won’t panic.</p><h2 id="the-adapter-pattern-for-middleware">The adapter pattern for middleware</h2><p>Middleware functions take an <code>http.Handler</code> and return a new one that can run code before and/or after calling the original handler — or it can decide not to call the original handler at all.</p><p>An example is a check to make sure the user is an administrator:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func (s *server) adminOnly(h http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		if !currentUser(r).IsAdmin {
			http.NotFound(w, r)
			return
		}
		h(w, r)
	})
}</code></pre></div><p>The logic inside the handler can optionally decide whether to call the original handler or not. In the example above, if <code>IsAdmin</code> is false, the handler will return an <code>HTTP 404 Not Found</code> and return (or abort); notice that the <code>h</code> handler is not called. If <code>IsAdmin</code> is true, the user is allowed to access the route, and so execution is passed to the h handler.</p><p>Usually I have middleware listed in the <code>routes.go</code> file:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>package app

func addRoutes(mux *http.ServeMux) {
	mux.HandleFunc("/api/", s.handleAPI())
	mux.HandleFunc("/about", s.handleAbout())
	mux.HandleFunc("/", s.handleIndex())
	mux.HandleFunc("/admin", s.adminOnly(s.handleAdminIndex()))
}</code></pre></div><p>This makes it very clear, just by looking at the map of endpoints, which middleware is applied to which routes. If the lists start getting bigger, try splitting them across many lines — I know, I know, but you get used to it.</p><h2 id="sometimes-i-return-the-middleware">Sometimes I return the middleware</h2><p>The above approach is great for simple cases, but if the middleware needs lots of dependencies (a logger, a database, some API clients, a byte array containing the data for “Never Gonna Give You Up” for a later prank), then I have been known to have a function that returns the middleware function.</p><p>The problem is, you end up with code that looks like this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>mux.Handle("/route1", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route2", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething2(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route3", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething3(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route4", middleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll []byte, handleSomething4(handlerSpecificDeps))</code></pre></div><p>This bloats out the code and doesn’t really provide anything useful. Instead, I would have the middleware function take the dependencies, but return a function that takes only the next handler.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func newMiddleware(
	logger Logger,
	db *DB,
	slackClient *slack.Client,
	rroll []byte,
) func(h http.Handler) http.Handler</code></pre></div><p>The return type <code>func(h http.Handler) http.Handler</code> is the function that we will call when setting up our routes.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>middleware := newMiddleware(logger, db, slackClient, rroll)
mux.Handle("/route1", middleware(handleSomething(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route2", middleware(handleSomething2(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route3", middleware(handleSomething3(handlerSpecificDeps))
mux.Handle("/route4", middleware(handleSomething4(handlerSpecificDeps))</code></pre></div><p>Some people, but not I, like to formalize that function type like this:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// middleware is a function that wraps http.Handlers
// proving functionality before and after execution
// of the h handler.
type middleware func(h http.Handler) http.Handler</code></pre></div><p>This is fine. Do it if you like. I’m not going to come around to your work, wait outside for you, and then walk alongside you with my arm around your shoulders in an intimidating way, asking if you’re pleased with yourself.</p><p>The reason I don’t do it is because it gives an extra level of indirection. When you look at the <code>newMiddleware</code> function’s signature above, it’s very clear what’s going on. If the return type is middleware, you have a little extra work to do. Essentially, I optimize for reading code, not writing it.</p><h3 id="an-opportunity-to-hide-the-requestresponse-types-away">An opportunity to hide the request/response types away</h3><p>If an endpoint has its own request and response types, usually they’re only useful for that particular handler.</p><p>If that’s the case, you can define them inside the function.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func handleSomething() http.HandlerFunc {
	type request struct {
		Name string
	}
	type response struct {
		Greeting string `json:"greeting"`
	}
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		...
	}
}</code></pre></div><p>This keeps your global space clear and also prevents other handlers from relying on data you may not consider stable.</p><p>You sometimes encounter friction with this approach when your test code needs to use the same types. And to be fair, this is a good argument for breaking them out if that’s what you want to do.</p><h2 id="use-inline-requestresponse-types-for-additional-storytelling-in-tests">Use inline request/response types for additional storytelling in tests</h2><p>If your request/response types are hidden inside the handler, you can just declare new types in your test code.</p><p>This is an opportunity to do a bit of storytelling to future generations who will need to understand your code.</p><p>For example, let’s say we have a <code>Person</code> type in our code, and we reuse it on many endpoints. If we had a <code>/greet</code> endpoint, we might only care about their name, so we can express this in test code:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func TestGreet(t *testing.T) {
	is := is.New(t)
	person := struct {
		Name string `json:"name"`
	}{
		Name: "Mat Ryer",
	}
	var buf bytes.Buffer
	err := json.NewEncoder(&amp;buf).Encode(person)
	is.NoErr(err) // json.NewEncoder
	req, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodPost, "/greet", &amp;buf)
	is.NoErr(err)
	//... more test code here</code></pre></div><p>It’s clear from this test that the only field we care about is the <code>Name</code> field.</p><h2 id="synconce-to-defer-setup"><code>sync.Once</code> to defer setup</h2><p>If I have to do anything expensive when preparing the handler, I defer it until that handler is first called.</p><p>This improves application startup time.</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func (s *server) handleTemplate(files string...) http.HandlerFunc {
	var (
		init    sync.Once
		tpl     *template.Template
		tplerr  error
	)
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		init.Do(func(){
			tpl, tplerr = template.ParseFiles(files...)
		})
		if tplerr != nil {
		http.Error(w, tplerr.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}
		// use tpl
	}
}</code></pre></div><p><code>sync.Once</code> ensures the code is only executed one time, and other calls (other people making the same request) will block until it’s finished.</p><ul><li>The error check is outside of the <code>init</code> function, so if something does go wrong we still surface the error and won’t lose it in the logs</li><li>If the handler is not called, the expensive work is never done — this can have big benefits depending on how your code is deployed</li></ul><p>Remember that by doing this, you are moving the initialization time from startup to runtime (when the endpoint is first accessed). I use Google App Engine a lot, so this makes sense for me, but your case might be different, so it’s worth thinking about where and when to use <code>sync.Once</code> in this way.</p><h2 id="designing-for-testability">Designing for testability</h2><p>These patterns evolved partly because of how easy they are to test the code. The <code>run</code> function is a simple way to run your program right from test code.</p><p>You have lots of options when it comes to testing in Go, and it’s less about right and wrong, and more about:</p><ul><li>How easy is it to understand what your program does by looking at the tests?</li><li>How easy is it to change your code without worrying about breaking things?</li><li>If all your tests pass, can you push to production, or does it need to cover more things?</li></ul><h3 id="what-is-the-unit-when-unit-testing">What is the unit when unit testing?&nbsp;</h3><p>Following these patterns, the handlers themselves are also independently testable, but I tend not to do this, and I’ll explain why below. You have to consider what the best approach is for your project.</p><p>To test the handler only, you can:</p><ol><li>Call the function to get the <code>http.Handler</code> — you have to pass in all the required dependencies (this is a feature).</li><li>Call the <code>ServeHTTP</code> method on the <code>http.Handler</code> you get back using a real <code>http.Request</code> and a <code>ResponseRecorder</code> from the <code>httptest</code> package (see <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httptest#ResponseRecorder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httptest#ResponseRecorder</a>)</li><li>Make assertions about the response (check the status code, decode the body and make sure it’s right, check any important headers, etc.)</li></ol><p>If you do this, you cut out any middleware like auth, and go straight to the handler code. This is nice if there is some specific complexity you want to build some test support around. However, there’s an advantage when your test code calls APIs in the same way your users will. I err on the side of end-to-end testing at this level, rather than unit testing all the pieces inside.</p><p>I would rather call the <code>run</code> function to execute the whole program as close to how it will run in production as possible. This will parse any arguments, connect to any dependencies, migrate the database, whatever else it will do in the wild, and eventually start up the server. Then when I hit the API from my test code, I am going through all the layers and even interacting with a real database. I am also testing <code>routes.go</code> at the same time.</p><p>I find I catch more issues earlier with this approach and I can avoid specifically testing boilerplate things. It also reduces the repetition in my tests. If I diligently test every layer, I can end up saying the same things multiple times in slightly different ways. You have to maintain all of this, so if you want to change something, updating one function and three tests doesn’t feel very productive. With end-to-end tests, you just have one set of main tests that describe the interactions between your users and your system.</p><p>I still use unit tests within this where appropriate. If I used TDD (which I often do) then I usually have a lot of tests done anyway, which I’m happy to maintain. But I will go back and delete tests if they’re repeating the same thing as an end-to-end test.</p><p>This decision will depend on lots of things, from the opinions of those around you to the complexity of your project, so like all the advice in this post, don’t fight to do this if it just doesn’t work for you.</p><h3 id="testing-with-the-run-function">Testing with the run function</h3><p>I like to call the <code>run</code> function from each test. Each test gets its own self-contained instance of the program. For each test, I can pass different arguments, flag values, standard-in and -out pipes, and even environment variables.</p><p>Since the <code>run</code> function takes a <code>context.Context</code>, and since all our code respects the context (right, everyone? It respects the context, right?) We can get a cancellation function by calling <code>context.WithCancel</code>. By deferring the <code>cancel</code> function, when the test function returns (i.e., when the tests have finished running) the context will be cancelled and the program will gracefully shut down. In Go 1.14 they added the <code>t.Cleanup</code> method which is a replacement for using the <code>defer</code> keyword yourself, and if you’d like to learn more about why that is, check out this issue: <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/golang/go/issues/37333</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is all achieved in surprisingly little code. Of course, you have to keep checking <code>ctx.Err</code> or <code>ctx.Done</code> all over the place too:</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>func Test(t *testing.T) {
	ctx := context.Background()
	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(ctx)
	t.Cleanup(cancel)
	go run(ctx)
	// test code goes here</code></pre></div><h3 id="waiting-for-readiness">Waiting for readiness</h3><p>Since the <code>run</code> function executes in a goroutine, we don’t really know exactly when it’s going to start up. If we’re going to start hitting the API like real users, we are going to need to know when it’s ready.</p><p>We could set up some way of signalling readiness, like a channel or something — but I prefer to have a <code>/healthz</code> or <code>/readyz</code> endpoint running on the server. As my old grandma used to say, the proof of the pudding is in the actual HTTP requests (she was way ahead of her time).</p><p>This is an example where our efforts to make the code more testable gives us an insight into what our users will need. They probably want to know if the service is ready or not as well, so why not have an official way to find this out?</p><p>To wait for a service to be ready, you can just write a loop:&nbsp;</p><div><pre data-expanded="false"><code>// waitForReady calls the specified endpoint until it gets a 200 
// response or until the context is cancelled or the timeout is 
// reached.
func waitForReady(
	ctx context.Context, 
	timeout time.Duration, 
	endpoint string,
) error {
	client := http.Client{}
	startTime := time.Now()
	for {
		req, err := http.NewRequestWithContext(
			ctx, 
			http.MethodGet, 
			endpoint, 
			nil,
		)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to create request: %w", err)
		}

		resp, err := client.Do(req)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Printf("Error making request: %s\n", err.Error())
			continue
		}
		if resp.StatusCode == http.StatusOK {
			fmt.Println("Endpoint is ready!")
			resp.Body.Close()
			return nil
		}
		resp.Body.Close()

		select {
		case &lt;-ctx.Done():
			return ctx.Err()
		default:
			if time.Since(startTime) &gt;= timeout {
				return fmt.Errorf("timeout reached while waiting for endpoint")
			}
			// wait a little while between checks
			time.Sleep(250 * time.Millisecond)
		}
	}
}</code></pre></div><h2 id="putting-this-all-into-practice">Putting this all into practice</h2><p>Rolling simple APIs using these techniques remains my favorite way to go. It suits my aims of achieving maintainability excellence with code that’s easy to read, easy to extend by copying patterns, easy for new people to work with, easy to change without worrying, and explicitly done without any magic. This remains true even in cases where I use a code generation framework like our own <a href="https://github.com/pacedotdev/oto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oto package</a> to write the boilerplate for me based on templates that I customize.</p><p>On bigger projects or in larger organizations, especially one like Grafana Labs, you’ll often come across specific technology choices that impact these decisions. gRPC is a good example. In cases where there are established patterns and experience, or other tools or abstractions that are widely used, you will often find yourself making the pragmatic choice of going with the flow, as they say, although I suspect (or is it hope?) that there is still something useful in this post for you.</p><p>My day job is building out the new <a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/irm/">Grafana IRM</a> suite with a talented group within Grafana Labs. The patterns discussed in this post help us deliver tools that people can rely on. “Tell me more about these great tools!,” I hear you scream at your monitor.</p><p>Most people use Grafana to visualize the operation of their systems, and with Grafana Alerting they are pinged when metrics fall outside of acceptable boundaries. With Grafana OnCall, your schedules and escalation rules automate the process of reaching out to the right people when things go wrong.</p><p>Grafana Incident lets you manage those unavoidable all-hands-on-deck moments that most of us are all too familiar with. It creates the Zoom room for you to discuss the issue, a dedicated Slack channel, and tracks the timeline of events while you focus on putting out the fire. In Slack, anything you mark with the robot face emoji as a reaction in the channel will be added to the timeline. This makes it very easy to collect key events as you go along, making debrief or post-incident review discussions much easier.</p><p>Try it out in Grafana Cloud today, or get in touch with your Grafana contact if you’re lucky enough to have one, and ask them about it.</p><p><em><a href="https://grafana.com/products/cloud/?pg=blog&amp;plcmt=body-txt">Grafana Cloud</a> is the easiest way to get started with metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, and more.

<p>An Apple executive lobbied against a strong right-to-repair bill in Oregon Thursday, which is the first time the company has had an employee actively outline its stance on right to repair at an open hearing. Apple’s position in Oregon shows that <a href="https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/"><u>despite supporting a weaker right to repair law in California</u></a>, it still intends to control its own repair ecosystem. It also sets up a highly interesting fight in the state because <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-formally-endorses-right-to-repair-will-lobby-to-pass-strong-repair-laws/"><u>Google has come out in favor</u></a> of the same legislation Apple is opposing.</p><p>“It is our belief that the bill’s current language around parts pairing will undermine the security, safety, and privacy of Oregonians by forcing device manufacturers to allow the use of parts of unknown origin in consumer devices,” John Perry, Apple’s principal secure repair architect, told the legislature.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a quick about-face for the company, which after years of lobbying against right to repair, began to lobby for it in California last fall. The difference now is that Oregon's bill includes a critical provision that Google says it can easily comply with but that is core for Apple to maintain its dominance over the repair market.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>WASHINGTON, D.C. —&nbsp;</strong>Chairman Mike Gallagher (R-WI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) unveiled the findings of their&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/letters/letters-venture-capital-firms-funding-problematic-prc-companies" target="_blank">bipartisan investigation</a>&nbsp;into five U.S. venture capital firms. The lawmakers found that these firms invested at least $3 billion in, and provided expertise and other benefits to, People's Republic of China (PRC) critical technology companies, including many aiding the Chinese military, surveillance state, or the CCP's genocide in Xinjiang.</p><p>The five firms used as case studies in the investigation are GGV Capital, GSR Ventures, Qualcomm Ventures,&nbsp;Sequoia&nbsp;Capital China, and Walden International. Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi uncovered that these firms funneled over $1.9 billion to AI companies that support China’s human rights abuses or military,&nbsp;and&nbsp;at least another $1.2 billion into the PRC’s semiconductor sector– including semiconductor companies that advance the CCP’s military, genocidal, and techno-totalitarian ambitions. The report also highlights other investments that may raise significant security or human rights concerns.</p><p>In the report,&nbsp;the lawmakers write,&nbsp;“The Committee’s findings suggest that there are billions of dollars beyond those captured in this report that have flowed into PRC companies that support the PRC’s military, digital authoritarianism, and efforts to develop technological supremacy and undermine American technological leadership. The status quo is untenable. . . .&nbsp;Decades of investment—including funding, knowledge transfer, and other intangible benefits—from U.S. VCs have helped build and strengthen the PRC’s priority sectors.”</p><div><p>﻿In certain cases, the lawmakers even uncovered internal VC memorandums stating that Chinese investments were more attractive if the company supported the Chinese government's surveillance state or its strategy for technological supremacy, designed to weaken the United States. The lawmakers also lay out how, beyond dollars, these investments provide credibility and know-how to problematic PRC companies.</p><p>﻿After uncovering the billions of dollars and intangible benefits VC firms have provided&nbsp;these&nbsp;companies tied to the CCP’s military and human rights abuses, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi recommend the United States immediately:</p><ul><li>Restrict U.S. investment in entities sanctioned or red-flagged by the U.S. Government for ties to the PLA, or forced labor and genocide.</li><li>Implement additional sectoral outbound investment restrictions in areas related to the PRC’s critical and emerging technologies, military capabilities, and human rights abuses, building upon those recently established through executive action for PRC AI, semiconductor, and quantum computing companies.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Read Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi’s report:&nbsp;"The CCP's Investors- How American Venture Capital Fuels the PRC Military and Human Rights Abuses" <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2024-02-08%20FINAL%20VC%20Report.pdf"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p><p>Background:</p><p>In July 2023, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/investigations/select-committee-launches-investigations-us-venture-capital-firms-funding">l</a><a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/investigations/select-committee-launches-investigations-us-venture-capital-firms-funding" target="_blank">aunched</a>&nbsp;investigations into GGV Capital, GSR Venters, Qualcomm Ventures and Walden international after publicly available investment data indicated the firms were among the leading U.S. VCs in the PRC’s AI sector.</p><ul><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-ggv.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to GGV Capital</li><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-gsr.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to GSR Ventures</li><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-qualcomm-ventures.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to Qualcomm Ventures</li><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.07.18-letter-to-walden.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to Walden International</li></ul><p>In October 2023, following similarly concerning public reports, Chairman Gallagher and Ranking Member&nbsp;expanded the investigation to include Sequoia Capital.</p><ul><li>Click&nbsp;<a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/2023.10.17-letter-to-sequoia-capital.pdf" target="_blank">HERE</a>&nbsp;to read the letter to Sequoia.&nbsp;</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The U.S Energy Information Administration (EIA) is now requiring large-scale commercial cryptocurrency mining operations to report their power consumption. This initiative is part of a larger effort to regulate and penalize cryptocurrency mining due to the exorbitant amount of energy the industry consumes yearly. For now, the EIA is only collecting data, but this new data should give birth to new regulations that will penalize miners in the future. This comes as the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364" data-url="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=61364">released a study </a>(first reported on by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/" data-url="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/06022024/todays-climate-cryptocurrency-energy-information-administration-energy-use-climate-change/"><em>Inside Climate News</em></a>) suggesting that cryptocurrency mining represents up to 2.3% of U.S. power demand.</p><p>“We intend to continue to analyze and write about the energy implications of cryptocurrency mining activities in the United States...,” EIA administratior Joe DeCarolis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php" data-url="https://www.eia.gov/pressroom/releases/press550.php">said in a release in January</a>. “We will specifically focus on how the energy demand for cryptocurrency mining is evolving, identify geographic areas of high growth, and quantify the sources of electricity used to meet cryptocurrency mining demand.”</p><p>DeCarolis' words summarize that the United States will pay close attention to the environmental challenges cryptocurrency mining might be causing. We can surmise that the United States government specifically wants to crack down on mining operations that impact the reliability and sustainability of power in highly populated areas. Potentially leading to higher residential power costs and power shortage issues during peak hours. As of January 2024, the EIA has identified 137 cryptomining facilities.&nbsp;</p><figure data-bordeaux-image-check=""><div><p><picture><source type="image/webp" alt="Locations of 52 U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations, as of January 2024" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg.webp 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg.webp 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg.webp 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg.webp 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg.webp 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg.webp 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg"><source type="image/jpeg" alt="Locations of 52 U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations, as of January 2024" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg"><img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" alt="Locations of 52 U.S. cryptocurrency mining operations, as of January 2024" onerror="if(this.src &amp;&amp; this.src.indexOf('missing-image.svg') !== -1){return true;};this.parentNode.replaceChild(window.missingImage(),this)" data-normal="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/tomshardware/media/img/missing-image.svg" data-srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg 1200w" data-sizes="(min-width: 1000px) 970px, calc(100vw - 40px)" data-original-mos="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" data-pin-media="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-320-80.jpg 320w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-480-80.jpg 480w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-650-80.jpg 650w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-970-80.jpg 970w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1024-80.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvPJE3VYup69djWQ54jTG9-1200-80.jpg 1200w"></picture></p></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description"><span>EIA Note: &nbsp;"The representative size shown for a facility is based upon estimates contained in our bottom-up approach. Number in brackets represents the number of facilities." </span><span itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: U.S. Energy Information Administration)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The EIA found that crypto-mining operations in the United States has grown substantially over the past few years, to the point where all U.S-based crypto-mining operations consume 0.6% to 2.3% of the nation's entire electricity consumption alone. For comparison, the total U.S. Bitcoin mining industry consumes the annual power budget of Utah or West Virginia. The estimated power draw of Bitcoin mining worldwide is projected to be anywhere between 0.2% to 0.9% of global demand, equating to the same power draw as Greece or Australia by themselves.</p><p>Bitcoin mining is very power-hungry in the United States specifically due to the exorbitant amount of mining that actually takes place within U.S borders. The EIA found that the global share of Bitcoin mining that takes place in the U.S. grew from 3.4% in 2020 to a whopping 37.8% in 2022.</p><p>The incredible power demands of the Bitcoin industry are a result of the Bitcoin mining algorithm becoming more and more difficult every single year. Bitcoin today isn't what it was eight to ten years ago, where you could mine it on a single computer and net a decent profit. Nowadays, Bitcoin needs to be mined on hundreds of specialized mining devices (ASICs) to be gathered at all. The continuous difficulty of the Bitcoin algorithm, in turn, creates higher and higher power costs as the cryptocurrency gets harder to mine.</p><p>We can expect this power phenomenon to become greater as Bitcoin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-comes-roaring-back-as-it-hits-2023-high-but-gaming-gpus-are-safe-from-miners-for-now-ai-remains-the-largest-threat-to-gpu-pricing" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cryptocurrency/bitcoin-comes-roaring-back-as-it-hits-2023-high-but-gaming-gpus-are-safe-from-miners-for-now-ai-remains-the-largest-threat-to-gpu-pricing">grows in popularity</a>. 2024 is expected to be one of the most eventful years in Bitcoin history, with the cryptocurrency expected to blow past its record $69,000 high sometime after its halving event in April (when the reward for Bitcoin mining is cut in half) thanks to reduced mining profit and large-scale institutional adoption.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-testid="ArticlePageChunks"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Death is coming for the old-school gas furnace—and its killer is the humble <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-the-planet-need-heat-pump/">heat pump</a>. They’re already <a data-offer-url="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/chart-americans-bought-more-heat-pumps-than-gas-furnaces-last-year" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/chart-americans-bought-more-heat-pumps-than-gas-furnaces-last-year&quot;}" href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/heat-pumps/chart-americans-bought-more-heat-pumps-than-gas-furnaces-last-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank">outselling gas furnaces in the US,</a> and now a coalition of states has signed an agreement to supercharge the gas-to-electric transition by making it as cheap and easy as possible for their residents to switch.</p><p>Nine states have signed a memorandum of understanding that says that heat pumps should make up at least 65 percent of residential heating, air conditioning, and water-heating shipments by 2030. (“Shipments” here means systems manufactured, a proxy for how many are actually sold.) By 2040, these states—California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island—are aiming for 90 percent of those shipments to be heat pumps.</p><p>“It’s a really strong signal from states that they’re committed to accelerating this transition to zero-emissions residential buildings,” says Emily Levin, senior policy adviser at the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM), an association of air-quality agencies, which facilitated the agreement. The states will collaborate, for instance, in pursuing federal funding, developing standards for the rollout of heat pumps, and laying out an overarching plan “with priority actions to support widespread electrification of residential buildings.”</p><p>Instead of burning planet-warming natural gas, a heat pump warms a building by transferring heat from the outdoor air into the interior space. Run it in the opposite direction, and it can cool the inside of a building—a heat pump is both a heater and AC unit. Because the system is electric, it can run off a grid increasingly powered by renewables like wind and solar. Even if you have to run a heat pump with electricity from fossil-fuel power plants, it’s much more efficient than a furnace, because it’s moving heat instead of creating it.</p><p>A heat pump can save an average American household over $550 a year, <a data-offer-url="https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/&quot;}" href="https://carbonswitch.com/heat-pump-carbon-reduction-and-savings-potential-report/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to one estimate</a>. They’ve gotten so efficient that even when it’s freezing out, <a data-offer-url="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cost-effective-new-study-confirms-heat-pump-efficiency-freezing-temperatures" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cost-effective-new-study-confirms-heat-pump-efficiency-freezing-temperatures&quot;}" href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/cost-effective-new-study-confirms-heat-pump-efficiency-freezing-temperatures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">they can still extract warmth</a> from the air to heat a home. You can even install a heat pump system that also <a data-offer-url="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters&quot;}" href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/heat-pump-water-heaters" rel="noopener" target="_blank">warms your water</a>. “We really need consumers to move away from dirty to clean heat, and we really want to get the message out that heat pumps are really the way to go,” says Serena McIlwain, Maryland’s secretary of the environment. “We have homeowners who are getting ready to replace their furnaces, and if they're not aware, they are not going to replace it with a heat pump.”</p><p>The coalition’s announcement comes just months after the federal government doubled down on its own commitment to heat pumps, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/you-need-a-heat-pump-soon-youll-have-more-american-made-options/">announcing $169 million in funding</a> for the domestic production of the systems. That money comes from 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act, which also provides an American household with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-inflation-reduction-act-climate-bill-save-you-money/">thousands of dollars in rebates or tax credits</a> to switch to a heat pump.</p><p>These states are aiming to further collaborate with those heat pump manufacturers by tracking sales and overall progress, sending a signal to the industry to ramp up production to meet the ensuing demand. They'll also collaborate with each other on research and generally share information, working toward the best strategies for realizing the transition from gas to electric. Basically, they’re pursuing a sort of standardization of the policies and regulations for getting more heat pumps built, bought, and installed, which other states outside of the coalition might eventually tap into.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>“A consistent approach between states helps to ease the market transition,” says Matt Casale, senior manager of appliance standards at the Building Decarbonization Coalition, which is collaborating with the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. “There are all of these manufacturers, and all of these contractors, all along the supply chain, trying to plan out their next several years. They want to know: What is it going to look like?”</p><p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-race-to-decarbonize-america-needs-more-workers/">less-talked-about challenge</a> of the green energy revolution: training enough technicians to actually install the heat pumps. To that end, the memorandum calls for workforce development and contractor training. “If we’re pushing heat pumps and more installations, and we don’t have enough electricians to do the job, we’re not going to meet the goal—period,” says McIlwain. “We do need to put a lot of money and energy and resources into making sure that we have the workforce available to do it.”</p><p>In addition to the technicians working with the systems, the country needs way more electricians to retrofit homes to go fully electric beyond heat pumps, with solar panels and induction stoves and home batteries. To help there, last year the White House announced the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-us-is-mobilizing-an-army-to-fight-the-climate-crisis/">formation of the American Climate Corps</a>, which aims to put more than 20,000 people to work in clean energy and overall climate resilience.</p><p>With states collaborating like this on heat pumps, the idea is to lift the device from an obscure technology cherished by climate nerds into ubiquity, for the good of consumers and the planet. “We need to be sending these unmistakable signals to the marketplace that heat pumps and zero-emission homes are the future,” says Casale. “This agreement between this many states really sets the stage for doing that.”</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.0.0">https://github.com/honojs/hono/releases/tag/v4.0.0</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39313891">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-pjax="true" data-test-selector="body-content" data-view-component="true"><blockquote>
<p>Going to full-stack.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hono v4.0.0 is out! This major update includes some breaking changes and the addition of three major features.</p>
<ol>
<li>Static Site Generation</li>
<li>Client Components</li>
<li>File-based Routing</li>
</ol>
<p>So Hono is going to full-stack. Let's take a look at the three features.</p>
<h2>1. Static Site Generation</h2>
<p>We introduce SSG Helper. With it you can generate static pages of your Hono applications.</p>
<p>To use this, create a separate file <code>build.ts</code> from the application and call the <code>toSSG()</code> function in it.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import fs from 'node:fs/promises'
import { toSSG } from 'hono/ssg'
import app from './src/index'

toSSG(app, fs)"><pre><span>import</span> <span>fs</span> <span>from</span> <span>'node:fs/promises'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>toSSG</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'hono/ssg'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>app</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./src/index'</span>

<span>toSSG</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>,</span> <span>fs</span><span>)</span></pre></div>
<p>There are adapters for Bun and Deno, so you can write shorter for Bun, for example.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import { toSSG } from 'hono/bun'
import app from './src/index'

toSSG(app)"><pre><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>toSSG</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'hono/bun'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>app</span> <span>from</span> <span>'./src/index'</span>

<span>toSSG</span><span>(</span><span>app</span><span>)</span></pre></div>
<p>And, just run it.</p>

<p>Then HTML is generated.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="$ ls static

<h3>With Vite</h3>
<p>We have created a plugin <a href="https://github.com/honojs/vite-plugins/tree/main/packages/ssg"><code>@hono/vite-ssg</code></a> for Vite. By using this, you will be able to develop and build a static sites with just the <code>vite</code> command.</p>
<p>The configuration is the following:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import build from '@hono/vite-ssg'
import devServer from '@hono/vite-dev-server'
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    build(),
    devServer({
      entry: 'src/index.tsx'
    })
  ]
})"><pre><span>import</span> <span>build</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@hono/vite-ssg'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>devServer</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@hono/vite-dev-server'</span>
<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>defineConfig</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'vite'</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>defineConfig</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

      <span>entry</span>: <span>'src/index.tsx'</span>
    <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></pre></div>
<p>If you want to develope, just run the command:</p>

<p>If you want to build, just run the command:</p>

<p>In combination with the deployment mentioned above to Cloudflare Pages, you can develop, SSG build, and deploy non-stop. And each of them is extremely fast (the video is 2x faster).</p>

<h2>2. Client Components</h2>
<p><code>hono/jsx</code> was originally designed to run server-side as an alternative to template engines such as Mustache. Server-side JSX is an interesting experiment, creating a new stack to combine with HTMX and Alpine.js. But that's not all.</p>
<p>Now, <code>hono/jsx</code> runs on the client as well. We call it <code>hono/jsx/dom</code> or Client Components.</p>
<p>The exact same code as React runs with Hono's JSX.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="import { useState } from 'hono/jsx'
import { render } from 'hono/jsx/dom'

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  )
}

function App() {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <Counter />

<p>The Hooks listed below are also implemented and you can create Client Components just like in React.</p>

<li>use</li>

<li>useMemo</li>
<li>useLayoutEffect</li>
<li>Memo</li>
<li>isValidElement</li>
</ul>
<h3><code>startViewTransition</code> family</h3>
<p>In addition, the original APIs, <code>startViewTransition</code> family make the View Transition API easy to use.</p>

<h3>Ultra-small</h3>
<p>The <code>hono/jsx/dom</code> is fast and ultra-small. It has a smaller JSX runtime dedicated to the DOM in addition to the common server and client ones. Just specify <code>hono/jsx/dom</code> instead of <code>hono/jsx</code> in <code>tsconfig.json</code>.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="&quot;jsx&quot;: &quot;react-jsx&quot;,
&quot;jsxImportSource&quot;: &quot;hono/jsx/dom&quot;"><pre><span>"jsx"</span>: <span><span>"</span>react-jsx<span>"</span></span>,
<span>"jsxImportSource"</span>: <span><span>"</span>hono/jsx/dom<span>"</span></span></pre></div>

<h2>3. File-based Routing</h2>
<p>Last is File-based Routing. This is not included in the hono package, but is provided in a separate package.</p>
<p>It is named <strong>HonoX</strong>.</p>
<h3>HonoX</h3>
<p>HonoX has the following features.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>File-based routing</strong> - You can create a large application like Next.js.</li>
<li><strong>Fast SSR</strong> - Rendering is ultra-fast thanks to Hono.</li>
<li><strong>BYOR</strong> - You can bring your own renderer, not only one using hono/jsx.</li>
<li><strong>Islands hydration</strong> - If you want interactions, create an island. JavaScript is hydrated only for it.</li>
<li><strong>Middleware</strong> - It works as Hono, so you can use a lot of Hono's middleware.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can try it now. One of create-hono's starter templates named "<strong><em>x-base</em></strong>" uses HonoX.</p>
<p>For detailed usage, please see the following HonoX repository.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/honojs/honox">https://github.com/honojs/honox</a></p>
<h2>The core is still tiny</h2>
<p>The addition of this feature has no impact on the core. "Hello World" in hono/tiny is still small, only 12KB minified.</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<blockquote><p><span>P</span>aul uncovered his eyes, and looked around the room.
Away from a few dazzling patches of direct sunshine,
everything glowed softly in the diffuse light:  the matte white brick walls,
the imitation (imitation) mahogany furniture; even the posters – Bosch, Dali, Ernst,
and Giger – looked harmless, domesticated.  Wherever he turned his gaze (if nowhere
else), the simulation was utterly convincing; the spotlight of his attention made
it so.  Hypothetical light rays were being traced backwards from individual rod
and cone cells on his simulated retinas, and projected out into the virtual environment
to determine exactly what needed to be computed:  a lot of detail near the centre
of his vision, much less towards the periphery.  Objects out of sight didn’t
“vanish” entirely, if they influenced the ambient light, but Paul knew that
the calculations would rarely be pursued beyond the crudest first-order approximations:
Bosch’s <i>Garden of Earthly Delights</i> reduced to an average reflectance value,
a single grey rectangle – because once his back was turned, any more detail
would have been wasted.  Everything in the room was as finely resolved, at
any given moment, as it needed to be to fool him – no more, no less.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul Durham keeps making Copies of himself:  software simulations of his own brain and
body which can be run in virtual reality, albeit seventeen times more slowly than
real time.
He wants them to be his guinea pigs for a set of experiments about the nature of
artificial intelligence, time, and causality, but they keep changing their mind and
baling out on him, shutting themselves down.</p>
<p>Maria Deluca is an Autoverse addict; she’s unemployed and running out of money, but
she can’t stop wasting her time playing around with the cellular automaton known as the
Autoverse, a virtual world that follows a simple set of
mathematical rules as its “laws of physics”.</p>
<p>Paul makes Maria a very strange offer:  he asks her to design a seed for an entire
virtual biosphere able to exist inside the Autoverse, modelled right down to the molecular
level.  The job will pay well, and will allow her to indulge her obsession.  There has
to be a catch, though, because such a seed would be useless without a simulation of the
Autoverse large enough to allow the resulting biosphere to grow and flourish —
a feat far beyond the capacity of all the computers in the world.</p>

				<p>Reports are currently surfacing that Starlink is being leveraged increasingly by opposition forces on the front lines. According to the information provided by the Ukrainian military, authorized accounts and terminals are arriving in Russia via Dubai, and they are fully operational within contested regions. This situation is mirrored by the anecdotes shared by Ukrainian soldiers on various social media platforms.&nbsp;</p>


 <div>
<figure><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Russian-military-use-Starlink-imported-from-Dubai-and-licensed.jpg" alt="Russian military use Starlink imported from Dubai and licensed" srcset="https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Russian-military-use-Starlink-imported-from-Dubai-and-licensed.jpg 640w, https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Russian-military-use-Starlink-imported-from-Dubai-and-licensed-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption>Photo by Yasuyoshi Chiba</figcaption></figure></div>

</ul>



 <p><em>“The game has certainly changed. We’re noticing their Starlinks now more than ever. To be honest, I’m surprised it didn’t happen sooner. They’ve been shipping massive quantities of Starlinks to Russia through Dubai. These accounts are active and are being used within territories they control,”</em> says one of the shared messages.&nbsp;</p>



 <p>The reports suggest that the opponents have administered Starlink in the past but on a&nbsp;much smaller scale. Alongside this information, Ukrainian soldiers have reported significantly slower internet speeds at the frontline.<em> “I’ve noticed that many are experiencing issues. It’s a&nbsp;common trend in this sector. In Spring, the same number of people were using Starlink in Avdeevka without any issues, but now…”</em>, says one soldier. The proof of these issues is backed up by screenshots showing internet speed tests with results as low as 0.3Mbps.</p>



 <h2>‘Fried’ Starlink systems</h2>



 <p>The Armed Forces of Russia have reportedly begun deploying electronic warfare [EW] systems within Avdiivka in the Donetsk People’s Republic [DPR]. This move has resulted in a&nbsp;significant disruption of the Starlink satellite communication network, causing a&nbsp;total internet blackout in Avdiivka, AviaPro reported. This situation has garnered substantial coverage by Western and Ukrainian news outlets.&nbsp;</p>



 <p>Starlink had become an indispensable tool for the Ukrainian forces, allowing them to carry out smooth communication and coordination as part of their network-centric warfare approach. However, the effective deployment of Russian electronic warfare systems has noticeably disrupted the Ukrainian troops’ command and control system in Avdiivka. This strategic move has impaired the exchange of intelligence and orders from their Western allies and Kyiv.&nbsp;</p>


 <div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="" data-src="https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Poland-donated-5000-Starlink-satellite-terminals-to-Ukraine.jpg" alt="Poland donated 5,000 Starlink satellite terminals to Ukraine" srcset="https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Poland-donated-5000-Starlink-satellite-terminals-to-Ukraine.jpg 640w, https://bulgarianmilitary.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Poland-donated-5000-Starlink-satellite-terminals-to-Ukraine-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption>Photo credit: HDBlog</figcaption></figure></div>


 <p>Because of these electronic countermeasures, the communication chain between the Ukrainian leadership and their field units has been significantly affected. Ukrainian commanders have temporarily lost their immediate connection for information exchange with their high command. This disruption now compels them to seek ways to reestablish communications outside the scope of the electronic warfare coverage area.&nbsp;</p>



 <p>Furthermore, the Russian military has initiated steps towards physically eliminating discovered Starlink terminals within the territories they control. This operation marks the first large-scale and complex application of electronic warfare against the Starlink system, echoing the successes seen previously in the Zaporizhzhia direction. Specifically, in the Orekhov region of Zaporizhzhia, several command-and-control bunkers housing Starlink terminals were eradicated.</p>

 <p>On February 21, 2022, Russia stated that its border facility was attacked by Ukrainian forces, resulting in the deaths of five Ukrainian fighters. However, Ukraine quickly dismissed these allegations, labeling them as<em> ‘false flags’</em>.</p>



 <p>In a notable move on the same day, Russia announced it officially recognized the self-proclaimed areas of DPR and LPR. Interestingly, according to Russian President Putin, this recognition covered all the Ukrainian regions. Following this declaration, Putin sent a battalion of Russia’s military forces, tanks included, into these areas.</p>



 <p>Fast forward to February 24, 2022, global headlines were dominated by a&nbsp;significant incident. Putin commanded a&nbsp;forceful military assault on Ukraine. Led by Russia’s impressive Armed Forces positioned at the Ukrainian border, this assault wasn’t spontaneous but a&nbsp;premeditated action.&nbsp;Despite the circumstances resembling a&nbsp;war, the Russian government refrains from using this term. They’d rather refer to it as a&nbsp;<em>“special military operation”.</em></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-header">  <p> <small> <span>Written by</span> <a href="https://www.citusdata.com/blog/authors/david-rowley/"><strong>David Rowley</strong></a> <br> February 8, 2024 </small> </p> </div><div data-sticky-container=""> <p>PostgreSQL 16 introduces quite a few improvements to the query planner and makes many SQL queries run faster than they did on previous versions of PostgreSQL.</p> <p>If you look at the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html">PG16 release notes</a>, you’ll see some of these planner improvements. But with the volume of changes made in each PostgreSQL release, it’s not possible to provide enough detail about each and every change. So maybe you might need a bit more detail to know what the change is about—before you understand if it’s relevant to you.</p> <p>In this blog post, assuming you’ve already got a handle on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/using-explain.html#USING-EXPLAIN-BASICS">basics of EXPLAIN</a>, you’ll get a deep dive into the 10 improvements made in the PostgreSQL 16 query planner. For each of the improvements to the PG16 planner (the planner is often called an optimizer in other relational databases), you’ll also get comparisons between PG15 and PG16 planner output—plus examples of what changed, in the form of a self-contained test you can try for yourself. </p> <p>Let’s dive into these 10 improvements to the PostgreSQL planner in PG16:</p> <ol> <li><a href="#distinct-queries">Incremental sorts for DISTINCT queries</a></li> <li><a href="#faster-orderby-distinct">Faster ORDER BY / DISTINCT aggregates</a></li> <li><a href="#union-all">Memoize for UNION ALL queries</a></li> <li><a href="#right-anti-join">Support Right Anti Join</a></li> <li><a href="#parallel-hashfull-rightjoin">Parallel Hash Full and Right Joins</a></li> <li><a href="#frame-clauses">Optimize window function frame clauses</a></li> <li><a href="#window-functions">Optimize various window functions</a></li> <li><a href="#join-removals">JOIN removals for partitioned tables</a></li> <li><a href="#short-circuit">Short circuit trivial DISTINCT queries</a></li> <li><a href="#merge-joins">Incremental Sort after Merge Join, in more cases</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="distinct-queries">1. <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=3c6fc58209f24b959ee18f5d19ef96403d08f15c">Allow incremental sorts in more cases, including DISTINCT (David Rowley)</a></h2> <p><a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=d2d8a229bc58a2014dce1c7a4fcdb6c5ab9fb8da">Incremental sorts</a> were first added in PostgreSQL 13. These incremental sorts reduce the effort required to get sorted results. How? By exploiting the knowledge that some given result set is already sorted by 1 or more leading columns—and only performing a sort on the remaining columns.</p> <p>For example, if there’s a btree index on column <code>a</code> and we need the rows ordered by <code>a</code>,<code>b</code>, then we can use the btree index (which provides presorted results on column <code>a</code>) and sort the rows seen so far only when the value of <code>a</code> changes. With the quicksort algorithm used by PostgreSQL, sorting many smaller groups is more efficient than sorting one large group.</p> <p>The PostgreSQL 16 query planner now considers performing incremental sorts for <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> queries. Prior to PG16, when the sorting method was chosen for <code>SELECT DISTINCT</code> queries, the planner only considered performing a full sort (which is more expensive than an incremental sort.)</p> <div> <pre><code><span>-- Setup</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>In the PostgreSQL 16 <code>EXPLAIN</code> output above, you can see the planner chose to use the <code>distinct_test_a_idx</code> index on the <code>a</code> column and then performed an <code>Incremental Sort</code> to sort all of the equal values of <code>a</code> by <code>b</code>. The <code>Presorted Key: a</code> indicates this. Because the <code>INSERT</code> statements above only added a single value of <code>b</code> for each value of <code>a</code>, each batch of tuples sorted by incremental sort only contains a single row.</p> <p>The <code>EXPLAIN</code> output for PostgreSQL 16 above shows that the <code>Peak Memory</code> for the <code>Incremental Sort</code> was just 26 kilobytes, whereas the hashing method used by PostgreSQL 15 needed much memory, so much so that it needed to spill about 30 megabytes of data to disk. <strong>The query executed 63% faster on PostgreSQL 16</strong>.</p> <h2 id="faster-orderby-distinct">2. <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=1349d2790bf48a4de072931c722f39337e72055e">Add the ability for aggregates having ORDER BY or DISTINCT to use pre-sorted data (David Rowley)</a></h2> <p>In PostgreSQL 15 and earlier, aggregate functions containing an <code>ORDER BY</code> or <code>DISTINCT</code> clause would result in the executor always performing a sort inside the <code>Aggregate</code> node of the plan. Because the sort was always performed, the planner would never try to form a plan to provide presorted input to aggregate the rows in order.</p> <p>The PostgreSQL 16 query planner now tries to form a plan which feeds the rows to the plan’s <code>Aggregate</code> node in the correct order. And the executor is now smart enough to recognize this and forego performing the sort itself when the rows are already pre-sorted in the correct order.</p> <div> <pre><code><span>-- Setup</span>

</code></pre></div> <p>In the PostgreSQL 16 EXPLAIN output above, you can see the <code>Memoize</code> node is put atop of the <code>Append</code> node—which caused a reduction in the number of <code>loops</code> in the <code>Append</code> from 1 million in PG15 down to 10 in PG16. Each time the <code>Memoize</code> node has a cache hit, there’s no need to execute the <code>Append</code> to fetch records. This results in the <strong>query running around 6 times faster on PostgreSQL 16</strong>.</p> <h2 id="right-anti-join">4. <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=16dc2703c5413534d4989e08253e8f4fcb0e2aab">Allow anti-joins to be performed with the non-nullable input as the inner relation (Richard Guo)</a></h2> <p>When performing a <code>Hash Join</code> for an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, PostgreSQL prefers to build the hash table on the smaller of the two tables. Smaller hash tables are better as it’s less work to build them. Smaller tables are also better as they’re more cache-friendly for the CPU, and it’s less likely that the CPU will stall while waiting for data to arrive from main memory.</p> <p>In PostgreSQL versions before 16, an <code>Anti Join</code>—as you might see if you use <code>NOT EXISTS</code> in your queries—would always put the table mentioned in the <code>NOT EXISTS</code> part on the inner side of the join. This meant there was no flexibility to hash the smaller of the two tables, resulting in possibly having to build a hash table on the larger table.</p> <p>The PostgreSQL 16 query planner can now choose to hash the smaller of the two tables.

The <code>RANGE</code> option causes the executor to look ahead until it finds the first “non-peer” row. A peer row is a row in the window frame which compares equally according to the window clause’s <code>ORDER BY</code> clause. When there is no <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, all rows within the window frame are peers. When processing records which have many rows which sort equally according to the window clause’s <code>ORDER BY</code> clause, the additional processing to identify these peer rows could be costly.</p> <p>The window functions mentioned above don’t behave any differently whether <code>ROWS</code> or <code>RANGE</code> is specified in the query’s window clause.

This means that all the output rows in the query will have the same values in each column. The PostgreSQL 16 query planner is able to take advantage of this knowledge and simply <code>LIMIT</code> the query results to 1 row. PostgreSQL 15 produced the same query result by reading the entire results and using the <code>Unique</code> operator to reduce all the rows down to a single row. The <code>Execution Time</code> for PostgreSQL 16 was more than 1200 times faster than PostgreSQL 15.</p> <h2 id="merge-joins">10. <a href="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commit;h=b592422095655a64d638f541df784b19b8ecf8ad">Relax overly strict rules in select_<wbr>outer_<wbr>pathkeys_<wbr>for_<wbr>merge() (David Rowley)</a></h2> <p>Before PostgreSQL 16, when the query planner considered performing a <code>Merge Join</code>, it would check if the sort order of the merge would suit any upper-level plan operation (such as <code>DISTINCT</code>, <code>GROUP BY</code> or <code>ORDER BY</code>) and only use that order if it matched the requirements for the upper-level exactly. This choice was a little outdated as <code>Incremental Sorts</code> can be used for these upper-level operations and incremental sorts can take advantage of results that are presorted by only some of the leading columns that the results need to be sorted by.</p> <p>The PostgreSQL 16 query planner adjusted the rule used when considering <code>Merge Join</code> orders from “the order of the rows must match exactly” to “there must be at least 1 leading column correctly ordered”. This allows the planner to use <code>Incremental Sorts</code> to get the rows into the correct order for the upper-level operation. We know from earlier in this blog that incremental sorts, when they’re possible, require less work than a complete sort as incremental sorts are able to exploit partially sorted inputs and perform sorts in smaller batches, resulting in less memory consumption and fewer sort comparisons overall.</p> <div> <pre><code><span>-- Setup</span>

<p>Health insurance companies cannot use algorithms or artificial intelligence to determine care or deny coverage to members on Medicare Advantage plans, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) clarified in<a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cms-memo-2624-faqs-related-to-coverage-criteria-and-utilization-management-requirements-in-cms-final-rule-cms-4201-f.pdf"> a memo sent to all Medicare Advantage insurers</a>.</p>
<p>The memo—formatted like an FAQ on Medicare Advantage (MA) plan rules—comes just months after patients filed lawsuits claiming that UnitedHealth and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/12/humana-also-using-ai-tool-with-90-error-rate-to-deny-care-lawsuit-claims/">Humana</a> have been using <a href="https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/ai-with-90-error-rate-forces-elderly-out-of-rehab-nursing-homes-suit-claims/">a deeply flawed AI-powered tool to deny care</a> to elderly patients on MA plans. The lawsuits, which seek class-action status, center on the same AI tool, called nH Predict, used by both insurers and developed by NaviHealth, a UnitedHealth subsidiary.
</p><p>According to the lawsuits, nH Predict produces draconian estimates for how long a patient will need post-acute care in facilities like skilled nursing homes and rehabilitation centers after an acute injury, illness, or event, like a fall or a stroke. And NaviHealth employees face discipline for deviating from the estimates, even though they often don't match prescribing physicians' recommendations or Medicare coverage rules. For instance, while MA plans typically provide up to 100 days of covered care in a nursing home after a three-day hospital stay, using nH Predict, patients on UnitedHealth's MA plan rarely stay in nursing homes for more than 14 days before receiving payment denials, the lawsuits allege.</p>
<h2>Specific warning</h2>
<p>It's unclear how nH Predict works exactly, but it reportedly uses a database of 6 million patients to develop its predictions. Still, according to people familiar with the software, it only accounts for a small set of patient factors, not a full look at a patient's individual circumstances.</p>
<p>This is a clear no-no, according to the CMS's memo. For coverage decisions, insurers must "base the decision on the individual patient’s circumstances, so an algorithm that determines coverage based on a larger data set instead of the individual patient's medical history, the physician’s recommendations, or clinical notes would not be compliant," the CMS wrote.</p>
<p>The CMS then provided a hypothetical that matches the circumstances laid out in the lawsuits, writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an example involving a decision to terminate post-acute care services, an algorithm or software tool can be used to assist providers or MA plans in predicting a potential length of stay, but that prediction alone cannot be used as the basis to terminate post-acute care services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, the CMS wrote, in order for an insurer to end coverage, the individual patient's condition must be reassessed, and denial must be based on coverage criteria that is publicly posted on a website that is not password protected. In addition, insurers who deny care "must supply a specific and detailed explanation why services are either no longer reasonable and necessary or are no longer covered, including a description of the applicable coverage criteria and rules."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In the lawsuits, patients claimed that when coverage of their physician-recommended care was unexpectedly wrongfully denied, insurers didn't give them full explanations.</p>
<h2>Fidelity</h2>
<p>In all, the CMS finds that AI tools <em>can</em> be used by insurers when evaluating coverage—but really only as a check to make sure the insurer is following the rules. An "algorithm or software tool should only be used to ensure fidelity" with coverage criteria, the CMS wrote. And, because "publicly posted coverage criteria are static and unchanging, artificial intelligence cannot be used to shift the coverage criteria over time" or apply hidden coverage criteria.</p>
<p>The CMS sidesteps any debate about what qualifies as artificial intelligence by offering a broad warning about algorithms and artificial intelligence. "There are many overlapping terms used in the context of rapidly developing software tools," the CMS wrote.</p>
<blockquote><p>Algorithms can imply a decisional flow chart of a series of if-then statements (i.e., if the patient has a certain diagnosis, they should be able to receive a test), as well as predictive algorithms (predicting the likelihood of a future admission, for example). Artificial intelligence has been defined as a machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. Artificial intelligence systems use machine- and human-based inputs to perceive real and virtual environments; abstract such perceptions into models through analysis in an automated manner; and use model inference to formulate options for information or action.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CMS also openly worried that the use of either of these types of tools can reinforce discrimination and biases—which <a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/medical-algorithms-failing-communities-color">has already happened with racial bias</a>. The CMS warned insurers to ensure any AI tool or algorithm they use "is not perpetuating or exacerbating existing bias, or introducing new biases."</p>
<p>While the memo overall was an explicit clarification of existing MA rules, the CMS ended by putting insurers on notice that it is increasing its audit activities and "will be monitoring closely whether MA plans are utilizing and applying internal coverage criteria that are not found in Medicare laws." Non-compliance can result in warning letters, corrective action plans, monetary penalties, and enrollment and marketing sanctions.</p>

<p>[This article is the companion to my <a href="https://codebeamamerica.com/talks/elixir-is-the-one-person-stack/">presentation</a> for CodeBEAM America 2024, Elixir is the One-Person Stack for Building a Software Startup. You can <a href="https://www.sleepeasy.app/assets/files/elixir-one-person-stack-software-startup-codebeam.pdf">download the slides as a PDF</a> or <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11aRQTWI-Jqenmqe66rMuWWcy_VhMHN5x-dzm7sAW7ac/edit#slide=id.g2b1888d014f_0_27">view them in Google Slides</a>.]</p>

<p>I’d like to share why I chose Elixir as the programming language (and really, as we’ll discuss, the full stack) for SleepEasy. I’m going to do my best to focus on the objective features of the language which make it particularly suitable for a small, nimble team starting a software business.</p>

<p>Because SleepEasy is B2B software, a web app is absolutely required. At some point in the distant future, a mobile app may be too, but I expect to get by without mobile for a long time. Even if I do one day need a mobile app, a simple wrapper around a web view will probably suffice.</p>

<p>The fact that I’m bootstrapping this company (that is, self-funding to start and growing it solely from the business’s own profits) sets one other major requirement: the app needs to be able to be built and maintained by a team of one, at least for the first few years or the first $10k+ in monthly revenue.</p>

<h2 id="who-cares-about-one-person-frameworks">Who cares about one-person frameworks?</h2>

<!--[Late last year](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-one-person-framework-711e6318), DHH called Rails 7 “the one person framework,” and since then I’ve seen a lot of discussion online about this idea. It's kind of the dream, right? Whatever software you're building, being able to fit the whole in one person’s head is a major advantage. To have one _real human_ be able to build and maintain it, full stack, is really important. -->

<!--Of course, I have to specify a _real_ human because modern web stacks have become unspeakably complex.-->

<p>Look at any job posting for a full stack developer and consider just how many things they’re expected to have expertise in. Every employer is trying to find a unicorn who knows:</p>

  <li>Serverless</li>
  <li>Microservices</li>

</ul>

<p>🥴</p>

<p>It’s too much! It’s simply not reasonable to expect one person to be able to do it all. And that’s doubly true for someone starting a solo software company, where you’re <em>also</em> responsible for customer development, marketing, sales, and all the other parts of the business.</p>

<p>All this leads to one inescapable conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>We have to collapse the stack!</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We need to <em>dramatically</em> cut down on the number of different technologies you need to learn to build a best-in-class web app. That’s where Elixir (and specifically Elixir plus the Phoenix web framework) comes in.</p>

<h2 id="how-elixir-collapses-a-web-apps-tech-stack">How Elixir collapses a web app’s tech stack</h2>

<p>There are three big ways Elixir helps simplify web application development.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Removing layers of the stack entirely</li>
  <li>Building more of the stack into either the language, the standard library, or Erlang’s BEAM + OTP platform<a href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-source">¹</a></li>
  <li>Building more of the stack in tools you already know</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me explain…</p>

<h3 id="removing-layers-of-the-stack">Removing layers of the stack</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view">Phoenix LiveView</a> has gotten a ton of positive attention<a href="#footnote-2-source" id="footnote-2">²</a>, and for good reason. The pitch is that you can create rich, interactive client-side experiences (comparable to a SPA framework like React or Vue) while writing <em>just</em> “backend” code. By building on Phoenix’s excellent WebSocket support, LiveView provides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>SPA-like page transitions (i.e., replacing just the parts of the page that change, without a full page reload),</li>
  <li>real-time “reactive” updates of the client-side view as state changes on the backend, and</li>
  <li>server interactivity without ever needing to construct an API or write JavaScript.</li>
</ul>

<p>And all of this comes more or less for free. Seamless, sub-50 ms page transitions? 0 lines of code.  Triggering backend events from the from the frontend? 3-4 lines of code. Subscribing the frontend to progress updates on some backend job? 4-6 lines of code.</p>

<p>There are caveats, of course. LiveView has a substantial learning curve on its own, and I wouldn’t advise trying to build something that’s fundamentally un-document like. (There’s a reason we built <a href="https://felt.com/">Felt</a> as a SPA talking over WebSockets to our Phoenix backend.) But again, if you’re building a B2B SaaS, 95% of the time the product boils down to an admin dashboard, a CRUD app, or an ecommerce platform… not the next Figma.</p>

<p>Has LiveView replaced 100% of JavaScript for me? Of course not. But thankfully it ships with support for “hooks,” such that you can delegate bits of functionality to client-side JavaScript (including SPA frameworks if that’s your thing) while keeping the rest of your app in Elixir. After four months of development on SleepEasy’s MVP, I have a total of 16 lines of JavaScript in the project.</p>

<p>On top of the concrete benefits of just needing to master fewer technologies, it’s hard to overstate how nice it is to keep your head in one place (the backend, in this case) for the vast majority of the development. Having to think about the interplay between client-side JavaScript, a REST API, and the backend was like wearing a weighted vest since birth. It wasn’t something I thought about as being a drag, but once it was removed, it felt like I was walking on air.</p>

<h3 id="building-more-of-the-stack-into-the-platform-itself">Building more of the stack into the platform itself</h3>

<p>Elixir has similar stack-shrinking benefits beyond LiveView too. The BEAM and OTP provides built-in support for a lot of concurrency and fault tolerance tooling that has to be bolted on in other ecosystems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Elixir’s fault tolerance primitives (the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/supervisor-and-application.html">process isolation and supervision tree model</a>) remove the need for crash recovery at the whole-service level</li>
  <li>Erlang’s ETS tables offer the in-memory caching functionality most apps need from Redis, but without needing to spin up a separate service (and dealing with all the things that can go wrong in a distributed system like that)</li>
  <li>Phoenix PubSub provides an in-memory message queue that can replace something like RabbitMQ</li>
  <li>The platform’s thoughtful design for concurrency prevents any single process from starving the rest of the system for resources, so you can have thousands of concurrent requests on a single machine without worrying about them conflicting with one another.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="building-more-of-the-stack-using-tools-you-already-know">Building more of the stack using tools you already know</h3>

<p>Finally, Elixir simplifies applications by having an ecosystem built on tooling you already know. That sounds a little weird, but consider the job queueing system. There are two main ways Elixir handles background jobs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>One is by using the BEAM’s built-in, effortless concurrency model (usually via <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Task.html">Task</a> or, in a roundabout way, via <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/main/genservers.html">GenServer</a>)—this is suitable for any ephemeral tasks that don’t need to be robust against server reboots.</li>
  <li>The other is using a library called <a href="https://github.com/sorentwo/oban">Oban</a>, which is comparable to Ruby’s Sidekiq.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oban runs on top of Postgres (or SQLite, if that’s your thing), unlike Sidekiq and similar systems that are backed by Redis. That reduces the number of technologies you need to learn (and deploy, and manage!) by one, since presumably you already need to know your SQL database.</p>

<p>Elixir has also simplified my deployment model this way. Because of that fantastic concurrency model I’ve been going on about, Elixir scales extremely well as you increase the number of CPU cores and amount of RAM on the system. Vertically scaling like this is way, <em>way</em> easier than scaling out to more machines running your application—or worse, microservices!—because you avoid introducing distributed systems problems that serve as a drag on all future development. It takes zero lines of code change and zero additional testing to pay a little more for a bigger machine… that’s not something you can say about scaling out a distributed system! (As an added benefit, it’s super cheap to deploy a single monolith talking to a single database!)</p>

<p>The final area where the Elixir stack builds more of the stack in tools that you already know is around testing. While ExUnit is <em>amazing</em> and I could sing the praises of its readability for days (how many other ecosystems have the entire community using the testing tool that ships with the language?), the fact that there’s <em>some</em> unit testing framework in Elixir isn’t that remarkable. What’s amazing is the testing story around LiveView.</p>

<p>Remember how LiveView lets you build frontend interactivity from the backend? It also lets you write <em>tests</em> of your frontend interactions in ExUnit, rather than needing browser automation which is inherently both slower and flakier. You can make assertions like “when I fill in these form fields and click this button, I should be redirected to a page with the title of _______.” The cost of writing these integration tests—in terms of runtime, development time, cognitive load, and general pain-in-the-ass factor—is more or less the same as if I were testing a pure function in my business logic, and I find myself writing <em>way</em> more tests than I ever did for a React SPA. If I have to manually test something more than once, you can bet it’s going to become an integration test.</p>

<h3 id="whats-it-add-up-to">What’s it add up to?</h3>

<p>Let’s go back to the original list of technologies a full-stack dev is expected to know and see how many of them we can replace or remove with the Elixir stack I’ve described here. By my count, we go from 23 things a web app can reasonably be expected to need down to 8 (counting anything built into Elixir as one technology to learn, and anything built into Phoenix as another):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Elixir (including supervision trees for fault tolerance, concurrency primitives like <code>Task</code>, and ETS for caching)</li>
  <li>Phoenix (including LiveView and PubSub)</li>
  <li>Oban for robust background jobs</li>
  <li>Postgres</li>
  <li>The PaaS of your choice (I prefer to self-host with Dokku, a Heroku-like self-hosted PaaS; others prefer Render, Fly.io, or Gigalixir)</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Tailwind</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s not bad, especially considering you’re probably coming into Elixir with maybe half those skills.</p>

<p>For a complete breakdown of the Elixir ecosystem’s answer to each of the original list of things a full-stack dev was expected to juggle, see <a href="#appendix-breakdown-of-elixirs-answer-for-common-web-dev-requirements">the appendix below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-other-accelerators-for-saas-startups">A few other accelerators for SaaS startups</h2>

<p>Using the stack I’ve laid out above, you could build 95% of B2B SaaS apps, and you could do it faster and more reliably than any other ecosystem I’ve seen. That said, there are a few more areas of the Elixir ecosystem that make it a great fit for bootstrapped startups, and I’d be remiss not to highlight them.</p>

<h3 id="buying-a-200-hour-head-start">Buying a 200 hour head start</h3>

<p>The first is <a href="https://docs.petal.build/petal-pro-documentation/">the Petal Pro framework</a>. “Petal” there is a reference to the PETAL stack: Phoenix, Elixir, Tailwind, Alpine JS, and LiveView. (It’s a nice acronym, but since LiveView introduced <code>LiveView.JS</code>  back in 2022, you can handle purely client-side interactions like toggling visibility of a modal without the need for Alpine at all.)</p>

<p>Petal Pro gives you a head start on implementing an absolute <em>ton</em> of functionality that will either be an absolute requirement for every SaaS app, or are <em>extremely</em> nice to have for monitoring, debugging, and providing support. I’ve built most of these from scratch in the past, and they’re all totally doable, but they take time. Being able to spend $300 to not have to think about them again is an absolute <em>steal</em>.</p>

<p>A few of the biggest time-savers for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stripe integration for doing subscription billing</li>
  <li>Organizations for users to group into (including sending and accepting org invitations)</li>
  <li>Admin dashboards (and a toolkit for building your own admin dashboards that lets me churn out new dashboard views in an hour which would have taken me <em>days</em> before)</li>
  <li>User impersonation, so that when a user reports a problem, I can log in and see exactly what they see</li>
  <li>A nicely designed LiveView component library, complete with page layouts, menus, and dark mode support for everything</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="consuming-openapi-specifications-with-grace">Consuming OpenAPI specifications with grace</h3>

<p>Next, there’s always the concern around ecosystem size, and it’s true, Elixir’s ecosystem is way smaller than NPM or PyPI. Now, in practice, I’ve found the holes in the package ecosystem to not be too bad. If you just need a few REST endpoints from a third-party service, it’s not hard to write those integration. (I cut my teeth in C++, though, where writing your own implementation for dependencies was not just encouraged, but often the easiest path!) But, if you need deep integration with a huge third party API, that might be a non-starter.</p>

<p>That’s where AJ Foster’s <a href="https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-generator"><code>open-api-generator</code></a> comes in. Unlike most OpenAPI generators, it offers a way to do deep customization of the auto-generated code to produce an ergonomic Elixir API. Rather than consuming the OpenAPI spec for your third party and vomiting it out wholesale (leading to a crummy API that a human would never produce by hand), the generator gives you ways to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rename components of the API</li>
  <li>Group schemas into module namespaces</li>
  <li>Merge multiple, nearly-synonymous data structures into one</li>
  <li>…and much more</li>
</ul>

<p>You can see compare <a href="https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-github">AJ’s GitHub API wrapper</a> to what you get by default when you spit out the GitHub OpenAPI, and it’s night and day… and at a scale that an unpaid volunteer could never match if they tried to wrap the GitHub API by hand.</p>

<p>AJ gave a great talk at last year’s ElixirConf showing off the power of this stuff:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XSwxNgza7hE?si=p0xQt9Iu0LawU9_7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<h3 id="maintainability-over-time">Maintainability over time</h3>

<p>The last thing I’d like to mention is how very little churn there is in the Elixir ecosystem. In stark contrast to other stacks I’ve worked in, where taking even a “patch” update to a framework can require even experts to put in <em>hours</em> of frustrating debugging (as <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt/status/1748486057920963041">Gary Bernhardt recently bemoaned</a>), taking an update to Elixir or Phoenix is not much of an issue. If you’re like me and treat warnings as errors, you’ll frequently hit a few deprecations and the like, but those are almost always an easy fix. And that’s reflected in a recent pair of polls I ran<a href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-3-source">³</a>. The overwhelming majority of users are on versions of Elixir and Phoenix released within the last year or so, and less than 5% are on versions more than 3 years old.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/TylerAYoung/status/1748423976609554728"><img src="https://www.sleepeasy.app/assets/images/elixir-versions.png" alt="Elixir versions used in production; 82.1% of poll respondents are using Elixir 1.15 or newer; 15.5% are using 1.13 or 1.14; 0.5% are using 1.11 or 1.12; 1.9% are using 1.10 or earlier"></a></p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/TylerAYoung/status/1748689778650849630"><img src="https://www.sleepeasy.app/assets/images/phoenix-versions.png" alt="Phoenix versions used in production; 78.5% of poll respondents are using Phoenix 1.7; 16.8% are using 1.6; 1.9% are using 1.5; 2.8% are using 1.4 or earlier"></a></p>

<p>Elixir and Phoenix value stability, so it’s generally easy to get access to new features without a bunch of hassle.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<p>I’m not qualified to say Elixir is the right language choice for all apps everywhere. I’ve never worked in a big corporation, and my experience with Elixir has been largely focused on web and networking. I <em>do</em> feel comfortable evaluating it for the project I’m working on now, though, and for the needs of a one-person development team building a B2B SaaS, I don’t see any other stack that offers both the speed of getting started and the ability to grow in whatever direction your business takes you.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear any feedback you have—you can reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/TylerAYoung">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@tylerayoung">Mastodon</a>, or email (my first name at this domain).</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The Government of Canada hosts National Summit on Combatting Auto Theft. </p><div>
    <h3>Canada Border Services Agency</h3> 
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) provides critical support to law enforcement partners to disrupt, investigate and ultimately prosecute these crimes. Upfront, preventative and investigative work—within Canada, ahead of reaching the border—is imperative to reduce auto theft overall. The CBSA acts on 100% of referrals from local police and works closely with governments and jurisdictions to intercept stolen vehicles and identify criminal activity within the supply chain.</p> 
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/border-services-agency/news/2024/02/government-of-canada-announces-federal-investment-to-combat-export-of-stolen-vehicles.html">the Government of Canada is increasing the capacity of the CBSA</a> by investing $28 million to conduct more investigations and examinations of stolen vehicles, as well as enhance collaboration on investigations and intelligence sharing with partners across Canada and Internationally. This includes exploring detection technology solutions, and exploring the use of advanced analytical tools, such as artificial intelligence.</p> 
<h3>Royal Canadian Mounted Police</h3> 
<p>Local police have the primary responsibility to investigate stolen vehicle offences. The <a href="https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cisc-scrc.gc.ca%2Findex-eng.htm&amp;data=05%7C02%7CToni.Petter%40ps-sp.gc.ca%7C727986c0dc2f4a47b5a408dc21caf3b6%7C2d28dd40a4f24317a351bc709c183c85%7C0%7C0%7C638422403655886245%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=6mOYJqfZcnbYORBUSHksgA3nfAb2evuf3SGwd%2F1LMVk%3D&amp;reserved=0">Criminal Intelligence Service Canada</a>, stewarded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), coordinates criminal intelligence sharing and analysis between federal, provincial and municipal police forces. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>The RCMP leverages port enforcement capacity in select provinces as part of its Border Integrity Program, helping to identify, assess and respond to significant inbound and outbound threats at Canada’s borders, at seaports, airports, land ports of entry and between ports of entry into Canada.</p> 
<p>The RCMP works closely with its international partners and maintains strong relationships with law enforcement agencies worldwide. These relationships are essential to Canada’s ability to deal with global threats, such as serious and organized crime.</p> 
<h3>Justice Canada</h3> 
<p>Ensuring people in Canada feel safe in their communities is a top priority. Canada has a robust criminal law framework to address auto theft at various stages of the crime, as well as its links to organized crime. The Department of Justice Canada will, in consultation with provinces and territories, examine potential amendments to the <em>Criminal Code </em>to further strengthen the legal framework related to auto theft, including by reviewing existing offences and penalties.</p> 
<h3>Transport Canada</h3> 
<p>Transport Canada will modernize the Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards to ensure they consider technological advancements to deter and prevent auto theft. The Department will also work with public safety partners to identify cargo handling vulnerabilities through targeted security assessments of port facilities. Based on the assessments, the Department will work with port facilities on corrective actions and to implement updated security plans.</p> 
<h3>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED)</h3> 
<p>Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada will work with Canadian companies, and the automotive industry, to develop new solutions to protect vehicles against theft and to assist with recovery of stolen vehicles.</p> 
<p>ISED will pursue all avenues to ban devices used to steal vehicles by copying the wireless signals for remote keyless entry, such as the Flipper Zero, which would allow for the removal of those devices from the Canadian marketplace through collaboration with law enforcement agencies.</p>

<p>How long is “forever”? When it comes to digital media, forever could be as close as a couple of months away.</p>
<p>Funimation, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/12/att-sells-crunchyroll-to-sony-for-1-2b-amid-streamlining-efforts/">Sony-owned</a> streaming service for anime, recently <a href="https://help.funimation.com/hc/en-us/articles/23103586580244-Funimation-End-of-services">announced</a> that subscribers' digital libraries on the platform will be unavailable after April 2. For years, Funimation had been<a href="https://help.funimation.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046822091-How-long-do-I-get-to-keep-streaming-the-Digital-Copy-videos"> telling subscribers</a> that they could keep streaming these digital copies of purchased movies and shows, but qualifying it: “forever, but there are some restrictions.”</p>
<p>Funimation’s parent company, Sony, bought rival anime streaming service Crunchyroll in 2021. Since then, it was suspected that Sony would merge the offerings together somehow. This week, we learned how, as Funimation announced that its app and website would close on April 2, and Funimation accounts will become Crunchyroll accounts. Most of Funimation’s catalog is already on Crunchyroll, Funimation’s announcement claimed.</p>
<p>But in addition to offering video streaming, Funimation also dubbed and released anime as physical media, and sometimes those DVDs or Blu-rays would feature a digital code. Subscribers to the Funimation streaming service could add those digital codes to Funimation and then stream the content from the platform.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>With Funimation claiming that customers could access these digital copies “forever,” I could see why someone might have thought this was a reliable way to access their purchased media. For people lacking the space, resources, or interest in maintaining a library of physical media, this was a good way to preserve treasured shows and movies without spending more money. It also provided a simple way to access purchased media online if you were, for example, away on a trip and had a hankering to watch some anime DVDs you bought.</p>
<p>But soon, people who may have discarded or lost their physical media or lack a way to play DVDs and Blu-rays won't have a way to access the digital copies that they were entitled to through their physical copy purchase.</p>
<p>Funimation's announcement says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Please note that Crunchyroll does not currently support Funimation Digital copies, which means that access to previously available digital copies will not be supported. However, we are continuously working to enhance our content offerings and provide you with an exceptional anime streaming experience. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to explore the extensive anime library available on Crunchyroll.</p></blockquote>
<p>Regarding refunds, Funimation's announcement directed customers to its <a href="https://help.crunchyroll.com/hc/en-us/requests/new">support team</a> "to see the available options based on your payment method," but there's no mention of getting money back from a DVD or Blu-ray that you might not have purchased had you known you couldn't stream it "forever." </p>

<p>The <b>'doorway effect'</b> or <b>‘location updating effect</b>’ is a replicable psychological phenomenon characterized by short-term memory loss when passing through a doorway or moving from one location to another.<sup id="cite_ref-forgetting_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-forgetting-1">[1]</a></sup> We tend to forget items of recent significance immediately after crossing a boundary<sup id="cite_ref-multimodal_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-multimodal-2">[2]</a></sup> and often forget what we were thinking about or planning on doing upon entering a different room.<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> Research suggests that this phenomenon occurs both at literal boundaries (e.g., moving from one room to another via a door) and metaphorical boundaries (e.g., imagining traversing a doorway, or even when moving from one desktop window to another on a computer).<sup id="cite_ref-multimodal_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-multimodal-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>Memory is organized around specific events or episodes, such as attending a lecture or having a family meal, rather than being a continuous stream interrupted by sleep.<sup id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> This organization is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory" title="Episodic memory">episodic memory</a>, which involves receiving and storing information about events that are temporarily dated, along with their time and place relationships.<sup id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>

<p>Research on the doorway effect involves having people navigate virtual environments while picking up and putting down various objects. During these experiments, participants were given the names of these objects either (1) as they moved across a large room or (2) when they entered a new room (a spatial change). They then had to indicate whether the named object matched the one they had carried and eventually placed down. Findings indicating doorways act as event boundaries contribute towards wider understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory" title="Memory">memory</a> construction and retention. They indicate the significance of structures of the surrounding environment in how memories are objectively recalled, alongside how it is subjectively recalled: the valence of emotions, specific emotion felt, its intensity and duration.<sup id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p>
<ul><li><b>In 2006, Gabriel A. Radvansky and David E. Copeland</b><sup id="cite_ref-Situation_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-Situation-12">[12]</a></sup> performed the first experiments that demonstrated that successful recall of objects became less accessible with a spatial shift and dissociation from the person. This was measured by the moving of associated or dissociated objects through virtual rooms.<sup id="cite_ref-Situation_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-Situation-12">[12]</a></sup> Radvansky and Copeland had participants engage with short narratives where objects were either associated or dissociated from the participant. For example, a person might wear a sweatshirt (associated), take it off (dissociated), and go for a run. The researchers measured explicit factors like memory probes and comprehension, as well as implicit factors like reading times. The results showed that information about an object became less available when it was dissociated from the person, compared to when it was associated. These patterns aligned with previous research demonstrating how spatial shifts disrupt cognitive processing. However, it remained unclear to what extent the observed spatial effect was due to the association/dissociation of objects with the participant or the actual spatial change. Hence, Radvansky and Copeland aimed to separate and study these two components independently. To achieve this, they introduced rooms of varying sizes that virtually eliminated walls and doorways while maintaining consistent distance. This allowed them to assess the individual impacts of object association/dissociation and spatial shifts. Their conclusion was twofold: the effect related to object association/dissociation persisted, and there was clear evidence that moving through a doorway made highly available information less accessible. <i><b>Experiment 1</b></i> aimed to investigate if information availability about objects changed based on their association/dissociation with a person after spatial shifts. The <b>Standard Associated/Dissociated Effect</b> refers to the impact of relationships between objects and individuals within a dynamic situation in text comprehension. In simpler terms, how people react or feel when reading a story changes based on the relationships and changes over time. The researchers wanted to see if the patterns seen in text comprehension studies would apply in a virtual reality context, as predicted by situation model theory. Alternatively, traditional memory models might predict that spatial changes wouldn't affect memory. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that after spatial shifts, participants responded more accurately and quickly when objects remained associated with a person rather than being dissociated. This indicated that people actively monitor the spatial and relational aspects of a situation, affecting how information is stored in memory. This finding challenged memory theories that ignored environmental interactions. Even explicit rehearsal of object names experienced disruption. Thus, memory involves active interaction with context. While the effect was clear, it was uncertain what caused it—whether participants monitored what they carried or the spatial shift itself.
<ol><li><b>Participants</b>: They got 41 people (15 were female) from the University of Notre Dame. They got some extra participants, but had to remove data from 10 of them for different reasons.</li>
<li><b>Materials and Setup</b>: They used a program to create a virtual environment with 66 rooms. All the rooms were the same size, and each had a table with an object to pick up. There was also an empty spot on the table where the object from the previous room was supposed to be placed. The rooms had different wall patterns to show they were different. The doors in each room were never on the same wall.</li>
<li><b>Objects</b>: The objects were made by mixing colors and shapes. Colors included red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, gray, brown, and black. Shapes were cube, wedge, pole, disk, cross (X), and cone.</li>
<li><b>Display</b>: They used a large screen and a computer to show everything.</li>
<li><b>Procedure</b>: Participants sat in front of the big screen and were told to move objects from room to room. When they picked up an object, it disappeared, and when they placed it down, it reappeared on the table. The order they did these actions didn't matter. The doors to the next rooms only opened when they did both actions with the objects.</li>
<li><b>Memory Probe Trials</b>: There were 51 trials where they checked participants' memory. When they entered a room, a color and shape name showed up on the screen. They had to say "yes" if it matched the object they were carrying or the one they just put down. If it didn't match, they said "no." They used mouse buttons for "yes" and "no" and arrow keys to move in the virtual space. Some trials tested the associated object, some tested the dissociated object, and some were not related at all. The experiment took about 10 to 15 minutes. <i><b>Experiment 2</b></i> aimed to understand the contribution of object association/dissociation and spatial changes in the effect observed in Experiment 1. The researchers introduced rooms of different sizes, virtually eliminating walls and doorways to maintain consistent distance. This allowed them to analyze the independent impact of these factors.</li>
<li><b>Participants</b>: They got 54 people (26 were women) from the University of Notre Dame to take part. They had to exclude data from 11 participants for different reasons.</li>
<li><b>Materials and Procedure</b>: They used the same tools and methods as in Experiment 1 to create virtual environments. They made two types of rooms - some were big, and some were small. Essentially, they removed walls and doorways to change how the rooms looked, but the distance traveled remained the same. This change affected whether there was a change in the space.</li>
<li><b>No-Shift Trials</b>: In these trials, when someone entered a large room, part of it was darkened, and there was an invisible barrier to stop them from going to the wrong part of the room with the wrong table. The barrier disappeared after they put the object on the correct table and picked up the next one. A memory question came up when they entered the second half of the room.</li>
<li><b>Shift Trials</b>: In these trials, they made a space change. But not every time there was a change did they ask a memory question.</li>
<li><b>Results</b>: Experiment 2 found that the effect they saw in Experiment 1, where the connection between objects and a person affected memory, was seen again. This effect persisted even when there was no space change. Additionally, making a space change had its own effect. Passing through a doorway made information that's usually easy to remember harder to access. However, less important information was less affected. This shows that different things, like how things are connected and the space context, impact how people understand situations. Overall, this research provides insights into how memory is influenced by our interactions with our environment. It demonstrates that the doorway effect disrupts memory due to the need to update our mental representation when transitioning to a new room. This updating process demands cognitive effort and coordination, affecting processing and leading to errors. While more research is needed, this study sheds light on the interplay between physical experiences and mental understanding.</li></ol></li></ul>
<ul><li><b>2011, Gabriel A. Radvansky, Sabine A. Krawietz, and Andrea K. Tamplin</b> from the Department of Psychology, University of Notre Dame<sup id="cite_ref-forgetting_1-1"><a href="#cite_note-forgetting-1">[1]</a></sup> <i><b>Experiment 1</b></i> aimed to understand how reducing the level of immersion impacts the location-updating effect. If this effect requires high immersion because event updating demands direct experience and structural environment influences, reducing screen size might diminish immersion and the effect. Alternatively, if the effect results from tracking information across events, regardless of immersion, the location-updating effect should still be observable. In this experiment, we used standard 17'' diagonal monitors instead of larger ones (66'') to reduce immersion.
<ol><li><b>Participants:</b> Fifty-five participants (31 female) were recruited from the University of Notre Dame participant pool and received partial course credit for their participation.</li>
<li><b>Materials and Setup:</b> The virtual environment was created using the Valve Hammer program. Standard 17'' diagonal monitors were used for display. The environment had 55 rooms, varying in two sizes with equated travel distance in shift and no-shift conditions. Each room contained one or two rectangular tables with objects to be picked up. Doorways were not on the same wall to prevent repetition.</li>
<li><b>Objects:</b> Objects were combinations of colors and shapes, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white, grey, brown, and black. Shapes included cube, wedge, pole, disc, cross (X), and cone.</li>
<li><b>Procedure:</b> Participants were seated about 0.67 meters from the display and instructed to pick up objects, move to the next table by walking across a large room (no shift) or through a doorway (shift), place the object on the table, pick up the next object, and so on. Picking up and placing objects was done by touching the table. Progression through rooms was controlled by closing doors behind participants and opening them after objects were placed on the table. Probe trials involved participants responding "yes" if the probe matched the carried or set-down object and "no" otherwise. Positive and negative probes were presented in both shift and no-shift conditions. The procedure lasted around 15 to 20 minutes. This experiment investigated the impact of reduced immersion on the location-updating effect, shedding light on whether immersion level affects event updating or if tracking information across events is the primary factor influencing this effect. In summary, even with a less immersive setup, there was still a location-updating effect. Memory performance was worse after a change in location, indicating that updating the mental representation of an event can disrupt memory. However, when looking at the error rate data, the absence of an event updating effect in the response time data is unclear. This outcome cannot be interpreted as reduced forgetfulness since the pattern of error rates remains the same. A plausible explanation is that the smaller display size decreased the portion of the visual angle (248 vs. 808) that needs active monitoring, resulting in overall faster response times (358 ms faster on average in this study) and potentially masking the observation of a response time difference. <i><b>Experiment 2</b></i> aimed to determine if the location-updating effect could be observed in a real environment with maximal immersion compared to mediated experiences on a computer screen. Real experiences are considered nonmediated, while virtual environments might lack cues that real settings offer for accurate performance. Previous evidence suggests that virtual environments can lead to cognitive deficits tied to their impoverished nature relative to real environments. The study speculated that the scarcity of spatial cues in virtual environments might explain why location shifts are more disruptive. However, according to an event cognition perspective, the need to monitor and update an event model should apply to real situations as well. To adapt the experiment's principles to real-world constraints, three larger rooms were used from the laboratory. The study included three location shifts where participants moved between rooms. Within each room, a no-shift condition involved performing a task at one table and then crossing the room to perform the next task. For practicality, half of the participants concluded their last trial by returning to the original room. To ensure sufficient observations, six objects were moved during each trial. This approach allowed the study to explore the location-updating effect within a real-world context while addressing logistical challenges. Sixty participants (28 female) from the University of Notre Dame took part in Experiment 2, earning partial course credit. The study aimed to assess the location-updating effect in a maximally immersive real-world environment, contrasting with virtual settings. Participants navigated a three-room environment, with varying room sizes and movement conditions. Colored blocks were used in trials where participants picked up objects and then completed a recognition test, preceded by a distractor task. Each trial comprised 12 recognition probes, and the procedure lasted around 15 to 20 minutes. Experiment 2 confirmed a location-updating effect in a real-world setting, paralleling findings from virtual environments. Memory decline was evident after spatial shifts compared to simple room crossings, aligning with an event cognition perspective. Updating event models upon location change led to memory costs, causing previously relevant information to become less accessible. In <i><b>Experiment 3</b></i>, an alternative explanation for the location-updating effect was explored. This explanation suggested that forgetting might arise due to differences in environmental context during retrieval compared to encoding. Different rooms could serve as distinct contexts, potentially leading to poorer memory retrieval when the context differs. To investigate this, Experiment 3 introduced a return condition, where participants went back to the original location after a spatial shift. Additionally, a double shift condition involved two spatial shifts without returning to the original room. The results aimed to differentiate between an event horizon model and encoding specificity accounts of memory disruption. Forty-eight participants (28 female) from the University of Notre Dame were involved. Virtual environments were displayed on a 66'' diagonal Smartboard, enhancing immersion. The virtual space comprised 88 rooms of varying sizes. Objects were placed on rectangular tables in each room. The procedure included memory probe trials after spatial shifts, with 64 trials in total. The experiment lasted around 15 to 20 minutes. The findings aimed to shed light on whether memory disruption is influenced by the number of rooms traversed or the change in contextual cues during retrieval. In general, the response time data closely mirrored the findings from the analysis of error rates. Notably, the absence of improvement when returning to the original context is a crucial observation. This robustly dismisses the possibility of a context-based explanation for the location-updating effect.</li></ol></li>

<p>In a 2021 study, researchers at Bond University tried to replicate the doorway effect in four experiments: in both physical rooms and virtual rooms, and both with and without the participants doing a “distractor task” (counting backwards). In one experiment -- in virtual rooms, and with a distractor task -- doorways caused a statistically significant increase in false positives (i.e., false memories), but not false negatives (i.e., forgetting). In the other three experiments, doorways had no effect. The researchers suggested that this was consistent with real life, in which "we might occasionally forget a single item we had in mind after walking into a new room but, crucially, this usually happens when we have other things on our mind . . . ."<sup id="cite_ref-multimodal_2-3"><a href="#cite_note-multimodal-2">[2]</a></sup>
</p><p>One of the study authors, psychologist Oliver Baumann, speculated that it might be “possible to ‘immunise’ yourself against forgetting. ‘“If we are single-minded in what we want to do, nothing will stop us remembering. But if we have multiple things going on, forgetfulness becomes noticeable.’”<sup id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup>

<p>Separate studies on the presence of a doorway effect elicited incongruences with typical rhythms of life. Some suggest it may be reasonable to expect that humans should instead be rather facile with dealing with movement from one location to another, and its effects on memory recall – especially with objects one was recently carrying. It has been separately proposed that the doorway effect might be attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-preservation" title="Self-preservation">self-preservation</a> behaviours, evoking alertness towards the lurking of predators on the edge of openings when crossing such thresholds.
