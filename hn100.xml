                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Nearly 200 people have been charged in a sweeping nationwide crackdown on health care fraud schemes with false claims topping $2.7 billion, <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice">the Justice Department</a></span> said on Thursday. </p><p><span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/merrick-garland">Attorney General Merrick Garland</a></span> announced the charges against doctors, nurse practitioners and others across the U.S. accused of a variety of scams, including a $900 million scheme in Arizona targeting dying patients. </p><p>“It does not matter if you are a trafficker in a drug cartel or a corporate executive or medical professional employed by a health care company,” Garland told reporters. “If you profit from the unlawful distribution of controlled substances, you will be held accountable.” </p><p>In the Arizona case, prosecutors have accused two owners of wound care companies of accepting more than $330 million in kickbacks as part of a scheme to fraudulently bill Medicare for amniotic wound grafts, which are dressings to help heal wounds. </p>
    

<p>Nurse practitioners were pressured to apply the wound grafts to elderly patients who didn’t need them, including people in hospice care, the Justice Department said. Some patients died the day they received the grafts or within days, court papers say. </p>



<p>In less than two years, more than $900 million in bogus claims were submitted to Medicare for grafts that were used on fewer than 500 patients, prosecutors said. </p><p>The owners of the wound care companies, Alexandra Gehrke and Jeffrey King, were arrested this month at the Phoenix airport as they were boarding a flight to London, according to court papers urging a judge to keep them behind bars while they await trial. An attorney for Gehrke declined to comment, and a lawyer for King didn’t immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press.</p>
    
<p>Authorities allege Gehrke and King, who got married this year, knew charges were coming and had been preparing to flee. At their home, authorities found a book titled “How To Disappear: Erase Your Digital Footprint, Leave False Trails, and Vanish Without a Trace,” according to court papers. In one of their bags packed for their flight, there was a book titled “Criminal Law Handbook: Know Your Rights, Survive The System,” the papers say.</p>
    

<p>Gehrke and King lived lavishly off the scheme, prosecutors allege, citing luxury cars, a nearly $6 million home and more than $520,000 in gold bars, coins and jewelry. Officials seized more than $52 million from Gehrke’s personal and business bank accounts after her arrest, prosecutors say. </p><p>In total, 193 people — including 76 doctors, nurse practitioners, and other licensed medical professionals — were charged in a series of separate cases brought over about two weeks in the nationwide health care fraud sweep. Authorities seized more than $230 million in cash, luxury cars and other assets. The Justice Department carries out these sweeping health care fraud efforts periodically to help deter other potential wrongdoers. </p><p>In another scheme targeting Native Americans, phony sober living homes were set up promising addiction treatment. Claims were then submitted for services that were never actually performed, officials said. </p>
    

<p>Another case alleges a scheme in Florida to distribute misbranded HIV drugs. Prosecutors say drugs were bought on the black market and resold to unsuspecting pharmacies, which then provided the medications to patients. </p><p>Some patients were given bottles that contained different drugs than the label showed. One patient ended up unconscious for 24 hours after taking what he was led to believe was his HIV medication but was actually an anti-psychotic drug, prosecutors say. </p><h2>___</h2><p>Follow the AP’s coverage of the U.S. Department of Justice at <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice">https://apnews.com/hub/us-department-of-justice</a></span>.</p>

<p>An upgrade from Python 3.11 to 3.12 has led to the rejection of
some Python apps by Apple's app stores. That led to Eric Froemling submitting a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522">bug report</a>
against CPython. That, in turn, led to an interesting
discussion among Python developers about how far the project was
willing to go to accommodate app store review processes. Developers
reached a quick consensus, and a solution that may arrive as soon as
Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>

<p>The problem at hand is that Apple's macOS App Store is
automatically rejecting apps that contain the string
"itms-services". That is the URL scheme for apps that
want to ask Apple's iTunes Store to install another
app. Software distributed via Apple's macOS store is
sandboxed, and sandboxed apps are prohibited from using URLs
with the <tt>itms-services</tt> scheme. That string is in the
<tt><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">urllib</a></tt>
parser in Python's standard library, though an application may never actually use
the <tt>itms-services</tt> handler.</p>

<p>Of course, Apple did not do anything so
straightforward as to <em>explain</em> this to Froemling. Once
he filed an appeal with Apple about the rejection, Apple finally told him that
<tt>parse.py</tt> and <tt>parse.pyc</tt> were the offending
files. After that, <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/120522#issuecomment-2169031927">he
said</a>, it was not hard to track down the problem:</p>

<blockquote>
Now in retrospect I'm frustrated I didn't think to run a full text
search for itms-services over Python itself earlier or stumble across
one of the <a href="https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/issues/1655">other
cases</a> of folks hitting this.
</blockquote>

<p>Russell Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011">started the discussion</a> in the Python Core
Development discussion forum on June&nbsp;17. He wanted to know whether "<q>acceptable to app
stores</q>" should be a design goal for CPython, or if that compliance
should be a problem left to the tools that generate application
bundles for app stores.</p>

<h4>Paranoid and inscrutable</h4>

<p>Keith-Magee noted in his initial question that Apple's review processes were the
most "<q>paranoid and inscrutable</q>" of app-store-review processes,
but that other app stores also had "<q>validation and acceptance processes
that are entirely opaque</q>". One solution might be to obfuscate the
offending string to pass review, but that might "<q>lead to an obfuscation arms race</q>" and
there were no guarantees this would be the last time the project had
to resolve app-validation problems. The other option, he said, was to
consider this to be a distribution problem and leave it to tools like
<a href="https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/briefcase/">Briefcase</a>,
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/py2app/">py2app</a>, and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/buildozer/">buildozer</a> to
solve. Traditionally, they have had to patch CPython anyway, he said,
because it did not support Android or iOS "out of the box". But that
will change with Python 3.13 when no patching should be required for
those platforms.</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Alex Gaynor <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/3">suggested</a> that the project try a
an approach that Keith-Magee had not put forward inspired by
Gaynor's experience with the <a href="https://cryptography.io/en/latest/">cryptography</a> library.
The project often receives complaints that the library refuses
to parse a certificate that is technically invalid, but was in wide
use. He said that the policy was to accept pull
requests that work around those issues "<q>provided they are small,
localized, and generally aren't too awful</q>". 
But, he added, these patches should only be accepted on the condition
that someone complains to the third party (in this case Apple), and extracts
some kind of commitment that they would do something about it. He
suggested that the workaround be time-limited, to give users a decent
experience "<q>while also not letting large firms simply externalize
their bizarre issues onto OSS projects</q>".</p>

<p>Brandt Bucher <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/4">wondered</a>
whether obfuscation was even allowed, or if it would be seen as
circumventing the review process. That was a question no one seemed to
have an answer to; and Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/6">responded</a> with an&nbsp;8-Ball emoji and
the phrase "<q>ask again later</q>." He added that Gaynor's approach
sounded appealing, but it would be like screaming into the
void. Apple, he said, barely has an appeals process and there is no
channel available to the Python project "<q>to raise a complaint that
we could reasonably believe would result in a change of
policy</q>".</p>

<p>Another approach, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/12">suggested</a>
by Alyssa Coghlan, would be to use a JSON configuration file that
<tt>urllib</tt> would read to set up its module level attributes
"<q>rather than hardcoding its knowledge of all the relevant schemes</q>".
That could allow app generators to drop "itms-services"
from the configuration file rather than patching <tt>urllib.py</tt>
directly. Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/13">said</a> that could work, but "<q>it strikes me as a
bit of overkill for an edge case</q>" that could be handled by
obfuscation or distribution-level patching.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;20, Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/16">wrote</a>
that he had thought of another approach: adding a build-time option
called "<tt>--with-app-store-patch</tt>" that removes code that is
known to be problematic. He said it would be enabled
by default for the iOS platform, and disabled elsewhere. It could be
used when building an application for macOS, if the developer intended
to distribute that application via the macOS App Store. He suggested
that the option could also accept a path to a file with a patch, to
allow distributors to provide an updated patch if an app store changes
its rules after the maintenance window for a Python release has
closed.</p>

<h4>Let's paint the bikeshed</h4>

<p>Coghlan <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/20">asked</a>
if it was now time to "<q>paint a config option bikeshed</q>". She
said that the proposed option name was both too broad and too
narrow. The "app-store" component of the name was too broad, because
it could encompass any app store, not only Apple app stores. The
"patch" component was too narrow, because patch specifies the
method of complying with policies rather than intent. There may be
other methods required to comply with app-store-compliance
checks. Keith-Magee liked the suggestion about dropping "patch" from
the option name, and suggested painting the bikeshed a nice shade of
"<tt>--with-app-store-compliance</tt>" that would interact with
platform identification to sort out what is required.</p>

<p>On June&nbsp;25, Keith-Magee <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/handling-incompatibilities-with-app-store-review-processes/56011/31">thanked</a>
participants in the discussion for their input, and pointed to a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/120984">pull request</a>
that would implement the <tt>--with-app-store-compliance</tt>
configuration option. In the request, he noted that it would be
possible to use the option with platforms other than iOS or macOS, but
there were no use cases for that at present. If all goes well, it
should be available in Python&nbsp;3.13.</p>

<p>It is frustrating that free-software projects like Python have to
waste time finding ways around opaque review processes just so
developers can write software for non-free platforms. However, the
approach taken by Keith-Magee and other CPython developers seems to be
the least-bad option that offers the best experience for Python
application developers. It will almost certainly not be the last time that a
project runs into this problem.</p><br clear="all">

				<p>The company best known for RStudio, the leading integrated development environment (IDE) for R programmers, has quietly launched a “next-generation” IDE designed specifically for both R and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3204016/what-is-python-powerful-intuitive-programming.html">Python</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/posit-dev/positron" rel="nofollow">Positron IDE</a> is available in public beta as of today for macOS, Windows, and Linux.</p><p>Created by Boston-based Posit PBC, formerly RStudio, Positron is based on Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3666488/what-is-visual-studio-code-microsofts-extensible-code-editor.html">Visual Studio Code</a>. Users of VS Code will likely find Positron’s look and feel rather familiar, with panels for writing code and viewing code output, consoles and terminals, and an activity bar at the far left offering options for file navigation, version control, debugging, and extensions. However, Positron is packaged out of the box to be easier to set up, especially for R users but also for Python.</p><p>There’s no need to install extensions in order to get R up and running in Positron, as is <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3625488/how-to-run-r-in-visual-studio-code.html%20">the case with VS Code</a>. Likewise you don’t have to install an extension for Positron to run Python. In fact, you’re cautioned <em>not</em> to install the usual VS Code extensions for R and Python in Positron, since the IDE already comes with that functionality built-in. For both languages, you should have the basic language files installed on your system, as well as the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/" rel="nofollow">IPykernel</a> package to run Python. Positron easily found both my R and Python installations at first launch.</p><figure><a href="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/06/positron_opening_screen-100963305-orig.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" rel="nofollow"><img alt="positron opening screen" width="1200" height="739" data-imageid="100963305" data-license="IDG" data-original="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/06/positron_opening_screen-100963305-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70" loading="lazy" src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2024/06/positron_opening_screen-100963305-large.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70"></a> <small>IDG</small></figure><p>You can install other VS Code extensions in Positron if you want them, though. Because Microsoft does not allow third-party IDEs to access the official VS Code Marketplace, Positron extensions are installed via the <a href="https://open-vsx.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenVSX registry</a>. “Posit is a major sponsor of OpenVSX,” Posit noted in its Positron wiki. Not all VS Code extension authors also submit and regularly update their projects to OpenVSX, however.</p><p>Posit calls the project “a next-generation data science IDE” and “an extensible polyglot tool for writing code and exploring data.” It has a built-in, easy-to-use data and variable explorer, which includes options like sorting and filtering data frames. It can be accessed by clicking an icon, for both R and Python data.</p><p>“The Data Explorer is intended to complement code-first exploration of data, allowing you to display data in a spreadsheet-like grid, temporarily filter and sort data, and provide useful summary statistics directly inside of Positron,” according to the project wiki. “The goal of the Data Explorer is not to replace code-based workflows, but rather supplement with ephemeral views of the data or summary statistics as you further explore or modify the data via code.”</p><p>There are other welcome little tweaks in Positron, such as cmd/ctrl + enter running one line of a Python script and then moving your cursor to the next line of code. This can be surprisingly helpful for quick code examination outside of the debug tool. If you are working on a project that combines both R and Python scripts, which I increasingly do as an R user working with generative AI, the IDE also easily pops up the correct console when you switch between scripts in both languages.</p><p>The repo cautions that Positron is “an early stage project under active development.” Users should keep that in mind when weighing how and when to try it out.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/fcc-rule-would-make-carriers-unlock-all-phones-after-60-days/">https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/27/fcc-rule-would-make-carriers-unlock-all-phones-after-60-days/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40814728">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p id="speakable-summary">The FCC wants to make it significantly easier for consumers to unlock their phones from their carriers, proposing that all devices must be unlockable just 60 days after purchase. How this will mesh with current plans and phone-buying trends, however, is something the agency is hoping to learn before putting such a rule into effect.</p>

<p>Mobile phones purchased from a carrier are generally locked to that carrier until either the contract is up or the phone is paid off. But despite <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/15/if-you-want-tech-freedom-congress-needs-to-change-a-law/">improvements to the process over the years </a>(unlocking was <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2013/01/26/unlocking-your-phone-is-now-illegal-but-what-does-that-mean-for-you/">flat-out illegal </a>not long ago), it still isn’t quite clear to all consumers when and how they can unlock their phone and take it to the carrier (or country) of their choice.</p>

	
	


<p>To be clear, this is not about opening up your phone using a face, fingerprint or password, but changing settings in its software to allow it to work with different mobile networks.</p>

<p>FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel announced the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-proposes-mobile-phone-unlocking-requirement">in a press release Thursday</a>. “When you buy a phone, you should have the freedom to decide when to change service to the carrier you want and not have the device you own stuck by practices that prevent you from making that choice,” she wrote. “That is why we are proposing clear, nationwide mobile phone unlocking rules.”</p>

	
	


<p>Specifically, the release says, carriers would simply have to provide unlocking services 60 days after activation. A welcome standard, but it may run afoul of today’s phone and wireless markets.</p>

<p>For instance, although the dreaded two-year contract is no longer forced on most consumers, many still opt for them to lock in the price and get other benefits. And perhaps more to the point, the phones themselves are often paid for in what amount to installment plans: You get a phone for “free” and then pay it off over the next few years.</p>

<p>The NPRM is the stage of FCC rulemaking where it has a draft rule but has not yet solicited public feedback. Only July 18, the agency will publish the full document and open up commentary on the above issues. And you can be sure there will be some squawking from mobile providers!</p>


	
	


<p>Not knowing the specifics of the proposed rule, we can’t be sure how it would mix with these common pay-over-time details. But unlocking a phone doesn’t free someone from needing to pay the device off — they can just use it on other networks if they want. And if a carrier lets you buy a phone outright from it but locks it to the bands for six months or a year out of sheer greed, this would offer an early exit.</p>

	
	


<p>As Rosenworcel said, the point of the rule is to offer consistency and transparency: a simple, national rule from regulators setting a reasonable limit on how and whether carriers can lock down devices. We’ll know more in July when the full NPRM is published.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="a18ceec073330138c96eaeed00e512fa" data-plugin="LayoutElement"><h5>Plan It Now,</h5>

<h5>Build It Later</h5>



<p><span>Project management is not just a tool to mislead the client into thinking you're actually doing something.</span></p>

<p><span>It can also be used to create a high quality product, on time, and slightly over budget.</span></p>

<p><span>For the second lighthouse I project managed, designed and then 3D printed all the parts, It looks great, and fits the brief completely.</span></p>

<p><span>But guess which one I now prefer.</span></p>

<p><span>So two lighthouses later, I realised that the act of planning sometimes loses the spirit of the idea.</span></p>

<p><span>Even so, I decided to try to plan and manage the Valve.Computer project, and fortunately, as the build grew, it gained more spirit than I can shake a stick at.</span></p>
</div><div id="a18ceec0733303a102bddc43e1de045d" data-plugin="LayoutElement"><h5>The Valve.Computer Project</h5>



<p><span>My stepdaughter is a senior Product Manager and my stepson is a Chartered Engineer and he frequently works as a Project Manager. They would know how to manage this project. Luckily they are too successful and busy to ever read this, thank goodness!</span></p>

<p><span>I tried doing the project management on a PC but gave up, and instead used 3 coloured pens, A4 paper and self adhesive address labels to cover up my mistakes. I simply found it easier. The only problem I discovered is that the paper gets a bit thick after several layers of amendments, but the big advantage is that can always find your last version, it's simply the thickest.</span></p>

<p><span>The main thing I discovered over the year was that the first time I tried almost anything I failed, but the annoying experience often enabled future success.</span></p>

<p><span>I started by stabbing at various bits of the idea. Eventually I was able to define what I wanted to do. I now realise that this definition, was the most important part of the whole project management.</span></p>

<p><span>The program seemed to consist of many complex components, all of which I needed to understand, to be able to build the Valve.Computer.</span></p>

<p><span>How do thermionic valves work, how do you design a PCB, and how on earth do you get from a NOR gate, to a memory register, via microcodes from a clock and a ROM, to actually run software. And what exactly is a microcode anyway. At times, in fact most of the time, it all just seemed impossible.</span></p>

<p><span>The main solutions I found were, firstly to keep the number of unique sub systems to an absolute minimum, secondly to use double triode valves to halve the physical size, which also reduced the construction time, and thirdly, to design multi layer printed circuit boards to reduce the inevitable build errors and produce a robust construction.</span></p>



<p><span>So far it has only gone BANG twice. The first time I pulled out plugs like my life depended on it, and Judy cried, “Everything all right!”. The second time I only slightly panicked, and Judy continued to decorate the Christmas tree, but later bought me a surpise present, a fire extinguisher!</span></p>



<p><span>But most important of all, is to have a lovely wife, who knows you're daft as a brush, and that life together is brilliant.</span></p>

It would release a trove of million documents related to the marketing of OxyContin.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4KY6HZCEF5D3RICGD3VAFSD7VE" data-el="text" dir="null">In 2021, a U.S. District Court judge <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/12/16/purdue-pharma-sackler-ruling/?itid=lk_inline_manual_21&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_52" target="_blank">overturned</a> the deal initially approved in bankruptcy court, ruling that the family members cannot be exempted from future claims. The 2nd Circuit reversed and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2023/05/30/opioids-court-ruling-purdue-pharma-sackler-family/?itid=lk_inline_manual_9&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_27&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_52" target="_blank">approved</a> the bankruptcy plan, saying that shielding the Sacklers from lawsuits was needed to “ensure the fair distribution” of settlement money.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2KGAD3RLJRBHVBRNRJFXKUZSYM" data-el="text" dir="null">The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to intervene. Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar told the court that under bankruptcy law, the rights of alleged victims to sue cannot be taken away without their consent. Purdue said the Justice Department’s position would allow a single person to veto the plan despite overwhelming support from 50 states and thousands of victims and local governments.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IS3RBAPR3BBATODLN4MXDICYDM" data-el="text" dir="null">While Thursday’s Supreme Court decision signals renewed negotiations for the company in bankruptcy court, other lawsuits may now proceed against the Sacklers.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WEVY4DDS2NDCZI2KLLT4KULW74" data-el="text" dir="null">Unless settlements are hashed out this summer, those lawsuits consolidated in the Ohio multidistrict litigation will proceed in September, said Jayne Conroy, a lead attorney who serves on a committee representing opioid plaintiffs. She noted that the bankruptcy process has cost Purdue more than $1 billion in legal and administrative fees, money that could have gone toward communities reeling from opioid addiction.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KXP77N54YNFCNFFFFUNR7GYW7Q" data-el="text" dir="null">“We’re going to continue to push to find the Sacklers responsible and liable and get justice for the victims,” Conroy said.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NYNDUGECVZETTLBO53BMW2IFR4" data-el="text" dir="null">The upending of the Purdue deal highlights the need for local governments and states to thoughtfully spend<b> </b>billions of dollars that other companies implicated in the opioid crisis have paid out, said Sara Whaley, a health policy expert at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p><p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OROVZVC7PNHKBIWLML6VTBEF7Y" data-el="text" dir="null">“Another $6 billion would have been great — but $50 billion still need to be spent,” Whaley said.</p></div></div>]]></description>

Unfortunately, there are several rare edge cases. As a tool moves from academic prototype to production-ready, obscure cases can and do occur. This results in loop analysis being a key source of late-discovered but significant algorithmic bugs. To avoid these, this paper presents a collection of examples and "folklore" challenges in loop analysis.</p></section><section id="backmatter" role="doc-bibliography" data-extent="backmatter"><h2>References</h2><div role="list"><div role="listitem" data-has="label"><p>[1]</p><div id="ref-00001"><p>2023.

<p>Linux and its code are made by people, and people are not with us forever. Over the weekend, a <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-wireless/ds6wc3svkyre4p2rwg4f76o67xndazaeoyjwblhuzichscyxoz@5ttdvbymxr55/T/#mfd2f4928e0e013c10375ca766035c1385e18f8e0">brief message on the Linux kernel mailing list</a> reminded everyone of just how much one person can mean to a seemingly gargantuan project like Linux, and how quickly that person can disappear.</p>
<p>Denise Finger, wife of the deceased, wrote to the Linux Wireless list on Friday evening:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is to notify you that Larry Finger, one of your developers, passed away on June 21st.</p></blockquote>
<p>LWN.net reckons that <a href="https://hkfuneralhome.com/larry-finger/">Finger, 84</a>, contributed to 94 Linux kernel releases, or 1,464 commits total, at least since <a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_2_6_16">kernel 2.6.16 in 2006</a> (and when the kernel started using git to track changes). Given the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/linus-torvalds-reiterates-his-tabs-versus-spaces-stance-with-a-kernel-trap/">sometimes precarious nature of contributing to the kernel</a>, this is on its own an impressive achievement—especially for someone with no formal computer training and who considered himself a scientist.</p>
<h2>The deepest of trenches: Linux Wi-Fi in the 2000s</h2>
<p>That kind of effort is worth celebrating, regardless. But it's the space that Finger devoted himself to that makes him a notably patient, productive contributor.</p>
<p>Getting Wi-Fi to work on a device running Linux back when Finger started contributing was awful. The chances of your hardware being recognized, activated, and working properly right after install was akin to getting a straight flush in poker. If nobody had gotten around to your wireless chipset yet, you used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper">NDISwrapper</a>, a Windows-interfacing kludge tool that simultaneously made your Linux install less open and yet still painful to install and maintain.</p>
<p>Finger started fixing this with work on <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx">Broadcom's BCM43XX drivers</a>. Broadcom provided no code for its gear, so Finger helped reverse-engineer the necessary specs by manually dumping and reading hardware registers. Finger also provided numerous Realtek drivers. Many commenters across blogs and message boards are noting that their systems are still using pieces of Finger's code today.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Fixing mainframes, science gear, and RV resorts</h2>
<figure><img alt="Larry Finger, and fish, from his Quora profile." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpeg" width="200" height="200"><figcaption><p>Larry Finger, and fish, from his Quora profile.</p><p>Quora</p></figcaption></figure><p>Finger doesn't have a large footprint on the web, outside of his hundreds of kernel commits. He has <a href="http://dwanderer-at-lwfinger.net/">a page for DRAWxtl</a>, open-source software that produces crystal-structure drawings, on his personal domain, but not a personal homepage. He <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Larry-Finger-1">sometimes answered Quora questions</a>. He had <a href="https://github.com/lwfinger">a GitHub profile</a> showing more than 100 contributions to projects in 2024.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest insight into Finger that can be found in one spot is a three-part series for Linux Journal, "<a href="https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/8084">Linux in a Windows Workstation Environment</a>," written in 2005 when he was roughly 65. He summarizes his background: Fortran programmer in 1963, PDP-11 interfaces to scientific instruments in the 1970s, VAX-11/780 work in the early 1980s, and then Unix/Linux systems, until retiring from <a href="https://carnegiescience.edu/about/our-history">the Carnegie Institution for Science</a> in Washington, DC, in 1999. The mineral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerite">Fingerite</a>, an extremely rare specimen, is named for Finger. His work in crystallography took him on a fellowship to northern Bavaria, as <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-speed-limit-on-the-autobahn-Ive-heard-stories-of-people-driving-insane-speeds-of-150+-MPH?no_redirect=1">noted in one Quora answer</a> about the Autobahn.</p>
<p>After retirement, Finger writes in Linux Journal, "I became a full-time RV resident, dedicated to the avoidance of cold weather." He and his wife Denise arrived that year at a 55-plus RV community in Mesa, Arizona. He joined the computer club there, which had a growing number of Windows PCs sharing a DSL connection, managed by one of the systems running WinGate. A new RV resort owner wanted to expand to 22 workstations, but WinGate licenses for that many connections would have been too expensive for the club. Finger, who was "highly distrustful of using Windows 98 in a mission-critical role," set to work building a DIY Linux replacement.</p>
<p>Finger goes on across the series to describe the various ways he upgraded the routing and server capacity of the network, which grew to 38 user stations, individual Samba shares, a membership database, VPN tunnels, several free RJ-45 ports, and "free Wi-Fi access... throughout the park."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Passing it along</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpg" data-height="2400" data-width="1920" alt="Larry Finger, from his obituary page."><img alt="Larry Finger, from his obituary page." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger-640x800.jpg" width="640" height="800" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger-1280x1600.jpg 2x"></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/larry_finger.jpg" data-height="2400" data-width="1920">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Larry Finger, from his obituary page.</p><p>Hixson-Klein Funeral Home</p></figcaption></figure><p>Lots of people have commented on the crucial work Finger did to make Linux usable for more people. A few mention that Finger also mentored people, the kind of unseen work that has exponential effects. "<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/979460/">MB" wrote on LWN.net</a> that Finger "mentored other people to get the Broadcom Open Source code into kernel. And I think it was a huge success. And that was only a small part of Larry's success story."</p>
<p>In a 2023 <a href="https://www.quora.com/Can-an-average-person-contribute-something-substantial-to-the-Linux-kernel-without-having-any-formal-training-in-Computer-Science">Quora response</a> to someone asking if someone without "any formal training in computer science" can "contribute something substantial" to Linux, Finger writes, "I think that I have." Finger links to the <a href="https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/936113/70fa396ea7bd8594/">stats for the 6.4 kernel</a>, showing 172,346 lines of his code in it, roughly 0.5 percent of the total.</p>
<blockquote><p>I have never taken any courses in Computer Science; however, I have considerable experience in coding, much of which happened when computers were a lot less powerful than today, and it was critical to write code that ran efficiently.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finger suggests in his response to start by focusing on small patches, deep reading of the guidelines, and always using git's send-email to send patches: "Nothing will get shot down more quickly than a patch submitted from a mailer such as Thunderbird." Finding typos and errors in comments and text strings can help, too, especially in projects that involve contributors across countries. Finger advises being patient, expecting criticism about following rules and formats, and to keep plugging away at it.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-resource-to-learn-about-Linux-kernel-driver-development-I-have-consulted-references-like-Linux-kernel-development-and-Linux-device-drivers-but-they-are-very-old-and-difficult-to-follow/answer/Larry-Finger-1">another Quora response</a> about kernel driver development, Finger says, "This activity can be highly rewarding, and also equally frustrating!" You should learn C, Finger suggested, and maybe start with analyzing USB drivers, and take your time learning about DMA.</p>
<p>"Do not lose hope," Finger wrote. "It took me about 2 years before I could do anything more than tell the experts where my system was generating a fault."</p>

The outlet was initially alerted to the situation by a cybersecurity researcher. The name associated with the stolen credentials matched the name of a person on LinkedIn who is listed as a Network Operations Center Manager at AU10TIX, 404 writes. The credentials allowed entry into a logging platform, where data related to the users of some client platforms appeared to be visible. The cybersecurity researcher provided screenshots of the data that could be accessed using the credentials, and 404 breaks it down like this:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The accessible information includes the person’s name, date of birth, nationality, identification number, and the type of document uploaded such as a drivers’ license. A subsequent link then includes an image of the identity document itself; some of those are American drivers’ licenses.</p></blockquote><p>Gizmodo reached out to AU10TIX for comment  and will update this story if it responds. When reached for comment by 404 Media, the company&nbsp;told the outlet that “the incident you cited happened over 18 months ago. A thorough investigation determined that employee credentials were illegally accessed then and were promptly rescinded.” However, 404 Media claims that, according to the security researcher, the credentials still worked as of this month. When confronted with that information, AU10TIX said it was “decommissioning the relevant system” linked to the credentials. </p><p>On the topic of user data potentially having been accessed, the company said: “While PII data was potentially accessible, based on our current findings, we see no evidence that such data has been exploited.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



					



<figure><img decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/sixcolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_2678.jpeg?resize=680%2C510&amp;ssl=1" alt="The Moaan InkPalm Plus and the Kobo Clara HD" data-image-w="" data-image-h="" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>The Moaan InkPalm Plus and the Kobo Clara HD.</figcaption></figure>
<p>It is probably not surprising that I, John Moltz, the world’s leading iPhone mini superfan would also want to use a small e-reader. That’s just science.</p>
<p>After spending years reading ebooks on my iPhones and iPads like an animal, I finally got a <a href="https://us.kobobooks.com/collections/ereaders/products/kobo-clara-hd">Kobo Clara HD</a> three years ago. And I really like it. It’s reasonably small, reasonably priced, has a nice screen, and it helped me reduce my crippling dependency on Amazon.</p>
<p>So, why did I think I needed another e-reader? Because they started making even smaller ones.</p>
<h2>So buttons</h2>
<p>Last fall Jason <a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/10/boox-palma-review-a-phone-shaped-e-reader/">reviewed the Boox Palma</a>, a phone-sized e-reader that looked right up my alley. Not only would it be easy to hold with one hand, it also had physical navigation buttons, something my Kobo, like most of the smaller and more inexpensive readers, lacked. The problem is that it costs $280. I said up my alley, not up my gated community. It’s not an unreasonable amount, it was just more than I wanted to spend since I already had an e-reader. Nothing to do but wait for prices to come down, I guess.</p>
<p>Or maybe I didn’t have to wait. <a href="https://xoxo.zone/@lazerwalker/112531497711081306">A post on Mastodon</a> got boosted into my feed that touted the Xiaomi Moaan InkPalm 5 which sells for about $95. Now you’re talking my kind of cheap. Looking into the Moaan lineup, I then found the InkPalm Plus which features a slightly larger screen, more storage and a more up-to-date version of Android, all for <a href="https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256806876799779.html">as low as $124 on AliExpress</a>.</p>
<p>Sold.</p>

<h2>Caution: rough edges</h2>
<p>So, what did I get for not that much of my money? The InkPalm Plus has 64 GB of storage, 2 GB of RAM, a 5.84-inch screen with a 1440 x 720 resolution and runs Android 11. All of the hardware specs are less than the Boox Palma but, again, see the price. And I’m reading books here, not playing Call of Duty. (Although, now that I say that I kinda want to try to play Doom on it.)</p>
<p>The device comes set to Chinese, but you can choose English during the setup process. Mostly. Some things, such as its version of Control Center, are just in Chinese (they do have icons, though, so it wasn’t too hard to get them sorted). Further, the apps loaded on it are in Chinese, which made figuring out which one was the browser a bit of an adventure.</p>
<p>You can’t really complete the setup process because it requires a Chinese phone number or an account number and password, presumably with Xiaomi. I just decided to ignore the account setup and the device seems to work fine. It will ask for the account login if you try to setup a lock screen PIN but you can cancel out of the login and still create one. I could root it and install another version of Android but that seems like a lot of work.</p>
<p>My first task was getting some apps I could use. Google would not let me install the Play store on this device so I installed F-Droid and <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/">the Aurora Store</a>. I was then able to easily download several e-reading apps.</p>
<p>I easily logged into my Kobo account and downloaded a book. The reading experience in the Kobo app is fine, if not as nice as it is on a Kobo device, which I guess makes sense. Page turning was a little slow in the Kobo app until I turned off transitions, and it doesn’t let you configure the progress indicator at the bottom.</p>
<p>The InkPalm Plus comes with version 8.69 of the Kindle app which, despite having two Chinese characters added to the end of the name, works fine in English. I downloaded version 8.103 from the Aurora Store but it was unusably slow and wouldn’t recognize the system setting to use the volume buttons for page forward and back, so I stuck with the pre-installed app.</p>
<p>I was easily able to connect the InkPalm Plus to my Mac via Bluetooth and load several epub books. I tried a number of indie reader apps from the Aurora Store and, while Jason said he liked Moon+ the best, I found I preferred ReadEra, at least on the InkPalm Plus.</p>
<h2>Looks aren’t everything</h2>
<p>As is typical of e-readers, the InkPalm Plus is plastic. You wouldn’t want that for a smartphone, but you do with a reader. And you can get it in any color as long as the color is orange (just the back plate). Nothing against orange, but it’s not really my jam. While it did help me find it easily among all my black and blue devices, I broke down and got a black case for it.</p>
<p>The lock screen doesn’t show what book you’re reading, at least when using third-party readers (perhaps one of the pre-installed ones would but they’re in Chinese) but it does have several Chinese-themed stock images to pick from and you can add your own via Bluetooth. I’m not saying I made a Starfleet delta insignia my lock screen image but I’m not not saying I did that, either. (I totally did that.)</p>
<p>The screen quality is good, but like some e-readers—as Jason noted on the Boox Palma—the screen refresh is insufficient, leading to some ghosting in the E Ink. You can force a refresh by swiping down to the device’s version of Control Center and tapping the circular icon near the top. (When I translated the Chinese characters under the icon, the label is apparently “Renovate.”)</p>
<p>The screen is, sadly, glossy… which will certainly be a non-starter for a lot of people.</p>
<p>There is also a feature called “Logo control” which, it pains me to admit, took me way longer than it should have to figure out what it did. It turns out that the Moaan logo in the bottom bezel is a capacitive button. Who knew? Not me. I did not know. This button is configurable and I was able to set it so that a short press took me back to the home screen and a long press refreshed the screen.</p>
<p>After futzing with the settings for a bit, I could get the screen of the InkPalm Plus to be very close to the Kobo in regular light. The differences were more noticeable in lower light where it appears as more backlit. The screen of the Kobo just seems more like paper. Still, I think the Plus’s screen is pretty good and obviously way better than a regular smartphone for reading. You can adjust brightness, temperature and contrast, so maybe more futzing will produce better results.</p>

<h2>Not Mr. Right, but Mr. Right Now</h2>
<p>My main attraction to the Boox Palma was twofold: it was easy to palm and it had physical buttons for page turning. These two things are ultimately what make the InkPalm Plus worth the warts for me.</p>
<p>A few weeks back I saw <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@jen.chae/video/7366443578362514719">this TikTok by Jen Chae</a> and was very tempted to emulate it. Chae’s setup involved a Boox Palma and a mini Bluetooth keyboard configured for page turning. The only thing that stopped me was reading about the short battery life of those little keyboards and knowing that keeping Bluetooth on all the time would be a drain on the InkPalm’s battery.</p>
<p>Speaking of batteries, battery life on the InkPalm Plus seems solid, if not quite as good as the Kobo’s. With WiFi and Bluetooth off, I get days of use out of it before needing to recharge (your mileage may vary) and it having a USB-C port rather than the USB micro on my Kobo is a plus.</p>
<p>The glossy screen is not ideal, obviously, but almost all my reading is done inside and usually at night, so it’s rarely an issue for me. (Amazon has a few different screen protectors for the InkPalm Plus for sale but it’s not clear if any will reduce glare.) I would probably prefer to have the cover of the book on the lock screen but the app you left off in is still going when you turn it on again, so you can pick up reading immediately.</p>
<p>I don’t think this is the ideal device for sure, even without the language issues. I would rather have a Kobo this size with buttons because their native setup just works better. But Kobo doesn’t make such a device and, for me, the Palma tries too hard by having a camera, a microphone and an SD card slot, all at the cost of a premium price. For now, I’m sticking with the InkPalm Plus, but I hope this smaller space is a place where existing e-reader manufacturers are going to get involved.</p>

We’re building a modern task queue as an alternative to tools like Celery for Python and BullMQ for Node. Our open-source repo is at <a href="https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet">https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet</a> and is 100% MIT licensed.</p><p>When we did a Show HN a few months ago (<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39643136</a>), our cloud version was invite-only and we were focused on our open-source offering.</p><p>Today we’re launching our self-serve cloud so that anyone can get started creating tasks on our platform - you can get started at <a href="https://cloud.onhatchet.run/" rel="nofollow">https://cloud.onhatchet.run</a>, or you can use these credentials to access a demo (should be prefilled):</p><pre><code>  URL: https://demo.hatchet-tools.com

People are currently using Hatchet for a bunch of use-cases: orchestrating RAG pipelines, queueing up user notifications, building agentic LLM workflows, or scheduling image generation tasks on GPUs.</p><p>We built this out of frustration with existing tools and a conviction that PostgreSQL is the right choice for a task queue. Beyond the fact that many developers are already using Postgres in their stack, which makes it easier to self-host Hatchet, it’s also easier to model higher-order concepts in Postgres, like chains of tasks (which we call workflows). In our system, the acknowledgement of the task, the task result, and the updates to higher-order models are done as part of the same Postgres transaction, which significantly reduces the risk of data loss/race conditions when compared with other task queues (which usually pass acknowledgements through a broker, storing the task results elsewhere, and only then figuring out the next task in the chain).</p><p>We also became increasingly frustrated with tools like Celery and the challenges it introduces when using a modern Python stack (&gt; 3.5). We wrote up a list of these frustrations here: <a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/problems-with-celery">https://docs.hatchet.run/blog/problems-with-celery</a>.</p><p>Since our Show HN, we’ve (partially or completely) addressed the most common pieces of feedback from the post, which we’ll outline here:</p><p>1. The most common ask was built-in support for fanout workflows — one task which triggers an arbitrary number of child tasks to run in parallel. We previously only had support for DAG executions. We generalized this concept and launched child workflows (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/child-workflows">https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/child-workflows</a>). This is the first step towards a developer-friendly model of durable execution.</p><p>2. Support for HTTP-based triggers — we’ve built out support for webhook workers (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks">https://docs.hatchet.run/home/features/webhooks</a>), which allow you to trigger any workflow over an HTTP webhook. This is particularly useful for apps on Vercel, who are dealing with timeout limits of 60s, 300s, or 900s (depending on your tier).</p><p>3. Our RabbitMQ dependency — while we haven’t gotten rid of this completely, we’ve recently launched hatchet-lite (<a href="https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/hatchet-lite">https://docs.hatchet.run/self-hosting/hatchet-lite</a>), which allows you to run the various Hatchet components in a single Docker image that bundles RabbitMQ along with a migration process, admin CLI, our REST API, and our gRPC engine. Hopefully the lite was a giveaway, but this is meant for local development and low-volume processing, on the order of hundreds per minute.</p><p>We’ve also launched more features, like support for global rate limiting, steps which only run on workflow failure, and custom event streaming.</p><p>We’ll be here the whole day for questions and feedback, and look forward to hearing your thoughts!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://pketh.org/open-sourcing-kinopio.html">https://pketh.org/open-sourcing-kinopio.html</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40810949">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>On the eve of it’s 5th anniversary, I’ve decided to make the code for the <code>kinopio-client</code> app public. That means you can run Kinopio on your own computer, make changes, and share improvements.</p>

<p><img src="https://pketh.org/images/github-logo@2x.png" width="24" height="25"> <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client">kinopio-client on github</a></p>

<p><code>kinopio-client</code> is the app that’s downloaded and run in your browser when you go to <a href="https://kinopio.club/">https://kinopio.club</a>. It can save data locally, and to the <code>kinopio-server</code>.</p>



<p>Because the app weighs only ~220kb, in an alternate dimension where we didn’t have the Internet but had html, I’d ship kinopio to you on a single floppy disk. It wouldn’t even need to be high-density.</p>



<p>To be honest, opening up 5 years of private code does feel a bit intimate, like inviting someone over. I’ve cleaned the dishes and swept up, but … don’t look in that closest.</p>

<p>That said, compared to other commercial codebases, you might find it refreshingly straightforward. It’s just a node.js app and here’s the entire install process:</p>

<div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/pketh/kinopio-client.git
<span>cd </span>kinopio-client
npm <span>install
</span>npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> @vue/cli
npm <span>install</span> <span>-g</span> hostile
hostile <span>set </span>localhost kinopio.local
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then create an <code>.env.local</code> file containing <code>VITE_PROD_SERVER=true</code>.</p>

<p>And to run it:</p>

<div><pre><code>npm run serve
https://kinopio.local:8080
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="why-make-commercial-app-code-public">Why Make Commercial app code public?</h2>

<p>I’ve long been thinking about how to share the amount of work that goes into Kinopio. The more you know how something is made, the more you appreciate it –&nbsp;even more so when it’s a quality product built to last a lifetime.</p>

<p>But at the same time, making software isn’t like carving <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F12qUyIACM">fountain pens</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UijpPTEuJgY">acoustic guitars</a>. As much as I would like to sometimes, I don’t toil in meditative isolation until I’m ready to deliver the perfect timeless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objet_d%27art">objet d’art</a>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pketh.org/images/2024/oss/sculptor.jpg">
  <figcaption>Not my life <a href="https://www.cosmos.so/e/441491231">(Source)</a></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By contrast, delivering software is more like delivering a gooey crying baby. It’s alive. Squirming, growing, and changing because the technologies it relies on do too. Physical materials rarely change, but web browsers, operating systems, and servers sure do.</p>

<p>The big benefit of public code for me is that it’s another way to share the work that goes into Kinopio. One more piece of the puzzle, in between diagnosing bug reports, discussing feature requests, and sharing updates on social media.</p>

<p>Some kind souls might <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribute changes</a>. But because Kinopio is such a complex interface-based app, I have no idea yet how often that’ll happen.</p>

<h2 id="risks">Risks?</h2>

<p>Sharing the code for paid software carries some potential risks worth considering,</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>A counterfeiter could theoretically use the code to make a clone product. Commercial derivatives are prohibited by the <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client/blob/main/LICENSE.md">license</a>, but even if they ignore that, the forger would still have to reverse engineer their own kinopio-server. It’d be way easier to use an off-the-shelf infinite canvas library or tldraw&nbsp;instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Code contributions are appreciated, but having too many PRs to review can be very stressful. On paper, Kinopio is a one person operation, but I’m not really alone because I’ve got a community of users I trust that moderate discussions and answer questions when I’m not able to. As always, I’ll be relying on their help and generosity.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-happens-next">What Happens Next?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in contributing, please by sure to read the <a href="https://github.com/kinopio-club/kinopio-client/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributor docs</a> first. And just like in the discord and forums, there’s only one rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’re all friends here, so let’s be cool, constructive, and always treat each other with respect.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
  <img src="https://pketh.org/images/2024/oss/journey.webp">
  <figcaption>Hirō Isono</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Compared to a library or CLI tool, where new features and more options don’t really complicate basic usage, what the ‘correct’ thing to do for a GUI application is far fuzzier and subjective.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to seeing what kind of activity takes place in the repo. Will I spend more time reviewing and less time coding? Maybe I’ll stream some live coding sessions?</p>

<p>With loving scrutiny,</p>

<p>– Pirijan, Kinopio Creator</p>

<p>I <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-17-one-click-finetuning.html">previously</a> experimented with one-click LLM finetuning providers and now is a good time to return to the core of the matter: evaluating how well all these fine-tuned models and experiments are faring. I have a gut feeling that my fine-tuned models did pretty well, but we’re not in the business of gut feeling so I’m hoping to be able to put some real numbers down to either prove or disprove this hypothesis.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder if you didn’t read <a href="https://mlops.systems/#category=isafpr">any of the previous posts in the series</a>, I’m building a model that can take a press release text like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“2011-11-S-011 ISAF Joint Command - Afghanistan For Immediate Release KABUL, Afghanistan (Nov.&nbsp;7, 2011) — A combined Afghan and coalition security force conducted an operation in search of a Haqqani facilitator in Argo district, Badakshan province. The facilitator coordinates suicide attacks with other insurgent leaders in the area. During the operation, a local national male failed to comply with repeated verbal warnings and displayed hostile intent toward the security force. The security force engaged the individual, resulting in his death. The security force confiscated a shotgun and intelligence linking the local national to the Haqqani network. The security force also detained two suspected insurgents during the operation.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…and then turn it into structured data (i.e.&nbsp;a JSON object) like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><span>{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2">    <span>'name'</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1</span><span>'</span><span>,</span></span>

<p>I’ve now fine-tuned several models and I want to get a sense of how good these are. I showcased <a href="https://mlops.systems/posts/2024-06-03-isafpr-evaluating-baseline.html">some initial baseline evaluations</a> using OpenAI’s <code>gpt-4-turbo</code> but I want to pit model against model now.</p>
<p>I’m also interested in teasing out some of the edge cases where I know I struggled as a human annotator. (I <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/strickvl/isafpressreleases">released the dataset</a> for this project publicly on the Hugging Face Hub and also was responsible for annotating every single item so I know the data intimately.) I can even consider using the hard examples to generate some synthetic data to boost performance on those edge cases, but that’s a task for much later on.</p>
<p>This blogpost is a prose overview of some of the evaluations I’m adding to my suite of tests (and why I’m adding them). I learned a lot from <a href="https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/">Hamel Husain’s “Your AI Product Needs Evals” blogpost</a> and if you’re interested in this I’d recommend reading it and then actually implementing his suggestions.</p>
<section id="core-evaluations-for-accuracy">
<h2 data-anchor-id="core-evaluations-for-accuracy">Core evaluations for accuracy</h2>
<p>The most important measurement to start with is just a pure “did the LLM make a correct prediction or not?” If I was doing all these evaluations manually myself, I’d take a look at the example above, for example, and ask myself “was the start date of the event mentioned in the blogpost really ‘2011-11-07’ as predicted by the model?” and “did the event take place in Badakhshan province?” and “were the Haqqanis the group targeted?”</p>
<p>It’s fairly straightforward to make these determinations when comparing each property one by one. I can then repeat this over every example in my test slice of my dataset and take an average if I want a single aggregate figure, or I can get individual figures for dates, provinces, target groups and so on (to know if maybe there’s one part of the prediction it struggles with most).</p>
</section>
<section id="out-of-domain-data">
<h2 data-anchor-id="out-of-domain-data">Out of domain data</h2>
<p>The ISAF mission has come to an end, so I don’t have to worry too much about new data and having to adapt to a continuously changing world, but it is possible that some smaller groups weren’t well represented in the training data (for predicting the target group, for example) so I want to know how well my model does with data it hasn’t seen.</p>
<p>My prompt passes in the schema for the data and I encourage it to follow the schema in its response, but if there’s a new group will it add the new group to the schema? I can write an evaluation to test this.</p>
<p>Another edge case is the possibility that a press release doesn’t follow the standard format. Having read them all, I know that the vast majority are pretty formulaic, but sometimes there is a special event or incident which caused the author of the press release to depart from the standard formula. I want to know that my model will:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>not just make something up so as to have <em>some</em> kind of JSON response even if the press release is about someone’s birthday party</li>
<li>even better, produce some sort of error code or blank response when this happens.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can use examples of this out of domain data to see what happens, and put a value to how often my model will just hallucinate something out of nothing. This will be important since the name of the game for this model is accuracy.</p>
</section>
<section id="gradations-of-some-a-few-many">
<h2 data-anchor-id="gradations-of-some-a-few-many">Gradations of ‘some’, ‘a few’, ‘many’</h2>
<p>The press releases try to give some information without actually giving too much. Indeed, when I published <a href="https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/special-reports/a-knock-on-the-door-22-months-of-isaf-press-releases/">my report</a> on the press releases back in 2011, ISAF even <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/news/78455/isaf-responds-use-aan-news-releases-study">issued a press release</a> (!) in which they stated that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Release of information in insurgent warfare is not always made public, so studies based on the use of press releases can be both incomplete and problematic. […] Authoritative research cannot be conducted through mere analysis of press releases, since the release of information through such releases is, by design, incomplete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So reading the press releases is very much an exercise in reading between the lines. In the press release cited earlier, all the numbers are specific (“a facilitator”, “a male”, “two insurgents”) so it’s easy to put numbers to how many were killed or captured. In many of the press releases, particularly during times where raids were being conducted at a very high tempo, you have to just take assumptions about what their words mean and assign minimum values to those words.</p>
<p>So ‘a couple’ meant at least two, but ‘a few’ meant 3 or more. Similarly ‘dozens’ means multiple dozens so that meant a minimum value of at least 24. From the original report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If a press release said that ‘insurgents’ were detained, without further details, we assigned that incident as having a minimum number of 2 detained (since we could not be sure of more). ‘A couple’ we took to mean 2. ‘Several’ we took to mean at least 3, even though on other occasions ‘several’ was used to refer to 7 or 8. Other terms we classified as denoting at least 3 included: ‘a few’, ‘some’, ‘a group’, ‘a small group’ and ‘multiple’; these terms sometimes were used to refer to far larger numbers but we chose the smaller number (if no other information was available in the press release) in order to come up with a minimally acceptable figure. ‘Numerous’ and ‘a handful’ we took to mean at least 4, and ‘a large number’ at least 5.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reports mostly referred to events that had taken place that day or the day before, but occasionally they’d refer to events that took place “last Thursday” or “last week” and so then you’d have to know what day the press release was issued and then make calculations accordingly. For this backwards-referring time assignations, I’m particularly interested (read: concerned!) to know how well my LLMs did. Whatever score we get, it’s probably fixable with a bit of manual parsing and logic, but we need to know if there’s a problem or not first.</p>
<p>Generally speaking there were province names assigned to incidents (all but 23, to be precise) but when they weren’t, then the LLM has to work back from a village name, potentially, or just specify that an incident took place in southern Afghanistan or Afghanistan as a whole. On a few occasions, the press release actually made an error, stating that village X or Y was in a particular province, when this was incorrect and it was in a different province. So for this, would we expect the LLM to assign the event to the correct province for that village, or just retain the error in the press release?</p>
<p>Sometimes a press release might refer to an event having taken place “in the provincial capital of X province” but without mentioning that city by name. So the LLM will have to have some knowledge of these things and I want to test how well it performs with this.</p>
<p>These might seem like tiny errors to get wrong, but for a project like this (where my report was making some strong accusations and drawing certain conclusions based on the data), it wouldn’t do to get things factually wrong. For an internal-facing LLM-powered chatbot, the price of mistakes is minimal, but for a project like this, there are potentially far more serious consequences which is why I’m putting together such detailed evaluations.</p>
</section>
<section id="spelling-variation">
<h2 data-anchor-id="spelling-variation">Spelling variation</h2>
<p>Another issue with some of the press releases is that they use a variety of spellings for the same locations or names of individuals. For some things — province names, for example — it makes sense to standardise on a fixed naming convention but for others it’s not always clear what to do. So our evaluation should ensure that common variations of certain provinces or designations or names are captured correctly by the LLM output.</p>
</section>
<section id="complex-stories">
<h2 data-anchor-id="complex-stories">Complex stories</h2>
<p>Some stories are very complicated and there may be no correct way to assign numbers, for example, to the text that was published. In those cases when annotating I often just left the minimum numbers at zero even though we know that <em>something</em> happened. Would the LLM also make the same call? What is the threshold for deciding not to take a chance on making a guess?</p>
</section>
<section id="next-step">
<h2 data-anchor-id="next-step">Next step</h2>
<p>The obvious next step is to actually code up these evaluation criteria and run those across our fine-tuned LLMs as well as the API-driven proprietary ones. I’ll be working on that over the coming days. Luckily, I did most of the work to identify all of the above when I first wrote the report so there isn’t much ground that needs to be broken so much as just sitting down and getting it done.</p>

<p>Google Sheets is one of the first products at Google to use WasmGC on Chrome. The move was announced in 2022, and the Sheets and Chrome teams partnered on standardization, engineering, and tooling to provide real-time feedback on optimizations. This partnership set a precedent for how engineering teams at Google can effectively work with Chrome to have more Google apps running on WasmGC.</p>

<h2 id="the_challenge_javascript" data-text="The challenge: JavaScript" tabindex="-1">The challenge: JavaScript</h2>

<p>The Google Sheets calculation engine was originally written in Java and launched in 2006. In the early days of the product, all calculation happened on the server. However, from 2013, the engine has run in the browser using JavaScript. This was originally accomplished through Google Web Toolkit (<a href="https://www.gwtproject.org/">GWT</a>), and later through Java to Closure JavaScript transpiler (<a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/">J2CL</a>). The JavaScript calculation engine runs in a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers">Web Worker</a> and communicates with the main thread using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/MessageChannel"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">MessageChannel</code></a>.</p>

<p>Migrating users from the server to the JavaScript version of the calculation engine (and later from GWT to J2CL) was a major undertaking that required careful validation. To ensure that the JavaScript calculation engine produced precisely the same results as the Java version, the Sheets team developed an internal validation mechanism. This mechanism can process a large corpus of sheets and validate that the results are identical between multiple versions of the calculation engine. The Sheets team uses this tool regularly to validate changes to Sheets. But the team didn't just compare the results of those calculations, they also compared the performance between JavaScript on the client and Java on the server. They found that the JavaScript version of the calculation engine was more than three times slower than the Java version.</p>

<h3 id="why_is_javascript_slower_than_java" data-text="Why is JavaScript slower than Java?" tabindex="-1">Why is JavaScript slower than Java?</h3>

<p>JavaScript is fast for a loosely-typed, dynamic language. Heavy investment in just-in-time (JIT) compilers (for example, <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/maglev">Maglev</a>, <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/sparkplug">Sparkplug</a>, and <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/turbofan-jit">Turbofan</a>) over the past 15 years has increased JavaScript's performance. However, JavaScript's loose types and dynamic behavior make it challenging for JIT compilers to generate optimal code. This means JavaScript still lags behind languages like Java and C++ for raw throughput. <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> adds type safety to JavaScript, but that type information is designed to make development easier, not to provide the sorts of guarantees needed by compilers to generate optimal code. For cases like Google Sheets, where large spreadsheets can take tens of seconds to calculate, JavaScript is fast, but not fast enough.</p>

<h2 id="the_solution_wasmgc" data-text="The Solution: WasmGC" tabindex="-1">The Solution: WasmGC</h2>

<p><a href="https://developer.chrome.com/blog/wasmgc/">WasmGC</a> is an <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc">extension</a> to the existing <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> specification which adds the primitives needed to compile garbage collected languages (such as Java). For example, WasmGC adds instructions for defining types and allocating garbage collected data structures. WasmGC is poised to do for garbage collected languages what Wasm did for C++ (for example, <a href="https://web.dev/articles/ps-on-the-web#webassembly_porting_with_emscripten">Photoshop</a> or <a href="https://web.dev/case-studies/earth-webassembly">Google Earth</a>), which is to bring them to the web at near native speed. At Google, we believe that WasmGC has the potential to be even more impactful than Wasm because of the popularity of garbage collected languages.</p>

<h2 id="google_workspace_partners_with_chrome" data-text="Google Workspace partners with Chrome" tabindex="-1">Google Workspace partners with Chrome</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc/blob/main/proposals/gc/MVP.md">WasmGC MVP draft specification</a> was published in 2019. In late 2020, Google Workspace and Chrome partnered to evaluate WasmGC using the Sheets calculation engine. Workspace's multiplatform team has significant expertise building and optimizing compilers and transpilers. Sheets, a part of Workspace, was identified as an ideal candidate for evaluating WasmGC: it is performance-sensitive and has robust performance and correctness validation mechanisms. Chrome has the <a href="http://v8.dev/">V8</a> team to build and optimize the WasmGC runtime as well as contributors to <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen">Binaryen</a> to build ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizations. Between Chrome and Workspace, there's all the expertise needed to build and optimize a WasmGC toolchain, with Google Sheets as an ideal testbed.</p>

<h3 id="the_first_prototype" data-text="The first prototype" tabindex="-1">The first prototype</h3>

<p>By mid 2021, the teams had a working <a href="https://github.com/google/j2cl/tree/master/samples/wasm">Java to WasmGC compiler</a>. Toward the end of the same year, they had a prototype version of Google Sheets running as WasmGC and doing calculations. Along the way, they hit many challenges. Tooling for profiling and taking heap dumps did not exist and had to be built. The existing implementation relied on many JavaScript libraries for which replacements had to be found or written for WasmGC. Validating the correctness of the Wasm calculation engine was a time-consuming effort due to the experimental nature of the specification, compiler, and new libraries. But Sheets' validation mechanisms were once again extremely helpful. The teams ultimately got it all working, and performance data started coming in early 2022.</p>

<h3 id="additional_optimizations" data-text="Additional optimizations" tabindex="-1">Additional optimizations</h3>

<p>The initial version of Sheets Wasm showed calculation performance roughly two times <em>slower</em> than JavaScript. However, this isn't a bad result for a new specification, new compiler, and several new libraries. From this point, the Sheets team began optimizing. Of the optimizations they found, a few categories emerged:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replicating core optimizations that already existed in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and in V8.</li>
<li>Using highly optimized browser APIs.</li>
<li>Removing JavaScript-specific coding patterns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firstly, the Sheets team needed to replicate optimizations which already exist in other toolchains. The best example of this is optimizing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">virtual method dispatching</a>, which has long been optimized by the JVM and V8, but nothing existed for WasmGC. Implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inline_caching">speculative inlining</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/blob/main/src/passes/ConstantFieldPropagation.cpp">devirtualization</a>—two very common optimizations—sped up calculation time by roughly 40% in Chrome.</p>

<p>Second, there are cases where browser APIs are backed by optimized native implementations that are difficult to compete with using Wasm. Strings and regular expressions are two good examples. Specifically, with regular expressions, the team saw nearly a 100 times speedup of regular expression operations when switching from <a href="https://github.com/google/re2j">re2j</a> (compiled to WasmGC) to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp"><code translate="no" dir="ltr">RegExp</code></a> browser API in Chrome, which can compile each regular expression to its own machine code.</p>

<p>Lastly, they found that years of optimizing had caused the codebase to be over-fitted to JavaScript. For example, they had a core data structure in Sheets which was blurring the lines between arrays and maps. This is efficient in JavaScript, which automatically models sparse arrays as maps, but slow on other platforms. So they had to rewrite the code in a more platform-agnostic way. This is another thing the team like about WebAssembly: it makes it easier for multiplatform applications to get good performance on the web. You don't have to bend your whole application to the idiosyncrasies of JavaScript.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion" data-text="Conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion</h2>

<p>WasmGC is a powerful technology that has the potential to advance the way developers build web applications. Over the coming years, at Google, we hope to see WasmGC advance to support <a href="https://chromestatus.com/feature/5163209685467136">shared memory multithreading</a> and further improve single threaded performance.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lawyers for the Post Office arranged a secret meeting with a judge to prevent disclosure to defence solicitors in a criminal trial, the&nbsp;Post Office Inquiry heard yesterday.&nbsp; Solicitor Martin Smith and his barrister colleague Simon Clarke met the judge at Birmingham Crown Court in 2013 on the eve of a trial of a sub-postmaster accused of theft.</p>
<p>Around the same time, the interim report by forensic accountants Second Sight had revealed potential problems with the Horizon system which had been the basis for previous prosecutions.</p>
<p>The prosecuting lawyers applied for public interest immunity on the report, successfully persuading the judge that the defence solicitors should not be made aware of it.</p>
<p>Giving evidence to the inquiry, Smith accepted he was the instructing solicitor on the case but stressed he was only present at the meeting to take notes and he could not remember any details of what was said to the judge.</p>
<p>The inquiry heard of several issues with disclosure as the Post Office and its representatives approached the mediation scheme and potential reviews of past convictions.</p>
<p>In the case of north Wales sub-postmaster Noel Thomas, who had been jailed in 2006 for false accounting, Smith suggested that an investigation report from the time should not be disclosed to him when it was reviewed in 2014. If it was to be disclosed, the inquiry heard, it should be heavily redacted – and Smith himself had written that Thomas should not be shown a Post Office note from 2005 which noted that operator Fujitsu was testing the reliability of Horizon.</p>
<p>‘Such a [note] may well invite a request for disclosure of the test results,’ Smith had emailed a colleague. ‘There may also be a risk that [Thomas] will suggest the investigation was inadequate or incomplete.’</p>
<p>On another occasion, Smith and Bond Dickinson’s Andy Parsons discussed whether disclosure might give a ‘ticket to the Court of Appeal’ to Seema Misra, who had been wrongly convicted in 2010 while she was pregnant with her second child.</p>
<p>Smith admitted that he had not complied with his duties as a prosecuting solicitor to ensure that the Post Office expert witness was aware of his obligations. He accepted he did not have the ‘requisite skill and expertise’ for the role he was in and did not know why Cartwright King had been given the task of handling Post Office prosecutions.</p>
<p>‘Quite why Cartwright King thought it was appropriate to take on this prosecution with hindsight I have no idea, because we certainly didn’t have the training for it,’ he said.</p>
<p>‘I was simply not aware of the duties on a prosecutor to make sure an expert witness was fully aware of their duties.’</p>
<p>He added that the approach to expert witnesses was ‘undoubtedly not compliant.’</p>
<p>The inquiry continues.</p></div></div>]]></description>
