        <p>The introduction of automatically focusing lenses has changed photography in numerous ways. Autofocus systems have significantly improved the reliability and accuracy with which fast moving objects can be shot. Round four decades ago, the new level of convenience offered by autofocus lenses has made photography more accessible to the masses. Since their first release of an autofocus lens in 1981, Canon has constantly developed their lens technology using different approaches. Over time, Canon has introduced seven different autofocus motor technologies that will be presented here.</p>

        <h2>Canon Autofocus Systems</h2>
        <p>In optics, focus describes the point at which incoming light rays converge and it is used synonymously as a concept of sharpness. Autofocus, by contrast, is a technology to automatically focus the lens at a desired subject. The <a href="https://exclusivearchitecture.com/03-technical-articles-DSLR-03-autofocus-systems.html">autofocus detection system</a> inside the camera determines the ideal focusing lens position and instructs the lenses autofocus drive accordingly. In 1987, Canon has introduced the both the EOS camera system and EF lenses which have been designed with autofocus as standard features. There have been some Canon autofocus lenses available before that date, but these have been discontinued with the introduction of EF lenses. For this reason, this chapter focuses on all autofocus motor types that are used in EF, EF-S, RF, and RF-S lenses that are marketed still today.</p>

            <h2>Types of Autofocus Actuators</h2>
        </p>    
            
            
        <div>
            <p>The autofocus group of lens elements always shifts along the optical axis in a linear way. While focusing automatically, the movement is generated by some type of actuator. Autofocus actuators can basically be divided into two categories:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li><b>Rotary Drive Systems:</b> These generate a rotation that is translated into a linear sliding motion via precision mechanics. One common transmission type uses a focusing barrel with helical slots. The focusing group of lens elements is engaged with these slots and slides forwards or backwards axially when the helical slot barrel is turned. Another possible transmission type uses a lead screw with a lead nut that connects to the focusing group of lens elements.</li>
            <li><b>Linear Drive Systems:</b> Also called direct-drive systems. These perform a sliding movement that does not have to be translated. The focusing group of lens elements is directly connected to the linear actuator.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>The first types of autofocus drive systems used rotary movement and these include the Arc-Form Drive, Ring-Type USM, DC Micro Motor, Micro USM, Micro USM II, and Stepper Motor. Later, the switch was made to linear drives which include the Nano USM and the Voice Coil Motor.</p>
        </div> 
            
        
        <p>
            <h2>Canon AF Comparison</h2>
        </p>     
            
            
        <div>
        <p>The following comparison chart shows all of the autofocus drive types that have ever been used in Canon's EF, EF-S, RF, and RF-S lenses. Note how the indication on lens barrels is often just USM but the exact type of built-in motor can be different. This is because Canon's USM autofocus drive system comprises several different mechanism families, the ring-type USM, the Micro USM (I and II), and the linear Nano USM. All USM drives use piezoelectric technology but with some variations. If an autofocus Canon lens has no indication on its barrel about the autofocus technology used, the lens either has an AFD or DC Micro Motor installed. The date indicates when a particular type of motor was first used in a lens. While some of the early types like the Arc-Form Drive have been discontinued, most other types are still in use today. One key differentiator between these technologies is the capability of a lens to allow full-time manual (FTM) focus override. The ring-type ultrasonic Motor was the first autofocus system that allowed FTM focus override. Until 2012, most other lenses did not offer this type of manual focusing while autofocus is activated. The latest types of autofocus drives, including the Stepper Motor, Nano USM, and Voice Coil Motor, offer focus-by-wire. This is a concept where the manual focusing ring on the lens barrel is not mechanically coupled with the focusing group of lens elements but electronically controls the autofocus drive. Lenses that use focus-by-wire always offer full-time manual focus override.</p>

        <h2>Arc-Form Drive (AFD)<br>1987 - 1990</h2>
        <p>Originally, the designation AFD stood for autofocus drive. Later, when other autofocus drive systems were introduced, the term was changed into Arc-Form Drive.</p>

            <h2>The Shape</h2>
            <p>The Arc-Form Drive was the first autofocus motor that was used in EF lenses. The assembly included the motor unit, the gear drive, and a transmission that allowed the user to switch between manual focusing and autofocusing. The AFD assembly was shaped like an arc so that it could easily be installed inside a cylindrical lens barrel.</p>

            <h2>Construction</h2>
            <p>The illustration shows an Arc-Form Drive inside a Canon EF 50mm F2.5 Compact Macro lens. The unit is driven by a 2-phase bipolar asymmetric stepper motor that consists of a stator core, two electromagnetic coils (each coil is also referred to as a phase), and a permanent magnet rotor. The bipolar construction of the motor allows current to flow through each coil in both directions. The term asymmetric refers to the shape of the stator that is not rotationally symmetric as in conventional stepper motors (but it is axially symmetrical though).</p>   
            <p>The motor drives a reduction gear train that has the purpose of reducing the output gear's speed but at the same time increase the torque of that gear. A lever is used to shift the output gear in one of two possible positions where it either engages with the gear train or with the manual input gear that is connected to the manual focusing ring of the barrel.</p>
            
            <p>Two feedback systems are used to monitor the drive unit during operation. One system is used to confirm proper rotation of the rotor and another system is used to measure the number of turns the unit has performed:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Two hall effect sensors are placed very closely at the rotor. These can detect changes in magnetic fields and are therefore used to confirm rotor movement.</li>
            <li>An optical encoder wheel with alternating black and reflective zones is attached to one of the gears. An infrared reflective sensor is placed so that it can read the number of steps that the encoder wheel turns (each transition between two zones is a step). This provides crucial feedback to the lens controller as autofocus instructions typically include a predefined number of steps an autofocus motor has to move into a certain direction.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Front View</h2>
            <p>The illustration is a front view of the stepper motor with the cover removed. The rotor has two magnetic polarities opposite to each other, north and south. The stator consists of two phases that are colored in cyan and green for reasons of better explainability. The stator cores run through the phase coils to conduct the electromagnetic flux towards the rotor.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Stepper Motor Operation</h2>
            <p>During autofocus operation, the wire coils are excited via electrical impulses, which in turn magnetizes the stator core. The polarity of the voltage applied to the two coils is changed in a pre-defined sequence. The rotor performs a complete rotation in four steps:</p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Phase B coil is turned off. Phase A coil is energized so that the left part of the stator core is magnetized, attracting the rotor to perform a rotation. (This is a 90 degree clockwise rotation if the previous step of the motor was step 4.)</li>
            <li>Phase A coil is turned off. Phase B coil is energized so that the right part of the stator core is magnetized. This attracts the rotor so that it performs a 90 degree clockwise rotation. </li>
            <li>Phase B coil is turned off. Phase A coil is energized with opposite polarity. This magnetizes the left part of the stator core again, but this time with opposite magnetic polarity. The rotor is attracted again so that it performs another 90 degree clockwise rotation.</li>
            <li>Phase A coil is turned off. Phase B coil is energized with opposite polarity. This magnetizes the right part of the stator core again, but this time with opposite magnetic polarity. This induces the rotor to perform another 90 degree clockwise rotation.</li>
            </ol>
                
            <p>The sequence of steps is repeated as long as the rotor is required to turn. If the sequence is run in reverse from step 4 to step 1, the rotor turns counter-clockwise. The diagram summarizes these four steps.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>AFD Transmission</h2>
            <p>The AFD motor was designed with a transmission element that is also the output gear, the one that actually drives the helical focusing barrel. Note how the focusing barrel has a wide gear rim along its perimeter that allows the transmission element to shift a certain amount while always remaining engaged with the focusing barrel. The metal lever is connected to the MF/AF switch on the lens barrel and it shifts the transmission element so that it connects the output gear either with the motorized gear train or with the manual input gear. If the output gear is connected to one option, it is disengaged from the other option. For that reason, the Arc-Form Drive does not have full-time manual focus override available.</p>    

            <p>In terms of overall performance and usability, the Arc-Form Drive is considered to be noisy during operation and slower than other autofocus drives. When following moving subjects, the system shows a noticeable reaction time. Lenses with an Arc-Form Drive have to sequentially focus and then stop down the aperture diaphragm. All other lenses with different autofocus motors are able to operate the autofocus motor and aperture diaphragm at the same time. Despite these weaknesses, AFD lenses still offer reliable autofocusing performance.</p>

        <h2>Ring-Type Ultrasonic Motor (USM)<br>1987 - Present</h2>
        <p>Canon's ultrasonic motors are very exceptional types of actuators. They neither have electromagnetic coils or magnetic rotors, so their motion is not generated by magnetism like in traditional motors. Instead, they use an ingenious combination of piezoelectric effects and friction. Introduced in November 1987 with the Canon EF 300mm F2.8L USM lens, the ring-type USM was the first implementation of this piezoelectric technology in photographic lenses, and in the years that followed, some different types of USM drives would appear.</p>
        </div>
        
        
        <div>
        <div>
        <p>Canon's ring-type ultrasonic motor – as the name suggests – is shaped like a ring and, for that reason, fits perfectly inside the lens barrel. The optical system of the lens runs through the opening of that construction. At the time of its advent, this new technology was groundbreaking in its design and functionality, being ultra-fast and silent. They provide a high level of torque powerful enough to move even heavy groups of focusing lens elements inside super-telephoto lenses. Due to their high torque, no speed-reducing gear train is required when connecting the motor to the focusing mechanism. The ring-type USM has high holding torque maintained at zero input power and offers low inertia from its rotor providing rapid start and stop characteristics. In addition, this type of drive technology is unaffected by electromagnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>Ring-Type USM Main Parts</h2>
            <p>The ring-type USM can be divided into the rotor, the piezoelectric stator, and various support rings.</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>The rotor is the only part of this motor that actually rotates around the optical axis while the USM is in operation. The rotor itself is a compound of metal and plastic parts bonded together. The rotor has a sliding rail on the side facing the stator.</li>
            <li>The stator is an elastic metal body. In this context, elastic refers to the ability of the stator to oscillate to a certain extent, similar to a tuning fork. The stator has a ring of piezoelectric ceramic elements welded to its back (away from the rotor). Once this layer is electrically excited, it sets the stator into vibration. The vibrational energy is then transferred into the rotor via friction. Apart from its vibration, the stator does not move.</li>
            <li>A felt ring is used to protect the sensitive piezoelectric layer from the metal support rings that are pressed against the stator, and to dampen the vibrations from being transmitted into the lens barrel.</li>
            <li>The ring-type USM motor only works when the stator is firmly pressed against the rotor. The compression spring is what exerts this pressure on both the stator and rotor. This spring is an important part that ensures proper functionality of the ring-type USM.</li>
            <li>the lock ring is an interface part that holds all parts of the unit tightly together. Three indents on the inner circumference of the lock ring slide into slots of an inner lens barrel, securing the ring in place.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        </div>
                
        
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Ring-Type USM Details</h2>
            <p>The following illustration is a cross-sectional view of the ring-type USM when it is fully assembled. The piezoelectric layer is what generates vibrations. A flex cable connects the piezoelectric elements with the lens circuit board, and therefore provides power to this element. Once the unit is installed inside a lens barrel, a dedicated contact surface on the rotor pushes against wheels on an output ring (not shown in this illustration) that ultimately drives the focusing mechanism.</p>
            
            <p>The compression spring creates a tension that is also referred to as preload force. Flat surface finishes of the sliding rail and the stator teeth ensure a good friction coefficient between rotor and stator. The preload force and the friction between the rotor and the stator determine the passive holding torque of the motor at zero power input.</p>

            <p>Canon uses stator rings of two different sizes. The medium sized stator has an outer diameter of 62&nbsp;mm, and the larger sized stator has an outer diameter of 77&nbsp;mm. There is a huge number of Canon lenses that use ring-type ultrasonic motors as their autofocus drives. The following list is only a very short excerpt:</p>

            <h2>The Piezoelectric Ceramic Ring</h2>
            <p>The operation of the motor requires the stator to vibrate in a very precise way. This vibration is generated by a segmented piezoelectric ceramic ring that is welded to the back of the elastic stator body. The illustration of the piezoelectric array shows the distribution and configuration of piezo elements on the ring.</p>
            
            <p>The individual piezo elements are grouped together into groups A and B. Each group can be energized individually, and set the ring into vibration to form a standing wave with wavelength λ. Two piezo elements cover one full wavelength λ, and therefore each single piezo element has a length of λ/2. One of the key factors to ensure proper wave excitation in the stator is that both piezo groups are offset by λ/4 as shown in the illustration. This is also referred to as a <b>spatial phase shift of λ/4</b>.</p>

            <h2>Piezo Elements</h2>
            
            <p>Piezoelectric ceramic elements are sandwiched between two electrodes. Electrode 1 is in direct contact with the metal stator ring and serves as ground (GND). In the following illustration, the lower electrodes of all piezo elements are covered by a layer of silver conductive adhesive so these elements are electrically connected to one group.</p>
            
            <p>The piezoelectric ceramic elements have the property to deform when an electrical field is applied, an effect also described as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The direction in which piezo elements deform is defined by their piezoelectric polarization, expressed via positive and negative signs in this slightly simplified diagram. Depending on the polarity of the voltage applied across the electrodes, the individual piezo elements bend upwards or downwards. As piezo elements are arranged with alternating piezoelectric polarities, energizing the piezoceramic layer shapes the stator into a waveform. When the electrodes are subject to an alternating voltage of high frequency, the stator ring begins to oscillate. The amplitude of these oscillations is as small as 1-2&nbsp;µm.</p>

            <h2>Piezo Group A is Energized</h2>
            <p>For the sake of better understanding, the two piezoelectric groups are viewed from the top, and energized separately. Piezo group A is fed by a distinct sinusoidal voltage (phase A) while piezo group B remains de-energized. This not only generates a standing wave across group A but the wave unfolds across the entire stator ring. Looking at a snapshot in time, hollow circles indicate valleys in the stator, whereas solid black circles indicate peaks in the stator. Note how the peaks and valleys are exactly at the center of each piezo element of group A, whereas on the opposite side of the ring, peaks and valleys are exactly between the piezo elements. Over the course of one sine oscillation, peaks will turn into valleys and back into peaks. At the same time valleys turn into peaks and back into valleys. A clear standing wave is formed only if the excitation frequency is equal to the natural flexural vibration resonant frequency of the stator. The resonant frequency of Canon's ring-type USM is approximately 27,000&nbsp;Hz (oscillations per second). This frequency is in the ultrasonic range, which is why this type of autofocus technology is called ultrasonic. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of phase A generating a standing wave.</p>

            <h2>Piezo Group B is Energized</h2>
            <p>Now piezo group B is fed by a distinct sinusoidal voltage (phase B) while piezo group A remains de-energized. Again, a standing wave is generated and unfolds across the entire stator ring. This time, peaks (hollow circles) and valleys (solid black circles) are at the center of each piezo element of group B, whereas on the opposite side of the ring, peaks and valleys are exactly between the piezo elements. This shows that the two standing waves generated by group A and B are not congruent. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of phase B generating a standing wave.</p>

            <h2>Both Groups are Energized</h2>
            <p>When both piezo groups are energized at the same time, their vibration-induced standing waves are combined and form a new wave. When phase A and phase B are shifted by a quarter of a sine wavelength λ – called a <b>temporal phase shift of λ/4</b> – the resulting wavelength is a traveling wave. This temporal phase shift can be achieved, for example, by using a sine wave for phase A and a cosine wave for phase B. Unlike a standing wave, the peaks and valleys of a traveling wave move around the circumference of the stator ring similar to waves on the surface of water. This traveling wave is the source of the motor’s rotational energy. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of both phases generating a traveling wave.</p>
            
            <p> The sign of the temporal phase shift determines the propagating direction of the traveling wave, and  consequently also the rotating direction of the rotor. The stator has teeth cut into the material, and these are designed to amplify the movement of the ring.</p>

        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Feedback Control System</h2>
            <p>Not all piezo elements on the stator ring are used to generate waves. One small piezo element is located between the wave-generating piezo groups A and B and it serves as a sensor to measure the intensity of stator oscillations. Like all other piezo elements, the sensor element is sandwiched between two electrodes 1 and 2 (not shown in the illustration). Electrode 1 is directly connected to the metal stator body and serves as ground, whereas electrode 2 is on the opposite side and connects to the sensor line.</p>
            
            <p>It was described earlier that applying a voltage to a piezo element generates a deformation of that element, referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The actual (non-inverted) piezoelectric effect, however, is that pressure or deformation (such as bending) of the piezo element will generate an electric voltage. Consequently, the piezo's electrical output reflects the wave amplitude of the stator at its location. This signal is picked up by the control circuitry and can be used to adjust the frequencies of phases A and B accordingly.</p>
            
            <p>This feedback control system is required to monitor the proper excitation of the stator ring, and to achieve maximum amplitude of the traveling wave. The maximum amplitude can only be attained when the wave-generating phases precisely hit the natural resonance frequency of the stator body. That natural resonance frequency may vary from unit to unit due to small production related variations in dimensions, and for a given unit the natural resonance will vary with the temperature of the stator.</p>

            All piezo elements – both wave generating elements and the sensor element – have electrodes that are in direct contact with the conductive stator ring. The GND wire is directly connected to the metal stator body, and therefore all piezo elements share the metal body as a common ground connection. The phase A wire is connected to the exposed electrode of the first piezo element of group A, and a thin film of silver conductive adhesive electrically connects all other elements of phase A with the first element. The phase B wire is connected to phase B in a similar way. The sensor wire is connected to the exposed electrode of the sensor element.</p>

            <p>The following illustration shows 3D models of the ring-type USM stator. On the inactive stator ring, all teeth are in the same plane, allowing the stator to rest flat on the rotor. Once the stator is excited, it forms a traveling wave, here greatly exaggerated for the sake of clarification. The number of waves per cycle depends on the configuration of piezo elements. In this example, there are nine waves per cycle, but Canon also uses stators that form seven waves. The number n of waves formed on the stator means that one particular wave peak requires n excitation periods to completely travel around the stator one time.</p>

            <p>The animation shows nine waves traveling across the stator ring in a very slowed-down form. It is clearly visible that the stator itself does not turn around its axis but only the peaks and valleys move as it performs this undulating vibration.</p>

        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Moving the Rotor</h2>
            <p>The generation of a traveling wave can be considered as the first step in a two-step energy conversion process. The second step is the stator teeth transmitting their vibrational energy into a unidirectional continuous movement of the rotor via friction. Looking very closely at the stator teeth, the traveling wave induces elliptical motions at the tips of each tooth. In the animation, only one elliptical path of one tooth is shown, but all the other teeth carry out identical elliptical motions. Where the traveling wave forms peaks, the teeth are pressed against the rotor and push it in the direction of the elliptical motion. As a result, the rotor moves in the opposite direction of the traveling wave.</p>
                
            <p>It can be calculated how fast the traveling wave propagates. It is assumed in this example that 27,000 Hz  is exactly the natural resonance frequency of the stator ring. With nine peaks formed across the stator, it requires nine excitation periods for one peak to completely run around the stator ring one time. Thus, if the excitation frequency is at 27,000 Hz, one peak will travel a full revolution around the stator ring 3,000 times per second. Although the peaks travel at an extremely fast speed, the speed of the rotor is comparatively low. The rotor typically turns at a rate of 70-90 revolutions per minute, if excited continuously. The speed can be lowered by exciting the stator via pulse-width modulation. The microscopic oscillations of the tooth tips are the reason why the ratio between rotor speed and traveling wave speed is very low. This low ratio is actually an advantage as no speed-reducing gearbox is required, and the rotor can be directly coupled to the focusing mechanism of the lens barrel.</p>

            <h2>The Working Principle Summarized</h2>
            
            <p>The ring-type ultrasonic motor operates a two-stage energy conversion process: In a first stage, electrical energy is converted into an undulating motion by the piezoelectric elements of the stator. In a second stage, these ultrasonic vibrations at around 27 kHz are converted into a continuous unidirectional rotating movement of the rotor by friction on the stator.</p>
            
            <p>The traveling wave is generated by two main factors: Two groups of piezoceramic elements must be arranged with a spatial phase shift of λ/4, and these two groups must be energized with a temporal phase shift of λ/4. The elliptical motion of the stator teeth is transferred into the rotor due to friction between the stator and rotor, caused by the pressure contact (preload force) between stator and rotor.
            Friction between stator and rotor.</p>

            <h2>Drawbacks</h2>
            <p>Although being extremely well suited for photographic camera lenses, these motors show some drawbacks:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>This type of motor is not designed for continuous operation. Due to the friction involved, its life expectancy is lower than that of conventional electric motors.</li>
            <li>Although the ultrasonic noise cannot be perceived by the human ear, it can be picked up by sensitive microphones which can be problematic during video shootings.</li>
            <li>Ring-type USM motors are comparatively expensive to produce: The stator ring including all of its teeth are precisely cut by CNC milling machines. The production and application of piezoceramics is another difficult process. In addition, this type of autofocus motor requires complex power supply and driving circuits including high frequency generation and feedback control system.</li>

            <p>It was described in the beginning of this chapter that the ring-type ultrasonic motor was the first autofocus system that allowed full-time manual focus override. This is not a function of the ultrasonic drive unit itself, but rather of the cleverly designed differential mechanism.</p>
            
            <p>The challenge with the implementation of full-time manual focusing in general is that the user must be able to manually override the autofocus system (by turning the focusing ring on the barrel) without forcing the motor or grinding the gears. The ring-type USM prevents this from happening via an additional output ring that connects to the focusing group of lenses via a link bracket. Once this output wheel is turned, the focusing group adjusts the focusing distance of the lens. They key feature of this output ring is that it has three small wheels installed along its outer periphery. These wheels are sandwiched between the two input options – the manual input ring and the motor input ring (the USM stator). This is a rotary differential mechanism, and it allows either one of these input options to turn the output ring without exerting a force on the other input option. For that reason, the manual focusing ring can be turned without forcing the rotor into any direction. Due to this rotary differential, full-time manual focusing has become a standard feature on all lenses with a ring-type ultrasonic motor.</p>

        <p>The following illustration shows the output wheel with its small carrier wheels. The top right shows a schematic of both input options (manual input and motor input) and how they are arranged in the lens barrel. Note that due to the differential construction the output wheel does not turn at the same speed as the input wheels, but at a speed defined by the formula: v<sub>OUT</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<span><sup>v<sub>IN1</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;v<sub>IN2</sub></sup><span>⁄</span><sub>2</sub></span>&nbsp; where v<sub>IN1</sub> refers to the speed of the manual input ring and v<sub>IN2</sub> refers to the speed of the motor input ring. If one of the input rings is not moving (which is normally the case), the output speed v<sub>OUT</sub> is half of the input speed.</p>

            <p>The DC Micro Motor – sometimes abbreviated MM – looks quite similar to the AFD motor. It has almost an identical shape. In addition, the DC Micro Motor also uses a reduction gear train to transmit the motor's power to the focusing lens barrel. However, the type of motor itself is different. Instead of a stepper motor as used in the AFD, this type of autofocus drive uses an ultra-compact direct current (DC) motor. This is an extremely common type of motor, and it is considered to be the least advanced autofocus motor used in Canon lenses along with the AFD.

            <h2>The Gear Train</h2>
            <p>Once power is supplied to a direct current motor, the rotor starts to turn very fast. For that reason, the gear train attached to the motor uses a high reduction ratio to lower the speed of rotation. At the same time, rotational torque is increased towards the output gear.</p>
            
            <p>The DC Micro Motor has a lever to shift one gear between two positions. One position closes the gear train so that the motor's rotation is forwarded to the output gear, and the other position interrupts the transmission of rotational force. A tiny metal spring holds this switching gear under slight pressure so that it remains in its default position engaged with the other gears. Only when the AF/MF switch on the barrel is moved to the MF position, the lever shifts the switching gear so that it disconnects from its adjacent gears, disconnecting the motor from the output gear. This type of transmission shows that the DC Micro Motor does not support full-time manual focus override.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
            
        <div>
        <p>An exploded view of the DC Micro Motor shows some more details of the unit. The rotor shaft is connected to a small pulley which drives another pulley via a rubber belt. This belt drive helps reduce vibrations that might be induced by the motor's operation. The larger pulley is connected to the first gear of the reduction gearbox. An encoder wheel with numerous tiny openings alongside its perimeter is attached to the first gear. Each transition between an opening and solid material is one step of the encoder wheel. A sensor runs an infrared beam through one of these openings, and records the signal on the other side. Once the wheel is turned, the signal is interrupted until the next opening where the signal is recorded again. This setup allows the lens electronics to count the number of steps the encoder wheel has turned and thus how far the focusing lens group has been moved.</p>

            <h2>The Brushed DC Motor</h2>
            <p>The exact type of motor is a 2-pole 3-coil brushed DC motor. The description 2-pole refers to the two connection terminals at the back of the motor. These connections directly lead to the two metal brushes that touch the rotor's commutator from opposite sides. This is how electrical power is supplied to the rotor. The description 3-coil indicates that the rotor has three coil windings attached to its metal core. Each of these coils is an electromagnet that can change its polarity.</p>

            <h2>Electrical Configuration</h2>
            <p>The following schematic shows the electrical configuration of the rotor. The commutator has three separate contact surfaces, and these are connected to the windings as depicted. As the brushes are 180 degrees apart, they only form electrical connections with two of the contact areas at a given time. This design is the key requirement for the coils to form correctly oriented magnetic fields.</p>

            <h2>The DC Motor in Operation</h2>
            <p>The two power terminals of the DC motor are energized with an operating DC voltage between 4 and 6 volts. The metal brushes pass on this voltage to the commutator, which in turn applies that voltage to the coils. The magnetic fields produced at each coil are either repelled or attracted by the stator's permanent magnets. Due to the commutator's design and the wiring configuration, each coil changes its electrical (and therefore magnetic) polarity as soon as it has reached maximum proximity to a permanent magnet. This switches the coils from being attracted to being repelled, ensuring a continuous rotation. This principle allows a small DC motor to run at speeds up to 6.000 rpm. When the voltage polarity of the brushes is reversed, the rotor turns in the opposite direction.</p>
            
            <p>The advantage of the DC Micro Motor is that it runs on a DC voltage, and therefore does not require any complex driver electronics such as a stepper motor. Nevertheless, the control circuitry must be capable of handling comparatively large currents. Due to its limited torque, the DC Micro Motor is almost always used in compact lenses with smaller and lighter focusing lens groups. Another disadvantage of this autofocus drive is its relatively noisy operation. Nevertheless, it is a reliable autofocus system that is embedded in numerous Canon lenses.</p>

        <h2>Micro USM and Micro USM II<br>1992 - 2016</h2>
        <p>The Micro USM and Micro USM II are different members of Canon's ultrasonic motor family. The first generation Micro USM was introduced in 1992. Ten years later in 2002, the second generation Micro USM II followed with an ultra-compact design half the size of the original version.</p>

            <h2>Construction</h2>
            <p>Canon's Micro USM actuators are small-diameter (11&nbsp;mm) cylindrical ultrasonic motors using piezoelectric ceramic elements to generate oscillations. Compared to the <a href="#QJ_POS_02">ring-type USM</a>, the Micro USM uses an ultra-compact design. The original Micro USM version has an overall length of 26.7&nbsp;mm whereas the Micro USM II is just 13.4&nbsp;mm long. Both versions of the Micro USM have an output gear that engages with a speed-reducing and torque-increasing gearbox that is connected to the focusing cam barrel.</p>
            
            <p>The Micro USM motor in general is a stack of different parts pressed together via a metal shaft. The motor can be divided into the rotor, the stator, and some auxiliary parts and support structures. The attachment flange is usually described as the top of the unit.</p>

            <h2>Micro USM Main Parts</h2>

            <ul>
            <li>A flexible metal shaft has threads cut into both ends so that retaining nuts and discs can be screwed on to hold the entire stack of parts together. An attachment flange is used on the top of the motor to allow the Micro USM to be installed in the gearbox of the autofocus mechanism.</li>
            <li>The metal rotor has two slots on one side where it engages with two protrusions on the surface of the output gear wheel. Therefore, every movement of the rotor is transmitted directly to the output gear wheel. On the opposite side, the rotor has a tiny lip (seen on the cross-sectional view) where it forms a pressure contact with one of the stator's oscillators. The pressure is formed by a small spring that is directly pushing onto the rotor from the top side.</li>
            <li>The stator consists of a laminated piezoelectric element (LPE) that is sandwiched between two oscillators. These oscillators are cylindrical metal bodies that are pressed flat against the adjacent parts. The stator's oscillator 2 is held in place by a threaded disc. This threaded disc is omitted on the Micro USM II, as in this version the oscillator 2 is designed with an own thread.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Principle of Operation</h2>
            <p>Both versions of Micro USM autofocus drives use piezoelectric elements to generate ultrasonic vibrations in the stator. While this principle is similar to the ring-type USM, the Micro USM type of motors use an entirely different stator design. 
                
            </p><h2>The Laminated Piezoelectric Element (LPE)</h2>    
            
            <p>The Micro USM uses piezoceramic discs to generate ultrasonic vibrations in the stator. As the vibrations of each individual disc are extremely small in amplitude, a stack of round 25 discs is laminated to a solid piezoceramic part. The resulting multi-layer cylindrical unit is called the laminated piezoelectric element (LPE). The illustration is a schematic view of one piezoceramic disc.</p>
            
            <p>The two halves of these discs have been polarized in opposite directions. Each disc has four electrodes attached to either side, two on each half. This allows the discs to be energized in two phases A and B. If an electric voltage is applied to one phase, the electric field that forms across the electrodes causes one quarter of the disc to expand and one quarter to contract. This electrically induced deformation of piezoceramic material is referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The reaction of piezoceramic material is roughly 10 times higher in the expanding way rather than in the contracting way. In the illustration, the level of deformation is hugely exaggerated to illustrate the principles involved.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The illustration shows the arrangement of discs inside the laminated piezoelectric element, and how electrical power is supplied to each disc. Layers with even numbers have their A+/- and B+/- electrodes on their top, while layers with uneven numbers (except for the first one) have AG and BG electrodes on their top. Each disc has a number of through-holes, tiny conductive paths that establish electrical connections between the different layers. Note how some electrodes are shaped with recesses so that there is enough space for through-holes into deeper layers of the stack. The discs and through-holes are arranged so that energizing the A-phase (applying a voltage between the A and AG contacts) will energize all the A-phase portions of all discs at the same time. The same applies for the B-phase. This synchronized activation of all discs causes a uniform deformation of the entire LPE. Electrical power is provided via a thin sheet of printed circuit board that is pressed against the top surface of the LPE, establishing a connection to all of the through-holes of that first disc. The individual layers are not visible to the naked eye.</p>

            <h2>Flexural Vibration</h2>
            <p>With the LPE sandwiched between the two oscillator bodies, energizing the LPE with a sinusoidal voltage causes the oscillators to vibrate. Vibration is amplified by exciting the stator with the natural resonance frequency of the oscillators which is in the ultrasonic range. The illustration shows how the stator vibration even causes a lateral displacement of the stator body.</p>

            <h2>Both Phases are Energized</h2>
            <p>The two phases of the LPE are energized with high-frequency voltages that are shifted by λ/4 (temporal phase shift). The resulting vibrations from each phase combine and generate a nutation motion of the stator around its axis. This nutation forms a peak at the top surface of the larger oscillator that moves around the circumference similar to a traveling wave. The amplitude of that oscillation movement is as small as two micrometers, and therefore not visible to the naked eye. The oscillator has a small lip on its surface that is in pressure contact with the rotor.</p>

The nutation is slowed down and greatly exaggerated in amplitude. Note that the stator itself does not rotate around its axis but only the peak on the top surface of the larger oscillator travels in a circular way. This traveling wave (one peak and one valley) is the source of rotational energy that is transferred into the rotor via friction.</p>

        <p>This animation shows the complete Micro USM unit in operation. The principle of transferring the stator's energy into the rotor is similar to the frictional coupling used by the ring-type USM motor. The Micro USM rotor is in pressure contact with the top surface of the elastic body. Proper operation is achieved only when the stator is excited at the exact resonance frequency of the elastic metal bodies, which amplifies vibrations and thus energy transfer into the rotor. Although the Micro USM stator has no teeth cut into the oscillator body, the traveling wave exerts frictional force in the opposite direction of the nutation motion. This principle of frictional coupling is very similar to the ring-type USM. The animation shows that the rotor and output gear perform actual rotations around their axis, and their direction of rotation is opposite from the direction of the stator's traveling wave.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>The Working Principle Summarized</h2>
            
            <p>The cylindrical ultrasonic motor operates a two-stage energy conversion process: In a first stage, electrical energy is converted into a nutation motion of the stator. In a second stage, these ultrasonic vibrations are converted into a continuous unidirectional rotating movement of the rotor by friction on the stator. The stator vibrations are generated by a multi-layer laminated piezoelectric element that is excited via two separate phases that are excited with a λ/4 phase-shifted sinusoidal voltage, generating the nutation mode. The stator's energy is transferred to the rotor due to friction between the stator and rotor, caused by the pressure contact (preload force) between stator and rotor.</p>
            
            <p>This summary is similar in many respects to the summary of the ring-type USM motor. While the Micro USM and ring-type USM share the same general principles, they are still different types of motors. Here is a comparison of the similarities and the differences between the Micro USM and the ring-type USM:</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Similarities</h2>

            <p>Both types of motors use piezoelectric elements to generate flexural vibrations in the stator, as well as ultrasonic excitation to maximize vibrations in the oscillators. A traveling wave is generated at the surface of the stator, and friction is used to turn the rotor in the opposite way than the traveling wave. Both types are inaudible by the naked ear, but their noise can be picked up by sensitive microphones during video recordings. Neither of them is intended for long-term operation.</p>
            
            <h2>Differences</h2>
            
            <p>Ring-type USM and Micro USM types of autofocus drives use completely different stator geometries. Also, their piezoceramic elements are arranged in different ways. The stator of a ring-type USM forms seven to nine traveling waves whereas the stator of a Micro USM performs a nutation motion that is similar to a single traveling wave (one peak and one valley). The overall size of the Micro USM is considerably smaller than the ring-shaped USM. Output speed is relatively high on the Micro USM, and therefore a gearbox is used to lower the speed of the output gear. Overall production cost is comparatively low for the Micro USM and Micro USM II, which is why these types of motors have been used for the low- and mid-level lenses.</p>

        <h2>Stepper Motor (STM)<br>2012 - Present</h2>
        <p>In June 2012, Canon announced the EF 40mm F2.8 STM and the EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS STM lenses. These were the first lenses that carried the designation STM in their name, an abbreviation that stands for stepper motor. Although the technology had already been used in the Arc-Form Drive, the stepper motor inside STM lenses has a clearly different design including a greatly reduced size.</p>

            <h2>Two Gear Types</h2>
            <p>Stepper motors are rotary drives that convert electrical energy into rotational energy of the motor shaft. Canon uses two different transmission types to convert the rotary motion into linear motion of the focusing lens groups:</p>
                
            <ul>
            <li><b>Lead-Screw-Type STM:</b> This type of transmission uses a worm drive to side the focusing lens unit axially along two guide rails.</li>
            <li><b>Gear-Type STM:</b> This type of transmission uses gear wheels and is ultimately connected to a focusing barrel with helical slots. Once that internal barrel is turned, the focusing lens unit is shifted along the lens axis.</li>
            </ul>   
                
            <p>While these are different types of transmissions, the actual stepper motors used are identical. Canon STM lenses offer very quiet and smooth autofocus operation. For that reason, the STM autofocus system is considered a good choice for both photography and video shooting. The STM system has become widely used not only in Canon's EF and EF-S series of lenses but also in their latest RF and RF-S lenses. Here is a short list of lenses that use the STM autofocus system:</p>

        <div>
            
            <p>The type of stepper motor used in STM lenses is a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor with permanent magnet rotor. Unlike the AFD stepper motor, the STM version uses a rotationally symmetrical stator. First, the general principle of stepper motor operation is shown, and then the actual design of Canon's stepper motors is examined.</p>
                
            <h2>Stepper Motor in General</h2>
                        
            <p>The following illustration shows the general principle of a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor. The term 2-phase refers to the use of two separate coils. The description bipolar indicates that each of these coils can be energized with current flowing in two different directions, allowing each coil to generate two opposite magnetic field polarities. The ferromagnetic metal parts of the stator pointing towards the rotor are called field poles. The coil windings of both phases are split into two portions and are wound around opposite field poles to ensure simultaneous magnetization during operation. Each phase is labeled with two letters, one of them overlined to indicate the polarity in which the magnetic field is generated. Once phase A is energized, the magnetic polarity of field pole A and field pole Ā (Inverse-A) is always opposite from each other. The same applies for the second phase. In the illustration, the letters are also used to describe the polarities at which the voltage is applied to the coils.</p>
            
            <p>In this simplified example, the stator consists of four field poles, two per phase, which results in a rather large step angle of 90 degrees. During operation, the two phases are energized as shown in the timing diagram below. Note how due to inverted polarities, the two coils are capable of generating four different magnetic field orientations, and the stator strictly follows these orientations. This mode of operation is called full-step mode. Four full steps are required to complete one turn of the rotor. The stepper motor can also be driven in half-step mode where between full-steps both phases are turned on at the same time, turning the rotor by 45 degrees. Eight half-steps are required to complete one turn of the rotor. In the context of autofocus systems, however, speed is more important than increasing the step precision, and therefore the half-step mode is not discussed further.</p>

        <div>
            <h2>Stepper Motor with Can-Stack Design</h2>
            <p>The type of stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses has 20 field poles, 10 per phase. This quantity of field poles makes it unpractical to apply coil windings directly at each field pole. For that reason, a very clever stator design is used:</p>
            
            <p>The two phase windings are stacked on top of each other as shown in the cutaway diagram. Each phase winding is surrounded by a steel shell, and triangular teeth (field poles) are brought to the center. These teeth are arranged in an alternating fashion, five coming from the bottom of each coil pointing upwards, and five coming from the top of each coil pointing downwards. Once a coil is energized, the steel shell carries the magnetic flux into the teeth, one polarity to the teeth pointing up and the opposite polarity to the teeth pointing down. As a result, the teeth form an alternating ring of north and south magnetic poles and will attract the permanent magnet rotor accordingly.</p>
            
            <p>Thanks to this design, one coil winding has a total of 10 field poles. Phase B is located below and has an equal number of 10 field poles. One key requirement of this design is that both rings of phase A and phase B stator teeth are offset by 18 degrees from each other. This is half the pitch between two teeth of one stator. This stepper motor construction is also referred to as can-stack design because it looks like a small stack of two steel cans. Another commonly used term is tin-can design.</p>
                

        </div>
        </div>
            
                
        <div>
        <div>
            <h2>Principle of Operation</h2>
            <p>Once all teeth of phases A and B are combined, the stator consists of 20 field poles. The rotor is a ferrite ceramic cylinder that is magnetized in the 10-pole pattern shown (five north and five south poles). The stepper motor is operated via four repetitive steps:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Phase B is de-energized. Phase A is energized so that field poles labeled A are magnetized as south poles (and Inverse-A as north poles). The rotor turns so that its five north poles align with the stator's A poles (and the rotor's five south poles align with the stator's Inverse-A poles).</li>
            <li>Step 2: Phase A is de-energized. Phase B is energized so that field poles labeled B are magnetized as south poles (and Inverse-B as north poles). The rotor turns so that its five north poles align with the stator's B poles (and the rotor's five south poles align with the stator's Inverse-B poles).</li>
            <li>Step 3: Phase B is de-energized. Phase A is energized in reverse so that field poles labeled A are magnetized as north poles (and Inverse-A as south poles). The rotor turns so that its five south poles align with the stator's A poles (and the rotor's five north poles align with the stator's Inverse-A poles).</li>
            <li>Step 4: Phase A is de-energized. Phase B is energized in reverse so that field poles labeled B are magnetized as north poles (and Inverse-B as south poles). The rotor turns so that its five south poles align with the stator's B poles (and the rotor's five north poles align with the stator's Inverse-B poles).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>After four steps, the rotor has completed a 72 degree turn, and thus it requires 20 steps to complete one full rotation. The direction of rotation can be reversed by performing the sequence of steps backwards. The rotor follows the magnetic fields so precisely that no separate feedback control system is required. The autofocus control system of the lens sends an instruction to the stepper motor driver to perform a certain number of steps. After the same number of electrical pulses to the phase coils, the rotor will have performed an equal number of steps into the desired direction.</p>

            <p>The can-stack is one of the most commonly used stepper motors designs. It is often used in scanners, printers, CNC mills, robots, and other devices. The illustration is an enlarged cutaway diagram of a stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses. This is an extremely small unit of just eight millimeters diameter (this is smaller than the DC micro motor). Due to this size, the STM drive is more suitable for smaller focusing lens elements. It is therefore unlikely to ever be used in heavy super-telephoto lenses.</p>
            
            <h2>Full-Time Manual Focus Override</h2>
            
            <p>Canon STM lenses use focus-by-wire as the coupling method between the manual focusing ring and the autofocus drive. For that reason, all STM lenses do support full-time manual focus override at any time.</p>

        <p>The Nano USM uses piezoceramic elements to generate vibrations that are translated into movement. The drive system does not generate rotational output, and therefore doesn't require a helical barrel or lead screw to translate rotation into linear movement. Instead, the Nano USM generates a linear movement that is directly forwarded to slide the focusing lens cell axially along guide rails. A position encoder with alternating dark and reflective stripes is attached to the focusing lens unit, allowing an infrared sensor to count the steps that the focusing mechanism has moved.</p>

            <h2>The Nano USM Actuator</h2>
            <p>The heart of the system is the Nano USM actuator. That is a tiny piece of elastic metal around 20&nbsp;mm in length with piezoceramic elements attached to its lower side. The piezoceramic layer has three electrodes on the lower surface. Two small elevations on the top surface are in pressure contact with a stationary slide rail. The illustration summarizes this construction of the Nano USM actuator.</p>
            
            <p>Although being extremely small, the Nano USM actuator generates comparatively high levels of output torque. In addition, it offers very rapid start and stop characteristics and fast, well controllable output speed.</p>

            <h2>Two Vibration Modes</h2>
            <p>During operation of the Nano USM drive, the USM actuator goes into two flexural vibration modes. Mode&nbsp;1 is an out-of-plane bending mode that turns the actuator into a saddle-shape. Mode&nbsp;2 is another out-of-plane bending mode that shapes the actuator into a waveform.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
            
        <div>
        <div>
            <p>Both modes are excited with high-frequency voltages in the range of the natural resonance frequency of the elastic metal body. The result is that both vibrational modes combine and generate an elliptical motion of the contact points. Due to the pressure contact between the Nano USM actuator and the stationary slide rail, the elliptical motion exerts a frictional force on the surface. It is the counterforce on the actuator that ultimately generates the linear movement of the Nano USM frame.</p>
            
            <p>The amplitudes of both bending modes are greatly exaggerated in the illustrations. In reality, the amplitudes are so small that no deformation can be seen during operation. Similarly, the ultrasonic frequencies involved in the excitation of the actuator are inaudible to the human ear, and unlikely to be picked up by microphones. Due to its slightly lower output power, the Nano USM is preferred when smaller groups of lens elements need to be moved.</p>

        <h2>Voice Coil Motor (VCM)<br>2024 - Present</h2>
        <p>The voice coil technology has a long history that is tied to the history of telecommunication. The first voice coil was patented at the end of the 19th century, but it was in the 1920s when the first voice coils were actually installed in telephone speakers. A wire coil was attached to a paper diaphragm, and a magnet was placed inside the coil. The resulting device was a transducer that converted electronic signals into the voice of the caller. This type of use gave voice coils their names. Over the last decades, voice coils kept their name but got increasingly used for other applications including hard disc drives, robotics, precision instrumentation, as well as camera systems.</p>
            
        <p>Canon is already using voice coil motors for a long time to drive the <a href="https://exclusivearchitecture.com/03-technical-articles-CLT-18-image-stabilization.html">image stabilization unit</a>. Voice coil motors have also been used for decades as autofocus drives in cine lenses. This is ideal for video shootings because they are completely silent even in the ultrasonic range. Then, in 2024, Canon first used voice coil motors as the autofocus drives in their photographic lenses. The Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM was the first lens with a voice coil motor.</p>

            <li>Voice coil motors are very compact and lightweight in their design. This makes them suitable for applications where space is limited or weight constraints are critical.</li>
            <li>Fast response times: Unlike traditional motor technologies, such as DC or stepper motors, voice coil motors provide near-instantaneous response due to their direct electromagnetic actuation. In addition, their lightweight nature contributes to rapid acceleration and deceleration. This makes them an excellent choice for autofocus drives.</li>
            <li>Due to their high acceleration, the coil can reach a high speed very fast.</li>
            <li>High level of precision and accuracy: The design of voice coil motors allows for precise control and positioning, enabling the coil to be moved in sub-micrometer steps.</li>
            <li>Voice coils generate a high force output to move even very large focusing lens groups.</li>
            <li>Low power consumption: There are very low frictional losses due to the direct electromagnetic actuation. Therefore, voice coil motors have a very low power consumption which leads to extended battery life.</li>
            <li>Due to its linear design, no helical barrel or lead screw is required to translate rotation into linear movement. The voice coil is therefore directly connected to the focusing lens group.</li>
            <li>Voice coil motors are virtually silent even when recorded by sensitive microphones. This makes Canon's RF lenses with VCM autofocus drives perfect choices not only for photography but also for videography.</li>

        <h2>The Principle of Operation</h2>
        <p>The image shows the VCM unit inside the Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM lens. There are two identical voice coil motors attached to the focusing lens cell. This symmetrical construction prevents one-sided stress on the mechanism and therefore ensures a smooth sliding operation. Each voice coil is supported by a sliding rail that passes through its center and which defines the range of axial movement. On either side there are two strong permanent magnets placed above and below the voice coils so that their magnetic field runs through the coil.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
                
        <div>
        <div>
            <p>The following illustration is a cross-sectional view of the VCM unit. The voice coil is exposed to the stationary magnetic field of the permanent magnets at any time. Once a current runs through the wire coil, a force (called Lorentz force) is exerted on the coil so that it moves axially along the sliding rail. The force generated is proportional to the flux density of the magnetic field and the intensity of the electric current. The direction in which the Lorentz force acts is depending on the direction of the current. By applying ultra-short voltage pulses to the voice coil, the unit can be driven into the desired direction with an extreme level of precision.</p>
            
            <p>A slight drawback of the technology is that even when the focusing lens is not moved, the position control must be active in order to retain the coil's position.</p>

            <h2>Hybrid AF Lenses</h2>
            <p>The use of voice coils in Canon's RF lenses made it possible to enter a new field. The smooth and silent operation of the VCM system not only convinces photographers but for the first time also satisfies the requirements of videographers. For that reason, Canon has introduced a new series of specially designed RF lenses, called hybrid lenses. These are L-lenses of the RF mount system that are specially designed to combine the benefits of photo and video technologies (such as a manual aperture ring normally found only on cine lenses). Some examples of these hybrid RF lenses include:</p>

            <ul>
            <li>Canon RF 24mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)</li>
            <li>Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)</li>
            <li>Canon RF 50mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The illustration is a transparent view of the Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM hybrid RF lens. It can be seen that this lens is equipped with two autofocus drive systems. The pair of voice coil motors drives the main focusing lens group while a Nano USM unit drives the floating lens element.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
            
            
        <div>
        <p>The following illustration is a block diagram of the same lens. Note that the main focusing lens group consists of four lens elements, a considerable weight that requires a powerful autofocus system. The two symmetrically arranged coils of the voice coil motor actually generate a significant force to even allow rapid movements of these focusing lenses. The floating lens is a single element only, and therefore the smaller Nano USM is a sufficiently powerful drive system.</p>

Right now they seem centered on silencing both bad policies and the authoritarian turn in government.</p><p>Our government is simply less accountable when qualified and credible people are afraid to ask questions, or share information. It is also more poorly run. Many in DOGE don’t know the basics of government — how its systems work, and what laws mean — and they won’t know until they are made to hear about it. </p><p>Meanwhile Congress flatly refuses to provide any oversight of DOGE. When Dems tried to subpoena Elon Musk, they were voted down. There is even a DOGE subcommittee that has not not dared to bring anyone from DOGE to speak under oath. </p><p><span>Governments where capable bureaucrats are fired, or </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/12/justice-fbi-nationa-security-threats-trump/" rel="">reassigned</a><span> if they offer uncongenial truths, will not relay accurate information to decisionmakers, and so, decisions will get worse. We are living through a moment where in some policy domains, </span><a href="https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/musks-fraudulent-fraud-squad?utm_source=publication-search" rel="">right wing social media posters</a><span> exert more influence on decisions than people who actually know how those policies work. </span></p><p><span>It is hard to recall such conformity within a party. Republicans are canceling town hall meetings rather than criticize Musk publicly, after Musk has made clear he will not just attack them, but also fund opponents. Eric Swalwell, a Democratic member of Congress </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/06/us/politics/trump-democracy.html" rel="">said</a><span> of his Republican peers: </span></p><blockquote><p>I’m friends with a lot of these guys, and I had wrongly assumed that what was holding them back from speaking out against Trump was they were afraid of losing their jobs. But what they’re afraid of is their own personal security. They tell me that their wives tell them, ‘Don’t contribute to us getting harassed at church or at the grocery store or at the club.’</p></blockquote><p><span>For the past decade or so, you were told that America faced a crisis of free speech, characterized by wokeness.

Now, as we move into a period where the government is crushing the speech of those it disagrees with, or purging ideas (or the people who represent those ideas) it dislikes, those claims look not just naive, but reckless, since they were used to justify the real chilling effects exist.

They have redefined free speech to be the speech they support, and other speech to be subject to government control. </p><p><span>For example, Niall Ferguson was recently featured on </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uatx-launches-touting-ideological-openness-debate-60-minutes-transcript/" rel="">60 Minutes</a><span> touting the need for his private  university, University of Austin, to serve as a counterpart to cancel culture. Ferguson, a former critic of Trump, is now supporter. He has visited him at Mar-A-Lago. He sees little risk that Trump will undermine our freedoms: “I’m convinced that whatever impulses he has or has had in the past, the system can contain them as it was designed to.”</span></p><p>Chris Rufo is no longer pretending that concern about cancel culture needs to be even-handed. He says the rules of cancel culture simply need to be rewritten: </p><blockquote><p>to determine how the Right can protect its own members from unjust cancellation attempts and how it can enforce just consequences on political opponents who violate the new terms.</p></blockquote><p><span>Others still cling to the idea that it was wokeness that is causing the current censorship, since it fueled </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jonathanbchait.bsky.social/post/3licuj52cms2t" rel="">the reactionary forces</a><span> of Trumpism. Or relabel the right to be “</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/02/woke-right/681716/" rel="">the woke right</a><span>” to try to maintain the relevance of the trope. If you spent the last decade being fundamentally wrong about the gravest threats to speech in America, these are  clever ways to rewrite history to give the impression that you were right all along.  </span></p><div data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://donmoynihan.substack.com/p/real-chilling-effects?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;}" data-component-name="CaptionedButtonToDOM"><p>Thanks for reading Can We Still Govern?

People who had happily talked with us at the start were now afraid to return our calls. “Now I have this fear all the time,” one told us at the time. There is a similar chill now in Washington. Every day someone who used to feel free to speak publicly against Mr. Trump says they will no longer let journalists quote them by name for fear of repercussions, both Democrats and Republicans…in decades of reporting in Washington, under Republicans and Democrats, it has never felt quite like this </p></blockquote><p>This is a grim comparison, but one that forces us to acknowledge the scale of the change. It is all the more astonishing since Baker is known for being famously (and even infuriatingly) non-partisan. </p><p>There is reason for hope. America has a more independent judiciary, media and civil society than Russia. But all of those institutions are themselves under attack. Their willingness to act, not their mere existence, is what gives them power. The norms do not defend themselves. As more institutions go quiet, or offer their co-operation with the new regime, the erosion of norms still occurs, even if it it occurs more slowly than it did in Russia. </p><p>Defending democracy against a coercive government poses a collective action problem: we are all better off when people are willing to publicly defend basic freedoms, but few want to be the guy standing alone in front of the tank. </p><p>So many institutions and individuals see what is going on and don’t want to say anything. To do so would threaten their livelihood or organization, or employees, or the personal safety of themselves or their families. It is understandable at an individual level, but collectively disastrous. </p><p><span>Courage is contagious. As people offer examples of a willingness to publicly push back, more will stand up. For example, climate scientists and misinformation researchers have fought for years against efforts to silence them. CBS apparently changed its mind about settling a frivolous lawsuit with Trump, and now </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/06/cbs-files-to-dismiss-trump-lawsuit" rel="">promises to fight back</a><span>. Some politicians are courageous despite the vitriol they have always faced. For example, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:p7gxyfr5vii5ntpwo7f6dhe2/post/3li42lco6b22h?ref_src=embed" rel="">AOC mocked</a><span> threats by homeland security czar Tom Holman to investigate her. </span></p><p>Individual actions and collective organizing help to remind others that the actions of the Trump administration do not have broad support. It can’t all be on individuals, however. Universities, philanthropies, corporations, nonprofits, and professional organizations need to remind each other of the power they have, and the principles they stand for. </p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

            <span>Abstract:</span>Artificial intelligence commonly refers to the science and engineering of artificial systems that can carry out tasks generally associated with requiring aspects of human intelligence, such as playing games, translating languages, and driving cars. In recent years, there have been exciting advances in learning-based, data-driven approaches towards AI, and machine learning and deep learning have enabled computer systems to perceive the world in unprecedented ways. Reinforcement learning has enabled breakthroughs in complex games such as Go and challenging robotics tasks such as quadrupedal locomotion.
<br>A key aspect of intelligence is to not only make predictions, but reason about the uncertainty in these predictions, and to consider this uncertainty when making decisions. This is what this manuscript on "Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence" is about. The first part covers probabilistic approaches to machine learning. We discuss the differentiation between "epistemic" uncertainty due to lack of data and "aleatoric" uncertainty, which is irreducible and stems, e.g., from noisy observations and outcomes. We discuss concrete approaches towards probabilistic inference and modern approaches to efficient approximate inference.
<br>The second part of the manuscript is about taking uncertainty into account in sequential decision tasks. We consider active learning and Bayesian optimization -- approaches that collect data by proposing experiments that are informative for reducing the epistemic uncertainty. We then consider reinforcement learning and modern deep RL approaches that use neural network function approximation. We close by discussing modern approaches in model-based RL, which harness epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to guide exploration, while also reasoning about safety.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>When I founded Ecosia a few years ago, I made <strong>two promises</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="1iwillneversellecosia">1. I will never sell Ecosia.</h3>
<h3 id="2iwillnevertakeprofitsoutofthecompany">2. I will never take profits out of the company.</h3>
<p>I made these promises because my goal for Ecosia has always been to make the world a greener, better place – not to get rich. I also wanted to prove that there is a more ethical way of doing business.</p>
<p>Since then, Ecosia has grown into something way bigger than myself: we’re not just planting millions of trees every month, we’re also becoming one of the largest environmental movements in the world.</p>
<p>And so I find it important to renew my commitment to my two promises by turning Ecosia into a so-called “steward-owned company”. This model imposes two <em>legally binding and irreversible</em> restrictions on us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Shares can’t be sold at a profit or owned by people outside of the company.</li>
<li>No profits can be taken out of the company.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two restrictions sound like a <em>terrible</em> idea to most traditional entrepreneurs. But Ecosia isn’t traditional. We’re not interested in maximizing profits, we’re interested in maximizing the amount of trees we plant.</p>
<p>I hope that many other businesses will follow suit. I truly believe that the world would be a better place if more businesses were driven by a meaningful cause instead of shareholder value maximization.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Christian Kroll</p>
<p>P.S.: Being a “steward-owned company” means that it will be impossible for me – or anyone else – to sell Ecosia at a profit or take money out of the company. This obviously also applies to the former co-owner of Ecosia, <a href="https://www.schumacher.me/">Tim</a>, an experienced entrepreneur I met a few years ago. He invested in Ecosia at a time when no one knew if this crazy project would ever work out. Tim, I cannot overstate how grateful I am that you agree to turn Ecosia into a non-profit company, effectively waiving your right to get any of your investment back.</p>

            <link>https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/</link>
            <guid>43317592</guid>
            <pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:44:27 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/">https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43317592">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p>About a month ago, the CPython project merged <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call">a new implementation strategy</a> for their bytecode interpreter. The initial headline results <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/128718">were very impressive</a>, showing a 10-15% performance improvement <strong>on average</strong> across <a href="https://pyperformance.readthedocs.io/">a wide range of benchmarks</a> across a variety of platforms.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I will document in this post, these impressive performance gains turned out to be <strong>primarily due to inadvertently working around a regression in LLVM 19.</strong> When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.</p>
<p>When the tail-call interpreter was announced, I was surprised and impressed by the performance improvements, but also confused: I’m not an expert, but I’m passingly-familiar with modern CPU hardware, compilers, and interpreter design, and I couldn’t explain why this change would be so effective. I became curious – and perhaps slightly obsessed – and the reports in this post are the result of a few weeks of off-and-on compiling and benchmarking and disassembly of dozens of different Python binaries, in an attempt to understand what I was seeing.</p>
<p>At the end, I <a href="#reflections">will reflect</a> on this situation as a case study in some of the challenges of benchmarking, performance engineering, and software engineering in general.</p>
<p>I also want to be clear that I still think the tail-calling interpreter is a great piece of work, as well as a genuine speedup (albeit more modest than initially hoped). I am also optimistic it’s a more robust approach than the older interpreter, in ways I’ll explain in this post. I also really don’t want to blame anyone on the Python team for this error. This sort of confusion turns out to be very common – I’ve certainly misunderstood many a benchmark myself – and I’ll have some reflections on that topic at the end.</p>
<p>In addition, the impact of the LLVM regression doesn’t seem to have been known prior to this work (and the bug still isn’t fixed, as of this writing); thus, in that sense, the alternative (without this work) probably really was 10-15% slower, for builds using clang-19 or newer. For instance, Simon Willison <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/13/python-3140a5/">reproduced the 10% speedup</a> “in the wild,” as compared to Python 3.13, using builds from <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone"><code>python-build-standalone</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="performance-results">Performance results&nbsp;<a href="#performance-results"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>Here are my headline results. I benchmarked several builds of the CPython interpreter, using multiple different compilers and different configuration options, on two machines: an Intel server (a <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/230580/intel-core-i513500-processor-24m-cache-up-to-4-80-ghz/specifications.html">Raptor Lake i5-13500</a> I maintain in Hetzner), and my Apple M1 Macbook Air. You can reproduce these builds <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/">using my <code>nix</code> configuration</a>, which I found essential for managing so many different moving pieces at once.</p>
<p>All builds use LTO and PGO. These configurations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>clang18</code>: Built using Clang 18.1.8, using computed gotos.</li>
<li><code>gcc</code> (Intel only): Built with GCC 14.2.1, using computed gotos.</li>
<li><code>clang19</code>: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using compute gotos.</li>
<li><code>clang19.tc</code>: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using the new tail-call interpreter.</li>
<li><code>clang19.taildup</code>: Built using Clang 19.1.7, computed gotos and some <code>-mllvm</code> tuning flags which work around the regression.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve used <code>clang18</code> as the baseline, and reported the bottom-line “average” reported by <code>pypeformance</code>/<code>pyperf compare_to</code>. You can find the complete output files and reports <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/tree/data/">on github</a>.</p>

<p>Observe that the tail-call interpreter still exhibits a speedup as compared to clang-18, but that it’s far less dramatic than the slowdown from moving to clang-19. The Python team has also observed larger speedups than I have (after accounting for the bug) on some other platforms.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-background">A brief background&nbsp;<a href="#a-brief-background"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>A classic bytecode interpreter consists of a <code>switch</code> statement inside of a <code>while</code> loop, looking something like so:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span><span>while</span> (true) {
</span></span><span><span>  opcode_t this_op <span>=</span> bytecode[pc<span>++</span>];
</span></span><span><span>  <span>switch</span> (this_op) {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> OP_IMM: {
</span></span><span><span>      <span>// push an immediate onto the stack
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>      <span>break</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>case</span> OP_ADD: {
</span></span><span><span>      <span>// handle the add
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>      <span>break</span>;
</span></span><span><span>    }
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// etc
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>  }
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Most compilers will compile the <code>switch</code> into a jump table – they will emit a table containing the address of each <code>case OP_xxx</code> block, index into it with the opcode, and perform an indirect jump.</p>
<p>It’s <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44681-8_59.pdf">long been known</a> that you can speed up a bytecode interpreter of this style by replicating the jump table dispatch into the body of each opcode. That is, instead of ending each opcode with a <code>jmp loop_top</code>, each opcode contains a separate instance of the “decode next instruction and index through the jump table” logic.</p>
<p>Modern C compilers support <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Labels-as-Values.html#Labels-as-Values">taking the address of labels</a>, and then using those labels in a “computed goto,” in order to implement this pattern. Thus, many modern bytecode interpreters, including CPython (before the tail-call work), employ an interpreter loop that looks something like:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c++"><span><span><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span>opcode_table[<span>256</span>] <span>=</span> {
</span></span><span><span>    [OP_IMM] <span>=</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>TARGET_IMM,
</span></span><span><span>    [OP_ADD] <span>=</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span>TARGET_ADD,
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// etc
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>};
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span>#define DISPATCH() goto *opcode_table[bytecode[pc++]]
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span>
</span></span><span><span>DISPATCH();
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>TARGET_IMM: {
</span></span><span><span>    <span>// push an immediate onto the stack

<p>For performance reasons (performance of the compiler, not the generated code), it turns out that Clang and LLVM, internally, actually merges all of the <code>goto</code>s in the latter code into a <strong>single</strong> <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#indirectbr-instruction"><code>indirectbr</code> LLVM instruction</a>, which each opcode will jump to. That is, the compiler takes our hard work, and deliberately rewrites into a control-flow-graph that looks essentially the same as the <code>switch</code>-based interpreter!</p>
<p>Then, during code generation, LLVM performs “tail duplication,” and copies the branch <strong>back</strong> into each location, restoring the original intent. This dance is documented, at a high level, <a href="https://blog.llvm.org/2010/01/address-of-label-and-indirect-branches.html">in an old LLVM blog post</a> introducing the new implementation.</p>
<h2 id="the-llvm-19-regression">The LLVM 19 regression&nbsp;<a href="#the-llvm-19-regression"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>The whole reason for the deduplicate-then-copy dance is that, for technical reasons, creating and manipulating the control-flow-graph containing many <code>indirectbr</code> instructions can be quite expensive.</p>
<p>In order to avoid catastrophic slowdowns (or memory usage) in certain cases, LLVM 19 implemented <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/78582">some limits on tail-duplication pass</a>, causing it to bail out if duplication would blow up the size of the IR past certain limits.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on CPython those limits resulted in Clang <strong>leaving all of the dispatch jumps merged</strong>, and entirely undoing the whole purpose of the computed <code>goto</code>-based implementation! This bug was <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/106846">first identified</a> by another language implementation with a similar interpreter loop, but had not been known (as far as I can find) to affect CPython.</p>
<p>In addition to the performance impact, we can observe the bug directly by disassembling the resulting object code and counting the number of distinct indirect jumps:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><h3 id="further-weirdness">Further weirdness&nbsp;<a href="#further-weirdness"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>I am confident that the change to the tail-call duplication logic caused the regression: if <a href="#the-fix">you fix it</a>, performance matches clang-18. However, I can’t fully explain the <strong>magnitude</strong> of the regression.</p>
<p>Historically, the optimization of replicating the bytecode dispatch into each opcode has been cited to speed up interpreters anywhere from <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/c718c6be0f82af5eb0e57615ce323242155ff014/Misc/HISTORY#L15252-L15255">20%</a> to <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-44681-8_59.pdf">100%</a>. However, on modern processors with improved branch predictors, <a href="https://inria.hal.science/hal-01100647/document">more recent work</a> finds a much smaller speedup, on the order of 2-4%.</p>
<p>We can verify this 2-4% number in practice, because Python still supports the “old-style” interpreter, which uses a single <code>switch</code> statement, via a configuration option. Here’s what we see if we benchmark that interpreter (".nocg" for “no computed gotos” in the following table):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Benchmark</th>
<th>clang18</th>
<th>clang18.nocg</th>
<th>clang19.nocg</th>
<th>clang19</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Performance change</td>
<td>(ref)</td>
<td>1.01x faster</td>
<td>1.02x slower</td>
<td>1.09x slower</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that <code>clang19.nocg</code>" is only 2% slower than <code>clang18</code>, even though the base <code>clang19</code> build is 9% slower! I interpret that “2%” as a fairer estimate for the cost/benefit of duplicating opcode dispatch, alone, and I don’t fully understand the other one.</p>
<h3 id="do-we-need-computed-gotos">Do we need computed gotos?&nbsp;<a href="#do-we-need-computed-gotos"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>I haven’t mentioned the <code>clang19.nocg</code> benchmark, which you may notice claims to be <strong>faster</strong> than <code>clang19</code>" It was at this point that I discovered an additional, and very funny, twist to the story.</p>
<p>I explained earlier that Clang and LLVM:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compiles the <code>switch</code> into a jump table and an indirect jump, very similar to the one we create by hand using computed gotos</li>
<li>Compiles computed gotos into a control-flow graph that closely resembles the classic <code>switch</code> graph, which a single instance of the opcode dispatch, and</li>
<li>Is able to reverse the transformation during codegen in order to duplicate the dispatch</li>
</ol>
<p>Those facts taken together, might lead you to ask, “Couldn’t we just start with the <code>switch</code>-based interpreter, and have the <strong>compiler</strong> do tail-duplication, and get the same benefits?”</p>
<p>And it turns out: Yes.</p>
<p>clang-18 (or clang-19 with appropriate flags), when presented with the “classic” <code>switch</code>-based interpreter, <strong>goes ahead and that replicates the dispatch logic into each the body of each opcode anyways</strong>. Here’s another table, showing the same builds with the number of indirect jumps, using the <code>objdump | grep</code> test from earlier:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Benchmark</th>
<th>clang18</th>
<th>clang18.nocg</th>
<th>clang19.nocg</th>
<th>clang19</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td># of indirect jumps</td>
<td>332</td>
<td>306</td>
<td>3</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Thus, there’s a case to be made that the entire “computed goto” interpreter turns out to be entirely unnecessary complexity (at least for modern Clang). The compiler is perfectly capable of performing the same transformation itself, and (apparently) the computed gotos don’t even suffice to guarantee it!</p>
<p>That said, I did also test GCC, and GCC (at least as of 14.2.1) does not replicate the <code>switch</code>, but does implement the desired behavior for when using computed goto. So at least in that case we see the expected behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-fix">The fix&nbsp;<a href="#the-fix"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/114990">LLVM pull request 114990</a> is open and should fix this regression. It has not yet merged as of this writing, but hopefully will soon. I have also benchmarked it and confirmed it restores the expected performance.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/78582">PR that caused the regression</a> added a tunable option to choose the threshold at which tail-duplication will abort. We can restore similar behavior on clang-19 by simply setting that limit to a very large number<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h2 id="reflections">Reflections&nbsp;<a href="#reflections"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>I will freely admit that I got nerdsniped quite effectively by this topic, and have gone far deeper than was really necessary. That said, having done so, I think there are a number of interesting lessons and reflections to be taken away, which generalize to software engineering and performance engineering, and I will attempt to extract and meditate upon some of them.</p>
<h2 id="on-benchmarking">On benchmarking&nbsp;<a href="#on-benchmarking"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>When optimizing a system, we generally construct some set of benchmarks and benchmarking methodology, and then evaluate proposed changes using those benchmarks.</p>
<p>Any set of benchmarks or benchmark procedures embeds (often implicitly) what I like to call a “theory of performance.” Your theory of performance is a set of beliefs and assumptions that answer questions like “which variables (may) effect performance, in what ways?” and “what is the relationship between results on benchmarks and the “true” performance in “production”?”</p>
<p>The benchmarks ran on the tail-call interpreter showed a 10-15% speedup when compared with the old computed-goto interpreter. Those benchmarks were accurate, in that they were accurately measuring (as far as I know) the performance difference between those builds. However, in order to generalize those specific data points into the statement “The tail-call interpreter is 10-15% faster than the computed-goto interpreter, more generally,” or even “The tail-call interpreter will speed up Python by 10-15% for our users,” we need to bring in more assumptions and beliefs about the world. In this case, it turns out the story was more complex, and those broader claims were not true in full generality.</p>
<p>(Once again, I really don’t want to blame the Python developers! This stuff is <strong>hard</strong> and there are a million ways to get confused or to reach somewhat-incorrect conclusions. I had to do ~three weeks of intense benchmarking and experimenting to reach a better understanding. My point is that this is a very general challenge!)</p>
<h3 id="baselines">Baselines&nbsp;<a href="#baselines"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>This example highlights another recurring challenge, not only in software performance, but in many other domains: “What baseline do you compare against?”</p>
<p>Any time you propose a new solution or method for some problem, you typically have a way of running your new method, and producing some relevant performance metrics.</p>
<p>Once you have metrics for <strong>your</strong> system, however, you need to know what to compare them against, in order to decide if they’re any good! Even if you score well on some absolute scale (assuming there <strong>is</strong> a sensible absolute scale to evaluate), if your method is worse than an existing solution, it’s probably not that interesting.</p>
<p>Typically, you want to compare against “the current best-known approach.” But sometimes that can be hard to do! Even if you understand the current approach in theory, you may or may not be an expert in applying it in practice. In the case of software this may mean something like, tuning your operating system or compiler options or other flags. The current-best approach may have published benchmarks, but they’re not always relevant to you; for instance, maybe it was published years ago on older hardware, and so you can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with the public numbers. Or maybe their tests were run at a scale you can’t afford to replicate.</p>
<p>I work in machine learning at Anthropic these days, and we see this all the time in ML papers. When a paper comes out claiming some algorithmic improvement or other advance, I’ve noticed that the first detail our researchers ask is often not “What did they do?” but “What baseline did they compare against?” It’s easy to get impressive-looking results if you’re comparing against a poorly-tuned baseline, and that observation turns out to explain a surprising fraction of supposed improvements.</p>
<h2 id="on-software-engineering">On software engineering&nbsp;<a href="#on-software-engineering"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>One other highlight, for me, is just how complex and interconnected our software systems are, and how rapidly-moving, and how hard it is to keep track of all the pieces.</p>
<p>If you’d asked me, a month ago, to estimate the likelihood that an LLVM release caused a 10% performance regression in CPython and that no one noticed for five months, I’d have thought that a pretty unlikely state of affairs! Those are both widely-used projects, both of which care a fair bit about performance, and “surely” someone would have tested and noticed.</p>
<p>And probably that <strong>particular</strong> situation was quite unlikely! However, with so many different software projects out there, each moving so rapidly and depending on and being used by so many other projects, it becomes practically-inevitable that <strong>some</strong> regressions “like that one” happen, almost constantly.</p>
<h3 id="optimizing-compilers">Optimizing compilers&nbsp;<a href="#optimizing-compilers"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h3>
<p>The saga of the computed-goto interpreter illustrates recurring tensions and unresolved questions around optimizers and optimizing compilers, to which we don’t yet have agreed-upon answers as a field.</p>
<p>We generally expect our compilers to respect the programmer’s intent, and to compile the code that was written in a way that preserves the programmer’s intent.</p>
<p>We also, however, expect our compilers to optimize our code, and to transform it in potentially-complex-and-unintuitive ways in order to make it run faster.</p>
<p>These expectations are in tension, and we have a dearth of patterns and idioms to explain to the compiler “why” we wrote code in various ways, and whether we were <strong>deliberately</strong> trying to trigger a certain output, or make a certain performance-related decision, or not.</p>
<p>Our compilers typically only <strong>promise</strong> to emit code with “the same behavior” as the code we write; performance is something of a best-effort feature on top of that guarantee.</p>
<p>Thus, we end up in this odd world where clang-19 compiles the computed-goto interpreter “correctly” – in the sense that the resulting binary produces all the same value we expect – but at the same time it produces an output completely at odds with the intention of the optimization. Moreover, we also see other versions of the compiler applying optimizations to the “naive” <code>switch()</code>-based interpreter, which implement the exact same optimization we “intended” to perform by rewriting the source code.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it appears that the “computed goto” interpreter, at a source code level, and “replicating the dispatch at a machine-code level” end up being almost-orthogonal notions! We’ve seen examples of every instance of the resulting 2x2 matrix! Because all of those <code>python</code> binaries compute the same values when run, our current tools are essentially unable to talk about the distinctions between them in a coherent way.</p>
<p>This confusion is one way in which I think the tail-calling interpreter (and the compiler features behind it) represent a genuine, and useful, advance in the state of the art. The tail-call interpreter is built on <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#musttail">the <code>musttail</code> attribute</a>, which represents a relatively new kind of compiler feature. <code>musttail</code> does not affect the “observable program behavior,” in the classic sense that compilers think, but is rather a conversation with the <strong>optimizer</strong>; it requires that the compiler be able to make certain optimizations, and requires that compilation fail if those optimizations don’t happen.</p>
<p>I’m hopeful this framework will turn out to be a much more robust style for writing performance-sensitive code, especially over time and as compilers evolve. I look forward to continued experiments with features in that category.</p>
<p>Concretely, I find myself wondering if it would be viable to replace the computed-goto interpreter with something like a (hypothetical) <code>[[clang::musttailduplicate]]</code> attribute on the interpreter <code>while</code> loop. I’m not expert enough in all the relevant IRs and passes to have confidence in this proposal, but perhaps someone with more familiarity can weigh in on the feasibility.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-note-on-nix">One more note: on <code>nix</code>&nbsp;<a href="#one-more-note-on-nix"><i>	🔗︎</i></a> </h2>
<p>I want to close with a call-out of how helpful <code>nix</code> was for this project. I have been experimenting with nix and NixOS for my personal infrastructure over the last year or so, but they turned out to be a total lifesaver for this investigation.</p>
<p>In the course of these experiments, I have built and benchmarked <strong>dozens</strong> of different Python interpreters, across four different compilers (<code>gcc</code>, <code>clang-18</code>, <code>clang-19</code>, and <code>clang-20</code>) and using numerous combinations of compiler flags. Managing all of that by hand would have strained my sanity, and I’m <strong>certain</strong> I would have made numerous mistakes during which I mixed up which compiler and which flags went into which build, and so on.</p>
<p>Using <code>nix</code>, I was able to keep all of these parallel versions straight, and build them in a reproducible, hermetic style. I was able to write some short abstractions which made them very easy to define, and then know with absolute confidence <strong>where</strong> any given build in my <code>nix</code> store came from, with which compilers and which flags. After a small amount of work to build some helper functions, the core definitions of my build matrix is <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/blob/afd2123bef6ec3fd872d628f2bb519b20684e161/python.nix#L105-L143">shockingly concise</a>; here’s a taste:</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="nixos"><span><span>{
</span></span><span><span>    base <span>=</span> callPackage buildPython { python3 <span>=</span> python313; };
</span></span><span><span>    optimized <span>=</span> withOptimizations base;

</span></span><span><span>    clang20 <span>=</span> withLLVM llvmPackages_20 optLTO;

</span></span><span><span>    clang18nocg <span>=</span> withoutCG clang18;
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>    clang19taildup <span>=</span> withTailDup clang19;
</span></span><span><span>}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I was even able to build a custom version of LLVM (with the bugfix patch), and do Python builds using that compiler. Doing so required <a href="https://github.com/nelhage/cpython-interp-perf/blob/afd2123bef6ec3fd872d628f2bb519b20684e161/llvm.nix#L14-L25">all of about 10 lines of code</a>.</p>
<p>That said, not everything was rosy. For one, <code>nix</code> is, by necessity, “weird” in various ways compared to the ways “normal people” use software, and I worry that some of that weirdness may have affected some of my benchmarks or conclusions in ways I didn’t notice. For instance, early on I discovered that nix (by default) builds projects using certain hardening flags that <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/130961">disproportionately impact the tail-call interpreter</a>. I’ve handled that one, but are there more?</p>
<p>In addition, Nix is incredibly extensible and customizable, but figuring out how to make a specific customization can be a real uphill battle, and involve a lot of trial and error and source-diving. My patched LLVM build ended up being pretty short and clean, but getting there required me to read a lot of <code>nixpkgs</code> source code, mixing and matching two under-documented extensibility mechanisms (<code>extend</code> and <code>overrideAttrs</code> – not to be confused with <code>override</code>, used elsewhere), and one failed attempt which successfully patched <code>libllvm</code>, but then silently built a new <code>clang</code> against the unpatched version.</p>
<p>Still, <code>nix</code> was clearly enormously helpful here, and on net it definitely made this kind of multi-version exploration and debugging <strong>much</strong> saner than any other approach I can imagine.</p>

<p>In beginning the NVIDIA Blackwell Linux testing with <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx5090-linux">the GeForce RTX 5090 compute performance</a>, besides all the CUDA/OpenCL/OptiX benchmarks delivered last week a number of readers asked about AI performance and in particular the Llama.cpp performance with the RTX 5090 flagship graphics card. Here are some initial benchmarks looking at the GeForce RTX 5090 performance in Llama.cpp compared to prior RTX 40 and RTX 30 graphics cards.</p>

<p>Over the weekend I carried out some initial tests of Llama.cpp as well as re-testing the higher-end GeForce RTX 30 and RTX 40 graphics cards. All tests were carried out using the NVIDIA 570.86.10 Linux driver on Ubuntu 24.10 with the Linux 6.11 kernel. The graphics cards tested included:</p>
<p>- GeForce RTX 3090<br>
- GeForce RTX 4070<br>
- GeForce RTX 4070 SUPER<br>
- GeForce RTX 4080<br>
- GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER<br>
- GeForce RTX 4090<br>
- GeForce RTX 5090</p>

<p>Llama.cpp with Llama 3.1 and Mistral 7B were used for the initial runs with text generation and prompt processing . More Llama.cpp benchmarks against the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards to come with enough reader interest. For now let's continue on with this initial look.</p>

threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal,” Tiwana said.</p><p>In addition to the

civic freedom, such as rights to association, peaceful assembly and expression, occasional violations occur.</p><p>For part of Trump’s first term, Tiwana said, the US had been categorized as “obstructed”, due to the administration’s response to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement" data-link-name="in body link">Black Lives Matter</a> protests and <a

Tiwana, said, but as of Monday, the US has been placed on the watchlist as the group says it sees “significant deterioration” in civic freedoms occurring.</p><p>Tiwana noted that the US is again seemingly headed toward the “obstructed” category.</p><p>While the Trump administration often say they <a

they see as agreeing with them”.</p><p>Historically, Tiwana said, the US has been “considered the beacon of democracy and defense of fundamental freedoms”.</p><p>“It was an important pillar of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-foreign-policy" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">US foreign policy</a>, even though it was imperfect, both domestically and how the US promoted it abroad,” he added.</p><p>But Tiwana believes that the recent actions and statements made by this US administration could empower authoritarian regimes around the world, undermine constitutional principles, and embolden those who “want to accumulate power and increase their wealth and their ability to stay in power for as long as possible”.</p><p>Tiwana says that he and the organization want to draw attention to the fact that those in power in the US are, in his view, engaging in a “zero-sum politics game” that is eroding “constitutional principles and frankly, engaging in, anti American behavior”.</p><p>“We urge the United States to uphold the rule of law and respect constitutional and international human rights norms,” said Tiwana.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<h2>The NRAO fleet</h2>
<p>The cars used on the NRAO campus are different from what you might expect. You’ll see photos of them below, and in case you’re wondering why they look so old, let me explain.</p>

<p>Gasoline-powered cars generate more RFI than diesel-powered cars because they have spark plugs. That meant that NRAO had to purchase diesel cars when they bought their original fleet, and by the way, these cars are part of that original purchase. When NRAO wanted to renew their fleet, they found out they couldn’t, because the newer diesel-powered cars on the market were all using chips and various other electrical equipment (seat belt buzzers, door buzzers, etc.) that generated unwanted RFI. Any electrical ark (spark plugs, power lines, bad thermostats, etc.) generates broadband radio signals, at various frequencies throughout the spectrum but mostly at the lower frequencies, below 2 GHz or so.&nbsp;So that meant they had to stick with their original fleet, whose diesel engines used no computer chips whatsoever and generated little RFI. You may look at these cars and call them clunkers but to NRAO technicians and scientists, they’re reliable modes of transportation that do not interfere with their research.</p>

<p>You may see newer cars in the parking lot, but they’re not used on campus. Only these blue diesel cars can go under and around the telescopes without causing problems.</p>

<p>Because they have no new technology to warm up the engine block on cold mornings, they keep them plugged in whenever they’re parked, to make sure they can be started right away and to keep down on the wear and tear on the engines.</p>

<p>One thing I can’t get used to in these old cars is the gear shifter. It’s so long and seems so awkwardly placed…</p>
<h2>More on the telescopes</h2>
<p>One of the telescopes on site is used as a teaching instrument. NRAO, being involved in both research and educational efforts, brings groups of school-age children on-site to teach them about radio astronomy. The telescope is not a fancy, cryogenically cooled machine but a simple wire-mesh dish with simple control and monitoring gear that the kids can play with. It’s fully functional though, and it does pick up many radio waves. It’s sufficient to teach radio astronomy and galactic coordinate systems and such.</p>
<p>The National Youth Science Camp is just up the road from NRAO. For two weeks each summer, groups of teachers (high school and college) come to NRAO for an intense course in radio astronomy. The staff turn on the knowledge firehose and “really pour it on them”, as Mr. Sizemore puts it. They have classes during the day and then do research at night with the telescopes. He says it’s not unusual at the end of two weeks to see them walking around the campus, muttering to themselves.</p>
<p>After they complete the course, they can bring their own students to NRAO (for a day or so) and use the 40-foot learning telescope to teach them about radio astronomy without much intervention from NRAO Staff.</p>
<p>As the young researchers sit and wait by the telescopes for the stars to come into position, they have nothing to do, so they doodle or draw. Sue Ann Heatherly, the NRAO Education Officer, loves to collect the better ones and she puts them up on the walls of various NRAO corridors.</p>
<p>As we drove around, Mr. Sizemore pointed to a dish and told me it was a polar mount, and that I will never see a dish built like that again. It’s mounted on the plane of the galaxy (Milky Way) not the earth coordinate system. It’s a right ascension and declination mount. If you were to stand on the axis of the telescope and look at the sky, you would be looking directly at Polaris, the North Star. (By comparison, the GBT (Green Bank Telescope) is mounted as an elevation and azimuth drive system, which is an earth based system. )&nbsp;The reason this telescope was built like this in the 1950s is because computer power at that time wasn’t fast enough to translate between the coordinates of the galaxy and the solar system in realtime. Now even a pocket calculator can do it.</p>
<p>Although the telescope has been sitting unused for 10 years, they recently brought it back online in order to do atmospheric research studies with MIT. The study involves bouncing radio signals off the&nbsp;satellites&nbsp;around the Earth, then measuring those signals to see how they were perturbed by the atmosphere. The MIT researchers brought their own trailer on-site, with their own receiver and computer equipment. After some work mitigating RFI leaks from the trailer, they were ready to go and NRAO was happy to see the telescope back in action.</p>
<p>When it comes to the GBT (Green Bank Telescope) one of the things NRAO doesn’t want to do with such a large telescope is to set up vibrations in the structure when it’s started and stopped. The way they handle that is to mount both forward and reverse motors at each drive wheel. In order to stop or start it, all the technicians have to do is to increase the current on the motors that move in the direction they need, and the structure will stop or start as fast or as slow as they want it. When you think about this and other precision equipment mounted on the dish, like the laser leveling equipment and the motors that power each plate in the dish, Mr. Sizemore likened the GBT to “building a battleship with the precision of a Swiss watch”.</p>

<p>Even the track of the telescope is leveled to within 1/5,000th of an inch, and the rest of the structure is comparable to that all the way up. What about the land settling over time, I asked? There are no such problems, he replied, because they went all the way down to bedrock when they laid the foundation (about 40 feet).</p>
<p>The local cement contractor had no competition when it came to the contract for laying the foundation. The closest competitor was about 40 miles away, on the other side of the mountain, so he got the contract and had to rent three additional cement mixer/pouring trucks in order to keep up with the demand. For the entire period (three or four weeks) that it took to pour the foundation, the man kept grinning as his trucks pulled into the construction site, because he stood to make a lot of money.</p>
<h2>The NRQZ monitoring station</h2>
<p>While I was on-site, Mr. Sizemore showed me his “hiding place” – his monitoring station. It’s a big trailer that can be hauled from place to place, but has been made stationary and hooked up to the power lines. That’s where he does most of his work. Here he monitors the gross violations of the Quiet Zone and also looks at the local environment: powerline noise, illegal use of radios, etc.</p>
<p>For example, at the time of my visit there, the amateur radio bands were being used improperly by a group of people and the signal was strong enough to overload the 140-foot telescope, so it became a serious problem. Wesley told me that the problem will likely be taken care of long before I write up about it, and the likely action taken will be that he calls the FCC in to enforce the rules in place. After 20 years on the job, Wesley has built up a network of contacts he can call upon when he needs help. One of those contacts is the man in charge of the Enforcement Bureau at the FCC, whom Wesley knew when he was still a satellite technician.</p>
<p>While I was recording our talk, I asked Wesley if he could see the interference generated by my recorder, and he worked up a quick setup to find the noise it created. Sure enough, he tuned into the noise generated by my iPod as it was recording our conversation within a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>One of the teaching tools he uses with school groups that visit NRAO is a metal trashcan (a Faraday cage with an antenna and amplifier mounted inside the lid). He takes his spectrum analyzer, connects it to the antenna and amplifier assembly, then gets a student volunteer to put in their phone or laptop or MP3 player, then he shows the whole group the interference those devices create. The only thing the antenna sees is the RFI generated by the device put in the trash can, because it’s a Faraday cage. Everyone is invariably wowed by this.</p>
<p>As we drove around the NRAO campus, we came across a car with a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantenna" target="_blank">cantenna</a>” (a directional waveguide antenna for long-range WiFi), and I immediately pointed it out to Mr. Sizemore, as I knew he’d be on the lookout for WiFi transmissions in the area. Smirking, he admitted that was his service car, and he told me the story behind it. The FCC had donated it to NRAO, who had been using it to sniff out illegal transmissions. The car actually had antennas built into its roof and was already fitted with equipment for sniffing out radio transmissions. Mr. Sizemore outfitted it with WiFi “sniffing” equipment as well: a laptop with NetStumbler and a bunch of other apps, a GPS device for marking the location of RFI-causing WiFi and a “cantenna” on the roof, that he could rotate and point at various WiFi sources.</p>
<p>Before retiring from NRAO (years after my interviews with him), Mr. Sizemore <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2009-01-02-interference-hunters_N.htm?csp=34" target="_blank">outfitted a new Dodge Ram extended cab truck as an RFI vehicle</a>, a feat which was written up in USA Today.</p>
<h2>NRAO and the community</h2>
<p>As we drove around the campus, Mr. Sizemore pointed to the farmhouses that surrounded NRAO. When the government took over the land, they invoked the right of imminent domain, forcing the farmers to move. That generated animosity toward the observatory, because the land was fertile and it was good for farming.</p>
<p>With time, things got better, to the point where there was only one farmer left who couldn’t stand NRAO and wouldn’t ever let them step on his property. All of the powerlines and phone lines for NRAO were routed around his property.&nbsp;At one point, the man chased Mr. Sizemore’s predecessor off with a stick. If NRAO staff ever had to go visit him, they’d take a deputy sheriff with them. When Mr. Sizemore began working there, he knew to steer clear of the farm.</p>
<p>One day though, he got a call from the man. He had an outside TV amplifier, a tube-type amplifier made by a company called Blonder-Tongue, which had been struck by lightning. The old man couldn’t find anyone to repair it and he didn’t want to spend money to get a new one. He called the only one whom he knew could help. Mr. Sizemore was of course glad to do it, because he’d finally be able to atone for the bad blood between NRAO and the farmer.</p>
<p>He drove out to the man’s place, where he had to wait off the property for the amplifier to be brought to him (he still wasn’t allowed on the farm) and took it back to the lab to see what he could do.</p>
<p>He called Blonder-Tongue&nbsp;and was told they hadn’t made that amplifier model in 20 years, and they hadn’t serviced it for 10 years. They didn’t think they could help. Mr. Sizemore insisted he speak with a supervisor and as luck would have it, the repair supervisor was an elderly guy who remembered working on them when he’d started with the company. He said, “Send it to me, and I’ll show these young technicians how things used to be.” Mr. Sizemore explained the entire situation to the man, about NRAO and the farmer, then mailed off the amplifier to the repair supervisor.</p>
<p>The amplifier came back repaired and it didn’t cost anything either. The old farmer was elated when he got it back. He put it back up and everything was fine until a week later, when he called Mr. Sizemore. You know the old saying about lightning not striking twice? Not true for the old man. His amplifier had been struck again.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to let Mr. Sizemore examine his property, to see if the lightning strikes could be prevented, so all he could do was to mail it off to Blonder-Tongue&nbsp;once more. Sure enough, it came back repaired as new again, at no charge. Thankfully, to the day of the interview, the amplifier evaded other lightning strikes so things were fine between NRAO and the old man.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Sizemore’s efforts, NRAO enjoys a very good relationship with the community. Being an isolated rural community, where all they have is each other, they tend to pull together and help each other.</p>
<p>For example, some people had learned to recognize the interference from awry TV amplifiers, which would show up as a herringbone pattern on their sets, and would call Mr. Sizemore to let him know. They also knew what powerline interference looked like, because it would show up on their sets once again, generating a specific noise pattern.</p>
<p>The NRAO site is basically a wildlife preserve. They let the animals live and roam free. The only practice they instituted a few years back was a controlled deer hunt, because the deer population had gotten out of control. Before they began, the Wildlife Management Institute wanted to do a headcount of the deer, so they fitted a plane with thermal imaging equipment and started to fly over the NRAO site one night.</p>
<p>Because they hadn’t publicized this, the local people didn’t know what was happening and all they could see was a plane which kept circling over NRAO at night. They thought the plane was in trouble, so they all pulled together, drove to the local airport (next to NRAO) and shone their headlights on the landing strip, to help it land. Well, after a while, they figured out the plane wasn’t in trouble and went home, but let’s just say that the next time WMI decided to do nighttime wildlife studies, they publicized it widely, to make sure everyone knew what was going on.</p>
<h2>The NEACP encounters</h2>
<p>As we talk about flyovers, another good story is that of the NEACP encounters. When the Cold War was going on, the US Military always had an aircraft in the air at all times, an airborne command post (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Emergency_Airborne_Command_Post" target="_blank">NEACP</a>: National Emergency Airborne Command Post). There were multiple such aircraft in service and one was in flight at all times. One would take off before one would land.</p>
<p>When they would fly over NRAO, all the radio equipment on board those planes (they used 1,000 Watt transmitters) would overload NRAO’s equipment with RFI. Mr. Sizemore found the number for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne_Mountain" target="_blank">CMOC</a> (Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center) and spoke to one of the people involved with NEACP. He introduced himself and said, “You have this aircraft, using this callsign, operating at this frequency, at this location.” They got upset right away, because they didn’t want anyone to know what their routes were. They started questioning Mr. Sizemore about the source of his information, to which he simply replied, “I used a 300-foot telescope and I looked at your aircraft.” Then he continued to explain: “I have to track this source of interference down. That is my job. I have a solution. Let me send you my observing schedule every month, to tell you what frequencies I’ll be observing on what days and tell you my station, and then you’ll be able to avoid me. And if you can’t avoid me, you can let me know, and I’ll tell the astronomers to take a coffee break.”</p>
<p>As a result of that phone call, Mr. Sizemore got the NEACP to avoid the Green Bank area, and when they couldn’t avoid it, he got a few calls from them when they had to pass over NRAO, after which he would quickly tell the astronomers to take a break, as their equipment would soon get overloaded, making the data unusable.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s the end of part seven and the series. As mentioned at the start, this work is unfinished, and that’s why you don’t see a nice story arc with good closure, but I hope that what I’ve published has proven enjoyable and interesting for you and has sparked your interest in radio astronomy and NRAO.&nbsp;You can also read parts&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves - Part One" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/04/chasing-rfi-waves-part-one/" target="_blank">one</a>, <a title="Chasing RFI Waves – Part&nbsp;Two" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/11/chasing-rfi-waves-part-two/" target="_blank">two</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves - Part Three" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/04/chasing-rfi-waves-part-three/" target="_blank">three</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves - Part Four" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/03/04/chasing-rfi-waves-part-four/" target="_blank">four</a>,&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves – Part&nbsp;Five" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/04/01/chasing-rfi-waves-part-five/" target="_blank">five</a>, and&nbsp;<a title="Chasing RFI Waves – Part&nbsp;Six" href="https://raoulpop.com/2012/04/08/chasing-rfi-waves-part-six/" target="_blank">six</a>.</p>

Software spends most of its time running in user mode, where it is restricted from directly performing powerful operations such as accessing files or communicating on a network. To carry out these actions, software must temporarily elevate to kernel mode by making a <em>system call</em>, which is a request to the kernel to take over and perform the desired operation. For example, when a program wants to open a file, it makes a system call which switches the program to running kernel code in kernel mode. The kernel code verifies the program is allowed to access that file, and then returns a special handle representing the now opened file back to the program in user mode.</p><p id="ecd6">Most operating systems use a <em>monolithic kernel</em> design, where the kernel has unrestricted access to the entire system — all hardware, memory, and user data. In an ideal world, where software is flawless and no one attempts to compromise security, this design may be satisfactory. However, software often contains bugs, and some of those bugs lead to security vulnerabilities. Given that monolithic kernels are large, they present more opportunities for these vulnerabilities to arise and be exploited. Once a vulnerability is successfully exploited, it can lead to a complete system compromise, as all the operating system’s functions are bundled together in the kernel’s single “basket of eggs”.</p><p id="3efb">An alternative kernel design, known as a <em>microkernel</em>, minimizes the functions within the kernel itself, pushing most operations into separate, unprivileged processes. This can improve security by isolating potential vulnerabilities. However, microkernels can suffer from performance issues, and push extra complexity onto the application software. As a result, monolithic kernels remain prevalent, and the vulnerabilities associated with them continue to be a problem.</p><p id="3cab">The kernel shared in common between iOS, macOS, tvOS, visionOS and watchOS — named XNU — is based on a microkernel called Mach. However, the way XNU has been implemented places all system functions within the same privileged scope and it effectively operates as a monolithic kernel. The XNU kernel, like all monolithic kernels, suffers from unfortunately common vulnerability discoveries.</p><h2 id="163d">Isolation Efforts</h2><p id="2632">Over the years, a variety of software and hardware-based mitigations have been developed to isolate some parts systems from their more vulnerable monolithic kernels. Below are some notable non-Apple examples:</p><ul><li id="321d">Microsoft Virtualisation-based Security (VBS) used for <em>Credential Guard </em>in Windows</li><li id="d52b">Intel Software Guard Extension (SGX) and VT-X2</li><li id="0d82">ARM TrustZone — Powers features like Samsung Knox, Samsung Pay, Android Verified Boot, Android secure PIN entry</li></ul><p id="364d"><em>Apple has also increasingly attempted to isolate data from the kernel and these are covered below.</em></p><h2 id="910e">2013 — Apple Secure Enclave</h2><p id="ebcc">In 2013 Apple released the iPhone 5s, the first iPhone containing a Secure Enclave. The Secure Enclave is implemented on a dedicated, hardened CPU core running a microkernel-based OS called <em>SepOS</em>. The underlying kernel in SepOS is <em>cL4</em>, Apple’s custom version of the L4-embedded microkernel. The Secure Enclave is used to store and protect sensitive data like encryption keys and biometric information (e.g., Face ID). The Secure Enclave operates independently of the iOS kernel and only provides its services to iOS through controlled, secure interactions. Even if the iOS kernel is compromised, the Secure Enclave remains largely unaffected unless an additional exploit targets it.</p><p id="438a">Do not confuse the Secure E<strong>n</strong>clave with the subject of this article, Secure E<strong>x</strong>claves!</p><h2 id="ec46">2017 — Page Protection Layer</h2><p id="4afc">With the release of the iPhone 8 and iPhone X containing the A11 processor, Apple introduced a security feature known as the <em>Page Protection Layer (PPL)</em>. This hardware+software feature isolated a small part of the kernel and gave it privileges to modify memory page tables — critical structures that manage memory access. The rest of the kernel lost the ability to directly modify these page tables. The PPL’s limited attack surface ensured that bypasses were infamously rare. While PPL added a layer of protection, it was only partly effective as the rest of the kernel still held most privileges required to compromise data without modifying page tables.</p><h2 id="5b0b">2021–2023 — Secure Page Table Monitor</h2><p id="9c23">Following PPL, the release of the iPhone 13 containing the A15 processor introduced new functionality utilised in iOS 17: the <em>Secure Page Table Monitor</em> (SPTM). This replaced and improved upon the PPL by securing additional memory functions and dividing them into subsystems, further isolating small kernel components. Validation of code signatures, confirming that all code had been signed by Apple was also isolated.</p><p id="861b">Around this time, oblique references to <em>exclaves</em> began to surface in XNU source code. These exclaves were speculated to be the subsystems managed by SPTM. Then 2024 happened…</p><h2 id="1e82">2024 — Exclaves: A major addition to XNU</h2><p id="7a85">With the release of XNU source code supporting M4 and A18 based systems (such as the iPhone 16), the curtain was partly pulled back on exclaves. (Exclaves are <em>not</em> active on prior processors).</p><p id="9904"><em>It is now clear that exclaves are part of a much larger redesign of XNU’s security model.</em></p></div><div><h2 id="5029">XNU Exclaves</h2><p id="6fc0"><em>Disclaimer: This analysis will not be 100% correct — many parts of exclaves aren’t open sourced and their inner workings are only inferred or I am speculating.</em></p><figure><figcaption>Conclave of 2005: White smoke indicates a new Pope has been elected; in this case Pope Benedictus XVI</figcaption></figure><p id="fa62">Exclaves are a new set of features that represent a significant enhancement for XNU’s traditional monolithic kernel. Exclaves refer to resources that are isolated from XNU, protected even if the kernel is compromised. These resources are pre-defined when the OS is built, are identified by name or id, have different types, are initialised at boot time, and are organized into unique domains. SPTM protects exclave memory from XNU with new exclave-specific page types. Types of resources include:</p><ul><li id="6a35"><em>Shared memory buffers </em>that can be accessed by both the kernel and the exclave, with the option to make them read-only or read-write to XNU.</li><li id="b491"><em>Audio buffers</em> and <em>sensors</em> that are used for securing features like the camera and microphone access indicators.</li><li id="fbc6"><em>Conclaves</em> that group multiple resources into their own secure domains and their corresponding <em>Conclave Managers</em></li><li id="a21a"><em>Services</em> that can execute code within the exclave space when called upon by threads in XNU.</li></ul><figure><figcaption>Threads change context between different privilege levels and worlds</figcaption></figure><h2 id="b3dc">Secure Kernel — seL4?</h2><p id="0de0">To allow for execution of exclave Services while isolated from XNU, Apple has introduced a new kernel called the Secure Kernel (SK). The SK image file contains a version string for “cL4”. While I have not attempted to disassemble SK, there are many indications that it is based on the seL4 kernel despite the “cL4” name. The IPC structures used by XNU to communicate with SK closely align with seL4 rather than L4-embedded used for the original SepOS cL4 kernel. Strings in SK frequently mention capabilities, frames, untyped memory, minting, and so on which are also more closely aligned with seL4.</p><p id="bfb2">Perhaps it isn’t a coincidence that the seL4 Foundation publicly announced that Apple had joined in April 2024. Incidentally, the kernel for the C1 processor, Apple’s new baseband chip, is also based on some version of L4 so Apple is heavily invested in this space.</p><h2 id="d6ec">Secure Worlds — ARM TrustZone?</h2><p id="1ac5">As previously mentioned, SepOS runs on a dedicated processor for maximum isolation. In contrast, SK runs on the same high speed application processors as XNU/iOS. To make this possible, additional processor privilege levels are required — likely supported by virtualization extensions, Apple specific additions to SPTM, or most likely via ARM’s <em>TrustZone</em> technology. The XNU source code contains several references regarding transitions to and from TrustZone’s concept of a <em>secure world</em>, and it would be the cleanest implementation method.</p><p id="3892">TrustZone divides the system into two worlds: the <em>Secure World</em> and the <em>Insecure World</em>. ARM provides several design patterns for TrustZone, and Apple appear to have been influenced by these. XNU (and iOS) run in the insecure world while SK operates in the secure world. SK provides a limited operating environment for exclaves, resources and services, differing from the Trusted Applications design pattern suggested by ARM. Given the isolated nature of exclave services and the limited attack surface of the Secure Kernel, escaping from the secure world to compromise XNU is likely to be much more difficult than exploiting it directly from the insecure world.</p><p id="b718">Apple <em>may</em> use SPTM to manage transitions between the secure and insecure worlds, though this is speculation on my part, as it is not open-sourced so disassembly of the binaries is required. The code refers to this transition as a <em>RINGGATE</em>.</p></div><div><h2 id="6c7b">A Deeper Dive</h2><figure></figure><h2 id="82fc">Domains and Resources</h2><p id="e4e9">XNU initialises a two-level kernel table structure to hold information on exclave <em>resources </em>discovered during boot. Each resource is exclusively of one resource type and holds information on a resource that exists in the secure world, or in both worlds.</p><p id="0856">The <em>root_table</em> identifies <em>domains</em> by name, with each domain referencing a second level table holding all the <em>resources</em> for that domain. Domains and their resources discovered so far include:</p><p id="1da3"><strong>com.apple.kernel </strong>— this domain contains many resources used by the kernel including:</p><ul><li id="329f">com.apple.service.ConclaveLauncherControl — conclave launcher service</li><li id="7ba8">com.apple.service.ConclaveLauncher_Debug — debug service</li><li id="4457">com.apple.service.ExclaveIndicatorController — service for secure indicator lights</li><li id="e230">com.apple.service.LogServer_XNUProxy — service for logging</li><li id="38ca">com.apple.service.FrameMint — service used to boot ExclaveKit</li><li id="4245">com.apple.storage.backend — Shared memory buffer used by exclave services to do file IO from XNU space via upcalls (more details below)</li><li id="95fc">Conclave Manager x — One per conclave, used to control a conclave</li><li id="331b">Conclave Manager y …</li></ul><p id="7718"><strong>com.apple.darwin </strong>— No open-source components use this domain</p><p id="b5b9"><strong>com.apple.conclave.name</strong> — There is one domain per conclave.</p><ul><li id="06da">service_x</li><li id="e73c">service_y</li><li id="d0fb">audio buffer</li><li id="7502">shared memory buffer</li><li id="0c5d">etc</li></ul><p id="2f5a"><strong>com.apple.driver.<em>name</em> </strong>— One domain per device driver — existence of these domains is based on comments, not actually seen in open-sourced code. I suspect these are just per-driver conclaves.</p><h2 id="9a8b">Conclaves</h2><p id="785f">A conclave is a type of resource that itself can contain multiple resources. However, it is much more than just a container of resources. Conclaves allow a group of services and other resources to have shared access to each other, and Mach tasks are limited in what (if any) conclaves they can call upon.</p><p id="a3d8">Each conclave has a <em>Conclave Manager</em> (another type of exclave resource), located in the kernel domain.</p><p id="eea9">Conclaves have a lifecycle, whereby their Conclave Manager is first <em>attached</em> to a Mach task, and are then <em>launched</em>. They can also be stopped and detached. States such as <em>launching</em> and <em>stopping</em> exist during transitions in the lifecycle.</p><h2 id="5805"><strong>Conclaves — Spawning and Attaching</strong></h2><p id="7581">The XNU posix_spawn() function can call task_add_conclave() to attach a task and a conclave manager resource together. This is a 1:1 relationship — only one task can be attached to a conclave manager and vice versa. Only launchd and tasks with the <em>com.apple.private.exclaves.conclave-spawn</em> entitlement may spawn a conclave. The <em>com.apple.private.exclaves.conclave-host </em>entitlement is largely similar, but I believe only entitles a task to attach itself, rather than being able to spawn a new task for this purpose.</p><p id="6ac1">The kernel looks up the associated conclave manager resource for the targeted conclave in the <em>com.apple.kernel</em> domain. It then saves a <em>tightbeam</em> endpoint to the conclave manager’s endpoint in the conclave’s resource struct. This endpoint is where all future control of the conclave is directed. Tightbeam appears to be an RPC framework for communication between exclave components.</p><p id="acb7">Note this attachment is to a <em>task</em> — not a <em>thread</em>. Execution of services will be covered later.</p><p id="65a9">Conclave manager tasks are <em>not</em> allowed to have kernel domain privileges.</p><h2 id="d948"><strong>Conclaves — Launching</strong></h2><p id="673f">Once attached, a conclave may be <em>launched</em>. The launch attempt must be performed from the conclave manager task attached to the conclave. Attempts to launch conclaves also wait until exclaves have fully booted (into state EXCLAVES_BS_BOOTED_EXCLAVEKIT — more on this later).</p><p id="747d">A new mach trap (ie system call) for exclave functionality has been added to XNU and ends up in the <em>_exclaves_ctl_trap() </em>function. This call is overloaded and can perform different <em>operations</em> passed in as parameters. The relevant operation to launch a conclave is EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_LAUNCH_CONCLAVE.</p><p id="1ab0">The launch operation calls a redacted function, <em>conclave_launcher_conclavecontrol_launch() </em>and passes it the tightbeam connection to the conclave manager to perform the launch. I suspect this requests the initialisation of executable code and resources for the conclave within the secure world.</p><p id="d027">In production, conclave hosts can be <em>tainted</em> when launched, and an exit() may then cause a kernel panic.</p><h2 id="5d4d">A New Mach Trap / System Call</h2><p id="610a">As mentioned, the _exclaves_ctl_trap() function handles a new Mach trap for exclave functionality. The call is overloaded, with its action dependent on an operation parameter, and it generally verifies entitlements to the operations called. The operations are:</p><ul><li id="7707">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_BOOT — Called twice during the system boot process — firstly to start exclaves boot stage 2, and then to boot stage ExclaveKit. The caller must be launchd or have the com.apple.private.exclaves.boot entitlement.</li></ul><p id="33ff"><em>All operations below, at minimum, require the current task to have the com.apple.private.exclaves.kernel-domain entitlement, or be the relevant conclave manager task</em></p><ul><li id="07d0">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_LAUNCH_CONCLAVE — launch a conclave, discussed earlier</li><li id="dea1">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_LOOKUP_SERVICES — lookup an exclave service and copy its struct to a userspace buffer. First it looks in the exclave domain of the current task, if that fails it checks the Darwin domain followed by kernel domain — if it is entitled to do so</li><li id="5b78"><strong>EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_ENDPOINT_CALL</strong> — calls the endpoint for an exclave service in the current task’s domain — this will result in the current thread switching from kernel mode to the secure world and executing specific code there</li><li id="4b58">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NAMED_BUFFER_CREATE — create a named buffer resource</li><li id="343b">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NAMED_BUFFER_COPYIN — copy data from a userspace buffer to a kernel buffer (that is shared with exclaves)</li><li id="7e58">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NAMED_BUFFER_COPYOUT — copy data from a kernel buffer (that is shared with exclaves) to a userspace buffer</li><li id="ed65">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_AUDIO_BUFFER_CREATE — can an audio buffer</li><li id="4258">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_AUDIO_BUFFER_COPYOUT — copy data from audio buffer to userspace buffer</li><li id="3d7d">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_CREATE — create a sensor resource (eg. camera, microphone)</li><li id="d56d">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_START</li><li id="406f">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_STOP</li><li id="3a23">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_SENSOR_STATUS</li><li id="edf9">EXCLAVES_CTL_OP_NOTIFICATION_RESOURCE_LOOKUP — create a notification resource — TBD, but likely for coordination/scheduling</li></ul><h2 id="88a8">Downcalls — running code in the secure world</h2><p id="c102">Downcalls are calls to exclave <em>Services’ </em>endpoints in the secure world — this is where secure world code execution happens.</p><p id="8349">There is a great deal of complexity in these calls, primarily around managing thread/IPC contexts and scheduling the current thread to execute code in the secure world.</p><ol><li id="1347">Downcalls switch the current thread into the secure world and start executing at an entry point in secure code, rather than asking some other thread to perform work on behalf of the current thread.</li><li id="ca8a">Calling tasks must have kernel domain entitlements or be the conclave manager task attached to the service’s conclave.</li><li id="237b">Conclaves have a maximum of 128 services that can be called</li><li id="ffd3">It appears that threads are scheduled into the secure kernel (via the sk_enter() function) by XNU. XNU appears to handle the scheduling of <em>all</em> threads in the secure world, with SK potentially not having any independent threads of its own.</li><li id="d4bf">A thread executing in the secure world can perform a temporary <em>upcall</em> to XNU, which returns the thread to kernel mode for the upcall, before a mandatory return <em>back</em> to the secure world context. More detail on upcalls will be provided further below.</li><li id="7c94">Threads executing in the secure world can do normal scheduler type things like yield, wait, be suspended, or be interrupted. When this happens, the thread leaves the secure world and returns to the XNU kernel context. From there it must be rescheduled back into the secure world by exclave scheduling code in XNU. The thread will continue to be rescheduled into the secure world as necessary until the downcall is completed.</li><li id="9e02">If a secure world thread is panic()ing on a CPU core (which will call on XNU to panic via SPTM), fresh tasks are no longer scheduled into the secure world on other cores and they wait for a timeout period. If everything goes correctly, the waiting threads will never finish their wait. However if the timeout expires, the waiting threads will then … panic() :)</li><li id="de4a">XNU appears to handle all interrupt processing, rather than SK. When XNU is finished handling an interrupt, the interrupted thread is returned to the secure world if it was executing there. Directing interrupts to either the insecure or secure kernel is an ARM TrustZone feature.</li><li id="d706">IPC structures for the downcall are setup with request and response buffers before entering the secure world through the redacted sk_enter() call.</li><li id="c8da">Interrupts and pre-emption are disabled while finalising the IPC request structure and calling sk_enter(). This is because there is only one of these structures <em>per core</em>. I suspect the redacted path travelled after calling sk_enter() and entering the secure world copies the request from the per-cpu structure into secure world memory, and then re-enables interrupts and pre-emption on the core. The alterative would be ugly. A similar process happens in reverse for protecting the per-cpu response structure.</li><li id="2e37">Disconcertingly, the downcall response can come back via a different CPU’s per-core response buffer, as the downcall may have been interrupted, upcalled, or yielded and needed rescheduling.</li><li id="1fdc">Coordination of a thread’s exclave status (to avoid SK re-entry etc) occurs via <em>th_exclaves_state</em> — a bitfield in the thread structure.</li></ol><h2 id="3742">Upcalls — Secure World calls to XNU</h2><p id="102d">A thread running in the secure world due to a downcall may need assistance from XNU and this can be achieved through an upcall to the exclaves upcall handler via the Tightbeam framework. Upcalls are limited to specific functions within XNU. A thread desiring an upcall returns to the insecure world where the specific upcall handler is called. While in this state, the thread cannot return to user mode (for obvious reasons) nor perform another downcall to the secure world, ie it is not allowed to “re-enter” exclaves. Instead the thread will be returned to the secure world at the point where it performed the upcall.</p><p id="b346">Allowed upcalls discovered in the source end up inside the following functions:</p><p id="c245"><strong>Memory<br></strong>exclaves_memory_upcall_alloc(npages, kind, completion);<br>exclaves_memory_upcall_free(pages, npages, kind, completion);</p><p id="e369"><strong>File storage<br></strong>exclaves_storage_upcall_root(exclaveid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_open(fstag, rootid, name, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_close(fstag, fileid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_create(fstag, rootid, name, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_read(fstag, fileid, descriptor, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_write(fstag, fileid, descriptor, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_remove(fstag, rootid, name, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_sync(fstag, op, fileid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_readdir(fstag, fileid, buf, length, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_getsize(fstag, fileid, completion);<br>exclaves_storage_upcall_sealstate(fstag, completion);</p><p id="6b87"><strong>DriverKit<br></strong>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_register(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_remove(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_enable(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_irq_disable(id, index, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_register(id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_remove(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_enable(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_disable(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_set_timeout(id, timer_id, duration,completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_timer_cancel_timeout(id, timer_id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_lock_wl(id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_unlock_wl(id, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_async_notification_signal(id, notificationID, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_mapper_activate(id,mapperIndex, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_mapper_deactivate(id, mapperIndex, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_notification_signal(id, mask, completion);</p><p id="df95"><strong>DriverKit Apple Neural Engine<br></strong>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_setpowerstate(id, desiredState, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_worksubmit(id, requestID, taskDescriptorCount, submitTimestamp, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_workbegin(id, requestID, beginTimestamp, completion);<br>exclaves_driverkit_upcall_ane_workend(id, requestID, completion);</p><p id="bda7"><strong>Conclaves<br></strong>exclaves_conclave_upcall_suspend(flags, completion);<br>exclaves_conclave_upcall_stop(flags, completion);<br>exclaves_conclave_upcall_crash_info(shared_buf, length, completion);</p><h2 id="9a54">The XNUProxy</h2><p id="83f9">References to XNUProxy abound, yet I haven’t been able to definitely pin down exactly what and where it is.

Anything going wrong usually ends up in a panic().</p><p id="a86e">Booting occurs in three stages. Stage one is not visible in the open-source, however is likely a secure boot process where SK is loaded into memory and its code signatures are verified before being made executable.

By isolating sensitive resources, Apple is shrinking their potential attack surface and reducing the impact of any single kernel compromise. Defending monolithic kernels is a Sisyphean task, and exclaves represent one method of dealing with the challenge — is it the right direction for the long term, or a temporary step? In my dreams, I imagine a future redesign using CHERI and a production implementation of ARM Morello 😊 Regardless, it’s a defensive effort on a larger scale than any other end user device manufacturer is currently attempting.</p><p id="19f9">Critically, this article has not directly examined <em>what</em> is being moved from the kernel into exclaves. Build images indicate they are being used for secure camera/microphone indicators, some Apple Neural Engine functionality, some device drivers, components that talk to the Secure Enclave and so on. There may be many components that will benefit from future migration to exclaves and the overall effectiveness of exclaves may depend on an ongoing effort to maximise their usage. Everything XNU outside of exclaves will still be fair game.</p><p id="1328">I also suspect that exclaves may be used within Apple’s Private Cloud Compute infrastructure for cloud-based AI to provide a higher assurance of privacy in the face of external threats.</p><p id="ee04">I would particularly like to highlight the work of Dataflow Forensics and their much more advanced work dissecting SPTM without the benefit of source code. I enthusiastically await their promised blog post about exclaves and hope they will answer many of the remaining questions, provide gory disassembly explanations, and correct all my mistakes and assumptions!</p><h2 id="5698">To do (by someone much smarter than me!)…</h2><ul><li id="e1e2">ExclaveKit…</li><li id="9aac">ExclaveDriverKit…</li><li id="de31">Where does the “XNUProxy” really fit in?</li><li id="38d5">Disassembly to determine how XNU switches to the secure world, and if this involves SPTM, and/or TrustZone…</li><li id="caa3">Almost everything about the Secure Kernel…</li><li id="839a">Almost everything happening in the Secure World userspace…</li></ul><p id="786b"><em>This analysis was based on Apple’s Open Source XNU build 11215.*</em></p><p id="6a6f"><em>AI was used to improve my poor writing skills in the introductory sections.</em></p></div></div></article></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple has been working to harden the XNU kernel that powers its various operating systems, including iOS and macOS, with a feature called "exclaves."</p>
<p>The term appears to have first surfaced <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/Libc/commit/c5a3293354e22262702a3add5b2dfc9bb0b93b85">in a libc file</a> in Apple's open source software collection in 2023, and subsequently within iOS 17, released in September of that year, as later <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://eclecticlight.co/2024/06/15/a-brief-history-of-mac-enclaves-and-exclaves/">noted</a> by Howard Oakley on his Eclectic Light Co blog.</p>
<p>Exclaves, Oakley observed last June, are believed to implement "domains isolated from the kernel that protect key functions in macOS even when the kernel becomes compromised. This in turn suggests that Apple is in the process of refactoring the kernel into a central microkernel with protected exclaves."</p>

    

<p>Current Apple chips have a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-enclave-sec59b0b31ff/1/web/1">Secure Enclave</a>, a dedicated secure subsystem integrated into the device's system-on-chip (SoC). It's separate from the application processor kernel as a defense against compromise. It's used for operations that need strong security like the processing of encryption keys.</p>

        


        

<p>An <em>enclave</em> is defined as an area within a territorial boundary. So an <em>exclave</em> is an area outside of a boundary with ties to the main territory.</p>
<p>The XNU kernel, as Apple's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/xnu">documentation</a> explains, is "a hybrid kernel combining the Mach kernel developed at Carnegie Mellon University with components from FreeBSD and a C++ API for writing drivers called IOKit."</p>

        

<p>It is hybrid in the sense that it combines the Mach microkernel with the BSD monolithic kernel.</p>
<p>Each architectural approach has different disadvantages. Microkernel designs face the challenge of dealing with the overhead of inter-process communication (IPC) between user-space servers and the kernel. Monolithic designs operate in a shared address space, so security compromises are potentially more damaging – once defenses have been bypassed, there's no further barrier to sensitive data.</p>
<p>According to a security researcher who has <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://randomaugustine.medium.com/on-apple-exclaves-d683a2c37194">explored Apple's kernel fiddling</a> under the name Random Augustine, Apple's development of exclaves represents a major shift in its security architecture. Essentially, Apple is trying to realize the security advantages of a microkernel without tossing the monolithic aspects of XNU.</p>

</ul>
<p>Based on the references to exclaves in the XNU source for Apple's Arm-compatible M4 chips and the A18 processors used in iPhone 16, our source argues that exclaves form the basis of a significant redesign of XNU's security model.</p>
<p>"In iOS 18, exclaves refer to specific resources that are separated from the main iOS kernel (XNU) and cannot be accessed by it, even if the kernel is compromised," the researcher explained in a document shared with <em>The Register</em>.</p>

        

<p>"These resources are predefined when the OS is built, are identified by name or id, have different types, are initialized at boot time, and are organized into unique domains."</p>
<p>These resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared memory buffers that can be accessed by both the kernel and the exclave, with the option to make them read-only or read-write to XNU.</li>

<li>Audio buffers and sensors that are used for securing features like the camera and microphone access indicators.</li>

<li>Conclaves that group multiple resources into their own secure domains.</li>

<li>Services that offer executable code within the exclave space when called upon by threads in XNU.</li>
</ul>
<p>These resources are protected from XNU via enclave-specific page-types via the Secure Page Table Monitor, a hardware security functionality introduced with the arrival of the A15 chip and iOS 17. This makes Apple's operating systems more secure by compartmentalizing sensitive services, such that the compromise of one doesn't process access to the entire kernel address space.</p>
<p>Apple has enabled the execution of exclave services via a new Secure Kernel (SK). The researcher Random Augustine has observed that while the SK image file contains a version string for "cL4," a possible reference to the L4-embedded used with the original SepOS (Secure Enclave Processor OS) cL4 kernel, the IPC structures used by XNU to communicate with SK look more like <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://sel4.systems/">seL4</a>, a high-assurance microkernel.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>It's adding defense in depth and isolating more parts of the OS from each other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gernot Heiser, a computer science professor at UNSW Sydney and the founding chairman of the seL4 Foundation, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://bsky.app/profile/microkerneldude.bsky.social/post/3ljhapekfj22u">via Bluesky</a> has suggested that Apple's SK is probably not an seL4 adaptation, which would be a GPL violation, but rather is a fresh implementation.</p>
<p>The obvious reason Apple would undertake this work is to improve security generally, which benefits the super-corp and its customers. The less obvious reason is that AI workloads running on-device and communicating with Apple's Private Cloud Compute infrastructure potentially expand the attack surface, so it makes sense to mitigate the blast radius of attacks by adopting microkernel architecture.</p>
<p>"This isn't aimed at a particular vulnerability – it's adding defense in depth and isolating more parts of the OS from each other," Random Augustine opined.</p>
<p>"So an attacker will need to find an extra vulnerability to attack things held in exclaves or to escape an exclave. Exclaves will likely be much harder to escape because they are running in a microkernel environment. Some of the code and libraries over there are also written in Swift which should increase memory safety."</p>
<p>Our source reports inquiring to an Apple engineer about why the iGiant hasn't been talking up this technology. The reason is, we're told, that Apple hasn't yet finished the project and likely doesn't yet have the confidence to make security claims.</p>
<p>Apple did not respond to a request for comment. ®</p>

Last year <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Microsoft-Gives-Mono-To-Wine">Microsoft donated the Mono Project to Wine</a> for its stewardship under the WineHQ umbrella. Today marks the Framework Mono 6.14 release as the first major Mono release in five years and the first under the WineHQ organization.
</p><p>
Framework Mono 6.14 is out today as the newest for the Mono project now being developed and maintained by Wine developers and the broader open-source community. Today's release announcement notes:
</p><blockquote>"This is the first release of Framework Mono from its new home at Winehq. It includes work from the past 5 years that was never included in a stable release because no stable branch had been created in that time. Highlights are native support for ARM64 on macOS and many improvements to windows forms for X11."</blockquote>
<p>In addition to the native macOS ARM64 support and System.Windows.Forms improvements for X11, some of the other Mono 6.14 improvements carried out over the past half-decade include improved support for generated COM interfaces, many warning fixes, addressing common cases where processes would hang on exit, and more.
</p><p><img src="https://www.phoronix.net/image.php?id=2025&amp;image=mono" alt="Mono logo"></p>
<p>As for the "Framework Mono" name rather than just Mono, the release announcement explains:
</p><blockquote>"Framework Mono is the project previously hosted at https://github.com/mono/mono, which was then simply called Mono. I have made this change to distinguish it from "monovm" and "Wine Mono", which are different projects. Framework Mono is a cross-platform runtime compatible with .NET Framework."</blockquote>

<p>Tesla was proudly proclaiming less than a year ago that it would be selling 20 million electric vehicles annually by 2030. Fast forward to today, and things have taken a sharp downturn. After seemingly abandoning this lofty goal mid-2024, the company has also seen its first annual sales decline in a decade. Now, Tesla’s sales are continuing to slide in several major markets, including Germany, Australia, and, of course, China.</p>
		
		



<p><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2025/03/tesla-sales-plunge-44-in-norway-despite-ev-market-soaring-by-53/">Earlier this week</a>, we reported that <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/tesla/">Tesla</a> sales in Norway collapsed by 44.4% through January and February, despite the country’s overall EV market growing by 53.4%. Things are even worse in Germany. New data from the KBA – Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority – shows that in January 2025, Tesla sales plummeted by 59.5%, with just 1,277 new cars registered in the country.</p>

<p>The situation only worsened in February. Sales were down a staggering 76.3% compared to February 2024, with just 1,429 units sold. Through January and February, Tesla has delivered 2,706 vehicles in <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/germany/">Germany</a>, marking a massive 70.6% drop from the same period last year. Tesla’s decline is even more pronounced when you consider that overall BEV sales in Germany climbed 30.8% in February.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/australia/">Australia</a> isn’t much better. Data from the nation’s Electric Vehicle Council shows that Tesla shifted 1,592 vehicles in February, a massive 71.9% decline from the 5,665 sold in February 2024. Through the first two months of the year, Tesla delivered 2,331 vehicles to Australians, a 65.5% decline from the 6,772 vehicles sold over the same two months in 2024. </p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that the highly anticipated, heavily updated Model Y has just started being sold in Australia—though only in the premium (A$73,400) Launch Edition variant, with the standard version still unavailable. So, the sales slump isn’t entirely surprising. </p>



<p>Even so, the outgoing Model Y saw a 55.4% decline, shifting only 924 units. Meanwhile, sales of the refreshed Model 3 are down a dramatic 81.4%, with just 668 cars sold. It seems Australians aren’t quite as eager to embrace the “Tesla dream” as they once were.</p>



<p><strong>Chinese Struggles</strong></p>
		
		



<p>And then there’s <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/tag/china/">China</a>, where things are also looking grim for Tesla in one of its most important markets worldwide. Preliminary data from China’s Passenger Car Association reveals that Tesla built and sold 30,688 vehicles in February 2025—a 49.16% drop from the 60,365 cars moved in February 2024. This total includes both domestic sales and exports, but it’s clear that Tesla’s Chinese market share is shrinking. When you factor in competition from local EV manufacturers, the picture becomes even murkier.</p>



<p>It’s safe to say that Tesla’s global growth trajectory has hit some roadblocks. While the company remains a leader in the electric vehicle space, its once-unassailable dominance in key markets is showing signs of distress. Whether it’s product fatigue, the controversial nature of its CEO, market saturation, or just bad timing—especially with the transition surrounding its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y, the shine is definitely starting to wear off.</p>

<p>I have noticed something in the past 12 months, something a little profound. I have noticed that I am no longer scared that a project will be too big or too complex for me, or that a project will use a technology or programming language I don’t know.</p>



<p>Things that have normally made me hesitate, were things that required a lot of research, for example I once had to walk away from a project as it required more than 4-layers on a PCB to route out the 484-pin BGA FPGA/processor. Back then each FPGA/processor chip was $50 and the board would have cost me about $200 and 3 weeks to get made, after that I would somehow have to assemble and test it or fork out another $100 for assembly. While I am usually pretty good, the chances of this working first or even second time were pretty low, as high speed circuits can be finicky. And even though the customer offered the use of their test equipment it meant I had to work in Christchurch!</p>



<p>I remember working through the specifications of the project at the time, seeing the 1000+ pages datasheet on the processor, the 200 page errata, the hundreds of posts from developers about issues, and the dozens of other design and programming guides and I just thought to myself, well yes maybe I could do it, but it would probably take 6-9 months and most of that would be study, trial and error, then at the end of it the prospect of using that particular processor on another job would be effectively zero. I walked away.</p>



<p>In another case I had a similar offer to replace a production system at a chemical factory, this was in 2012 and I was at the time full-on with other clients. I did however look at the system and its multitude of simple machine interfaces and, less simple external ERP systems, again totally do-able, but in this case the time I would need to dedicate to write the development would have left me a burnt out wreck. Again I had to walk away.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2025 and me coming to the end of the longest contract of my career, I re-looked at the timings I had allocated for the above two projects with the better tools and AI available now and realised how much easier everything could have been. Just the other day I dusted off a project I did 14 years ago, a <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/01/05/image-sensor-for-filling-wine-bottles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fill level sensor</a> for a bottling machine. A guy wrote to me about five years ago about the project, which at the time was terribly primitive and used none-machine-learning, conventional programming to get levels and trigger an accept/reject action. I told him the sensor was now obsolete and possibly it could be done these days with a camera and a fast ML algorithm but I stopped short of any more information as quite frankly I was out of my depth.</p>



<p>As an experiment this weekend I re-created this system using an RPi5 compute module and a $20 camera sensor plugged into it. Within two hours I wrote my first machine learning, using the AI to assist me and got the camera on a RPi board to read levels of wine in wine bottles on my test rig. The original project took me six weeks solid! I again used the google Gemini 2.0 AI for this assignment and it had no problem explaining every line of code, every library, and every concept, and on the spectrum of AI’s Gemini is not considered the best.</p>



<p>I am now at a real impasse, towards the end of my career and knowing I could happily start it all again with a new insight and much bigger visions for what I could take on. It feels like wining the lottery two weeks before you die 🙂</p>



<p>I am now re-examining some of the other things I often thought were too complex or too far above my abilities for hobby projects, and, so long as I can afford them, give them a go. It is an exciting time to be alive.</p>

Most notably, earlier this week, the Capitol Forum reported the Department of Justice Antitrust Division is now investigating egg markets.</span></p><p><span>The reason is simple. For most Americans, eggs have always been cheap, and thus a key food staple. And now eggs are expensive, and sometimes in shortage. Over the past year egg prices have increased by 53%— </span><a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/money/business/retail/2025/02/13/iowans-pinched-by-higher-prices-for-eggs-other-grocery-items-cpi/78218383007/" rel="">jumping</a><span> 15% in January alone. As of the beginning of February, egg producers were charging wholesale buyers an </span><a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/DBEC53E8-A250-3541-9D57-1B36A7ED6B11" rel="">average of $5.95 for a dozen eggs</a><span>, and retailers were charging consumers anywhere </span><a href="https://thelistwire.usatoday.com/lists/average-egg-prices-in-united-states-bird-flu-outbreak/" rel="">between</a><span> </span><a href="https://eggprices.org/national-data" rel="">$4 and $9 a dozen</a><span> — and sometimes even more.</span></p><p>The high prices, and sometimes shortages, are a problem in and of themselves, but they also represent that the American system has gone askew. If we can’t even get a cheap omelet or egg sandwich anymore, what can America do right?</p><p><span>The stated reason for the high price of eggs is something that happens periodically: an avian flu epidemic. Since 2022, outbreaks of bird flu on poultry farms have led to the culling of over </span><a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections/commercial-backyard-flocks" rel="">115 million egg-laying hens</a><span>. This epidemic, according to the prevailing narrative, has driven egg prices up to record highs all on its own. As one industry executive </span><a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/business/money-report/why-egg-prices-are-surging-but-chicken-prices-are-falling-its-an-act-of-god-event-says-trade-strategist/3206359/?os=ixglowljw0&amp;ref=app" rel="">put it</a><span>, it’s all just “supply disruption, ‘act of God’ type stuff.” The popular response to this story has been what you’d expect: Scientists are discussing flu vaccines for chickens, politicians are blaming each other about bird culls, and many are concerned about how the massive scale of today’s egg farms enables—and exacerbates—avian flu epidemics. And none of that is necessarily wrong.</span></p><p>But something doesn’t add up about this “avian flu is the sole and natural cause of high egg prices” story. Despite the “act of God” going on — and the skyrocketing prices accompanying it — egg production is actually . . . not down by all that much. 115 million hens is a lot of birds to cull, but it’s important to put the loss of those hens in context: They weren’t lost all at once. They were lost over three years. And there have always been around 300 million other hens alive and kicking to lay eggs for America—not to mention a continuous pipeline of 120-130 million female chicks (called “pullets”) in the process of being raised into adult hens to replace the ones dying or aging out.</p><p>As a result of this pipeline, the effect of avian flu outbreaks on egg production, while not insignificant, has been relatively small. Monthly egg production during each of the last three years has averaged only 3-5% lower than it was in 2021, the year before the epidemic started. Meanwhile, demand for eggs has actually declined. According to private reports by the Egg Industry Center, Americans went from consuming around 206 shell eggs each in 2021 to consuming less than 190 shell eggs each in 2024 — a ~7.5-percent nosedive. As many countries have closed their markets to American eggs since 2021 on account of the avian flu, egg exports have also fallen off a cliff — going down by nearly half between 2021 and 2022 and staying there ever since. That dynamic, according to my analysis of USDA data, has shaved another ~2.5% off aggregate demand on U.S. egg production.</p><p><span>So, reports of an unprecedented egg “shortage” are exaggerated. Nonetheless, egg prices — and egg company profits — have gone through the roof. Cal-Maine Foods — the largest egg producer and the only one that publishes its financial data as a publicly traded company — has been making more money than ever. It’s annual gross profits in the past three years have floated between</span><em><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM_FY25_2Q_Investor_Presentation.pdf" rel=""> </a></em><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM_FY25_2Q_Investor_Presentation.pdf" rel="">3 and 6 times</a><em> </em><span>what it used to earn before the avian flu epidemic started — </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000114036123040882/ny20009586x3_ars.pdf" rel="">breaking $1 billion</a><span> for the first time in the company’s history. All of this extra profit is coming from higher selling prices, which have been earning Cal-Maine </span><a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/79e86203/files/uploaded/CALM_FY25_2Q_Investor_Presentation.pdf" rel="">unprecedented 70-145 percent margins </a><span>over farm production costs per dozen.

Historically, egg producers have responded to avian flu epidemics—and the temporary rise in egg prices that often accompanies them—by quickly rebuilding and expanding their flocks of egg-laying hens. “</span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3298723?seq=9" rel="">Fowl plagues</a><span>”—as these epidemics used to be called—have been with us since at least the 19</span><sup>th</sup><span> century. Most recently, large-scale avian flu epidemics hit egg farms in 2015 and 1983-1984. The egg industry responded to both of these destructive events by sprinting to rebuild and expand the egg-laying hen flock — something which checked price increases and ultimately made sure prices went back to pre-epidemic levels within a reasonable time.</span></p><p><span>As Cal-Maine Foods explained in its </span><a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/16160/000114420407044438/v084606_10k.htm" rel="">2007 Annual Report</a><span>: “In the past, during periods of high profitability, shell egg producers have tended to increase the number of layers in production with a resulting increase in the supply of shell eggs, which generally has caused a drop in shell egg prices until supply and demand return to balance.”</span></p><p><span>For example, immediately after the height of the avian flu epidemic in May 2015, egg producers started adding millions more pullets to their operations each month—ultimately raising 15.3 million more pullets on their farms in 2015 than they did in 2014, and increasing that figure by another 8 million in 2016, according to my analysis of data from monthly USDA/NASS </span><a href="https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/fb494842n?locale=en" rel="">Chicken and Eggs</a><span> reports. Altogether, producers added adult hens to their flocks at a prodigious rate of 4.15 million per month on average from August 2015 through February 2016, replacing nearly all of the hens lost to avian flu within 7 months.</span></p><p><span>As a result, the average wholesale price of eggs landed at $1.65 a dozen that year, only 40 percent higher than it did the year before. By the end of March 2016, monthly </span><a href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/86282/LDPM-282-02.pdf?v=43404" rel="">egg production was higher</a><span> than it was in March 2014 — and egg prices had not only returned to pre-epidemic levels, but were </span><a href="https://ers.usda.gov/sites/default/files/_laserfiche/outlooks/86282/LDPM-282-02.pdf?v=43404" rel="">dropping even lower</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>This time around, however, that’s not happening. Despite high profits, the egg industry has somehow maintained a stubborn deficit in egg production capacity. Hatcheries — the firms that supply hens to egg producers — have </span><em>throttled</em><span> the pipeline of hens instead of expanding it. According to the Egg Industry Center, the size of the flock of “parent” hens — the hens used by hatcheries to produce layer chicks for egg producers — plummeted from 3.1 million hens in 2021, to 2.9 million in 2022, to 2.5 million hens in 2023 and 2024.</span></p><p>Meanwhile, hatcheries have been hatching significantly fewer parent chicks to replace aging ones — nearly 380,000 (or 12 percent) fewer in 2022 compared to the year before, and even fewer parent chicks in 2023 and 2024 — leaving the parent flock older and more likely to produce eggs that fail to hatch. That could explain why, although hatcheries reported producing 125-200 million more fertilized eggs to the USDA in each of the last three years compared to 2021, the number of eggs they’ve placed in incubators and the number of chicks they’ve hatched from those eggs has either declined or stayed basically steady with 2021 levels in every year since.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png" width="633" height="398" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:398,&quot;width&quot;:633,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:42479,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/158596127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F11fc68b6-3f67-4bca-a924-aaaf5e5e952c_633x398.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Chart by Basel Musharbash.

When an industry starts profiting more from *not* producing than from producing, it’s a sign that something isn’t right. It could be an innocent bottleneck.

Headquartered a short car trip apart in Cuxhaven, Germany, and Boxmeer, Netherlands, these private firms have systematically gained control over the supply of egg-laying hens to American producers over the past two decades by buying out or suppressing rivals and challengers. Today, no egg producer in this country can expand the number of hens in its flock — or even replace the hens it already has when they age out or die — without the cooperation of this duopoly. And, since the value of hens rises with the price of the eggs, when the price of eggs is high these two barons have a clear interest in keeping the supply of pullets to producers on a tight leash — so the high prices stick.</span></p><p>On the other end of the egg supply chain, you have the largest egg producer in the country and the world, Cal-Maine Foods.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

If a producer gets out of line and responds to high prices with flock expansions or discounting practices that Cal-Maine doesn’t approve of, Cal-Maine can flood the market with eggs—depressing prices for everyone while capturing market share for itself. As a publicly-traded company with a low cost of capital from Wall Street, Cal-Maine can live with low egg prices for a long time. Not so for most of the 60 or so family-owned producers who make up the rest of the egg industry; they’re actual businesses that need to turn a profit.</span></p><p><span>The power wielded by these dominant firms — EW Group, Hendrix, and Cal-Maine — is not theoretical. Just last year, a federal jury found that, shortly after Cal-Maine rose to dominance in the late 1990s, its executives took over the leadership of a longstanding industry association called the United Egg Producers (UEP) and turned it into a cartel, the equivalent of what the presiding judge analogized to a “</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305.713.0_5.pdf" rel="">mob boss</a><span>” for the industry. </span></p><p><span>Shortly after, other major egg producers that had long resisted joining the UEP — like Rose Acre Farms — gave up their independence and entered the UEP’s fold, until it finally represented producers accounting for more than 90% of the country’s egg supply. Cal-Maine’s executives then used the association as a “bullhorn” to “</span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305.713.0_5.pdf" rel="">bark out orders</a><span>” at egg producers and “coordinate a conspiracy” to restrict the supply of eggs in the United States through a variety of strategies — including throttling the replacement of hens lost to mortality and a fake “animal welfare” program designed to reduce overall flock numbers rather than improve hen’s lives.</span></p><p><span>An economist who helped plan the UEP cartel </span><a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305/gov.uscourts.ilnd.263305.73.17.pdf" rel="">summed up</a><span> the economic rationale behind it pretty simply: “More hens, less income!” And the conspiracy’s results proved he was right. Wholesale egg prices reached unprecedented heights over the course of the 2000s and then never came back down — settling around a new, higher focal point 50 to 100 percent higher than the pre-conspiracy level for the next decade. Something similar could be happening with the current avian flu epidemic. Indeed, the new focal point appears to be already here: There was an argument that wholesale egg prices “collapsed” in 2023. In reality, they were on average 75% higher than wholesale egg prices before the epidemic’s onset in 2022.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png" width="1456" height="815" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:815,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:466622,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/158596127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37428d11-6f31-4791-bbc9-b95e2e0898f8_3300x1847.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Chart by Basel Musharbash.

So let’s start with how the big fluffy omelet became so Americana.</span></p><p><strong>America as a Land of Egg Plenty</strong></p><p>Producing an egg seems simple. An “old McDonald had a farm” kind of farmer breeds a lovely hen, grows it to adulthood, has it lay eggs, puts those eggs in a crate, and sends that crate to a grocery store in return for a negotiated price. And that’s basically how the industry worked until the middle of the 20th century. The essentials of that story remained on point, but the components were split up among a series of specialized operations.</p><p>If you abstract out what the egg farmer used to do all by himself, you get all the layers of the modern egg supply chain. First, as discussed above, there are breeders, who manage chicken genetics and produce “parent stock,” or the stock of birds that are mated to produce the fertilized eggs that become table-egg laying hens. Second, there are hatcheries, who buy parent stock from breeders, mate them to produce fertilized eggs, incubate their eggs to hatch table-egg laying chicks, and then grow the chicks into hens. Third, there are egg producers, who buy table-egg laying chicks or hens from the hatcheries and use them to produce eggs (some producers also buy fertilized eggs from hatcheries and incubate them in-house). Fourth, there are the various distributors and processors who buy eggs from producers. And finally, there are market makers who survey buyers and sellers for information about egg prices and other market data points, and use that information to publish regular benchmarks for the market value of eggs.</p><p>So, to understand the story behind egg prices, we shouldn’t think about “the egg industry” or the “egg market” but a series of linked industries and markets — starting from the breeders and hatcheries, running through the egg producers and the egg buyers, all the way to the market makers — the end result of which is the carton of eggs on the shelf. To get there, we have to start eighty years ago, when egg production was revolutionized by new technologies and techniques, and the modern egg supply chain was born.</p><p>In 1942, New Deal-era Secretary of Agriculture, and then Vice President, Henry A. Wallace built a new model for producing eggs. It was based on creating better birds through the “hybridization” of chicken, which is the crossing of two or more pure breeds of chicken to create a “hybrid” chicken with specific qualities. The resulting hens laid more or better eggs, required less feed, and were more adapted to specific production systems. After Wallace developed them, cross-breeding methods were shared with small breeders around the country through United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) extension offices at land grant colleges, which conducted basic research into the field and made breeding know-how and pure-bred stocks available to the public. Within a few years, dozens of other “primary breeders” emerged, creating a dynamic chicken genetics industry with many local and regional players.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png" width="977" height="757" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:757,&quot;width&quot;:977,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:703527,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:&quot;https://www.thebignewsletter.com/i/158596127?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png&quot;,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F47771b50-323a-4ec3-adb6-144f3ec0e4a4_977x757.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>In 1940, FDR named Henry A.

The hatcheries bought “parent stock” for branded strains of chicken from the primary breeders, mated them to produce fertilized eggs, incubated the eggs until they hatched, and then sold the resulting chicks and young hens (called “pullets”) to farmers, which raised them into mature hens and then used them to produce eggs. As farmers got to know the different hybrid chicken brands, they selected among them for productivity and other characteristics that suited their production systems — creating a virtuous feedback loop.</p><p><span>Soon, these developments led to a revolution in egg production both at home and around the world. The number of eggs laid per hen in the United States increased by almost </span><a href="https://dr.lib.iastate.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/a27d90a4-042a-4230-964a-584f6dc75f90/content" rel="">44% between 1940 and 1955</a><span> — more, in relative terms, than it would increase over the next four decades combined. Hybrid hens originating from the United States were soon introduced around the world, leading to a rapid expansion in global egg production—not to mention the explosion in cheap American diners dotting the new highway systems being built.</span></p><p>In tandem with the mid-century revolution in chicken breeding, there was a revolution in egg production systems. Poultry science departments at land-grant colleges engaged in continual field testing and production research to develop new equipment and systems for egg farmers, ultimately developing critical technologies like large-scale incubators to hatch eggs on a schedule, fine-sand blowers to clean eggs without breaking shells, and caged-rearing systems to mechanize feeding, watering, and egg-collection in their hen houses.</p><p><span>Although these innovations gave rise to some efficiencies of scale at the farm level and enabled the rise of factory-style hatcheries and egg production facilities, the industry as a whole remained highly decentralized at every stage of production and distribution well into the late 1970s. As late as 1978, most producers were still small, and most egg production still took place on farms with </span><a href="https://agcensus.library.cornell.edu/wp-content/uploads/1978-United_States-CHAPTER_1_State_Data-181-Table-18.pdf" rel="">fewer than 50,000 hens</a><span>. There were just </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-0811-3_49" rel="">34 “big” egg companies with 1 million or more egg-laying hens each</a><span>, and they accounted for only 27% of annual egg production.</span></p><p>Undergirding this system was law: Antitrust enforcement prevented the largest breeders, hatcheries, and egg producers from growing by serial acquisitions or by handicapping their rivals’ access to customers or suppliers. For similar reasons, the markets into which egg producers sold their eggs—packers, retailers, processors, wholesalers, and institutions—also remained open and competitive, offering a wide diversity of potential buyers to egg producers of various sizes in every region of the country.</p><p><span>Because of the openness of the egg industry and the abundance of small producers with excess capacity, there was almost always a significant surplus of eggs in the country. When that surplus narrowed (whether because of long-term population growth or a sudden crisis, like an avian flu epidemic), elevated egg prices invited rapid expansions in egg output from new and existing producers that quickly brought prices back down. For example, during the </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1349329?seq=2" rel="">avian flu epidemic of 1983-1984</a><span>, producers had to cull tens of millions of layer hens and other birds, including nearly every chicken in Pennsylvania. But retail egg prices rose by just 66 percent over a few months — and promptly fell just as </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1349329?seq=2" rel="">sharply over the next few months</a><span> as producers quickly replaced the hens they’d lost.</span></p><p><span>“Eggs,” </span><a href="https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/303075/files/nc-117-028.pdf___.YzJ1OmFlbHBlY29ub21pY2xpYmVydGllczpjOm86OGI0OTBiMDZkMmIxZmFlNTlkODZhYzY5MmEzODZjNjg6NjpiOGYyOmExMjQ1NWJhNGFmMjk3NmY3NDQ0NGNmMzQ4ODhjZDdmY2JmZTc1YjkxNTU4ZWYxYTk1YTdjZWYwYWRmZjRlMjk6cDpUOk4" rel="">said</a><span> a prominent agricultural economist in 1978, “will be processed and produced in this country if there is a fair return on investment. When the return [on eggs] becomes high,” he continued, “there will be expansion of production that will reduce prices.” And that was actually true: Higher prices routinely led farmers to get into the egg business to make money, and that in turn regularly reset the market with more supply. Price spikes were short-lived. Shortages were unheard of. America was a land of egg plenty.</span></p><p>Then, everything changed. </p><p><em><span>Stay tuned for part two of Hatching a Conspiracy, which will come next week.

    </div><p>A team of engineers and physicists at Southern University of Science and Technology, in China, has created a nickel-based material that behaves as a superconductor above the -233°C (40 K) threshold under ambient pressure. In their study <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08755-z" target="_blank">published</a> in <i>Nature</i>, the researchers synthesized thin films of bilayer nickelate (La₂.₈₅Pr₀.₁₅Ni₂O₇) and found one that behaved as a high-temperature superconductor.</p>


										      
																					<p>The -233°C threshold (40 K), often associated with the McMillan limit, marks a boundary beyond which conventional superconductivity theories become less predictive.</p>
<p>Scientists have been searching for a room-temperature superconductor that could revolutionize a wide range of technologies. The ability to achieve superconductivity without the need for costly and complex cooling systems would significantly reduce energy loss due to heat conversion in electrical transmission, leading to dramatic improvements in efficiency and cost reduction. This breakthrough could lead to advancements in numerous fields, including maglev trains, fusion reactors and MRI machine components. This new effort by the team in China represents another step in reaching the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Until now, <a href="https://phys.org/tags/high-temperature+superconductors/" rel="tag">high-temperature superconductors</a> have primarily been based on copper and iron compounds, while nickelate superconductors required high-pressure conditions to function.</p>
<p>The newly discovered high-temperature nickelate superconductor emerged from the team's experiments with epitaxially grown bilayer nickelate thin films. Their work was part of a long-term project geared toward finding high-temperature superconductors based on nickel. The current research had been running for three years and involved growing nickelates with controlled rare-earth metal substitutions and precise oxygen content.</p>
<p>For this latest successful effort, the team substituted a portion of lanthanum with praseodymium in the nickelate structure. Testing showed it transitioned to a superconductor at approximately -228°C.</p>
<p>The research team suggests their development of a nickel-based, high-temperature superconductor is likely to open the door to other possibilities, some nickel-based and others based on other metals. It might also help in research dedicated to understanding why some materials can transition into superconductors.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>A 38-strong group of tech players have founded a project with the snappy name Digital Autonomy with RISC-V in Europe, aka DARE, that aims to develop processor units to power the continent’s supercomputers and other high-performance machines.</p>
<p>If you're having deja vu, you're not alone: Europe has been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/07/17/europes_exascale_supercomputer_chips/">talking about</a> and toying with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/08/riscv_hpc/">using RISC-V</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/12/24/european_processor_initiative_phase_one_concludes/">supercomputing</a> for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/08/eu_chip_projects/">some years</a>, even getting far as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/22/first_riscv_epi_chip/">some silicon</a>, though turned to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/05/14/sipearl_rhea1_specs/">Arm's architecture</a> for its <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextplatform.com/2024/09/16/thinking-outside-of-the-box-with-the-jupiter-supercomputer-datacenter/">first exascale</a> system. The continent hasn't given up on RISC-V, though, certainly not with America in the state it's in.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://dare-riscv.eu/launch-of-dare-sga1-project/">DARE project</a> is supported by the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and coordinated by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC-CNS). The project aims to create three chiplets – individual chip dies that can be combined to form complete processor packages – and has already picked leaders for each effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>A vector-math accelerator die tuned for high-performance computing (HPC) workloads, led by Barcelona-based chip designer Openchip</li>

<li>A next-gen inference chiplet from Dutch startup Axelera AI</li>

<li>A general-purpose processor die, driven by Germany's Codasip</li>
</ol>
<p>"DARE is daring to start from the top of the technological complexity pole and produce European-designed processors chips for supercomputers, paving the way for Europe's digital sovereignty," Osman Unsal, DARE principal investigator at BNC-CNS, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The first phase of this six-year endeavor is backed by €240 million (£200 million, $260 million) in funding. DARE has given itself the goal of developing the three above-mentioned RISC-V chiplets in three years.</p>

    

<p>Axelera AI, which says it’s been <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.axelera.ai/news/axelera-ai-secures-up-to-61-million-grant-to-develop-scalable-ai-chiplet-for-high-performance-computing">awarded</a> €61.6 million (£52 million, $65 million) in funding from EuroHPC, appears to be the furthest along on its journey toward creating a datacenter-class RISC-V chip. While most of its current lineup is focused on running AI models at the network edge, we're told its upcoming Titania chiplet will be designed for server-grade workloads.</p>

        


        

<p>On the surface, Axelera's chips follow a similar formula as other AI ASICs, such as Google's tensor processing units. The Dutch outfit's current silicon feature four accelerator cores, each with a matrix multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit, a RISC-V control core to make the accelerator programmable, and some digital signal processors which handle neural network activation functions.</p>
<p>Like some other designs we've seen on the market, these MAC units, which are responsible for the bulk of today's AI processing, are embedded in a pool of SRAM enabling efficient streaming and crunching of matrices through the chips; it's classic in-memory processing you see more and more these days.</p>

        

<p>CEO Fabrizio Del Maffeo told <em>El Reg</em> Axelera's arrangement of its MAC units allows its quad-core AI processing units to achieve more than 200 INT8 trillion operations per second (TOPS) of inference performance while consuming just 15-20 watts of power.</p>
<p>The forthcoming Titania will take this same basic formula but scale it up, with more processing cores on-die and multi-die system-in-package designs.</p>
<p>Codasip already offers several 32-bit embedded-class and 64-bit application-grade RISC-V CPU cores, which appear to be aimed at network edge, IoT, and modest personal computing devices. In a <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://codasip.com/press-release/2025/03/06/codasip-selected-to-design-a-high-end-risc-v-processor-for-the-eu-funded-dare-project/">press release</a>, the biz said the DARE project would provide it the resources to extend its portfolio to include high performance applications including "AI, big data processing, and supercomputing."</p>

<p>While RISC-V is open and permissively licensed, American lawmakers have sometimes <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/07/proposed_restrictions_riscv/">called</a> for the US to prevent China's access to the tech. ®</p>

<li><strong>AgentCommunicator Tool</strong>: A real BeeAI tool that facilitates communication between agents</li>

<p dir="auto">The System Agent implements a sophisticated decision mechanism:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>If similarity ≥ 0.8: Reuse an existing agent/tool</li>
<li>If 0.4 ≤ similarity &lt; 0.8: Evolve an existing agent/tool</li>
<li>If similarity &lt; 0.4: Create a new agent/tool</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">In the example, when we ask for an invoice analysis agent, it creates a new one. When we ask for a medical record analyzer, it evolves the existing SpecialistAgent (since it has a similarity score of around 0.46).</p>
