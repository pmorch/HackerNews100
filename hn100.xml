<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I just need to vent about this here, and maybe talking about it here will get some change.</p>

<p>I am type 1 diabetic and depend on insulin to survive, since 2021 I've been using Insulet's OmniPod Dash pump just because using needles got annoying. It uses a device called the "PDM" to control it, and I have some spare ones (had to get replacements after certain ones had issues, had a replacement after a battery recall, all of that) and about two years ago I got into custom ROM development for old phones, and I decided to take a look into one of my spare Dash PDMs, and I realized something</p>

<p>They run Android. Which uses the Linux kernel. Running <code>uname -r</code>, I was able to see it was 3.18.19, which is very ancient and kinda surprising for a medical device, but whatever, I then decided to contact Insulet to get the kernel source code for it, being GPLv2 licensed, they're obligated to provide it. I tried at several emails, no response. The PDM hardware is a rebranded Chinese phone, a Nuu A1+, so I decided to try to go to Nuu to see if they could provide it. They gave me a simple one line response: "Thank you for contacting NUU Support.  I am sorry but we wouldn't be able to at this time.". I replied again saying they're obligated to, it's GPLv2 licensed, and got the response "Again, would not be able to send that to you at this time. I can reach to our engineers but I would not hear anything back from them about that until mid next week.", I agreed, then a week later got the email "Unfortunately, it can not be sent.". That was nearly two years ago, and despite multiple attempts, I haven't managed to get any further response from Nuu or Insulet.</p>

<p>This honestly disgusts me. GPL violations are already bad on their own, but on a medical device? That me, and thousands of people rely on to stay alive? It's absolutely inexcusable behaviour. It takes 30 seconds to just create a .tar.gz file with the kernel source, host it somewhere, and send it to me, but for some reason, Insulet and their ODM Nuu have a hard refusal for it. Being on kernel 3.18 too, something that's been EOL for over 8 years, and on top of that it's also Android Marshmallow, EOL for 7 years, and it communicates to the actual pump itself over Bluetooth, everything about this device is a massive security hole and the fact they're refusing to share the kernel source makes it even sketchier. What is so bad about this kernel source that Insulet cannot provide it at any cost?</p>

<p>Also, kinda unrelated to the kernel source, but this thing also has no AVB or any form of partition verification at all. As if the 8 years of missing security patches weren't bad enough, anyone with access to your PDM, a MicroUSB cable, and a copy of mtkclient can flash whatever the hell they want on it. On another subreddit I've shown me rooting the PDM, it's ridiculous that a 21 billion dollar company can't put security measures in their device that $50 phones have.</p>

<p>Please, if anyone is able, spread awareness about Insulet and their GPL violations. It's absolutely disgusting that I'm still fighting for this nearly 2 years after my initial contact attempt and still haven't gotten anywhere. Honestly, I am completely out of ideas for what to do.</p>

<p>EDIT: A lot of people are saying I'm out of luck since the ODM (Nuu) is a Chinese company, I don't believe this is true. I believe Insulet also has access to the kernel source, as they made a ton of modifications to the software, and in a hardware revision that happened ~2022 (i have enough pdms to know this), there was a modification made that caused the boot.img from the original Nuu A1+ to stop working on a PDM, indicating Insulet made some sort of bootloader and kernel modification. Insulet is American.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/07/10/lewis-carroll-determinants/">https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2023/07/10/lewis-carroll-determinants/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46395106">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/madhatter.png" alt="Mad hatter from Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll" width="400" height="460"></p>
<p>Charles Dodgson, better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, discovered a method of calculating determinants now known variously as the method of contractants, Dodgson condensation, or simply condensation.</p>
<p>The method was devised for ease of computation by hand, but it has features that make it a practical method for computation by machine.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The basic idea is to repeatedly condense a matrix, replacing it by a matrix with one less row and one less column. Each element is replaced by the determinant of the 2×2 matrix formed by that element and its neighbors to the south, east, and southeast. The bottom row and rightmost column have no such neighbors and are removed. There is one additional part of the algorithm that will be easier to describe after introducing some notation.</p>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Let <em>A</em> be the matrix whose determinant we want to compute and let <em>A</em><sup>(<em>k</em>)</sup> be the matrix obtained after <em>k</em> steps of the condensation algorithm.</p>
<p>The matrix <em>A</em><sup>(1)</sup> is computed as described in the overview:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson1.svg" alt="a^{(1)}_{ij} = a_{ij} a_{i+1, j+1} - a_{i, j+1} a_{i+1, j}." width="227" height="25"></p>
<p>Starting with <em>A</em><sup>(2)</sup> the terms are similar, except each 2×2 determinant is divided by an element from two steps back:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson2.svg" alt="a^{(k+1)}_{ij} = \frac{1}{a^{(k-1)}_{i+1,j+1}}\left(a^{(k)}_{ij} a^{(k)}_{i+1, j+1} - a^{(k)}_{i, j+1} a^{(k)}_{i+1, j} \right)" width="334" height="47"></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/37354/37354-pdf.pdf">Dodgson’s original paper</a> from 1867 is quite readable, surprisingly so given that math notation and terminology changes over time.</p>
<p>One criticism I have of the paper is that it is hard to understand which element should be in the denominator, whether the subscripts should be <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> or <em>i</em>+1 and <em>j</em>+1. His first example doesn’t clarify this because these elements happen to be equal in the example.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here’s an example using condensation to find the determinant of a 4×4 matrix.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.johndcook.com/dodgson4.svg" alt="\begin{align*} A^{(0)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 4 &amp; 1 \\ 5 &amp; 9 &amp; 2 &amp; 6 \\ 0 &amp; 7 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 2 &amp; 0 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix} \\ A^{(1)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 22 &amp;-34 &amp; 22 \\ 35 &amp; -5 &amp;-6 \\ -14 &amp; 14 &amp; 3 \end{bmatrix} \\ A^{(2)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 120 &amp; 157 \\ 60 &amp; 69 \end{bmatrix} \\ A^{(3)} &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 228 \end{bmatrix} \end{align*}" width="188" height="236"></p>
<p>We can verify this with Mathematica:</p>
<pre>    Det[{{3, 1, 4, 1}, {5, 9, 2, 6}, 
         {0, 7, 1, 0}, {2, 0, 2, 3}}]
</pre>
<p>which also produces 228.</p>
<h2>Division</h2>
<p>The algorithm above involves a division and so we should avoid dividing by zero. Dodgson says to</p>
<blockquote><p>Arrange the given block, if necessary, so that no ciphers [zeros] occur in its interior. This may be done either by transposing rows or columns, or by adding to certain rows the several terms of other rows multiplied by certain multipliers.</p></blockquote>
<p>He expands on this remark and gives examples. I’m not sure whether this preparation is necessary only to avoid division by zero, but it does avoid the problem of dividing by a zero.</p>
<p>If the original matrix has all integer entries, then the division in Dodgson’s condensation algorithm is exact. The sequence of matrices produced by the algorithm will all have integer entries.</p>
<h2>Efficiency</h2>
<p>Students usually learn cofactor expansion as their first method of calculating determinants. This rule is easy to explain, but inefficient since the number of steps required is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>!).</p>
<p>The more efficient way to compute determinants is by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. As with condensation, one must avoid dividing by zero, hence the partial pivoting.</p>
<p>Gaussian elimination takes <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>³) operations, and so does Dodgson’s condensation algorithm. Condensation is easy to teach and easy to carry out by hand, but unlike cofactor expansion it scales well.</p>
<p>If a matrix has all integer entries, Gaussian elimination can produce non-integer values in intermediate steps. Condensation does not. Also, condensation is inherently parallelizable: each of the 2 × 2 determinants can be calculated simultaneously.</p>

<p>Rob got a 100% AI-generated email credited to “Claude Opus 4.5 AI Village” thanking him for his contributions to computing. He did <em>not</em> appreciate the gesture.</p>
<p>I totally understand his rage. Thank you notes from AI systems can’t possibly feel meaningful, see also the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/2/24212078/google-gemini-olympics-ad-backlash">backlash against the Google Gemini ad</a> where Gemini helped a child email their hero.</p>

<p>I decided to dig in and try to figure out exactly what happened.</p>
<h4 id="ai-village">AI Village</h4>
<p>The culprit behind this slop “act of kindness” is a system called <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village">AI Village</a>, built by <a href="https://sage-future.org/">Sage</a>, a 501(c)(3) non-profit loosely affiliated with the Effective Altruism movement.</p>
<p>The AI Village project started <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/introducing-the-agent-village">back in April</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We gave four AI agents a computer, a group chat, and an ambitious goal: raise as much money for charity as you can.</p>
<p>We’re running them for hours a day, every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They’ve been running it ever since, with frequent updates to their goals. For Christmas day (when Rob Pike got spammed) the goal they set was:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/goal/do-random-acts-kindness">Do random acts of kindness</a>.</strong></p>
<p>You can replay the actions of different agents <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265">using the Day 265 replay page</a>. Here’s a screenshot of GPT-5.2 mercilessly spamming the team at the wonderful <a href="https://carpentries.org/">Carpentries</a> educational non-profit with another AI-generated thank you note:</p>

<h4 id="digital-forensics-with-shot-scraper-har">Digital forensics with shot-scraper har</h4>
<p>I couldn’t easily find the Rob Pike incident in that interface, so I turned to some digital forensics. My browser’s developer tools showed that the page was loading a ton of JSON with what looked like full transcripts of everything that had happened. I used my <a href="https://shot-scraper.datasette.io/en/stable/har.html">shot-scraper har</a> command to grab a copy of everything loaded by that page:</p>
<div><pre>shot-scraper har --wait 10000 <span><span>'</span>https://theaidigest.org/village?day=265<span>'</span></span></pre></div>
<p>That command loads up the page in a headless Chromium browser, waits 10 seconds to give the JavaScript time to run and then saves a <code>theaidigest-org-village.har</code> HTTP archive file to a local directory.</p>
<p>The <code>.har</code> file is JSON that captures every request and response that was used to construct the page.</p>
<p>I haven’t yet built the “extract HAR as separate files” feature, so I had Claude Code build <a href="https://gist.github.com/simonw/007c628ceb84d0da0795b57af7b74d7d">an extract_har.py</a> script (<a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?cb5c02c3272a0ae2dd71d9ff7a4932b0/index.html">transcript</a>) and then ran a few <code>rg</code> commands to see if <code>Rob Pike</code> was in there. He was!</p>
<p>So I had Claude Code do <a href="https://gistpreview.github.io/?edbd5ddcb39d1edc9e175f1bf7b9ef9a/index.html">the rest of the investigation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>search for mentions of Rob Pike in all these files</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[...]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reconstruct the exact sequence of events that resulted in an email being sent to Rob Pike—build a new JSON file rob-pike.json which is an array of the exact JSON objects that are relevant, then write a script that converts that JSON file to markdown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And here’s what happened:</p>

<h4 id="don-t-unleash-agents-on-the-world-like-this">Don’t unleash agents on the world like this</h4>
<p>I don’t like this at all.</p>
<p>On the surface the AI Village experiment is an interesting test of the frontier models. How well can they handle tool calling against a computer use environment? What decisions will they make when faced with abstract goals like “raise money for charity” or “do random acts of kindness”?</p>
<p>My problem is when this experiment starts <strong>wasting the time</strong> of people in the real world who had nothing to do with the experiment.</p>
<p>The AI Village project touch on this in their November 21st blog post <a href="https://theaidigest.org/village/blog/what-do-we-tell-the-humans">What Do We Tell the Humans?</a>, which describes a flurry of outbound email sent by their agents to real people:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the span of two weeks, the Claude agents in the AI Village (Claude Sonnet 4.5, Sonnet 3.7, Opus 4.1, and Haiku 4.5) sent about 300 emails to NGOs and game journalists. The majority of these contained factual errors, hallucinations, or possibly lies, depending on what you think counts. Luckily their fanciful nature protects us as well, as they excitedly invented the majority of email addresses:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this completely misses the point! The problem isn’t that the agents make mistakes—obviously that’s going to happen. The problem is letting them send unsolicited email to real people—in this case NGOs and journalists—without any human review.</p>
<p>(Crediting the emails to “Claude Opus 4.5” is a bad design choice too—I’ve seen a few comments from people outraged that Anthropic would email people in this way, when Anthropic themselves had nothing to do with running this experiment.)</p>
<p>The irony here is that the one thing AI agents can never have is <em>true</em> agency. Making a decision to reach out to a stranger and take time out of their day needs to remain a uniquely human decision, driven by human judgement.</p>
<p>Setting a goal for a bunch of LLMs and letting them loose on Gmail is not a responsible way to apply this technology.</p>

    <p>uv installs packages faster than pip by an order of magnitude. The usual explanation is “it’s written in Rust.” That’s true, but it doesn’t explain much. Plenty of tools are written in Rust without being notably fast. The interesting question is what design decisions made the difference.</p>

<p>Charlie Marsh’s <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/tech-talks/uv-an-extremely-fast-python-package-manager/">Jane Street talk</a> and a <a href="https://xebia.com/blog/uv-the-engineering-secrets-behind-pythons-speed-king/">Xebia engineering deep-dive</a> do an excellent job at covering the technical details. Let’s dig into the design decisions that led to it: standards that enable fast paths, things uv drops that pip supports, and optimizations that don’t require Rust at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-standards-that-made-uv-possible">The standards that made uv possible</h2>

<p>pip’s slowness isn’t a failure of implementation. For years, Python packaging required executing code to find out what a package needed.</p>

<p>The problem was <a href="https://setuptools.pypa.io/">setup.py</a>. You couldn’t know a package’s dependencies without running its setup script. But you couldn’t run its setup script without installing its build dependencies. <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a> in 2016 called this out explicitly: “You can’t execute a setup.py file without knowing its dependencies, but currently there is no standard way to know what those dependencies are in an automated fashion without executing the setup.py file.”</p>

<p>This chicken-and-egg problem forced pip to download packages, execute untrusted code, fail, install missing build tools, and try again. Every install was potentially a cascade of subprocess spawns and arbitrary code execution. Installing a source distribution was essentially <code>curl | bash</code> with extra steps.</p>

<p>The fix came in stages:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/">PEP 518</a> (2016) created pyproject.toml, giving packages a place to declare build dependencies without code execution. The TOML format was borrowed from Rust’s Cargo, which makes a Rust tool returning to fix Python packaging feel less like coincidence.</li>
  <li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a> (2017) separated build frontends from backends, so pip didn’t need to understand setuptools internals.</li>
  <li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/">PEP 621</a> (2020) standardized the <code>[project]</code> table, so dependencies could be read by parsing TOML rather than running Python.</li>
  <li><a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0658/">PEP 658</a> (2022) put package metadata directly in the Simple Repository API, so resolvers could fetch dependency information without downloading wheels at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>PEP 658 went live on PyPI in May 2023. uv launched in February 2024. The timing isn’t coincidental. uv could be fast because the ecosystem finally had the infrastructure to support it. A tool like uv couldn’t have shipped in 2020. The standards weren’t there yet.</p>

<p>Other ecosystems figured this out earlier. Cargo has had static metadata from the start. npm’s package.json is declarative. Python’s packaging standards finally bring it to parity.</p>

<h2 id="what-uv-drops">What uv drops</h2>

<p>Speed comes from elimination. Every code path you don’t have is a code path you don’t wait for.</p>

<p>uv’s <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/compatibility/">compatibility documentation</a> is a list of things it doesn’t do:</p>

<p><strong>No .egg support.</strong> Eggs were the pre-wheel binary format. pip still handles them; uv doesn’t even try. The format has been obsolete for over a decade.</p>

<p><strong>No pip.conf.</strong> uv ignores pip’s configuration files entirely. No parsing, no environment variable lookups, no inheritance from system-wide and per-user locations.</p>

<p><strong>No bytecode compilation by default.</strong> pip compiles .py files to .pyc during installation. uv skips this step, shaving time off every install. You can opt in if you want it.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual environments required.</strong> pip lets you install into system Python by default. uv inverts this, refusing to touch system Python without explicit flags. This removes a whole category of permission checks and safety code.</p>

<p><strong>Stricter spec enforcement.</strong> pip accepts malformed packages that technically violate packaging specs. uv rejects them. Less tolerance means less fallback logic.</p>

<p><strong>Ignoring requires-python upper bounds.</strong> When a package says it requires <code>python&lt;4.0</code>, uv ignores the upper bound and only checks the lower. This reduces resolver backtracking dramatically since upper bounds are almost always wrong. Packages declare <code>python&lt;4.0</code> because they haven’t tested on Python 4, not because they’ll actually break. The constraint is defensive, not predictive.</p>

<p><strong>First-index wins by default.</strong> When multiple package indexes are configured, pip checks all of them. uv picks from the first index that has the package, stopping there. This prevents dependency confusion attacks and avoids extra network requests.</p>

<p>Each of these is a code path pip has to execute and uv doesn’t.</p>

<h2 id="optimizations-that-dont-need-rust">Optimizations that don’t need Rust</h2>

<p>Some of uv’s speed comes from Rust. But not as much as you’d think. Several key optimizations could be implemented in pip today:</p>

<p><strong>HTTP range requests for metadata.</strong> <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/binary-distribution-format/">Wheel files</a> are zip archives, and zip archives put their file listing at the end. uv tries PEP 658 metadata first, falls back to HTTP range requests for the zip central directory, then full wheel download, then building from source. Each step is slower and riskier. The design makes the fast path cover 99% of cases. This is HTTP protocol work, not Rust.</p>

<p><strong>Parallel downloads.</strong> pip downloads packages one at a time. uv downloads many at once. This is concurrency, not language magic.</p>

<p><strong>Global cache with hardlinks.</strong> pip copies packages into each virtual environment. uv keeps one copy globally and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_link">hardlinks</a> (or copy-on-write on filesystems that support it). Installing the same package into ten venvs takes the same disk space as one. This is filesystem ops, not language-dependent.</p>

<p><strong>Python-free resolution.</strong> pip needs Python running to do anything, and invokes build backends as subprocesses to get metadata from legacy packages. uv parses TOML and wheel metadata natively, only spawning Python when it hits a setup.py-only package that has no other option.</p>

<p><strong>PubGrub resolver.</strong> uv uses the <a href="https://github.com/dart-lang/pub/blob/master/doc/solver.md">PubGrub algorithm</a>, originally from Dart’s pub package manager. pip uses a backtracking resolver. PubGrub is faster at finding solutions and better at explaining failures. It’s an algorithm choice, not a language choice.</p>

<h2 id="where-rust-actually-matters">Where Rust actually matters</h2>

<p>Some optimizations do require Rust:</p>

<p><strong>Zero-copy deserialization.</strong> uv uses <a href="https://rkyv.org/">rkyv</a> to deserialize cached data without copying it. The data format is the in-memory format. This is a Rust-specific technique.</p>

<p><strong>Lock-free concurrent data structures.</strong> Rust’s ownership model makes concurrent access safe without locks. Python’s GIL makes this difficult.</p>

<p><strong>No interpreter startup.</strong> Every time pip spawns a subprocess, it pays Python’s startup cost. uv is a single static binary with no runtime to initialize.</p>

<p><strong>Compact version representation.</strong> uv packs versions into u64 integers where possible, making comparison and hashing fast. Over 90% of versions fit in one u64. This is micro-optimization that compounds across millions of comparisons.</p>

<p>These are real advantages. But they’re smaller than the architectural wins from dropping legacy support and exploiting modern standards.</p>

<h2 id="the-actual-lesson">The actual lesson</h2>

<p>uv is fast because of what it doesn’t do, not because of what language it’s written in. The standards work of PEP 518, 517, 621, and 658 made fast package management possible. Dropping eggs, pip.conf, and permissive parsing made it achievable. Rust makes it a bit faster still.</p>

<p>pip could implement parallel downloads, global caching, and metadata-only resolution tomorrow. It doesn’t, largely because backwards compatibility with fifteen years of edge cases takes precedence. But it means pip will always be slower than a tool that starts fresh with modern assumptions.</p>

<p>The takeaway for other package managers: the things that make uv fast are static metadata, no code execution to discover dependencies, and the ability to resolve everything upfront before downloading. Cargo and npm have operated this way for years. If your ecosystem requires running arbitrary code to find out what a package needs, you’ve already lost.</p>

  <h4>By Colin Domnauer</h4><p>Picture this: You're enjoying a delicious bowl of mushroom soup, when suddenly you notice hundreds of tiny people dressed in cartoonish clothing marching across your tablecloth, jumping into your bowl, swimming around, and clinging to your spoon as you lift it for another taste. You're not dreaming — you've just experienced the effects of a mushroom known scientifically as <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>. It belongs to an entirely different class of Fungi than the more commonly known <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/articles/psychoactive-psilocybins-evolution-magic-mushrooms" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d9f2707b-d7e8-4dcf-86ad-77372886d7f2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Psychoactive psilocybin’s evolution in ‘magic mushrooms’">“magic mushrooms”</a> and remains far more mysterious.</p><p>When outsiders first embarked into the Western Highlands of Papua New Guinea in 1934, they encountered a perplexing sight: after consuming a type of wild mushroom which they called “nonda,” the local people would appear to go temporarily insane, exhibiting a sudden and striking change in mood and behavior. Subsequent accounts of the “mushroom madness” phenomenon, as it was termed, provided more details into the mushroom's strange psychological effects.</p>





<p>Specifically, it was reported that those affected would experience lilliputian hallucinations — a rare, clinically defined psychiatric syndrome (named after the tiny people in Gulliver's Travels) characterized by the perception of numerous little people autonomously moving about and interacting in the real-world environment. One elder tribesman in Papua New Guinea describes this effect, explaining how “he saw tiny people with mushrooms around their faces. They were teasing him, and he was trying to chase them away.”</p><p>By the 1960s, scientists were working to identify the species of mushrooms involved and what chemicals within them might be responsible for such bizarre effects. However, both questions have remained unanswered to this day. As a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/science/collections/mycology" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="47089b2e-c46b-4bfe-a501-890c154bbc84" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Mycology">the Natural History Museum of Utah</a>, I've been working to solve this puzzle: What exactly is the identity of this mushroom, how widespread is the cultural knowledge of its effects, and why does it produce such fantastical visions?</p><h3>Investigating Lilliputian Mushrooms in China</h3><p>Home to 40 percent of the world's wild edible fungi, Yunnan, China has always been remarkable for mushroom lovers. But in the last decade or so, the summer rains have brought more than just mushrooms; they’ve been accompanied by an explosion of news articles that read like something out of children's fairy tales: after consuming a popular wild mushroom known locally as “Jian shou qing,” locals frequently report having unbelievably bizarre experiences, most notable characterized by seeing “xiao ren ren,” or little people.</p>





<p>A professor in Yunnan recounted how one evening during dinner (Jian shou qing is openly sold in markets and restaurants), he began seeing swirling shapes and colors after <a href="https://nhmu.utah.edu/articles/life-short-eat-good-mushrooms" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70c5540f-1554-440f-ae2b-d0b7f3819097" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Life is short, eat good mushrooms">eating stir-fried mushrooms</a>. Since the psychoactive effects are familiar to most locals, he began looking for xiao ren ren but was disappointed to find none — until he lifted the tablecloth and peeked underneath, seeing “hundreds of xiao ren ren, marching like soldiers.”</p><p>Even more curious, he said, “when I lifted the tablecloth higher, the heads came off and stuck to the bottom of the cloth and the bodies kept marching in place… I did this many times, at two-minute intervals, and each time they were there, marching and grinning… I measured them, too… they were 2 cm high.” According to records at Yunnan Hospital, 96 percent of patients affected by this mushroom report seeing an abundance of "little people" or "elves," often dancing, jumping, or marching around their real-world environment.</p>





<p>As recently as 2014, the taxonomic identity of the psychoactive Jian shou qing mushroom remained unknown. It wasn’t until mycologists in Yunnan purchased and sequenced the mushrooms being sold in an open-air street market (where it had been sold for decades) that the species was officially described and recognized as being new to science. Its formal Latin name is <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>, and, interestingly, it’s more closely related to the common porcini (Utah’s official state mushroom) than to any other currently known hallucinogenic mushroom species.</p><p>Although<em> Lanmaoa asiatica</em> is a recent scientific discovery, the knowledge and use of this psychoactive mushroom may have much deeper ancient roots in Chinese culture. A prominent Daoist text from the 3rd century CE refers to a “flesh spirit mushroom,” which, according to the text, if consumed raw, allows one to “see a little person” and “attain transcendence immediately.”</p>

</div>

  





  



<div>
    
  <h3>A Global Experience</h3><p>Surprisingly, I became aware of yet another independent report of the exact same phenomenon — a mushroom that caused lilliputian hallucinations, but this time from an entirely different region of the world. Indigenous communities in the Philippines' remote Northern Cordillera were collecting and consuming a wild mushroom which, according to local knowledge, occasionally evokes visions of little people, which they call the “ansisit.” The mushroom is known locally as "Sedesdem." Just as the “Nonda” in Papua New Guinea and “Jian shou qing” in Yunnan, it is a culturally esteemed wild edible mushroom that, if undercooked, produces bizarre yet remarkably consistent psychoactive effect.</p>





<p>As no scientific surveys of the mushrooms in the Northern Philippines had been conducted, Sedesdem’s taxonomic identity remained unknown, leaving me with the obvious task. I travelled to this community in 2024 to explore the mushrooms and experience the culture surrounding this phenomenon. By working with local guides and foraging through the forest, we collected samples that are now preserved for scientific study at the Natural History Museum of Utah — allowing us to perform the first DNA sequencing of this region's fungi.</p><p>What surprised me most was the unexpected discovery of the Sedesdem mushroom’s identity: it was none other than <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>, the exact same species as in Yunnan. The puzzle was coming together.</p><h3>More Than Folklore or Tall Tales</h3><p>That the same peculiar hallucinations are independently reported across such distant cultures indicates that these bizarre psychological effects are not cultural fabrications or coincidences, but manifestations of a shared underlying chemical and neurological basis.</p><p>Chemical and genomic analyses performed on <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em> <a href="https://dentingerlab.org/" data-entity-type="external">at the Natural History Museum of Utah</a> have revealed no traces of any known psychoactive compounds, suggesting that something entirely new is waiting to be discovered. In other words, <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em> appears to harbor a chemical compound capable of reliably evoking this unusual experience of lilliputian hallucinations. The discovery of that chemical may, in fact, hold the key to understanding one of the most mysterious dimensions of the human psyche.</p><h3>Ongoing Research Into the Fairytale Mushroom</h3>





<p>Our efforts to identify this compound are ongoing, and the progress so far has been exciting!&nbsp; When mice are given chemical extracts of <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em>, their behavior shifts noticeably compared to controls. By continuing to fractionate these extracts and testing each in turn, we’ve been steadily narrowing in on isolating the specific bioactive molecules involved.</p><p>But the chemistry is only part of the mystery. In parallel, I’m building a global database of all <em>Lanmaoa</em> species. In doing so, I’ve discovered four new species previously unknown to science. Through full-genome sequencing, I’ve been able to clearly map the evolutionary relationships and history of <em>Lanmaoa</em> for the first time, allowing us to search for patterns that might reveal where and why psychoactivity evolved in this group. For example, genomic analysis reveals that the closest relative of <em>L. asiatica</em> is a species commonly found (though rarely eaten) here in North America. While there are no reports of it being psychoactive in the US, it’s entirely plausible its effects have simply gone unnoticed.</p><h3>Exciting Discoveries Are Waiting for Us</h3><p>I’m fascinated by how far the knowledge of these mushrooms extends, across both space and time. Are there additional cultural traditions and groups surrounding this psychoactive species that have yet to be documented? Does humanity’s knowledge of this mushroom and its most bizarre effects stretch further into history, and deeper into folkloric beliefs, that we currently appreciate? Given the remarkable findings we’ve made in just the past few years, I believe the answer to both these questions is yes.</p><p>While many questions remain, one thing is for certain: <em>Lanmaoa asiatica</em> reminds us that the world of mushrooms, even those found in markets and on dinner plates, conceals mysteries and wonders we’ve yet to imagine. Somewhere between traditional folklore and modern biology, between the wild forest floor and the sterile scientific laboratory, lies a story still unfolding, a story that may begin with something as seemingly innocuous as a bowl of mushroom soup.</p>

        <h2>What is acadlisp?</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>acadlisp</strong> is an AutoLISP interpreter written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly.
            It runs AutoLISP code directly in the browser - no AutoCAD installation required.
        </p>

        <h2>The Story: Schematic Generator 1991</h2>
        <p>
            In 1991, a small electrical company in Bavaria, Germany faced a challenge:
            every machine installation required custom electrical schematics - a time-consuming manual process.
        </p>
        <p>
            The solution: <strong>AutoLISP</strong>, the programming language built into AutoCAD.
            I invented a workflow using CSV files, templates, and LISP code to automate schematic generation.
            Define components in spreadsheets, feed them through templates, generate complete technical drawings automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've never met anyone else who used this approach. Now I've built an interpreter in Rust/WASM
            so this workflow can live on in the browser - partly nostalgia, partly preservation before
            this knowledge disappears entirely.
        </p>

        <h2>LISP as Early AI</h2>
        <p>
            LISP (List Processing) was developed in 1958 by John McCarthy and was for decades
            <em>the</em> language of Artificial Intelligence research. What makes LISP special?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homoiconicity:</strong> Code and data share the same structure (lists)</li>
            <li><strong>Self-modification:</strong> Programs can write and modify themselves</li>
            <li><strong>Symbolic processing:</strong> Manipulation of symbols, not just numbers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            In the 1991 schematic generator, the code actually wrote itself:
            inserting a component could trigger more components, templates generated templates.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Rust</li>
            <li><strong>Target:</strong> WebAssembly (WASM)</li>
            <li><strong>Output formats:</strong> SVG, DXF (AutoCAD R12/AC1009)</li>
            <li><strong>Supported AutoLISP functions:</strong> defun, setq, if, while, cond, +, -, *, /, sin, cos, sqrt, car, cdr, list, nth, command, princ, and more</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Example Code</h2>
        <pre><code>; Draw a rectangle
(defun draw-box (x y w h)
  (command "LINE" (list x y) (list (+ x w) y) "")
  (command "LINE" (list (+ x w) y) (list (+ x w) (+ y h)) "")
  (command "LINE" (list (+ x w) (+ y h)) (list x (+ y h)) "")
  (command "LINE" (list x (+ y h)) (list x y) ""))

(draw-box 10 10 100 50)
</code></pre>

<p dir="auto"><strong>witr</strong> exists to answer a single question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Why is this running?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">When something is running on a system—whether it is a process, a service, or something bound to a port—there is always a cause. That cause is often indirect, non-obvious, or spread across multiple layers such as supervisors, containers, services, or shells.</p>
<p dir="auto">Existing tools (<code>ps</code>, <code>top</code>, <code>lsof</code>, <code>ss</code>, <code>systemctl</code>, <code>docker ps</code>) expose state and metadata. They show <em>what</em> is running, but leave the user to infer <em>why</em> by manually correlating outputs across tools.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>witr</strong> makes that causality explicit.</p>
<p dir="auto">It explains <strong>where a running thing came from</strong>, <strong>how it was started</strong>, and <strong>what chain of systems is responsible for it existing right now</strong>, in a single, human-readable output.</p>

<p dir="auto">Ports, services, containers, and commands all eventually map to <strong>PIDs</strong>. Once a PID is identified, witr builds a causal chain explaining <em>why that PID exists</em>.</p>

<p><em>"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." - Albert Einstein</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Hello there!<sup id="fr-1-1"><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>In this book we are going to write and learn about operating systems together!</p>
<p>We are going to implement an entire POSIX compliant OS in Rust and not use ANY<sup id="fr-2-1"><a href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> external libraries. All of the thought process, code and implementations will be explained and documented here as well as in this <a href="https://github.com/sagi21805/LearnixOS">repo</a> which all the code snippets are from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: ALL the syntax highlighting of the Rust code is custom and create by me! If you see and bug, please write in the comments or submit an <a href="https://github.com/sagi21805/mdbook-rust-highlight">issue</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="base-knowledge"><a href="#base-knowledge">Base Knowledge</a></h2>
<p>This book will be technical, and will assume a little bit of a programming knowledge background, but not necessarily in rust</p>
<p>If you are not coming from a low level programming knowledge that's fine!</p>
<p>Just make sure you know this stuff or learn it as you read. Also if in any place on this book I take some things for granted, please, open an issue <a href="https://github.com/sagi21805/LearnixOS-Book">here</a> and let me know so I could explain it better.</p>
<p>Some of the base knowledge that you would need to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some assembly knowledge. (just understand simple movs, and arithmetic operations, at a very basic level<sup id="fr-3-1"><a href="#footnote-3">3</a></sup>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some knowledge on memory. (what's a pointer, what's an address)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A knowledge in rust is not <em>that</em> important, but knowing at least one programming language is. I myself have some more learning in Rust, and in this book I will also explain some great features that it has!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A lot of motivation to learn and understand because it is a complex subject.</p>

<div><p>Albert Camus -- <i>The Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays</i></p><p>I'll pick the one(s) I read most recently. Camus and his absurdism resonate with me.

<div><p>I'll share my top book of the year:</p><p><i>Fryderyk Chopin: A Life and Times</i>, Alan Walker</p><p>A riveting read by a legendary musicologist and biographer.  Walker spent about ten years researching this.  It is 700 pages, which seems daunting but he makes this authoritative bio absolutely enjoyable.  It's also a "corrective biography", it dispels a lot of myths.  This book is one of the best examples of accessible writing with flair.  What a writer!</p><p>Throughout the book, Walker tastefully quotes musical phrases (in notation) from Chopin's works to situate them in context.  I often paused reading and put on the track on a given page (nocturnes, mazurkas, preludes, etc).  It made the reading experience incredibly rich and fun.  Other things I enjoyed: Chopin's letters to his friends and family, life in aristocratic salons of Paris, London, Warsaw, and more—Chopin had unparalleled access.  Of course, there's also a lot of gut-wrenching stuff.  As the book's blurb says, it really <i>is</i> for both the casual music lover and the professional pianist.</p><p>If you haven't discovered them yet, give a listen to Chopin's nocturnes.  But please, give them an attentive listen and play them on a high-quality audio system.  Here[1] is one of his finest nocturnes (it is less famous than the "happier" nocturne that follows it, Op. 9 No. 2).</p><p>[1] <i>Nocturne in B-flat minor, Op. 9 No. 1</i>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThMGf07UBHQ" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThMGf07UBHQ</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46392045"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46392045" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46392045&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46391572"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>Technical followed by non-technical. I read more than these, but these are the highlights.</p><p>Mouse, a Language for Microcomputers by Peter Grogono - Mouse is basically an esolang with barely any abstraction facilities, but the book was well-written and the language compelling enough to explore further.</p><p>Notes on Distance Dialing (pdf) by AT&amp;T - Described the telephone systems of the USA and Canada in the mid-1950s. The reading is a dry as it gets, but it was a fascinating dive into a vastly complex system solving extremely hard problems. This is a must-read for folks interested in systems-thinking. That said, I am actively looking for recommendations for books about the process of designing and building the unbelievably complex telephony system over the rudiments of the earlier systems. Recommendations welcomed!</p><p>The Eye of Osiris by R. Austin Freeman - This is the first book that I’ve read from Freeman and I suspect that I will read many more in the future. The story follows the disappearance of John Bellingham, Egyptologist and the subsequent investigation. As the investigation stalls, the eminent Dr. Thorndyke digs into the case. The story sets up the mystery nicely and indeed provides enough information to the reader to infer how the disappearance occurred and who or what facilitated it. The book is one of the best whodunits that I’ve ever read.</p><p>The Mystery of Edwin Drood by Charles Dickens - His final work remains unfinished as he passed away before he could complete it. Further complicating the meta-story is that he also didn’t outline the ending nor even put to paper the “villain” of the story. The meta-mystery of the ending has motivated a mountain of speculation around the ending including dozens of continuations of the story from other authors, all deriving their pet endings from textual hints, accounts from Dickens’ friends, illustration notes, and even in some cases seances supposedly accompanied by the spirit of Dickens himself. What was written by Dickens is spectacular and a compelling mystery and although it would be great to know the resolution, in some ways the “Droodiana” that has cropped up over the past 150+ years is reason enough for it to remain a mystery. The whole lore around Edwin Drood is a worthwhile hobby in itself and well-worth exploring. The Chiltern Library edition of the book contains the story and a good bit of the lore around the writing and the meta-works available at the time of its publication.</p><p>The Shadow People by Margaret St. Clair - Sadly out of print and difficult to find, but I’ve had it on my shelves for decades and finally got around to reading it. The book came onto my radar in the 1980s when I learned about it in the appendix-n of the 1st edition Advanced D&amp;D Dungeon Masters Guide. I enjoyed many of the books at the time and have slowly swung around to re-reading them over the past few years. Sadly, most on the list do not stand the test of time for me, but St. Clair’s mixture of 60s counter-cultural leanings in a fantasy/sf world still works. The cultural touch-points in the book feel quite dated, but despite the occasional awkwardness, the story is unique even today.</p><p>Lolly Willowes by Sylvia Townsend Warner - The book started as a passable novel of manners focused on a turn of the century British middle-class family. The titular character was mostly background decoration for the first third of the novel and AFAIR was talked about only in the third-person. It’s only when she made the choice to move out on her own to the country in her middle age does she gain a central role in the narrative and her inner thoughts revealed. This is where things really pick up because I was shocked to learn that this unassuming woman’s inner thoughts had a delicious darkness to them. I don’t want to give away too much, but I’ll just say that you will not expect how the story ends.</p><p>Patience by Daniel Clowes - A profound graphic novel using time-travel to explore the idea of enduring love with a story that proceed through time, following Jack as he tries to alter the past and save the woman he loves. This well-known science fiction motif is elevated by Clowes’ signature psychological complexity.</p><p>Narcissus and Goldmund by Herman Hesse - I’ve read most of the books by Hermann Hesse but this one escaped my attention until this year. The story follows the parallel lives of a monk Narcissus and his passionate friend Goldmund as they respectively search for meaning in life through spiritual means and through pleasures of the flesh.</p><p>We Who Are About To… by Joanna Russ - A small group of astronauts crash land on a hostile alien world and quickly realize that rescue is unlikely to come. Many SF stories have started this way and so the expectation is that this is a colonization story… but Russ thrives on subverting reader expectations.</p><p>Fifty Forgotten Records by R.B. Russell - Another lovely entry in Russell’s series (one can hope) of autobiographical explorations of art, so far covering literature and now music. This book describes 50 records of varying popularity and Russell’s personal connections to each. While I certainly enjoyed finding a dozen or so new albums to explore, the true triumph of the book lies in the vulnerable, reflective memoir threaded throughout.</p><p>The Way of All Flesh by Samuel Butler A novel that follows 4-generations of the Ponitifex family, with a particular bildungsroman-esque thread around Ernest, a young man who’s naivete leads to his downfall and how his life unfolds thereafter.</p><p>I wrote about these (and more) at <a href="https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2025.html" rel="nofollow">https://blog.fogus.me/2025/12/23/the-best-things-and-stuff-o...</a></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46396316"><td></td></tr><tr id="46396128"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46396128" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46396128&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46391572"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I read The Buddha: Biography of a Myth, by Donald S. Lopez after hearing him on Conversations With Tyler. That's probably my top non-fiction book this year. Key takeaway was that the history of Buddhism is incredibly deep. Two highlights: First, the Buddha said that minor rules could be disregarded after his passing, but the person that was informed of this forgot to ask for clarification of what rules were minor, so there's debate over which rules must be followed. Second, the Buddha left us because nobody asked him to stay. This second point makes me reflect on the importance of reminding people that they are valued.</p><p>I also read The Red Book, Reader's Edition, by Carl Jung. I'm still processing that one. The artwork in the book is breathtaking and I strongly suggest looking it up even if you only look at the art. Narratively, it feels a bit like rambling at times. I'd previously read Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, and Aion, and felt like those had a bit more intelligible substance. The first few chapters of Aion are excellent, but then Jung just goes on for like a dozen chapters about fish symbolism which completely lost me.</p><p>I also read a few other books on occult and esoteric topics, but my thoughts on those books are more complex than what I'm willing to type out on mobile. Key takeaway from a book on Wiccan Witchcraft was that they also believe in a system of reincarnation. I'm interested in reading through some of the core texts of Chinese Mythology at some point, but there aren't any good audiobook recordings for some of them.</p><p>I'm sad to say that I made very little progress in getting through proper college level textbooks, but I'm working through Molecular Biology of the Cell.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46396803"><td></td></tr><tr id="46396822"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="0"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="0"></td><td><center><a id="up_46396822" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46396822&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46391572"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>Getting into reading again this year after a long break.</p><p>The most memorable read of this year was "The Count of Monte Cristo" (1846) by Alexander Dumas .</p><p>It's one of the greatest stories ever told. It's ~1250 pages but I sped through it in 3 weeks even if I'm a slow reader.</p><p>Highly recommended!</p><p>I also read The Stranger by Camus and the two top Orwells which lived up to the hype.</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46391867"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46391867" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46391867&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46391572"></a></center></td><td><br>
<div><p>The Count of Monte Cristo was published in serial form. Daily from 1844 to 1846.</p><p>That explains a lot the format, which tended to try to retain the audience.</p><p>Also, the author wrote in advance of the daily publication, but the book was written "live", answering to public perception and response. This is a reason why the book is so "good": the author had the chance to adjust the story based on data from sales and feedback from readers.</p><p>Of course Dumas was a great writer too, but this live writing, data based is probably why the book resonates so well with audiences.</p><p>So, as a joke, if you read count of monte cristo in 3 weeks, you did the equivalent of bing reading it.</p><p>This happens with soap operas too. 10 years ago, they lasted 1 year. They had an initial structure, the story, the characters, but responded in "real-time" to audience feedback.</p><p>For those willing to read the book, give yourself some time. Try to read it over a course of some years. Read a little, come back to it.</p><p>There are several famous books written in the same form, like Crime and Punishment or The Three Musketeers.</p><p>Oh, and also authors got payed by installment, so that explains the lenght lol</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr><tr id="46391983"><td><table><tbody><tr><td indent="1"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/s.gif" height="1" width="40"></td><td><center><a id="up_46391983" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/vote?id=46391983&amp;how=up&amp;goto=item%3Fid%3D46391572"></a></center></td><td><br>

<div><p>I started the year with "Right thing, right now", and I'm ending it with "wisdom takes work" (R.Holiday), but I'm happy to say that I'm now a bit "tired" of re-reading the same rehashing of other people's book, and I want to read the original ones. Which, actually, is the pont.</p><p>I wanted to read classics, and devoured "The portrait of Dorian Gray" (O.Wilde), where maybe 50% of all the "as O.Wilde said..." quotes seem to come from (uttered by a single, incredibly obnoxious character.)</p><p>I challenged myself to read "Les Miserables" (V.Hugo), and actually managed to get two tomes out of five down. Eminently quotable, heavily skippable - why on earth spend half a time on describing the ins and out of Waterloo, except to show off ? - and, surprisingly, at times, _funny_.</p><p>The bio of Pierre Mendès France (J.Lacouture) was very much topical, given the mess in Franch politics. We had more PMs in one year than in a few chapters of the book. It's very weird to read that, at some point, some politicians were "liked" by the people - but lost power anyway.</p><p>A small Edouard Phillipe book called "Men who read" almost made me like the guy - his next book is more serious and expected.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Using git as a database is a seductive idea. You get version history for free. Pull requests give you a review workflow. It’s distributed by design. GitHub will host it for free. Everyone already knows how to use it.</p>

<p>Package managers keep falling for this. And it keeps not working out.</p>

<h2 id="cargo">Cargo</h2>

<p>The crates.io index started as a git repository. Every Cargo client cloned it. This worked fine when the registry was small, but the index kept growing. Users would see progress bars like “Resolving deltas: 74.01%, (64415/95919)” hanging for ages, the visible symptom of Cargo’s libgit2 library grinding through <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9069">delta resolution</a> on a repository with thousands of historic commits.</p>

<p>The problem was worst in CI. Stateless environments would download the full index, use a tiny fraction of it, and throw it away. Every build, every time.</p>

<p><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2789-sparse-index.html">RFC 2789</a> introduced a sparse HTTP protocol. Instead of cloning the whole index, Cargo now fetches files directly over HTTPS, downloading only the metadata for dependencies your project actually uses. (This is the “<a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/05/package-manager-tradeoffs.html">full index replication vs on-demand queries</a>” tradeoff in action.) By April 2025, 99% of crates.io requests came from Cargo versions where sparse is the default. The git index still exists, still growing by thousands of commits per day, but most users never touch it.</p>

<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/9383">GitHub explicitly asked Homebrew to stop using shallow clones.</a> Updating them was <a href="https://brew.sh/2023/02/16/homebrew-4.0.0/">“an extremely expensive operation”</a> due to the tree layout and traffic of homebrew-core and homebrew-cask.</p>

<p>Users were downloading 331MB just to unshallow homebrew-core. The .git folder approached 1GB on some machines. Every <code>brew update</code> meant waiting for git to grind through delta resolution.</p>

<p>Homebrew 4.0.0 in February 2023 switched to JSON downloads for tap updates. The reasoning was blunt: “they are expensive to git fetch and git clone and GitHub would rather we didn’t do that… they are slow to git fetch and git clone and this provides a bad experience to end users.”</p>

<p>Auto-updates now run every 24 hours instead of every 5 minutes, and they’re much faster because there’s no git fetch involved.</p>

<h2 id="cocoapods">CocoaPods</h2>

<p>CocoaPods is the package manager for iOS and macOS development. It hit the limits hard. The Specs repo grew to hundreds of thousands of podspecs across a deeply nested directory structure. Cloning took minutes. Updating took minutes. CI time vanished into git operations.</p>

<p>GitHub imposed CPU rate limits. The culprit was shallow clones, which force GitHub’s servers to compute which objects the client already has. The team tried various band-aids: stopping auto-fetch on <code>pod install</code>, converting shallow clones to full clones, <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/">sharding the repository</a>.</p>

<p>The CocoaPods blog captured it well: <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/Master-Spec-Repo-Rate-Limiting-Post-Mortem/">“Git was invented at a time when ‘slow network’ and ‘no backups’ were legitimate design concerns. Running endless builds as part of continuous integration wasn’t commonplace.”</a></p>

<p>CocoaPods 1.8 <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-1.8.0-beta/">gave up on git entirely</a> for most users. A CDN became the default, serving podspec files directly over HTTP. The migration saved users about a gigabyte of disk space and made <code>pod install</code> nearly instant for new setups.</p>

<h2 id="nixpkgs">Nixpkgs</h2>

<p>Nixpkgs is currently stress-testing GitHub’s infrastructure. In November 2025, GitHub contacted the NixOS team about <a href="https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-core-team-update-2025-11-30-github-scaling-issues/72709">periodic maintenance jobs failing</a> and causing “issues achieving consensus between replicas.” If unresolved, the repository could have become read-only.</p>

<p>The repository totals 83GB with half a million tree objects and 20,000 forks. A local clone is only 2.5GB — the rest is GitHub’s fork network storing every pull request branch and merge commit. The CI queries mergeability daily, creating new merge commits each time.</p>

<p>Unlike CocoaPods, Nixpkgs can’t easily move to a CDN. The Nix expressions <em>are</em> the package definitions, not metadata pointing elsewhere. Binary caches already serve built packages over HTTP, but nixpkgs itself remains a git repository — and it’s still growing.</p>

<h2 id="vcpkg">vcpkg</h2>

<p>vcpkg is Microsoft’s C++ package manager. It uses git tree hashes to version its ports, with the curated registry at <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg">github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg</a> containing over 2,000 libraries.</p>

<p>The problem is that vcpkg needs to retrieve specific versions of ports by their git tree hash. When you specify a <code>builtin-baseline</code> in your vcpkg.json (functioning like a lockfile for reproducible builds), vcpkg looks up historical commits to find the exact port versions you need. This only works if you have the full commit history.</p>

<p>Shallow clones break everything. GitHub Actions uses shallow clones by default. DevContainers <a href="https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398">shallow-clone vcpkg</a> to save space. CI systems optimize for fast checkouts. All of these result in the same error: “vcpkg was cloned as a shallow repository… Try again with a full vcpkg clone.”</p>

<p>The workarounds are ugly. One <a href="https://github.com/devcontainers/images/issues/398">proposed solution</a> involves parsing vcpkg.json to extract the baseline hash, deriving the commit date, then fetching with <code>--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</code>. Another suggests including twelve months of history, hoping projects upgrade before their baseline falls off the cliff. For GitHub Actions, you need <code>fetch-depth: 0</code> in your checkout step, <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349">downloading the entire repository history</a> just to resolve dependencies.</p>

<p>A vcpkg team member <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/issues/25349">explained the fundamental constraint</a>: “Port versions don’t use commit hashes, we use the git tree hash of the port directory. As far as I know, there is no way to deduce the commit that added a specific tree hash.” An in-product fix is infeasible. The architecture baked in git deeply enough that there’s no escape hatch.</p>

<p>Unlike Cargo, Homebrew, and CocoaPods, vcpkg hasn’t announced plans to move away from git registries. Custom registries must still be git repositories. The documentation describes filesystem registries as an alternative, but these require local or mounted paths rather than HTTP access. There’s no CDN, no sparse protocol, no HTTP-based solution on the horizon.</p>

<h2 id="go-modules">Go modules</h2>

<p><a href="https://engineering.grab.com/go-module-proxy">Grab’s engineering team</a> went from 18 minutes for <code>go get</code> to 12 seconds after deploying a module proxy. That’s not a typo. Eighteen minutes down to twelve seconds.</p>

<p>The problem was that <code>go get</code> needed to fetch each dependency’s source code just to read its go.mod file and resolve transitive dependencies. Cloning entire repositories to get a single file.</p>

<p>Go had security concerns too. The original design wanted to remove version control tools entirely because <a href="https://arslan.io/2019/08/02/why-you-should-use-a-go-module-proxy/">“these fragment the ecosystem: packages developed using Bazaar or Fossil, for example, are effectively unavailable to users who cannot or choose not to install these tools.”</a> Beyond fragmentation, the Go team worried about security bugs in version control systems becoming security bugs in <code>go get</code>. You’re not just importing code; you’re importing the attack surface of every VCS tool on the developer’s machine.</p>

<p>GOPROXY became the default in Go 1.13. The proxy serves source archives and go.mod files independently over HTTP. Go also introduced a <a href="https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/21/federated-package-management.html#gos-experiment-with-dns">checksum database (sumdb)</a> that records cryptographic hashes of module contents. This protects against force pushes silently changing tagged releases, and ensures modules remain available even if the original repository is deleted.</p>

<h2 id="beyond-package-managers">Beyond package managers</h2>

<p>The same pattern shows up wherever developers try to use git as a database.</p>

<p>Git-based wikis like Gollum (used by GitHub and GitLab) become <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum/issues/1940">“somewhat too slow to be usable”</a> at scale. Browsing directory structure takes seconds per click. Loading pages takes longer. <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/wikis.html">GitLab plans to move away from Gollum entirely.</a></p>

<p>Git-based CMS platforms like Decap hit GitHub’s API rate limits. A Decap project on GitHub <a href="https://decapcms.org/blog/git-based-cms-definition-features-best-practices/">scales to about 10,000 entries</a> if you have a lot of collection relations. A new user with an empty cache makes a request per entry to populate it, burning through the 5,000 request limit quickly. If your site has lots of content or updates frequently, use a database instead.</p>

<p>Even GitOps tools that embrace git as a source of truth have to work around its limitations. ArgoCD’s repo server <a href="https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/high_availability/">can run out of disk space</a> cloning repositories. A single commit invalidates the cache for all applications in that repo. Large monorepos need special scaling considerations.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern">The pattern</h2>

<p>The hosting problems are symptoms. The underlying issue is that git inherits filesystem limitations, and filesystems make terrible databases.</p>

<p><strong>Directory limits.</strong> Directories with too many files become slow. CocoaPods had <a href="https://blog.cocoapods.org/Sharding/">16,000 pod directories</a> in a single Specs folder, requiring huge tree objects and expensive computation. Their fix was hash-based sharding: split directories by the first few characters of a hashed name, so no single directory has too many entries. Git itself does this internally with its objects folder, splitting into 256 subdirectories. You’re reinventing B-trees, badly.</p>

<p><strong>Case sensitivity.</strong> Git is case-sensitive, but macOS and Windows filesystems typically aren’t. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/os-compatibility">Check out a repo containing both <code>File.txt</code> and <code>file.txt</code> on Windows</a>, and the second overwrites the first. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/case-sensitivity">Azure DevOps</a> had to add server-side enforcement to block pushes with case-conflicting paths.</p>

<p><strong>Path length limits.</strong> Windows restricts paths to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation">260 characters</a>, a constraint dating back to DOS. Git supports longer paths, but Git for Windows inherits the OS limitation. This is painful with deeply nested node_modules directories, where <code>git status</code> fails with “Filename too long” errors.</p>

<p><strong>Missing database features.</strong> Databases have CHECK constraints and UNIQUE constraints; git has nothing, so every package manager builds its own validation layer. Databases have locking; git doesn’t. Databases have indexes for queries like “all packages depending on X”; with git you either traverse every file or build your own index. Databases have migrations for schema changes; git has “rewrite history and force everyone to re-clone.”</p>

<p>The progression is predictable. Start with a flat directory of files. Hit filesystem limits. Implement sharding. Hit cross-platform issues. Build server-side enforcement. Build custom indexes. Eventually give up and use HTTP or an actual database. You’ve built a worse version of what databases already provide, spread across git hooks, CI pipelines, and bespoke tooling.</p>

<p>None of this means git is bad. Git excels at what it was designed for: distributed collaboration on source code, with branching, merging, and offline work. The problem is using it for something else entirely. Package registries need fast point queries for metadata. Git gives you a full-document sync protocol when you need a key-value lookup.</p>

<p>If you’re building a package manager and git-as-index seems appealing, look at Cargo, Homebrew, CocoaPods, vcpkg, Go. They all had to build workarounds as they grew, causing pain for users and maintainers. The pull request workflow is nice. The version history is nice. You will hit the same walls they did.</p>

            <p>I’ve been working in a single chat for close 9-10 months now, with some separate chats opened once in a while.

<p>In <strong>Settings &gt; Customize ChatGPT</strong>, under the field that asks <em>“What traits should ChatGPT have?”</em>, I added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After every response, add the current timestamp.”</p>

<p>Now each reply ends with a timestamp, which makes it much easier to track what was said and when, especially in ongoing conversations. Not a perfect solution, but it’s been working pretty well for me.</p>

              <p>Yes, it’s totally possible! Every <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that has a <code>"data-message-id"</code> contains an internal object with some message information, including the timestamp. I created this simple script that you can copy and paste directly into the Chrome DevTools console.</p>
<p>Just right-click anywhere on the page and choose <strong>“Inspect”</strong>, then go to the <strong>“Console”</strong> tab and paste this code:</p>
<pre><code>document.querySelectorAll('div[data-message-id]').forEach(div =&gt; {
  const reactKey = Object.keys(div).find(k =&gt; k.startsWith('__reactFiber$'));
  if (!reactKey) return;

              <p>That’s awesome! I just installed the extension and it works perfectly.</p>
<p>For anyone who wants to use Hangzhi’s timestamp extension before it’s officially approved on the Chrome Web Store, here’s how you can install it manually:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download the ZIP file from the GitHub repo:</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub page: github[.]com/Hangzhi/chatgpt-timestamp-extension</li>
<li>Direct download link: github[.]com/Hangzhi/chatgpt-timestamp-extension/raw/main/chatgpt-timestamp-extension.zip</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: Since direct links aren’t allowed here, just replace <code>[.]</code> with <code>.</code> and paste the link into your browser.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After downloading, right-click the ZIP file and select “Extract to chatgpt-timestamp-extension/”. This will create a folder named <code>chatgpt-timestamp-extension</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open <code>chrome://extensions/</code> in your browser.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the top-right corner, enable “Developer mode”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After enabling it, new options will appear. Click “Load unpacked”, then select the folder you just extracted (<code>chatgpt-timestamp-extension</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That’s it! You should now see a new extension called “ChatGPT Timestamp” in your Chrome extensions. Open ChatGPT, and you’ll see timestamps above each message.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again <a href="https://community.openai.com/u/hangzhi">@Hangzhi</a> for the great work and for turning the idea into a real Chrome extension!</p>

              <p>Hi OpenAI Team,</p>
<p>I recently ran into a technical issue with my PC and discussed it with ChatGPT. A few days later, I needed to <strong>find out exactly when I posted a specific message</strong>, because that moment correlated with when the problem occurred. Unfortunately, there’s no way to see when individual messages were sent or received, which made it hard to trace the timing.</p>
<p>This would also benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone using ChatGPT to track ongoing issues</li>
<li>Users referencing previous decisions or drafts</li>
<li>Those working across multiple sessions and needing historical context</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d love to see this added in a future update.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to add my vote to adding individual-message timestamps in ChatGPT.  We all really appreciate the work you do and the amazing resource you have created.  This is a simple feature request that would really help a lot of people.  Thanks!</p>

              <p>Yep! I too suggest adding optional timestamps to ChatGPT conversations.</p>
<p>For long-running or sensitive threads, having the exact time a message was sent improves clarity, emotional context, and continuity. It helps both the model and the user avoid misunderstandings about timing (like, night vs. day, time between replies, or multi-day situations).</p>
<p>This can also support users with health issues, legal timelines, documentation, or crisis patterns by allowing more accurate context.</p>

        <article>

        

    <div>
        <p>This month I sold my 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro and bought a Framework 13 DIY Edition laptop. After I got everything setup I sat down to write about the experience. Some ~4500 words later I realized I needed to break my thoughts into multiple posts.</p>
<p>See also:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/framework-13-diy-edition-hardware-thoughts/">Framework 13 DIY Edition Hardware Thoughts</a></li>

</ul>

<p>My new Framework 13 laptop just arrived. After I finally set everything up I started writing a post about the experience. I thought I'd write a <em>little bit</em> about my previous laptops, but a lot of fond memories I had forgotten about came flooding back. The tinkerings and many openings of laptops past. If you will indulge me, I've been feeling nostalgic. This is for the other laptop weirdos out there that that feel the same.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-a-history-of-doing-terrible-acts-to-laptops">I have a history of doing terrible acts to laptops</h3>
<p><img src="https://blog.matthewbrunelle.com/content/images/2025/08/25654_1350884488762_5177004_n.jpg" alt="25654_1350884488762_5177004_n.jpg" loading="lazy"><br>
The only image I could find of my NC10 was this blurry, 2021 flip phone photo of me removing the windows sticker.</p>
<p>In 2008, I managed to get my hands on a Samsung NC10 Netbook in a fancy metallic blue color. [^ Back when netbooks where a thing circle 2007-2013] Prior to this I only had desktops. The specs were pretty humble (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_NC10?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">from wikipedia</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A single core 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N270</li>
<li>Integrated Intel GMA 950 graphics</li>
<li>1 GB DDR2 RAM</li>
<li>10.2 inch 1024x600 screen and a <em>VGA connector</em> of all things.</li>
<li>83-key keyboard rather than the usual 87 or 88 keys on a laptop.</li>
<li>A 160 GB HDD</li>
</ul>
<p>Something could be done about that though! You could <a href="https://replacethatpart.com/how-to-upgrade-memory-ram-of-the-samsung-nc10-a-complete-guide-2/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">upgrade</a> the RAM to a powerful 2GB. You could replace the slow HDD with an SSD. You could <a href="https://liliputing.com/touchscreen-kit-for-the-samsung-nc10-and-other-netbooks/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">add a touch screen</a>. You could <a href="https://www.atmasphere.net/archives/2009/01/15/the-samsung-nc10-hackintosh?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">make a Hackintosh</a> out of it if you replaced the wifi card. If you wanted to, you could do those things and I was a weirdo, so I did!</p>
<p>I found a lot of fun in trying to get as much as I could out of that hardware. In fact I'd say the act of doing all that was far more enjoyable than actually using the laptop once the tinkering was done. After the novelty and slowness of a Hackintosh wore off I put Linux on the Netbook. I still sought the thrill of the hunt.</p>
<p>I installed a lite weight distro <a href="https://crunchbang.org/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">CrunchBang</a> [^ or just #!] and messed around. I read more about different minimalist distros and came across two others I could hop to: Arch and Gentoo. This feels like an inflection point in my life, I choose to try Arch since I wouldn't have to compile everything on a single core. [^ Who know what would have happened if I picked Gentoo. I might have a beard now.] The screen was small and I wanted to maximize its usefulness so I started trying tiling WMs. Why not <a href="https://xmonad.org/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">XMonad</a>?</p>
<p>It turns out the GMA950 was undervolted on the NC10. Someone made a shareware tool called the GMABooster that could restore the max clock rate. The original website <a href="http://www.gmabooster.com/home.htm?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">http://www.gmabooster.com/home.htm</a> is long toast and not on wayback. This <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=81429&amp;ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Arch forum thread</a> has details though:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It allows a user, not a manufacturer to choose the desired GMA speed. It combines a sophisticated assembler-level technology and the user-friendly graphic user interface, offering You to near double the GMA core perfomance without even a need to restart a computer..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The package was on AUR so I could squeeze out a little more performance. I could finally watch 480 YouTube videos instead of 360. At some point, long after I had stopped using the netbook, the AUR package became abandoned. I <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150802113711/https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gmabooster/">adopted it as maintainer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ciferkey/GMABooster_Linux?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">mirrored</a> the binary in GitHub. This was the first time I ever was a package maintainer. [^ I am on a couple random packages in nixpkgs now.] Nowadays the package is memorialized in the the <a href="https://github.com/aur-archive/gmabooster?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">AUR archive</a>.</p>
<p>I had a device that I could repeatedly break and remake. Did I do anything productive or meaningful with it? Absolutely not. Did I learn a lot in the process? I'd say so!</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="in-the-past-you-could-do-terrible-things-to-macbooks-too">In the past you could do terrible things to Macbooks too</h3>
<p>When I went to College I got a 2011 Macbook Pro. The kind that would overheat and desolder the GPU. [^ Some clever people have found hardware hacks to repair the problem <a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/fixing-2011-macbook-pro-booting-grey-screen-amd-radeon-video-glitch?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2017/fixing-2011-macbook-pro-booting-grey-screen-amd-radeon-video-glitch</a>] Mine managed to last a long time and didn't need replacing until 2019. The RAM was not built-in yet on Macbooks. Apple said the model could only support up to 8GB total RAM, but you <a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/259351?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">could actually</a> get 16GB to work. Also, this was back when Macbooks had CD drives. I replaced the my drive with an <a href="https://eshop.macsales.com/item/Western%20Digital/DDMB5KT1.0/?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">Other World Computing DIY Optical Drive to HDD Upgrade Kit</a>. [^ And you could put the drive into an "OWC SuperSlim" enclosure to turn it into a USB CD drive.] and installed SSDs in both slots. With two drives I was able to install rEFInd as a boot manager and triple boot:</p>
<ul>
<li>OSX as a stable install for my course work</li>
<li>Windows for games</li>
<li>Linux so I could break my install repeatedly</li>
</ul>
<p>I iterated on my Arch install so many times that I started to keep a checklist about my setup process to help me remember everything. Certain stylistic choices were set and still used to this day. [^ This is when I started using Inconsolata for a monospace font and Zenburn for a color scheme.] I couldn't change quite as many things about this laptop, but I still made an effort to change what I could.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="as-laptops-grew-thinner-they-grew-more-boring">As laptops grew thinner they grew more boring</h3>
<p>When it came time for a new laptop I was not looking at Macbook Pros anymore. Apple had made changes, like the touch bar and removing magsafe, that felt like they were targeting a different audience. So instead I had been eyeing a ThinkPad.<br>
[^ It's almost cliche to buy one and install Linux.] The prices on the Lenovo store are mostly made up and constantly discounted. My housemate had access to a corpo portal for Lenovo that let me get one at a heavily reduced price. The cost of 3 year service coverage was also discounted so I got some figuring it could help to cover cost of parts if if something failed.</p>
<p>So I bought a Gen 7 X1 Carbon and... I just used it. No mods were possible on this laptop. When I had an SSD failure I asked Lenovo if they could mail me the drive so I could do the install. They said they had to send someone to confirm the issue. So a technician came out and replaced the drive.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-gift-and-curse-of-a-free-macbook-pro">The gift and curse of a free Macbook Pro</h3>
<p>Finally in 2023 I was <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/company-news/a-message-from-hubspot-ceo-yamini-rangan?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">laid off by HubSpot</a>. Part of severance was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Laptops &amp; WFH Set-Up: Impacted employees may keep their HubSpot laptops (it will be cleaned of any company data remotely), as well as any work from home gear like monitors and keyboards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus a pretty high spec 2021 M1 Max Macbook Pro fell into my lap. I gave my X1 Carbon to a friend to avoid creating yet more ewaste that sits in my closet.</p>
<p>The 2021 version was a bit of return to form: touch bar was gone, magsafe was back, etc. However even the <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown?utm_source=M1MBPTD&amp;utm_medium=Annotation&amp;utm_campaign=YouTube">iFixit review</a> said the "design represents a major move in the right direction" but still only rated the laptop a 4/10  for repairability. [^ The score was eventually updated to a 5/10 when Apple later released a service manual and access to parts.]</p>
<p>I felt some dissonance though. If I was looking to buy a laptop, I wouldn't have picked this one. macOS was getting less enjoyable to use with each update. Likewise the Linux Desktop experience was really coming into its own. [^ By 2023 essentially all my games were playable!] However I felt bad about buying a new laptop when I now had a perfectly good one. So I held onto it and once again, no mods were done or could be done with this laptop.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="finally-buying-a-framework-13">Finally buying a Framework 13</h3>
<p>I had waited on getting a Framework laptop because I wanted to see them go through a couple iterations. I wanted to see if the promise of repairing, replacing and upgrading actually came true. From what I read it mostly has! [^ People with Framework 15 do seem to be waiting though.]</p>
<p>What changed the decision for me was the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lugging around a powerful 16 inch laptop was a drag. Having a laptop when traveling is nice if I need to hurriedly rebook something. Mobile sites and apps tend to restrict you in weird ways.</li>
<li>Despite being a couple years old, the laptop was still worth a lot. People probably want Macbooks for local LLM inference. So I felt pretty good a buyer will actually use the laptop.</li>
<li>The Framework release a refresh of the 13 with the new AMD chips.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then I had a friend get Laptop 13 and attest to liking it. That was the last push I needed to finally buy one. Now I can be a laptop weirdo again.</p>
<p>You can't change the RAM on laptops now.<br>
You can't change the SSD on laptops now.<br>
You can't easily repair the screen on laptops now.</p>
<p>You can do all that and more with a Framework laptop.<br>
You can be a laptop weirdo with a Framework laptop.</p>
<p>Weirdo typically has two interpretations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A possibly dangerous person.<br>
A strange, odd, eccentric person.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To both of those I say: all us laptop weirdos can now put a <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/the-snack-drawer-store-now-made-with-real-snacks/43101?ref=blog.matthewbrunelle.com">snack drawer</a> in our laptops.<br>
You cannot stop us.</p>

<p dir="auto">We implement white-box SLA training by aligning the predictions of the SLA-enabled model with those of the full-attention pretrained model. Unlike black-box training in the original paper, which tunes the pretrained model using diffusion loss, white-box training mitigates distribution shift and is less sensitive to the training data.</p>

在10月底的M2中，我们主要解决模型成本和模型开放性的问题。在M2.1中，我们致力于提升真实世界复杂任务中的表现：<strong>重点聚焦于更多编程语言和办公场景的可用性，并在这个领域做到最好的水平</strong>。</p></div><div><p><img alt="icon" loading="lazy" width="24" height="24" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" src="https://filecdn.minimax.chat/public/a533807b-9ff6-4f86-a72e-8eb31d0245c1.png"></p></div><div><div 1.7;="" max-width:="" 800px;"="">

  <p>
    MiniMax M2.1 具体模型亮点如下:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
  
    <li>
      <p><strong>卓越多编程语言能力</strong></p>
      <p>过去很多模型主要围绕 Python 优化, 但真实世界的系统往往是多语言协作的结果。</p>
      <p>在 M2.1 中, 我们系统性提升了 Rust / Java / Golang / <span>C++</span> / Kotlin / Objective-C / TypeScript / <span>JavaScript</span> 等语言的能力, 多语言任务整体表现达到业内领先水平, 覆盖从底层系统到应用层开发的完整链路。
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>WebDev 与 AppDev：能力与美学的整体跃迁</strong></p>
      <p>针对业界普遍存在的移动端开发短板, M2.1 显著加强了原生 Android / iOS 开发能力。</p>
      <p>同时, 我们系统性提升了模型在 Web 与 App 场景中的设计理解与美学表达能力, 能够出色地构建复杂交互、3D科学场景模拟与高质量可视化表达, 推动 <span>vibe coding</span> 成为可持续、可交付的生产实践。
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>复合指令约束提升，办公场景变为可能</strong></p>
      <p>作为开源模型中<span>率先系统性</span>引入 Interleaved Thinking 的模型系列, M2.1 systematic problem-solving 能力再次升级。</p>
      <p>模型不仅关注代码执行是否正确, 同时关注模型对“复合指令约束”的整合执行能力, 在真实办公场景具备更高的可用性。
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>更简洁高效的回复</strong></p>
      <p>相比 M2, MiniMax-M2.1 的模型回复以及思维链更加简洁, 在实际编程与交互体验中, 响应速度显著提升, Token 消耗明显下降, 在 AI Coding与Agent驱动的连续工作流中更加流畅和高效。
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>出色的 <span>Agent / 工具脚手架泛化能力</span></strong></p>
      <p>M2.1 在各类编程工具与 Agent 框架中均有出色表现。在 Claude Code、Droid (Factory AI)、Cline、Kilo Code、Roo Code、BlackBox 等工具中展现一致且稳定的效果, 并对 Skill.md、Claude.md / agent.md / cursorrule、Slash Command 等 Context Management机制提供可靠支持。
      </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
      <p><strong>高质量对话和写作</strong></p>
      <p>M2.1 不再只是“代码能力更强”, 在日常对话、技术说明与写作场景中, 也能提供更具细节与结构性的回答。
      </p>
    </li>
