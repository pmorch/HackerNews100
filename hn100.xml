<p><strong>This is the story of a commercially unavailable <em>stereo pair</em> of the
bi-amped Marshall Uxbridge, with custom-built replacement electronics:
active filters feeding two linear power amps. Listening to this
high-fidelity set has brought me immense enjoyment. Play a great album
on these near-fields, and the result is close to pure magic! Over and
above the accurate reproduction of a wide audio range, the precision
and depth of its stereo imaging is stunning.</strong></p>

<em>Odd socks, rock’n’roll! (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Dumpster diving electronics is a way of life, which sometimes brings
great moments of joy.  One of these moments happened when I stumbled
upon… the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=marshall+uxbridge&amp;iax=images&amp;ia=images">Marshall Uxbridge
Voice</a>,
a smart speaker, in seemingly pristine condition. And not just one,
but <em>two</em> of them! One was black, the other white. What a find!</p>

<p>What to do with these babies? Intrigued by the question “what could be
wrong with them, why would someone throw them out like that?” –
I set out to investigate. Plugging in one of them, after a few seconds
of waiting, a female voice was heard: <em>«NOW IN SETUP MODE. FOLLOW THE
INSTRUCTIONS IN YOUR DEVICE’S COMPANION APP.»</em></p>

<p>Sounded like a command: clear, loud and demanding. But no, that won’t
happen. Instead, let’s see if we can use this gadget as a plain old
Bluetooth speaker?  Yes indeed! With the help of <code>blueman-manager</code>, I
was able to hook it up to my Linux desktop (running Debian stable, as
ever) and select it as a speaker output. And it worked, and music
filled the room!</p>

<p>I was delighted, and immediately impressed by the sound quality. The
low end was punchy and deep, much deeper than the modest dimensions
led me to believe. The high end was crisp and detailed. Good drivers,
I thought, and a good amp – there’s got to be some iron and
copper inside, no wonder the thing is quite heavy! I liked it even
though the sound reminded me of the “disco smile” (hollowed out mids),
but I chalked that up to overly consumer-friendly default EQ
settings. Maybe it can be improved.</p>

<p>The other device was similarly well functioning. I still could not
believe my luck. Why would anyone throw out these excellent
Bluetooth-enabled, powered speakers? They are doing such a great job!</p>

<p>Being in the market for a couple high-end speakers, I started to
fantasize about making a stereo pair out of these two.  Is that even
possible? Probably not out of the box, as I could only
Bluetooth-connect one at a time with the computer.  While listening to
a video, I also learned that the speaker added some 300ms of delay
(compared to my wired headphones), which could be compensated, but was
going to be a pain nevertheless. I had no idea if it came from the
Bluetooth link or further processing in the “smart” speaker.  Probably
both. And any small differences between the latencies of two devices
would certainly destroy the stereo imaging, if I ever got that to
work…</p>

<p>Then the bland female voice suddenly came in over the music again,
loud and clear: <em>«CONNECTION UNSUCCESSFUL. CHECK YOUR APP FOR
INSTRUCTIONS AND TRY AGAIN.»</em> Oh my poor ears! And there goes my
listening experience!  <em>Don’t you dare open your filthy mouth again!</em></p>

<p>At that moment I knew I was not into <em>smart speakers</em>. Or at least not
into the smartness. The speakers were good. Oh, they were excellent!
But they had to be <em>de-smarted</em>. Preferably with a single, dumb,
analog RCA line input on their backs, so nobody but me gets to decide
over the program material. That way I could also drive them as a
stereo pair. No Bluetooth, no latency, no female robot overlord, just
a good old-fashioned line input!</p>

<p>Seems like a modest ask. Can we have it? Well, time to look inside!</p>

<h2 id="inside-the-uxbridge">Inside the Uxbridge</h2>

<p>Opening the enclosure by removing the backplate is a matter of pulling
the six ordinary Phillips screws on the back. Then, the box can be
pried open with some thin lever (screwdriver edge) – it fits
snugly and is made even tighter with some air-tight foam.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/original-innards.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/original-innards-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Original innards (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>The main electronics is on a board fastened to the back; it receives
power from a separate PSU hidden under the woofer via the big JST plug
(disconnected in the photo); the two smaller (connected) JST plugs
connect to the woofer and tweeter (red and white, respectively). There
are a couple flexible flat cables connecting to auxiliary boards
hosting the volume and tone controls (plus the mics and push-buttons)
on the top, and four RGB LEDs at the bottom of the front plate. I had
to disconnect some of these, as well as the JST power plug, so as to
take the above photo.</p>

<p>The main board comes with a smaller daughter board with <em>Linkplay</em>
written on it. This is supposedly an <a href="https://w.dspconcepts.com/reference-designs/amlogic-a113x-smart-speaker">OEM
module</a>
for wireless connectivity and the “smarts” of the speaker: it contains
an Amlogic A113X SoC, memory chips plus wireless module. The daughter
board slides into an edge connector (not entirely unlike PCIe) on the
main board. From the radio module, wires run off to two rectangular
patch antennas fastened near opposite upper corners of the backplane.
All wiring is covered in foam, and apparent care has been taken to
make the enclosure air-tight.</p>

<p>The audio amplifier itself is built around an ESMT AD85050. This
48-pin device is apparently a knock-off of <a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TAS5727">some class D power
amplifiers</a>, with rather <a href="http://www.micro-bridge.com/data/ESMT/AD85050.pdf">scarce
documentation</a> of
its own. It is employed in a two channel configuration, with separate
power amplifiers dedicated to both drivers. These, both the tweeter
and the woofer, measure close to 4Ω.</p>

<p>Looking at the circuit boards in some detail (and using a connectivity
checker), it becomes apparent that the I<sup>2</sup>C control, the
I<sup>2</sup>S two-channel digital audio stream and the 3.3V power all
come from the daughter board. Which, unfortunately, is also the source
of that vexing female robot commander voice.</p>

<p>Can we use the electronics? That depends on whether we are able to
oust the resident voice of terror, and get hold of an analog input.
Initially, I was hopeful, and felt that discarding everything between
the PSU and the speakers, including a ready-made power amp already
coupled to the speakers, would be a waste. As a first experiment, I
removed the daughter board.  Nothing worked – but in light of my
earlier findings, I was not surprised. So then, assuming I cut the
I<sup>2</sup>S lines to mute the damn robot, would it be possible to
somehow inject an analog input to the (otherwise digital) amp?</p>

<p>With an “I’m feeling lucky” attitude, I somehow managed to solder some
very thin wires connecting to the ESMT chip’s LINP, LINN and AGND
lines in the hope of finding out. In case you were wondering, these
are supposed to act as analog differential inputs for the power
amplifier’s “left” channel (non-inverting and inverting, plus analog
ground). As a first step, I tried asymetrically driving LINP (with
LINN tied to ground). Nothing came out of the speaker; evidently,
there is ample built-in fault-protection and shutdown mechanisms built
into the ESMT chip to combat such abuse.</p>

<p>Next, using an op-amp on a breadboard, I attached a very temporary
symmetrical driving circuit on the inputs. This did the trick of
making sound come out, and it did sound pretty good (no obvious noise,
distortion or interference), except that only the woofer was driven.
Ah, of course! The tweeter is wired to the other (“right”) channel! So
I would need to supply <em>two</em> symmetrical audio inputs to drive this
amp.  These would preferably be driven by an active loudspeaker filter
circuit that limits the frequency range for each driver.</p>

<p>Considering the need for so many “patch” wires and the prospect of
stuffing additional electronics into an already cramped box, this
route seemed less than optimal. I also briefly played with the thought
of keeping the digital-input amplifier; capturing the configuration
sent to it via I<sup>2</sup>C and duplicating that from some
microcontroller; then coming up with some way to drive the
I<sup>2</sup>S digital audio input… somehow. Replace the daughter
board? But too many unknowns remained, and I felt constrained by
choices already made by others.</p>

<h2 id="going-all-in">Going all-in</h2>

<p>At the same time, the initially dismissed prospect of completely
replacing the electronics started to look attractive. If I need to
build a bunch of active filter circuits to separate the frequency
bands <em>before</em> the power amps, sure I can add two power amps to that
lot… and throw out the existing board! Which is not especially
small, so there is plenty of real estate for its replacement.</p>

<p>And on the plus side, I could get rid of the idle power consumption of
a full-blown embedded computer system (complete with Bluetooth/WiFi
radio, so less EM pollution and potential interference), and less
dissipated heat (I could sense the closed back of the idling Uxbridge
get warm after half an hour or so). What’s not to like?</p>

<p>So let’s establish some requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The PSU supplies 18V DC. The whole system needs to be single-supply.</li>
  <li>Analog RCA line input on the back. Air-tight construction.</li>
  <li>Active pre-amp filter with the customary crossover of about
2&nbsp;kHz.</li>
  <li>Possibly some further audio equalization / speaker compensation.</li>
  <li>Two power amplifiers, one for the woofer and one for the tweeter.</li>
  <li>Output impedance (both amps): 4Ω.</li>
  <li>Non-obvious thermal constraints: dissipation in a hermetically
sealed box…?</li>
  <li>Obvious mechanical constraints (board size and JST connectors).</li>
</ul>

<p>The first step in the circuit design (with the constraints on DC power
input and speaker impedance set in place) was to find a suitable power
amplifier architecture with actual, existing components. After very
little searching, I settled on the
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/contrib/LM1875.pdf">LM1875T</a>
which seemed like a safe bet and promised high-end audio quality.  The
datasheet even has a reference circuit for single-supply operation.</p>

<p>Next, I decided on the crossover filters. Again, after a little
reading up on this subject, I found no reason to search beyond the
ubiquitous 4-th order
<a href="https://linkwitzlab.com/filters.htm">Linkwitz-Riley</a> filter
architecture (two cascaded, identical Sallen-Key low-pass or high-pass
filters to provide a steepness of 24&nbsp;dB/octave) with the
theoretical advantage of the channels neatly summing to 0&nbsp;dB (in
phase) throughout the crossover range.</p>

<p>What op-amp to use? I picked the
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/contrib/LM833.pdf">LM833</a>,
not too expensive but quite capable with its 15&nbsp;MHz
gain-bandwidth, 7&nbsp;V/μs slew rate and 4.5&nbsp;nV/√Hz
voltage noise. This is certainly a low noise, high speed op-amp when
targeting the audio range, and as it is a dual op-amp, we can build a
complete Linkwitz-Riley high-pass or low-pass filter out of a single
piece.</p>

<h2 id="the-complete-circuit">The complete circuit</h2>

<p>At this point, there is nothing left to do but <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/rest.jpg">draw the rest of the
fucking owl</a>, so that is exactly
what I did. The complete schematic is available as a
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/schematic.pdf">PDF</a>;
below I will highlight the functional blocks one by one.</p>

<p>At all times, keep in mind that we are building an analog circuit with
op-amps, customarily fed with symmetrical supplies (with ground in the
middle). Due to the existing power supply, we need to make the whole
thing run from a single supply with respect to ground, and that is not
how these circuits are usually drawn. It’s a technical detail, but an
important one!</p>

<p>For this exact reason, let’s start with the virtual grounds for
supporting single supply operation:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-vgnd.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-vgnd-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Virtual ground circuitry (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>We could be more fancy and use an active device (a dedicated
“rail-splitter” like the
<a href="https://www.ti.com/product/TLE2426">TLE2426</a>, or just a regular
op-amp) to lower the source impedances driving these grounds, but in
practice, given the tiny loads, a well bypassed, moderate impedance
source will do just fine. With a non-obvious CAVEAT: For preserving
adequate separation between the woofer and tweeter signal paths (or,
rather, preventing cross-talk via the virtual ground), we use two
separate virtual grounds, each dedicated to one signal path.</p>

<p>The single power rail VCC itself comes directly from the PSU connector
J1; it supplies the three op-amps, each decoupled with a 100&nbsp;nF
poly capacitor:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Power input; op-amp supply &amp; decoupling (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>These are sort of trivial details, and are customarily omitted when
presenting analog circuits. It is important not to forget about
them. With these out of the way, let’s look at the meatier parts of
the circuit.</p>

<h2 id="active-filters">Active filters</h2>

<p>The incoming signal is AC-coupled into the circuit via C1, after which
R1 and R2 set the DC level to mid-supply (our virtual ground) for the
signal to ride from there on. C2, together with R3 and the source
impedance driving the line input, forms a first-order low-pass filter
(f<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;≈&nbsp;50&nbsp;kHz assuming a source
impedance of 600&nbsp;Ω) to eliminate any RF interference just
before the signal reaches the input follower U1A, which drives the
rest of the filter circuits with low impedance.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-filters.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-filters-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Input buffer &amp; active filter schematics (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>From here, the signal feeds two downstream signal paths. The upper
one, built around U2B and U2A, consists of two cascaded Sallen-Key
high-pass filters forming a 4-th order Linkwitz-Riley high-pass with
24&nbsp;dB/octave steepness below its corner frequency. The passive
component values are optimized to allow realisation with uniform
values of commonly available high-quality polymer capacitors, and
relatively small-value resistors in order to keep thermal noise
contributions as low as feasible. This path ends in the signal TWR_IN,
driving the tweeter’s power amplifier.</p>

<p>The lower signal path begins with a low-shelving filter around U1B,
augmented with the divider-degenerating capacitor C7 to roll off DC
response to unity. The purpose of this shelving filter is to provide
emphasis towards the woofer’s lower end, in order to compensate its
inevitable rolloff. The component values are the result of simulation
and real-world tuning (as described below).</p>

<p>The bass-enhanced signal then goes through a Linkwitz-Riley low-pass
filter (around U3A and U3B), a close counterpart to the tweeter HPF.
Component values were guided by the same optimization criteria. The
LPF comes last so as to attenuate the noise of preceding stages. The
resulting signal WFR_IN drives the woofer’s power amplifier.</p>

<p>Note the nodes labeled VGNDT on R5 and R7: these are tied to a virtual
ground dedicated to tweeter-side circuitry, set at half-supply.  This
ensures correct single-supply operation of U2B and U2A, as well as
correct DC level on TWR_IN. In the woofer path, the equivalent circuit
points can be tied to the real ground, as the DC level on the “cold”
side of the capacitors C10 and C12 has no influence on the filter’s
operation. The DC level on WFR_IN is determined by the R1/R2 divider
right at the input; the whole signal path up to WFR_IN is DC-coupled
(with a DC transfer of unity) from there.</p>

<h3 id="spice-simulation">SPICE simulation</h3>

<p>To validate the above circuit, I first built a simulation model in the
excellent <a href="https://xschem.sourceforge.io/index.html">XSchem</a>, and
asked <a href="https://ngspice.sourceforge.io/">ngspice</a> to compute the
frequency and phase response on both outputs.</p>

<p><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/spice-ac.png" alt=""><br>
<em>AC simulation: magnitude and phase response of filter outputs</em></p>

<p>The (electrical) crossover frequency is 2&nbsp;kHz, with some slight
bump in the summed output (as evidenced by each channel being a bit
over -6&nbsp;dB). The <em>real</em> (acoustical) response will, however, also
be affected by driver response. According to listening tests, the
woofer’s high-frequency roll-off roughly compensates the “electrical”
bump in the crossover area.</p>

<p>What about the phase difference between the woofer and tweeter signal
paths? According to SPICE, at the crossover frequency the tweeter
output phase lags the woofer output by ~19°. That is equivalent to a
delay of 19/360 times one cycle duration at 2&nbsp;kHz, which works
out to around 26&nbsp;μs. Factoring in the speed of sound
(340&nbsp;m/s), this (electronic) delay is equivalent to an acoustic
propagation path difference of about 9&nbsp;mm.</p>

<p>In other words, the difference in signal propagation across the two
filters is equivalent to the tweeter being 9&nbsp;mm farther away from
the listener than the woofer. In reality, the tweeter is going to be a
bit closer to the listener, because the speakers will land on a table
below head height, and the tweeter is mounted higher up in the
enclosure. The exact geometry can vary quite a bit, but the geometric
path difference will be in the ballpark – <em>but with opposite
sign!</em></p>

<p>As a consequence, the filter delay does not pose a problem; on the
contrary, it might actually help the drivers’ sound waves arrive
perfectly in-phase around the crossover frequency. Given the inexact
nature of this problem (unknown variations in driver characteristics,
plus the uncontrolled acoustic environment), we won’t bother with a
delay compensator (allpass filter). It’s bound to be close to
“perfect” anyway.</p>

<h2 id="power-amplifiers">Power amplifiers</h2>

<p>The power amps for the tweeter and woofer are principally identical,
themselves closely following the single supply reference circuit in
the
<a href="https://git.hq.sig7.se/muxbridge-biamp.git/blob_plain/HEAD:/doc/contrib/LM1875.pdf">LM1875T</a>
datasheet. The voltage gain is set to 10 (via R16/R15 and R20/R19),
the lowest gain with guaranteed stability. A higher gain is not
desired, because the line input would then become overly sensitive
(its useful range, given the practical limitations on output volume,
would be too low).</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power-amp.png"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/schematic-power-amp-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Power amplifier schematics (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<p>Between the amps, only capacitors differ in two positions. In both
cases, we exploit the fact that the tweeter amp, given its useful
frequency range, can get away with higher corner frequencies. The
feedback loop degeneration caps C15 and C20 roll off the gain to unity
at DC; here, C15 can be made significantly smaller than its
counterpart.  Similarly, the output coupling (DC-blocking) capacitors
C17 and C22 form high-pass filters together with the load impedance,
where we can again get away with a much higher corner frequency
(smaller capacitance) in the tweeter amp. We do not max out this
possibility (see the respective f<sub>c</sub> annotations), only to
the extent that a significantly cheaper and smaller component can be
used.  We choose high-quality capacitors specifically intended for
audio applications.</p>

<p>If you looked real close, you might have noticed one more discrepancy
across the amps: opposite polarities of output connectors J3 and J4.
That’s right, and reflect the fact that the Uxbridge driver cables
have their JST connectors crimped with opposite polarities; however,
both our amps are “straight” so one of them needs to have its output
polarity reversed.</p>

<p>What kind of output power can we expect? The PSU just clears the lower
end of the LM1875 supply range, so it’s going to be on the low
end. The low driver impedance (4Ω) certainly helps a bit.
Between the datasheet and some back of the envelope calculations, I
expect about 5W of peak output power per driver (in practice, this
applies to the woofer only; the tweeter will always be driven with
much less power).  That might seem low, but in practice, it is plenty
for near-field listening in a quiet room. Thankfully, the low supply
voltage also keeps dissipation down – a couple watts at most,
and a mere fraction of a watt idling.</p>

<h2 id="prototyping-and-tuning">Prototyping and tuning</h2>

<p>To validate the design in actual reality, I built a breadboard version
of the complete circuit, from line input to the actual speakers. To
ferret out any possible incompatibility, I powered it from the actual
Uxbridge PSU removed from one of the units.  This unit became my test
harness: I removed the original electronics, extended the speaker
wires and led them out via a small hole on the backplane (left in
place of the Bluetooth button). I fastened the backplane in place and
did my best to close the hole (with speaker wires protruding) using
some tape. This way I could evaluate circuit performance with the real
(non-ideal) speaker loads, together with real acoustics, and tune the
filters after listening to music and pure sine tones. I was also able
to A/B test, going back and forth between my circuit driving the
prepared (closed) enclosure and the other complete, intact Uxbridge
unit via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>I still haven’t built my first real DDS VFO / signal generator
instrument (it’s in the pipeline, should be complete any year now…).
For the time being, I reached for a “virtual” one by playing sine
frequencies via online tone generators (<a href="https://tonegen.net/">first</a>,
<a href="https://onlinetonegenerator.com/frequency-sweep-generator.html">second</a>).
I used them to establish general sanity, verify driver polarities, and
equalize levels through the crossover range. I also tuned the woofer
rolloff compensation filter with this method; I got satisfactory
results down to about 35&nbsp;Hz, which is on par with the original
unit. The upper end? Limited by my hearing abilities… N.B.: All
tuning and fiddling is already reflected in the circuits presented
above.</p>

<p>Speaking of A/B tests: I also listened to lots of music, mostly
assorted tracks and albums I enjoy and have been listening to all my
life across a wide range of equipment and acoustic environments. I
carefully compared the sound of the speakers; in a couple days, I
reached the point where I preferred the sound of the new circuit. I
believe it gives a flatter, more precise response especially in the
midrange, where the original Uxbridge sounded hollow. I’m no fan of
the “disco smile”; I prefer the mid to have some real bite.</p>

<p>Another reason I wanted a full prototype was to get a grip on the
thermal situation. Having done those back of the envelope estimates, I
was still quite uncertain about the amount of heat I could expect the
LM1875’s to dissipate, and wanted to gauge heatsink temperatures (with
the scientific “finger method”) both while idle and with realistic
listening volumes. My estimates were validated; the TO-220 heating
fins I planned for (and prototyped with) only got seriously warm at a
loudness level I could not hope to sustain without creating “social
problems”. Good, because there is not much point in putting a bigger
heatsink into the air-tight enclosure…</p>

<p>Apart from the sorry fact that I was listening in mono (and in a bad
way: only hearing one of the stereo channels!), everything seemed
rather promising. Now comes the part which is, by now, a routine job:
casting the circuit into permanent form by designing a professional
PCB.</p>

<h2 id="pcb-design">PCB design</h2>

<p>This is a small-ish analog circuit, and we have plenty of real estate!
We only need to match board size and hole patterns. We could go
high-tech and use SMT components, and easily reduce the PCB area by a
factor of two… but why bother?  All the components are readily
available, plugged into the breadboard. I would prefer to use them.</p>

<p>The complexity of this design is so low that the board is, in effect,
single layer. Almost all wiring is on the component side, the rest of
which is filled with a ground plane. The solder side is a complete
ground plane (except a single, short copper bridge connecting VCC
between C18 and C19). This double-sided, massive ground plane
contributes to the low noise and high performance of this amplifier.
A bunch of thermal vias under the heatsinks help the PCB take its part
in spreading and dissipating heat.</p>

<p>The dimensions are about half of the original panel – call me a
dinosaur, but I see no need to <a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/2024/03/SMT-and-the-ultimate-LCD-SPI-interface">design with
SMT</a> (requiring a
stencil mask for applying the paste) to make it even smaller!</p>

<p>Below, a side-by-side comparison of the new dumb analog dinosaur and
the original, fully digital smart technology:</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/panels-new-old.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/panels-new-old-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>
<em>Electronics, new vs. old (click to enlarge)</em></p>

<h2 id="connectors-and-mechanics">Connectors and mechanics</h2>

<p>Given the already crimped plugs on the PSU and speaker cables, I
naturally wanted to keep the connectors on the new panel identical.
The DC power connector was easily identified as JST-VH, and I had no
trouble buying it. On the other hand, it took me some time to identify
the speaker connectors as JST-XA. Worse, my local parts store did not
carry it. The dimensions of the XA are rather similar to the more
common JST-XH, except for the pin spacing (2.5 vs. 2.54&nbsp;mm, not a
big deal on a 2-pin connector). A more important detail is that the XH
lacks the XA’s locking mechanism.  In the end, I prototyped with XH
(mating with the XA counterparts on the speaker wires). Eventually, I
de-soldered the XA sockets from the original boards so I could solder
them into my PCBs.</p>

<p>For the audio input, I picked a 2-pin JST-PH connector (2&nbsp;mm
pitch), using a matching plug with a pre-crimped short pair of wires.
The bare ends were soldered to the female panel-mount RCA connector
conveniently fastened into the backplane hole
(⌀&nbsp;=&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;mm) formerly occupied by the Bluetooth
button. The back of the RCA connector was filled with hot glue to make
it air-tight.</p>

<p>When the time has come to assemble my born-again speakers, it became
clear that there was some obstacle preventing the back side from
settling into place. At first, I feared the biggest capacitor (C22)
colliding with the woofer magnet (during the design process, I
convinced myself there was enough clearance, but now got the scare
– my 3D skills suck!).  Finally, it turned out that omitting the
small cut-out on the board outline (visible on the left edge of the
original panel) was a mistake. That space was taken by the plastic
stem receiving the middle-left Phillips screw (looking from behind the
box). The issue is clearly visible in the below photo (look at the
middle hole along the left edge):</p>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/backplane-assembly.jpg"><img src="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/backplane-assembly-thumb.jpg" alt=""></a><br>

<p><a href="https://tomscii.sig7.se/images/muxbridge-biamp/backplane-assembly-2.jpg">Another image</a> of
the second unit, exhibiting the same issue.</p>

<p>Well, out with the rasping set! I managed to remove just enough
material (about 2&nbsp;mm) from the plastic stem down to the required
depth to make space for the PCB edge. Plastic filings carefully
vacuumed out of the box. Success, with footnotes (there are <em>always</em>
footnotes)!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the past several weeks, I listened and re-listened to many of my
long-time favourite albums and all I can say is, I absolutely love the
sound of this pair of odd socks!  The listening experience is on par
with, or easily surpasses, any stereo I ever had (and I’ve had a few).
Even though I don’t have the means to measure, in the first hours of
listening I felt a dramatic step up in fidelity from the original
Uxbridge. I am convinced that tuning the active filters with the
speakers in the loop has given me a superior frequency response, and
the linear power amps at low power are likely to have less noise and
distortion. The sharp stereo imaging is another sign of high fidelity.
The fact that I got these “from the bin” for free (at least the
enclosures, power supplies and drivers) gives me a smile each time I
turn them on.</p>

<p>It appears that analog electronics in the audio range is more or less
a solved problem: discounting the obvious extremities of high power
(hundreds of watts) or really miniscule signal levels (microvolts), it
is not too difficult to create, with contemporary semiconductors, a
simple circuit charting seriously audiophile territory!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>The death of Bram Moolenaar, <a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>
founder and benevolent dictator for life (BDFL), in 2023 sent a shock
through the community, and raised concern about the future of the
project. At <a href="https://vimconf.org/">VimConf</a> 2024 in
November, current Vim maintainer Christian Brabandt delivered a
keynote on "<q>the new Vim project</q>" that detailed how the
community has reorganized itself to continue maintaining Vim and what
the future looks like.</p> <h4>Vim after Bram</h4>

<p>Brabandt began with his history with Vim: he has been involved in
Vim since&nbsp;2006, and said his first commit to the project was made
in the&nbsp;7.0/7.1 days (sometime around 2006). He started by
contributing small patches and fixes, and then contributed larger
features such as the <a href="https://vimhelp.org/visual.txt.html#gn"><tt>gn</tt> and
<tt>gN</tt> commands</a>, which combine searching and visual-mode
selection, improved cryptographic support using <a href="https://doc.libsodium.org/"><tt>libsodium</tt></a>, 
maintained the Vim <a href="https://appimage.org/">AppImage</a>, and
more. He said he became less active in the project around 2022 due to
personal and work-related reasons.</p>

<p>That changed in August&nbsp;2023, when
Moolenaar <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/940551/">passed
away</a>. Moolenaar had been the maintainer of Vim for more than&nbsp;30
years; while he had added Brabandt and Ken Takata as
co-maintainers of Vim in the years before, most development still
flowed through him. With his death, a considerable amount of
knowledge was lost—but Brabandt and others stepped up to keep the
project alive.</p>

<blockquote>
<b>No slop, all substance: subscribe to LWN today</b>

</p></blockquote>


<p>Moolenaar was the only owner of the Vim GitHub organization at the
time, so only his account could change certain
settings. Initially, contributors tried to use the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/content/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-deceased-user-policy.md">deceased
user policy</a> to add owners to the organization. That was quite an
involved process, and it soon became apparent that the end result
would be the deactivation of Moolenaar's account. Having Moolenaar's
account be accessible by his family was important, so they abandoned
that approach, and instead the family granted access to it as needed
for organizational changes.</p>

<p>Charles Campbell (known as "<a href="http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html">Dr Chip</a>"), a
Vim contributor for more than&nbsp;25 years also decided to retire
soon after Moolenaar's death. His departure was followed by an
expansion of the team of maintainers, as Yegappan Lakshmanan joined
it, with Dominique Pellé, Doug Kearns, and GitHub users "glepnir",
"mattn", and "zeertzjq" joining soon after.</p>

<h4>More than just the source code</h4>

<p>He stressed that maintaining Vim is not just about the source
code. There are quite a few other things to be managed, such as the
Vim web site, FTP server, security disclosures, Vim communities on
other sites such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/">Reddit</a> and
<a href="https://vi.stackexchange.com/">Stack Exchange</a>, and
more.</p>

<p>Vim's site needed work. The design, and most of the code,
had been unchanged for quite a while—until 2023, it was based on
PHP&nbsp;5. In recent times, there had been a few occasions where the
web site was unstable, and so he started looking for a new host
in&nbsp;2024. The move involved an upgrade to PHP&nbsp;8, for which
some of the code had to be rewritten. Brabandt thanked Mark
Schöchlin, who stepped up to take care of all this.</p>

<p>He acknowledged that the design has been pretty much unchanged
since&nbsp;2001, doesn't look modern, and can be scary to new
users. There has been some work on redesigning it, but the first
attempt hasn't been that successful. He prioritizes consistency and
does not wish to scare away longtime users.</p>

<p>DNS was also troublesome—the <tt>vim.org</tt>
domain was managed by Stefan Zehl, but Moolenaar also owned a number
of other domains such as <tt>vim8.org</tt>, <tt>vim9.org</tt>,
etc. Thankfully, SSL certificates were already managed using Let's
Encrypt, so Brabandt had no problems there. Several email addresses, such as
<tt>bram@vim.org</tt>, <tt>bugs@vim.org</tt>, etc., were
forwarded to Moolenaar's personal email; those have since been updated
to point to Brabandt's address instead. The FTP server was hosted by
<a href="https://nluug.nl/">NLUUG</a>, but he decided to retire
it and says that he hasn't received any complaints so far.</p>

<h4>ICCF Holland</h4>

<p>As readers might know, Vim is <a href="https://vimhelp.org/uganda.txt.html#license">charityware</a>,
and the charity of choice is <a href="https://iccf-holland.org/">ICCF
Holland</a>, founded by Moolenaar. Brabandt said that the ICCF is very
much alive, and plans to reorganize and restructure itself. Quite a
few users started donating after Moolenaar's passing, and
in&nbsp;2023, it raised about €90,000. The project plans to continue
to work with ICCF and doesn't want to change ICCF's association with
Vim. He noted that there is no sponsorship for the maintainers, all of
whom are working for free. Traditionally, all money raised has been
given to the ICCF and he has no plans to change that. Brabandt
said he earns enough from his job that he doesn't need assistance to
work on Vim, so he's happy to let all donations go to ICCF.</p>

<p>As an incentive to donate, Moolenaar had allowed people who donated
to ICCF to vote on Vim feature requests. Donors to the ICCF could link
to their Vim.org account when donating, and then vote on
features. This is one aspect that he no longer sees a need for,
now that issues and enhancements are discussed on GitHub, and so has
decided to shut this down. Linking the accounts and donations was also
not easy for Brabandt—he was not sure how Moolenaar did this in
the past.</p>

<h4>Communication channels</h4>

<p>He also talked about the community centered around the Vim
mailing lists, which are hosted on Google Groups. In May&nbsp;2024,
he <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/vim_use/c/skARx2yAEWc/m/U69NrKAgAgAJ">received
an automated message</a> from Google informing him that all
content from the vim-dev list had been blocked due to spam or
malware. This caused a fair bit of trouble, and while it was
restored in around a day or so, he still does not know what the
exact problem was. There has been some consideration of self-hosting the
list, but one drawback is that everyone would have to sign up
again. The mailing list is no longer that active now, with more of the
community conversations happening on Reddit or Stack Exchange.</p>

<p>Security reporting had to be addressed as well. A couple of years
ago, people were reporting issues on <a href="https://huntr.com/repos/vim/vim">the Huntr platform</a>. There
were quite a few open issues which have since been taken care
of. Huntr was acquired by another company in&nbsp;2023, which
refocused it entirely on AI and shut down general open-source
vulnerability reporting.</p>

<p>Now, Vim is accepting security reports via email or <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/security">GitHub</a>, and publishing
vulnerabilities via GitHub security advisories. There is a
private mailing list for as-yet unpublished security issues, and
emails are forwarded to all maintainers. Brabandt has started adding a
<tt>[security]</tt> tag to commit messages for marking security fixes,
and such commits are announced on the <tt>oss-security</tt> list (the
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/ZwKwrSltz1Zj7wCR@256bit.org">most
recent</a> being from October) and
to maintainers of distribution packages.</p>

<h4>Maintenance mode</h4>

<p>Brabandt then showed the contribution graph, to demonstrate that
development did not stop after Moolenaar passed away. There was a
slowdown as Moolenaar's health deteriorated, and then a spike as
he cleaned up the open pull requests (PRs). <a href="https://www.vim.org/vim-9.1-released.php">Version&nbsp;9.1</a>,
dedicated to Moolenaar, was released on
January&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2024—about four months after his
passing.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;9.1 release included improvements to <a href="https://vimhelp.org/textprop.txt.html#virtual-text">virtual text</a> (which
enables completion suggestions and such to appear in the
editing area, while not being part of the actual text), smooth
scrolling, and OpenVMS support. After&nbsp;9.1, he started adding
more potentially controversial changes, such as support
for <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/">the
XDG base directory specification</a>. Now Vim does not need to litter
your top-level home directory: <tt>~/.vimrc</tt>
or
<tt>~/.vim/vimrc</tt> still work, but <a href="https://vimhelp.org/starting.txt.html#xdg-vimrc"><tt>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vim/vimrc</tt></a>
will now work if neither of the above are present. Another such
change is Wayland support. It is not complete yet, and he says he is
not sure whether remaining problems with clipboard support are Vim bugs or 
Wayland ones.</p>

<p>As he went through the backlog of PRs, he started developing
a policy for merging PRs, prioritizing the need to test things well.
Tests are now running with continuous integration (CI). He said that
it's also important to have good documentation.</p>

<p>Vim has interfaces to quite a few languages, including
Python&nbsp;2 and&nbsp;3, Ruby, Lua, Tcl, and MzScheme. But Brabandt
isn't sure which of these are really needed these days. For example,
Python&nbsp;2, Tcl, and MzScheme (which does not build
with the latest version of the language) might need to be retired to
reduce the maintenance burden. Other areas to improve include the GUI
(GTK&nbsp;4 has been around for a while, <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/issues/8038">but Vim does not use
it</a> yet), support for advanced terminal features, and better spell
checking (which has largely remained unchanged since
Vim&nbsp;7). Support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree-sitter_%28parser_generator%29">tree-sitter</a>
parser generator is wished-for, but it is controversial, and he does not see it coming to Vim soon.</p>

<p>He knows there have been some significant changes in Neovim, but
he's not sure how many of those can come to Vim. There have been small
changes in Vim, but for major changes, you need community support. He
does not want to make backward-incompatible changes and is quite
hesitant to merge changes that might break things. He said he has to
keep in the mind the whole picture, especially the expectations of
users, when dealing with PRs. Currently, he said that Vim is
more-or-less in maintenance mode.</p>

<p>He said he has created an internal repository to keep track of
stakeholders and to ensure that if something were to happen to him,
other maintainers could pick up where he left off.</p>

<p>Brabandt recommended that those new to the project 
start by making small contributions and becoming familiar with
the codebase. He had some pointers for developers. He said it is
important to use a defensive style with C to ensure that new bugs
aren't being introduced. One should use <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/">Coverity</a>, a static-analysis
tool, to scan for defects. Some parts of the Vim codebase are complex,
he said, and need to be refactored into more manageable units if
possible.</p>

<p>Maintaining Vim is a full-time job, he said, and it is not only
about maintaining the code, but also the community—managing
expectations and listening to users' needs. He has to understand the
community: what does it want Vim to be? An IDE? Bug-for-bug
compatibility with old Vim? How can we
make <a href="https://vimhelp.org/vim9.txt.html#Vim9-script">Vim9 script</a>, the
new Vim scripting language, more widely used? How can we ensure that the
Vim community remains healthy? He ended his talk by thanking all
the Vim contributors and then took a few questions.</p>

<h4>Questions</h4>

<p>One audience member asked about the difference between Vim and
Neovim's maintenance model. Since most PRs are still merged by
Brabandt, would that make him the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life">BDFL</a> for Vim?</p>

<p>Brabandt emphatically denied being a BDFL. Currently, he merges
most changes because the version number has to be incremented with
each change, so multiple people merging can introduce
conflicts. However, when he was on vacation, he handed over the main
maintainership to Lakshmanan. He emphasized that it's a community
project, and he listens to the community before making decisions. It
just happens that at this time the other maintainers don't want to
merge changes themselves and instead defer to Brabandt, which is fine
with him.</p>

<p>Another member of the audience wondered about language barriers,
since there are many Japanese members of the Vim community as well as
many languages in Europe, etc. Brabandt answered that, as an
international project, the primary language for working on Vim is
English. He also noted that it is easier these days to collaborate
across languages thanks to ChatGPT and translation tools, but it still
happens that some users do not communicate in English well, and that
makes it harder to understand their needs.</p>

<h4>The rest of VimConf 2024</h4>

<p>VimConf was <a href="https://vimconf.org/2013/">first held in&nbsp;2013</a> by the
Japanese Vim user group <a href="https://vim-jp.org/">vim-jp</a>. Since then, the group has organized
it every year, until&nbsp;2020 when VimConf was canceled due to COVID.
After a hiatus, it resumed in&nbsp;2023 with a scaled-down version. The
full-fledged edition returned to Akihabara, Tokyo on
November&nbsp;23,&nbsp;2024.</p>

<p>Even though most of the organizers and
attendees are Japanese, VimConf strives to be welcoming to
all. Presentation materials are expected to be in English, and live
translation is provided in both Japanese and English for keynotes and
regular presentations, except for lightning talks. PDFs for the talks
are available on <a href="https://vimconf.org/2024/">VimConf's
website</a>, and all of the talks are now on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx8bw5NQypsmPvVXXRVmF7bvCjFKv1MuN">YouTube</a>.</p><br clear="all"><table>

    <div><p>I remember vividly Jon Bentley's first Algorithms lecture at CMU, where he asked all of us incoming Ph.D. students to write a binary search, and then dissected one of our implementations in front of the class. Of course it was broken, as were most of our implementations. This made a real impression on me, as did the treatment of this material in his wonderful <em>Programming Pearls</em> (Addison-Wesley, 1986; Second Edition, 2000). The key lesson was to carefully consider the invariants in your programs.</p><p>Fast forward to 2006. I was shocked to learn that the binary search program that Bentley proved correct and subsequently tested in Chapter 5 of <em>Programming Pearls</em> contains a bug. Once I tell you what it is, you will understand why it escaped detection for two decades. Lest you think I'm picking on Bentley, let me tell you how I discovered the bug: The version of binary search that I wrote for the JDK contained the same bug. It was reported to Sun recently when it broke someone's program, after lying in wait for nine years or so.</p><p>So what's the bug? Here's a standard binary search, in Java. (It's one that I wrote for the <code>java.util.Arrays</code>):</p></div>
<pre>1:     public static int binarySearch(int[] a, int key) {<br>2:         int low = 0;<br>3:         int high = a.length - 1;<br>4:<br>5:         while (low &lt;= high) {<br>6:             int mid = (low + high) / 2;<br>7:             int midVal = a[mid];<br>8:<br>9:             if (midVal &lt; key)<br>10:                 low = mid + 1<br>11:             else if (midVal &gt; key)<br>12:                 high = mid - 1;<br>13:             else<br>14:                 return mid; // key found<br>15:         }<br>16:         return -(low + 1);  // key not found.<br>17:     }</pre>
<p><br>The bug is in this line:</p>
<pre> 6:             int mid =(low + high) / 2;</pre>
<div><p>In <em>Programming Pearls</em> Bentley says that the analogous line "sets m to the average of l and u, truncated down to the nearest integer." On the face of it, this assertion might appear correct, but it fails for large values of the <code>int</code> variables <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>. Specifically, it fails if the sum of <code>low</code> and <code>high</code> is greater than the maximum positive <code>int</code> value (2<sup>31</sup> - 1). The sum overflows to a negative value, and the value stays negative when divided by two. In C this causes an array index out of bounds with unpredictable results. In Java, it throws <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</p><p>This bug can manifest itself for arrays whose length (in elements) is 2<sup>30</sup> or greater (roughly a billion elements). This was inconceivable back in the '80s, when <em>Programming Pearls</em> was written, but it is common these days at Google and other places. In <em>Programming Pearls</em>, Bentley says "While the first binary search was published in 1946, the first binary search that works correctly for all values of <span>n</span> did not appear until 1962." The truth is, very few correct versions have ever been published, at least in mainstream programming languages.</p><p>So what's the best way to fix the bug? Here's one way:</p></div>
<pre> 6:             int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);</pre>
<p><br>Probably faster, and arguably as clear is:</p>
<pre> 6:             int mid = (low + high) &gt;&gt;&gt; 1;</pre>
<p><br>In C and C++ (where you don't have the <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> operator), you can do this:</p>
<pre> 6:             mid = ((unsigned int)low + (unsigned int)high)) &gt;&gt; 1;</pre>
<div><p>And now we <em>know</em> the binary search is bug-free, right? Well, we strongly suspect so, but we don't know. It is not sufficient merely to prove a program correct; you have to test it too. Moreover, to be really certain that a program is correct, you have to test it for all possible input values, but this is seldom feasible. With concurrent programs, it's even worse: You have to test for all internal states, which is, for all practical purposes, impossible.</p><p>The binary-search bug applies equally to mergesort, and to other divide-and-conquer algorithms. If you have any code that implements one of these algorithms, fix it now before it blows up. The general lesson that I take away from this bug is humility: It is hard to write even the smallest piece of code correctly, and our whole world runs on big, complex pieces of code.</p><p>We programmers need all the help we can get, and we should never assume otherwise. Careful design is great. Testing is great. Formal methods are great. Code reviews are great. Static analysis is great. But none of these things alone are sufficient to eliminate bugs: They will always be with us. A bug can exist for half a century despite our best efforts to exterminate it. We must program carefully, defensively, and remain ever vigilant.</p><p><span>Update 17 Feb 2008</span>: Thanks to Antoine Trux, Principal Member of Engineering Staff at Nokia Research Center Finland for pointing out that the original proposed fix for C and C++ (Line 6), was not guaranteed to work by the relevant C99 standard (<span>INTERNATIONAL STANDARD - ISO/IEC - 9899 - Second edition - 1999-12-01</span>, <a href="http://3.4.3.3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3.4.3.3</a>), which says that if you add two signed quantities and get an overflow, the result is undefined. The older C Standard, C89/90, and the C++ Standard are both identical to C99 in this respect. Now that we've made this change, we <span>know</span> that the program is correct;)</p></div>

<p>I’m not aware of a <em>perfect</em><sup id="fnref:perfect" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perfect" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> term for this, so I’m making one up:
the Makefile effect<sup id="fnref:aware" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:aware" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The Makefile effect boils down to this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tools of a certain complexity or routine unfamiliarity are not run <em>de novo</em>,
but are instead copy-pasted and tweaked from previous known-good examples.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see this effect frequently with engineers of all stripes and skill/experience
levels, with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> being a common example<sup id="fnref:example" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:example" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A task (one of a common shape) needs completing. A very similar (or even
identical) task has been done before.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> (or another tool susceptible to this effect) is the correct or
“best” (given expedience, path dependencies, whatever) tool for the task.</li>
  <li>Instead of writing a <code>Makefile</code>, the engineer copies a previous (sometimes
very large and complicated<sup id="fnref:large" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:large" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>) <code>Makefile</code> from a previous instance of the task
and tweaks it until it works in the new context.</li>
</ol>

<p>On one level, this is a perfectly good (even ideal) <em>engineering</em> response
at the <em>point of solution</em>: applying a working example is often the parsimonious
thing to do, and runs a lesser (in theory) risk of introducing bugs, since
most of the work is unchanged.</p>

<p>However, at the <em>point of design</em>, this suggests a tool design (or tool <em>application</em><sup id="fnref:application" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:application" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>)
that is <em>flawed</em>: the tool (or system) is too complicated (or annoying) to use from scratch. Instead
of using it to solve a problem from scratch, users repeatedly copy a known-good solution
and accrete changes over time.</p>

<p>Once you notice it, you start to see this pattern all over the place.
Beyond Make:</p>

<ul>
  <li>CI/CD configurations like GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD, where users
copy their YAML spaghetti from the <em>last</em> working setup and tweak it
(often with repeated re-runs) until it works again;</li>
  <li>Linter and formatter configurations, where a basic set of rules gets
copied between projects and strengthened/loosened as needed for local
conditions;</li>
  <li>Build systems themselves, where everything non-trivial begins to resemble
the previous build system.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="does-this-matter">Does this matter?</h2>

<p>In many cases, perhaps not. However, I think it’s worth thinking about, especially
when designing tools and systems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tools and systems that enable this pattern often have less-than-ideal
diagnostics or debugging support: the user has to run the tool repeatedly,
often with long delays, to get back relatively small amounts of information.
Think about CI/CD setups, where users diagnose their copy-pasted
CI/CD by doing print-style debugging <em>over the network with a layer
of intermediating VM orchestration.</em> Ridiculous!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tools that enable this pattern often <em>discourage broad learning</em>:
a few mavens know the tool well enough to configure it, and others
copy it with <em>just</em> enough knowledge to do targeted tweaks.
This is sometimes inevitable, but often not: dependency graphs
are an inherent complexity of build systems, but remembering the difference
between <code>$&lt;</code> and <code>$^</code> in Make is not.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tools that enable this pattern are <em>harder to use securely</em>: security
actions typically require deep knowledge of the <em>why</em> behind a piece of
behavior. Systems that are subject to the Makefile effect are also often ones
that enable confusion between code and data (or any kind of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-band_signaling">in-band signalling</a> more generally), in large part because functional
solutions are not always secure ones. Consider, for example, about
<a href="https://woodruffw.github.io/zizmor/audits/#template-injection">template injection</a> in GitHub Actions.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In general, I think well-designed tools (and systems) should aim to minimize
this effect. This can be hard to do in a fully general manner, but some
things I think about when designing a new tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does it <em>need</em> to be configurable?</li>
  <li>Does it <em>need</em> syntax of its own?
    <ul>
      <li>As a corollary: can it <em>reuse</em> familiar syntax or idioms from other tools/CLIs?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Do <em>I</em> end up copy-pasting my use of it around? If so, are <em>others</em> likely to do the same?</li>
</ul>

On a sweltering afternoon last summer, I walked in with my wife and daughter. The place was empty. But looking closer, I realized that business was booming. The bar was covered with to-go food: nine large brown bags.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As we ate our meal, I watched half a dozen people enter the restaurant without sitting down to eat. Each one pushed open the door, walked to the counter, picked up a bag from the bar, and left. In the delicate choreography between kitchen and customer, not a word was exchanged. The space once reserved for that most garrulous social encounter, the bar hangout, had been reconfigured into a silent depot for customers to grab food to eat at home.</p><section data-event-module="magazine promo" data-flatplan-ignore="true"><div><h2>Explore the February 2025 Issue</h2><p>Check out more from this issue and find your next story to read.</p></div><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2025/02/" target="_blank" data-action="click button - magazine promo" data-label="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2025/02/" data-event-element="view more">View More</a></section><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Until the pandemic, the bar was bustling and popular with regulars. “It’s just a few seats, but it was a pretty happening place,” Rae Mosher, the restaurant’s general manager, told me. “I can’t tell you how sad I’ve been about it,” she went on. “I know it hinders communications between customers and staff to have to-go bags taking up the whole bar. But there’s nowhere else for the food to go.” She put up a sign: <span>BAR SEATING CLOSED</span>.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The sign on the bar is a sign of the times for the restaurant business. In the past few decades, the sector has shifted from tables to takeaway, a process that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/03/restaurant-post-pandemic-recovery/677675/">accelerated through the pandemic and continued even as the health emergency abated</a>. In 2023, 74 percent of all restaurant traffic came from “off premises” customers—that is, from takeout and delivery—up from 61 percent before COVID, according to the National Restaurant Association.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The flip side of less dining out is more eating alone. The share of U.S. adults having dinner or drinks with friends on any given night has declined by more than 30 percent in the past 20 years. “There’s an isolationist dynamic that’s taking place in the restaurant business,” the Washington, D.C., restaurateur Steve Salis told me. “I think people feel uncomfortable in the world today. They’ve decided that their home is their sanctuary. It’s not easy to get them to leave.” Even when Americans eat at restaurants, they are much more likely to do so by themselves. According to data gathered by the online reservations platform OpenTable, solo dining has increased by 29 percent in just the past two years. The No. 1 reason is the need for more “me time.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The evolution of restaurants is retracing the trajectory of another American industry: Hollywood. In the 1930s, video entertainment existed only in theaters, and the typical American went to the movies several times a month. Film was a necessarily collective experience, something enjoyed with friends and in the company of strangers. But technology has turned film into a home delivery system. Today, the typical American adult buys about three movie tickets a year—and watches almost 19 hours of television, the equivalent of roughly eight movies, on a weekly basis. In entertainment, as in dining, modernity has transformed a ritual of togetherness into an experience of homebound reclusion and even solitude.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The privatization of American leisure is one part of a much bigger story. Americans are spending less time with other people than in any other period for which we have trustworthy data, going back to 1965. Between that year and the end of the 20th century, in-person socializing slowly declined. From 2003 to 2023, it plunged by more than 20 percent, according to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bls.gov/tus/">American Time Use Survey</a>, an annual study conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Among unmarried men and people younger than 25, the decline was more than 35 percent. Alone time predictably spiked during the pandemic. But the trend had started long before most people had ever heard of a novel coronavirus and continued after the pandemic was declared over. According to Enghin Atalay, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/frbp/assets/working-papers/2022/wp22-11.pdf">Americans spent even more time alone in 2023</a> than they did in 2021. (He categorized a person as “alone,” as I will throughout this article, if they are “the only person in the room, even if they are on the phone” or in front of a computer.)</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Eroding companionship can be seen in numerous odd and depressing facts of American life today. Men who watch television now spend seven hours in front of the TV for every hour they spend hanging out with somebody outside their home. The typical female pet owner spends more time actively engaged with her pet than she spends in face-to-face contact with friends of her own species. Since the early 2000s, the amount of time that Americans say they spend helping or caring for people outside their nuclear family has declined by more than a third.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-0" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 1" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="1"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/america-decline-hanging-out/677451/">Derek Thompson: Why Americans suddenly stopped hanging out</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Self-imposed solitude might just be the most important social fact of the 21st century in America. Perhaps unsurprisingly, many observers have reduced this phenomenon to the topic of loneliness. In 2023, Vivek Murthy, Joe Biden’s surgeon general, published <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">an 81-page warning about America’s “epidemic of loneliness,”</a> claiming that its negative health effects were on par with those of tobacco use and obesity. A growing number of public-health officials seem to regard loneliness as the developed world’s next critical public-health issue. The United Kingdom now has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/16/may-appoints-minister-tackle-loneliness-issues-raised-jo-cox">a minister for loneliness</a>. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/nov/16/who-declares-loneliness-a-global-public-health-concern">So does Japan.</a></p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="illustration of person eating at table while working on a laptop computer" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/5BCh12ophU00sz_sKmhThSBudVE=/174x22:880x645/350x309/media/img/posts/2025/01/table/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/v7Np-NH8L1M7IeA6nbVjxWx1yO4=/174x22:880x645/700x618/media/img/posts/2025/01/table/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/5BCh12ophU00sz_sKmhThSBudVE=/174x22:880x645/350x309/media/img/posts/2025/01/table/original.jpg" width="350" height="309"></picture><figcaption>Max Guther</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But solitude and loneliness are not one and the same. “It is actually a very healthy emotional response to feel some loneliness,” the NYU sociologist Eric Klinenberg told me. “That cue is the thing that pushes you off the couch and into face-to-face interaction.” The real problem here, the nature of America’s social crisis, is that most Americans don’t seem to be reacting to the biological cue to spend more time with other people. Their solitude levels are surging while many measures of loneliness are actually flat or dropping. A 2021 study of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2022-09577-002">the widely used UCLA Loneliness Scale</a> concluded that “the frequently used term ‘loneliness epidemic’ seems exaggerated.” Although young people are lonelier than they once were, there is little evidence that loneliness is rising more broadly today. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/473057/loneliness-subsides-pandemic-high.aspx">2023 Gallup survey</a> found that the share of Americans who said they experienced loneliness “a lot of the day yesterday” declined by roughly one-third from 2021 to 2023, even as alone time, by Atalay’s calculation, rose slightly.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Day to day, hour to hour, we are choosing this way of life—its comforts, its ready entertainments. But convenience can be a curse. Our habits are creating what Atalay has called a “century of solitude.” This is the anti-social century.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Over the past few months, I’ve spoken with psychologists, political scientists, sociologists, and technologists about America’s anti-social streak. Although the particulars of these conversations differed, a theme emerged: The individual preference for solitude, scaled up across society and exercised repeatedly over time, is rewiring America’s civic and psychic identity. And the consequences are far-reaching—for our happiness, our communities, our politics, and even our understanding of reality.</p><h4><b>The End of </b><b>the Social Century</b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>The first half </span>of the 20th century was extraordinarily social. From 1900 to 1960, church membership surged, as did labor-union participation. Marriage rates reached a record high after World War II, and the birth rate enjoyed a famous “boom.” Associations of all sorts thrived, including book clubs and volunteer groups. The New Deal made America’s branch-library system the envy of the world; communities and developers across the country built theaters, music venues, playgrounds, and all kinds of gathering places.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But in the 1970s, the U.S. entered an era of withdrawal, as the political scientist Robert D. Putnam famously documented in his 2000 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781982130848"><i>Bowling Alone</i></a>. Some institutions of togetherness, such as marriage, eroded slowly. Others fell away swiftly. From 1985 to 1994, active involvement in community organizations fell by nearly half. The decline was astonishingly broad, affecting just about every social activity and every demographic group that Putnam tracked.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">What happened in the 1970s? Klinenberg, the sociologist, notes a shift in political priorities: The government dramatically slowed its construction of public spaces. “Places that used to anchor community life, like libraries and school gyms and union halls, have become less accessible or shuttered altogether,” he told me. Putnam points, among other things, to new moral values, such as the embrace of unbridled individualism. But he found that two of the most important factors were by then ubiquitous technologies: the automobile and the television set.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Starting in the second half of the century, Americans used their cars to move farther and farther away from one another, enabling the growth of the suburbs and, with it, a retreat into private backyard patios, private pools, a more private life. Once Americans got out of the car, they planted themselves in front of the television. From 1965 to 1995, the typical adult gained six hours a week in leisure time. They could have devoted that time—300 hours a year!—to community service, or pickup basketball, or reading, or knitting, or all four. Instead, they funneled almost all of this extra time into watching more TV.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="TK" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/T5wguJQc-tjvYJTUsqAn_SdFUyI=/10x24:1104x1456/655x857/media/img/posts/2025/01/gCKcu_america_alone2/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ww1ebsA4ogdK-koIh9SelnwYqyw=/10x24:1104x1456/750x981/media/img/posts/2025/01/gCKcu_america_alone2/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Arpb4Kpw1MSb26XODLGX-KhPGqQ=/10x24:1104x1456/850x1112/media/img/posts/2025/01/gCKcu_america_alone2/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lY0HVaSafQiTfTNOcKcbBCwbZyo=/10x24:1104x1456/928x1214/media/img/posts/2025/01/gCKcu_america_alone2/original.jpg 928w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/T5wguJQc-tjvYJTUsqAn_SdFUyI=/10x24:1104x1456/655x857/media/img/posts/2025/01/gCKcu_america_alone2/original.jpg" width="655" height="857"></picture></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Television transformed Americans’ interior decorating, our relationships, and our communities. In 1970, just 6 percent of sixth graders had a TV set in their bedroom; in 1999, that proportion had grown to 77 percent. Time diaries in the 1990s showed that husbands and wives spent almost four times as many hours watching TV together as they spent talking to each other in a given week. People who said TV was their “primary form of entertainment” were less likely to engage in practically every social activity that Putnam counted: volunteering, churchgoing, attending dinner parties, picnicking, giving blood, even sending greeting cards. Like a murder in Clue, the death of social connections in America had any number of suspects. But in the end, I believe the likeliest culprit is obvious. It was Mr. Farnsworth, in the living room, with the tube.</p><h4><b>Phonebound</b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>If two </span>of the 20th century’s iconic technologies, the automobile and the television, initiated the rise of American aloneness, the 21st century’s most notorious piece of hardware has continued to fuel, and has indeed accelerated, our national anti-social streak. Countless books, articles, and cable-news segments have warned Americans that smartphones can negatively affect mental health and may be especially harmful to adolescents. But the fretful coverage is, if anything, restrained given how greatly these devices have changed our conscious experience. The typical person is awake for about 900 minutes a day.

By this account, screens occupy more than 30 percent of their waking life.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Some of this screen time is social, after a fashion. But sharing videos or texting friends is a pale imitation of face-to-face interaction.

Although the human brain grows to 90 percent of its full size by age 5, its neural circuitry takes a long time to mature. Our lengthy childhood might be evolution’s way of scheduling an extended apprenticeship in social learning through play. The best kind of play is physical, outdoors, with other kids, and unsupervised, allowing children to press the limits of their abilities while figuring out how to manage conflict and tolerate pain. But now young people’s attention is funneled into devices that take them out of their body, denying them the physical-world education they need.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-1" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 2" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="2"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/teen-childhood-smartphone-use-mental-health-effects/677722/">Read: Jonathan Haidt on the terrible costs of a phone-based childhood</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Teen anxiety and depression are at near-record highs: The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/yrbs/results/2023-yrbs-results.html">latest government survey of high schoolers</a>, conducted in 2023, found that more than half of teen girls said they felt “persistently sad or hopeless.” These data are alarming, but shouldn’t be surprising.

A popular trend on TikTok involves 20‑somethings celebrating in creative ways when a friend cancels plans, often because they’re too tired or anxious to leave the house. These clips can be goofy and even quite funny. Surely, sympathy is due; we all know the feeling of relief when we claw back free time in an overscheduled week. But the sheer number of videos is a bit unsettling. If anybody should feel lonely and desperate for physical-world contact, you’d think it would be 20-somethings, who are still recovering from years of pandemic cabin fever. But many nights, it seems, members of America’s most isolated generation aren’t trying to leave the house at all.

In the early stages of friendship, people engage in small talk by sharing trivial details. As they develop trust, their conversations deepen to include more private information until disclosure becomes habitual and easy. Altman later added an important wrinkle: Friends require boundaries as much as they require closeness.

He had a feeling that the rise of remote work might have accelerated a longer-term trend: a shift in the amount of time that people spend inside their home. He ran the numbers and discovered “an astounding change” in our daily habits, much more extreme than he would have guessed. In 2022—notably, after the pandemic had abated—adults spent an additional 99 minutes at home on any given day compared with 2003.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">This finding formed the basis of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sociologicalscience.com/articles-v11-20-553/">a 2024 paper, “Homebound,”</a> in which Sharkey calculated that, compared with 2003, Americans are more likely to take meetings from home, to shop from home, to be entertained at home, to eat at home, and even to worship at home. Practically the entire economy has reoriented itself to allow Americans to stay within their four walls. This phenomenon cannot be reduced to remote work. It is something far more totalizing—something more like “remote life.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">One might ask: Why <i>wouldn’t</i> Americans with means want to spend more time at home? In the past few decades, the typical American home has become bigger, more comfortable, and more entertaining. From 1973 to 2023, the size of the average new single-family house <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/construction/chars/current.html">increased by 50 percent</a>, and the share of new single-family houses <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://humanprogress.org/dataset/u-s-single-family-homes-built-with-air-conditioning?countries=Percentage+of+homes+with+air+conditioning-Percentage+of+homes+without+air+conditioning&amp;primary-data=27374&amp;compare=null&amp;chart-type=Line+Chart&amp;view=selected&amp;value-type=score&amp;calc-table-country-a=null&amp;calc-table-country-b=null&amp;x-axis-start=0&amp;x-axis-end=10&amp;y-axis-start=5&amp;y-axis-end=95&amp;y-axis-log=false&amp;x-axis-log=false&amp;auto-scale=true&amp;map-color=Monochromatic+Sky&amp;region-calculation=Sum&amp;start-date=1973&amp;end-date=2020&amp;the-year=2020&amp;sort-bar-chart-ascending=true">that have air-conditioning doubled</a>, to 98 percent. Streaming services, video-game consoles, and flatscreen TVs make the living room more diverting than any 20th-century theater or arcade. Yet conveniences can indeed be a curse. By Sharkey’s calculations, activities at home were associated with a “strong reduction” in self-reported happiness.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A homebound life doesn’t have to be a solitary life. In the 1970s, the typical household entertained more than once a month. But from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, the frequency of hosting friends for parties, games, dinners, and so on declined by 45 percent, according to data that Robert Putnam gathered. In the 20 years after <i>Bowling Alone</i> was published, the average amount of time that Americans spent hosting or attending social events declined another 32 percent.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">As our homes have become less social, residential architecture has become more anti-social. Clifton Harness is a co-founder of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.testfit.io/">TestFit</a>, a firm that makes software to design layouts for new housing developments. He told me that the cardinal rule of contemporary apartment design is that every room is built to accommodate maximal screen time. “In design meetings with developers and architects, you have to assure everybody that there will be space for a wall-mounted flatscreen television in every room,” he said. “It used to be ‘Let’s make sure our rooms have great light.’ But now, when the question is ‘How do we give the most comfort to the most people?,’ the answer is to feed their screen addiction.” Bobby Fijan, a real-estate developer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/06/dining-rooms-us-homes-apartments/678633/">said last year</a> that “for the most part, apartments are built for Netflix and chill.” From studying floor plans, he noticed that bedrooms, walk-in closets, and other private spaces are growing. “I think we’re building for aloneness,” Fijan told me.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="TK" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 729px) 655px, (min-width: 576px) calc(100vw - 48px), 100vw" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/rdN05LKf9OUoVCIw92SjWcotIC0=/9x23:1019x872/655x551/media/img/posts/2025/01/OlsO9_time_spent_at_home/original.jpg 655w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8OCdCTVFIr6BWgtAWop6UDGIQ80=/9x23:1019x872/750x631/media/img/posts/2025/01/OlsO9_time_spent_at_home/original.jpg 750w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/q39avC-5cOPZh6q5WcVwfABx_cw=/9x23:1019x872/850x715/media/img/posts/2025/01/OlsO9_time_spent_at_home/original.jpg 850w, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/P9iYsJpjbY47-4w0XL4NS7b2Qhk=/9x23:1019x872/928x781/media/img/posts/2025/01/OlsO9_time_spent_at_home/original.jpg 928w" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/rdN05LKf9OUoVCIw92SjWcotIC0=/9x23:1019x872/655x551/media/img/posts/2025/01/OlsO9_time_spent_at_home/original.jpg" width="655" height="551"></picture></figure></div><h4><b>“Secular Monks” </b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>In 2020, </span>the philosopher and writer Andrew Taggart observed in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.firstthings.com/article/2020/03/secular-monks">an essay published in the religious journal <i>First Things</i></a> that a new flavor of masculinity seemed to be emerging: strong, obsessed with personal optimization, and proudly alone. Men and women alike have been delaying family formation; the median age at first marriage for men recently surpassed 30 for the first time in history. Taggart wrote that the men he knew seemed to be forgoing marriage and fatherhood with gusto. Instead of focusing their 30s and 40s on wedding bands and diapers, they were committed to working on their body, their bank account, and their meditation-sharpened minds. Taggart called these men “secular monks” for their combination of old-fashioned austerity and modern solipsism. “Practitioners submit themselves to ever more rigorous, monitored forms of ascetic self-control,” he wrote, “among them, cold showers, intermittent fasting, data-driven health optimization, and meditation boot camps.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When I read Taggart’s essay last year, I felt a shock of recognition. In the previous months, I’d been captivated by a particular genre of social media: the viral “morning routine” video. If the protagonist is a man, he is typically handsome and rich. We see him wake up. We see him meditate. We see him write in his journal. We see him exercise, take supplements, take a cold plunge. What is most striking about these videos, however, is the element they typically lack: other people. In these little movies of a life well spent, the protagonists generally wake up alone and stay that way. We usually see no friends, no spouse, no children.

Liana C. Sayer, a sociologist at the University of Maryland, shared with me her analysis of how leisure time in the 21st century has changed for men and women. Sayer divided leisure into two broad categories: “engaged leisure,” which includes socializing, going to concerts, and playing sports; and “sedentary leisure,” which includes watching TV and playing video games. Compared with engaged leisure, which is more likely to be done with other people, sedentary leisure is more commonly done alone.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The most dramatic tendency that Sayer uncovered is that single men without kids—who have the most leisure time—are overwhelmingly likely to spend these hours by themselves. And the time they spend in solo sedentary leisure has increased, since 2003, more than that of any other group Sayer tracked. This is unfortunate because, as Sayer wrote, “well-being is higher among adults who spend larger shares of leisure with others.” Sedentary leisure, by contrast, was “associated with negative physical and mental health.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Richard V. Reeves, the president of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://aibm.org/">American Institute for Boys and Men</a>, told me that for men, as for women, something hard to define is lost when we pursue a life of isolationist comforts. He calls it “neededness”—the way we make ourselves essential to our families and community. “I think at some level, we all need to feel like we’re a jigsaw piece that’s going to fit into a jigsaw somewhere,” he said. This neededness can come in several forms: social, economic, or communitarian. Our children and partners can depend on us for care or income. Our colleagues can rely on us to finish a project, or to commiserate about an annoying boss. Our religious congregations and weekend poker parties can count on us to fill a pew or bring the dip.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But building these bridges to community takes energy, and today’s young men do not seem to be constructing these relationships in the same way that they used to. In place of neededness, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/01/the-miseducation-of-the-american-boy/603046/">despair is creeping in</a>. Men who are un- or underemployed are especially vulnerable. Feeling unneeded “is actually, in some cases, literally fatal,” Reeves said. “If you look at the words that men use to describe themselves before they take their own lives, they are <i>worthless</i> and <i>useless</i>.” Since 2001, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://aibm.org/research/unnatural-male-deaths/">hundreds of thousands of men have died of drug overdoses</a>, mostly from opioids and synthetics such as fentanyl. “If the level of drug-poisoning deaths had remained flat since 2001, we’d have had 400,000 fewer men die,” Reeves said. These drugs, he emphasized, are defined by their solitary nature: Opioids are not party drugs, but rather the opposite.</p><h4><b>This Is Your </b><b>Politics on Solitude</b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>All of this</span> time alone, at home, on the phone, is not just affecting us as individuals. It’s making society weaker, meaner, and more delusional. Marc J. Dunkelman, an author and a research fellow at Brown University, says that to see how chosen solitude is warping society at large, we must first acknowledge something a little counterintuitive: Today, many of our bonds are actually getting stronger.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Parents are spending more time with their children than they did several decades ago, and many couples and families maintain an unbroken flow of communication. “My wife and I have texted 10 times since we said goodbye today,” Dunkelman told me when I reached him at noon on a weekday. “When my 10-year-old daughter buys a Butterfinger at CVS, I get a phone notification about it.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">At the same time, messaging apps, TikTok streams, and subreddits keep us plugged into the thoughts and opinions of the global crowd that shares our interests. “When I watch a Cincinnati Bengals football game, I’m on a group text with beat reporters to whom I can ask questions, and they’ll respond,” Dunkelman said. “I can follow the live thoughts of football analysts on X.com, so that I’m practically watching the game over their shoulder. I live in Rhode Island, and those are connections that could have never existed 30 years ago.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Home-based, phone-based culture has arguably solidified our closest and most distant connections, the inner ring of family and best friends (bound by blood and intimacy) and the outer ring of tribe (linked by shared affinities). But it’s wreaking havoc on the middle ring of “familiar but not intimate” relationships with the people who live around us, which Dunkelman calls the village. “These are your neighbors, the people in your town,” he said. We used to know them well; now we don’t.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The middle ring is key to social cohesion, Dunkelman said. Families teach us love, and tribes teach us loyalty. The village teaches us tolerance. Imagine that a local parent disagrees with you about affirmative action at a PTA meeting. Online, you might write him off as a political opponent who deserves your scorn. But in a school gym full of neighbors, you bite your tongue. As the year rolls on, you discover that your daughters are in the same dance class. At pickup, you swap stories about caring for aging relatives. Although your differences don’t disappear, they’re folded into a peaceful coexistence. And when the two of you sign up for a committee to draft a diversity statement for the school, you find that you can accommodate each other’s opposing views. “It’s politically moderating to meet thoughtful people in the real world who disagree with you,” Dunkelman said. But if PTA meetings are still frequently held in person, many other opportunities to meet and understand one’s neighbors are becoming a thing of the past. “An important implication of the death of the middle ring is that if you have no appreciation for why the other side has their narrative, you’ll want your own side to fight them without compromise.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The village is our best arena for practicing productive disagreement and compromise—in other words, democracy. So it’s no surprise that the erosion of the village has coincided with the emergence of a grotesque style of politics, in which every election feels like an existential quest to vanquish an intramural enemy. For the past five decades, the American National Election Studies surveys have asked Democrats and Republicans to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electionstudies.org/data-tools/anes-guide/anes-guide.html?chart=avg_ft_parties">rate the opposing party on a “Feeling Thermometer”</a> that ranges from zero (very cold/unfavorable) to 100 (very warm/favorable). In 2000, just 8 percent of partisans gave the other party a zero. By 2020, that figure had shot up to 40 percent. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2021/12/08/poll-political-polarization-students">a 2021 poll by Generation Lab/<em>Axios</em></a>, nearly a third of college students who identify as Republican said they wouldn’t even go on a date with a Democrat, and more than two-thirds of Democratic students said the same of members of the GOP.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election had many causes, including inflation and frustration with Joe Biden’s leadership. But one source of Trump’s success may be that he is an avatar of the all-tribe, no-village style of performative confrontation. He stokes out-group animosity, and speaks to voters who are furiously intolerant of political difference. To cite just a few examples from the campaign, Trump called Democrats “enemies of the democracy” and the news media “enemies of the people,” and promised to “root out” the “radical-left thugs that live like vermin within the confines of our country, that lie and steal and cheat on elections.”</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="Illustration of standing person holding a gray cat up above their head, nose to nose" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/__XuH4qwjuw4WyE_po4gIoUh35c=/148x157:754x867/300x351/media/img/posts/2025/01/cat/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/mRFFiWtoz-e1W82_3i-JlnWq9Xo=/148x157:754x867/600x702/media/img/posts/2025/01/cat/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/__XuH4qwjuw4WyE_po4gIoUh35c=/148x157:754x867/300x351/media/img/posts/2025/01/cat/original.jpg" width="300" height="351"></picture><figcaption>Max Guther</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Social disconnection also helps explain progressives’ stubborn inability to understand Trump’s appeal. In the fall, one popular Democratic lawn sign read <span>Harris Walz: Obviously</span>. That sentiment, rejected by a majority of voters, indicates a failure to engage with the world as it really is. Dunkelman emailed me after the election to lament Democratic cluelessness. “How did those of us who live in elite circles not see how Trump was gaining popularity even among our literal neighbors?” he wrote. Too many progressives were mainlining left-wing media in the privacy of their home, oblivious that families down the street were drifting right. Even in the highly progressive borough of Brooklyn, New York, three in 10 voters chose Trump. If progressives still consider MAGA an alien movement, it is in part because they have made themselves strangers in their own land.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Practicing politics alone, on the internet, rather than in community isn’t only making us more likely to demonize and alienate our opponents, though that would be bad enough. It may also be encouraging deep nihilism. In 2018, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/need-for-chaos-political-science-concept/677536/">a group of researchers led by Michael Bang Petersen</a>, a Danish political scientist, began asking Americans to evaluate false rumors about Democratic and Republican politicians, including Trump and Hillary Clinton. “We were expecting a clear pattern of polarization,” Petersen told me, with people on the left sharing conspiracies about the right and vice versa. But some participants seemed drawn to any conspiracy theory so long as it was intended to destroy the established order. Members of this cohort commonly harbored racial or economic grievances. Perhaps more important, Petersen said, they tended to feel socially isolated. These aggravated loners agreed with many dark pronouncements, such as “I need chaos around me” and “When I think about our political and social institutions, I cannot help thinking ‘just let them all burn.’ ” Petersen and his colleagues coined a term to describe this cohort’s motivation: the need for chaos.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-5" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 6" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="6"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/02/need-for-chaos-political-science-concept/677536/">Read: Derek Thompson on the Americans who need chaos</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Although chaotically inclined individuals score highly in a popular measure for loneliness, they don’t seem to seek the obvious remedy. “What they’re reaching out to get isn’t friendship at all but rather recognition and status,” Petersen said. For many socially isolated men in particular, for whom reality consists primarily of glowing screens in empty rooms, a vote for destruction is a politics of last resort—a way to leave one’s mark on a world where collective progress, or collective support of any kind, feels impossible.</p><h4><b>The Introversion Delusion</b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>Let us be</span> fair to solitude, for a moment. As the father of a young child, I know well that a quiet night alone can be a balm. I have spent evenings alone at a bar, watching a baseball game, that felt ecstatically close to heaven. People cope with stress and grief and mundane disappointment in complex ways, and sometimes isolation is the best way to restore inner equilibrium.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But the dosage matters. A night alone away from a crying baby is one thing. A decade or more of chronic social disconnection is something else entirely. And people who spend more time alone, year after year, become meaningfully less happy. In his 2023 paper on the rise of 21st-century solitude, Atalay, at the Philadelphia Fed, calculated that by one measure, sociability means considerably more for happiness than money does: A five-percentage-point increase in alone time was associated with about the same decline in life satisfaction as was a 10 percent lower household income.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="illustration of person in sweats and socks lying on floor with one arm under head and the other holding a smartphone" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/D1Wf9QpXpYsALTQsYkcLlD51eIk=/38x61:628x423/350x215/media/img/posts/2025/01/floor/original.jpg" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/D1Wf9QpXpYsALTQsYkcLlD51eIk=/38x61:628x423/350x215/media/img/posts/2025/01/floor/original.jpg" width="350" height="215"></picture><figcaption>Max Guther</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Nonetheless, many people keep choosing to spend free time alone, in their home, away from other people. Perhaps, one might think, they are making the right choice; after all, they must know themselves best. But a consistent finding of modern psychology is that people often don’t know what they want, or what will make them happy. The saying that “predictions are hard, especially about the future” applies with special weight to predictions about our own life. Time and again, what we expect to bring us peace—a bigger house, a luxury car, a job with twice the pay but half the leisure—only creates more anxiety. And at the top of this pile of things we mistakenly believe we want, there is aloneness.</p><p id="injected-recirculation-link-6" data-view-action="view link - injected link - item 7" data-event-element="injected link" data-event-position="7"><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/05/is-facebook-making-us-lonely/308930/">From the May 2012 issue: Is Facebook making us lonely?</a></p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Several years ago, Nick Epley, a psychologist at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, asked commuter-train passengers to make a prediction: How would they feel if asked to spend the ride talking with a stranger? Most participants predicted that quiet solitude would make for a better commute than having a long chat with someone they didn’t know. Then <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/jschroeder/Publications/Epley&amp;Schroeder2014.pdf">Epley’s team created an experiment</a> in which some people were asked to keep to themselves, while others were instructed to talk with a stranger (“The longer the conversation, the better,” participants were told). Afterward, people filled out a questionnaire. How did they feel? Despite the broad assumption that the best commute is a silent one, the people instructed to talk with strangers actually reported feeling significantly more positive than those who’d kept to themselves. “A fundamental paradox at the core of human life is that we are highly social and made better in every way by being around people,” Epley said. “And yet over and over, we have opportunities to connect that we don’t take, or even actively reject, and it is a terrible mistake.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Researchers have repeatedly validated Epley’s discovery. In 2020, the psychologists Seth Margolis and Sonja Lyubomirsky, at UC Riverside, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Margolis-Lyubomirsky-2020.pdf">asked people to behave like an extrovert for one week and like an introvert for another</a>. Subjects received several reminders to act “assertive” and “spontaneous” or “quiet” and “reserved” depending on the week’s theme. Participants said they felt more positive emotions at the end of the extroversion week and more negative emotions at the end of the introversion week. Our modern economy, with its home-delivery conveniences, manipulates people into behaving like agoraphobes. But it turns out that we can be manipulated in the opposite direction. And we might be happier for it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Our “mistaken” preference for solitude could emerge from a misplaced anxiety that other people aren’t that interested in talking with us, or that they would find our company bothersome. “But in reality,” Epley told me, “social interaction is not very uncertain, because of the principle of reciprocity. If you say hello to someone, they’ll typically say hello back to you. If you give somebody a compliment, they’ll typically say thank you.” Many people, it seems, are not social enough for their own good. They too often seek comfort in solitude, when they would actually find joy in connection.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Despite a consumer economy that seems optimized for introverted behavior, we would have happier days, years, and lives if we resisted the undertow of the convenience curse—if we talked with more strangers, belonged to more groups, and left the house for more activities.</p><h4><b>The AI Century</b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>The anti-social century</span> has been bad enough: more anxiety and depression; more “need for chaos” in our politics. But I’m sorry to say that our collective detachment could still get worse. Or, to be more precise, weirder.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">In May of last year, three employees of OpenAI, the artificial-intelligence company, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uM8jhcqDP0&amp;t=4s">sat onstage to introduce</a> ChatGPT’s new real-time conversational-speech feature. A research scientist named Mark Chen held up a phone and, smiling, started speaking to it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Hey, ChatGPT, I’m Mark. How are you?” Mark said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Hello, Mark!” a cheery female voice responded.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Hey, so I’m onstage right now,” Mark said. “I’m doing a live demo, and frankly I’m feeling a little bit nervous. Can you help me calm my nerves a little bit?”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Oh, you’re doing a live demo <i>right now</i>?” the voice replied, projecting astonishment with eerie verisimilitude. “That’s awesome! Just take a deep breath and remember: You’re the expert here.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Mark asked for feedback on his breathing, before panting loudly, like someone who’d just finished a marathon.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Whoa, slow!” the voice responded. “Mark, you’re not a vacuum cleaner!” Out of frame, the audience laughed. Mark tried breathing audibly again, this time more slowly and deliberately.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“That’s it,” the AI responded. “How do you feel?”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“I feel a lot better,” Mark said. “Thank you so much.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">AI’s ability to speak naturally might seem like an incremental update, as subtle as a camera-lens refinement on a new iPhone. But according to Nick Epley, fluent speech represents a radical advancement in the technology’s ability to encroach on human relationships.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“Once an AI can speak to you, it’ll feel extremely real,” he said, because people process spoken word more intimately and emotionally than they process text. For <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344232654_It's_surprisingly_nice_to_hear_you_Misunderstanding_the_impact_of_communication_media_can_lead_to_suboptimal_choices_of_how_to_connect_with_others">a study published in 2020</a>, Epley and Amit Kumar, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin, randomly assigned participants to contact an old friend via phone or email. Most people said they preferred to send a written message. But those instructed to talk on the phone reported feeling “a significantly stronger bond” with their friend, and a stronger sense that they’d “really connected,” than those who used email.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Speech is rich with what are known as “paralinguistic cues,” such as emphasis and intonation, which can build sympathy and trust in the minds of listeners. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797615572906">another study</a>, Epley and the behavioral scientist Juliana Schroeder found that employers and potential recruiters were more likely to rate candidates as “more competent, thoughtful, and intelligent” when they heard a why-I’m-right-for-this-job pitch rather than read it.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Even now, before AI has mastered fluent speech, millions of people are already forming intimate relationships with machines, according to Jason Fagone, a journalist who is writing a book about the emergence of AI companions. Character.ai, the most popular platform for AI companions, has tens of millions of monthly users, who spend an average of 93 minutes a day chatting with their AI friend. “No one is getting duped into thinking they’re actually talking to humans,” Fagone told me. “People are freely choosing to enter relationships with artificial partners, and they’re getting deeply attached anyway, because of the emotional capabilities of these systems.” One subject in his book is a young man who, after his fiancée’s death, engineers an AI chatbot to resemble his deceased partner. Another is a bisexual mother who supplements her marriage to a man with an AI that identifies as a woman.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If you find the notion of emotional intercourse with an immaterial entity creepy, consider the many friends and family members who exist in your life mainly as words on a screen. Digital communication has already prepared us for AI companionship, Fagone said, by transforming many of our physical-world relationships into a sequence of text chimes and blue bubbles. “I think part of why AI-companion apps have proven so seductive so quickly is that most of our relationships already happen exclusively through the phone,” he said.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Epley sees the exponential growth of AI companions as a real possibility. “You can set them up to never criticize you, never cheat on you, never have a bad day and insult you, and to always be interested in you.” Unlike the most patient spouses, they could tell us that we’re always right. Unlike the world’s best friend, they could instantly respond to our needs without the all-too-human distraction of having to lead their own life.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“The horrifying part, of course, is that learning how to interact with real human beings who can disagree with you and disappoint you” is essential to living in the world, Epley said. I think he’s right. But Epley was born in the 1970s. I was born in the 1980s. People born in the 2010s, or the 2020s, might not agree with us about the irreplaceability of “real human” friends. These generations may discover that what they want most from their relationships is not a set of people, who might challenge them, but rather a set of feelings—sympathy, humor, validation—that can be more reliably drawn out from silicon than from carbon-based life forms. Long before technologists build a superintelligent machine that can do the work of so many Einsteins, they may build an emotionally sophisticated one that can do the work of so many friends.</p><h4><b>The Next 15 </b><b>Minutes</b></h4><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><span>The anti-social century</span> is as much a result of what’s happened to the exterior world of concrete and steel as it is about advances inside our phones. The decline of government investments in what Eric Klinenberg calls “social infrastructure”—public spaces that shape our relationship to the world—may have begun in the latter part of the 20th century, but it has continued in the 21st. That has arguably affected nearly everyone, but less advantaged Americans most of all.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone to poor neighborhoods in big cities, and the community leaders tell me the real crisis for poor teenagers is that there’s just not much for them to do anymore, and nowhere to go,” Klinenberg told me. “I’d like to see the government build social infrastructure for teenagers with the creativity and generosity with which video-game companies build the toys that keep them inside. I’m thinking of athletic fields, and public swimming pools, and libraries with beautiful social areas for young people to hang out together.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">Improved public social infrastructure would not solve all the problems of the anti-social century. But degraded public spaces—and degraded public life—are in some ways the other side of all our investments in video games and phones and bigger, better private space. Just as we needed time to see the invisible emissions of the Industrial Revolution, we are only now coming to grips with the negative externalities of a phonebound and homebound world. The media theorist Marshall McLuhan once said of technology that every augmentation is also an amputation. We chose our digitally enhanced world. We did not realize the significance of what was being amputated.</p><div data-flatplan-inline_image="true"><figure><picture><img alt="illustration of person with gray hair seated in brown easy chair watching television on wooden cabinet and holding remote control" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ng5_C0lLnACbaPR18x39ARRjaW0=/136x62:1130x805/400x299/media/img/posts/2025/01/tv/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/hC4lzn58XCHkSbFU5vaWHGy5ZZM=/136x62:1130x805/800x598/media/img/posts/2025/01/tv/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ng5_C0lLnACbaPR18x39ARRjaW0=/136x62:1130x805/400x299/media/img/posts/2025/01/tv/original.jpg" width="400" height="299"></picture><figcaption>Max Guther</figcaption></figure></div><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">But we can choose differently. In his 2015 novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780062334510"><i>Seveneves</i></a>, Neal Stephenson coined the term <i>Amistics</i> to describe the practice of carefully selecting which technologies to accept. The word is a reference to the Amish, who generally shun many modern innovations, including cars and television. Although they are sometimes considered strictly anti-modern, many Amish communities have refrigerators and washing machines, and some use solar power. Instead of dismissing all technology, the Amish adopt only those innovations that support their religious and communal values. In his 1998 dissertation on one Amish community, Tay Keong Tan, then a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard, quoted a community member as saying that they didn’t want to adopt TV or radio, because those products “would destroy our visiting practices. We would stay at home with the television or radio rather than meet with other people.”</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">If the Amish approach to technology is radical in its application, it recognizes something plain and true: Although technology does not have values of its own, its adoption can <i>create</i> values, even in the absence of a coordinated effort. For decades, we’ve adopted whatever technologies removed friction or increased dopamine, embracing what makes life feel easy and good in the moment. But dopamine is a chemical, not a virtue. And what’s easy is not always what’s best for us. We should ask ourselves: What would it mean to select technology based on long-term health rather than instant gratification? And if technology is hurting our community, what can we do to heal it?</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">A seemingly straightforward prescription is that teenagers should choose to spend less time on their phone, and their parents should choose to invite more friends over for dinner. But in a way, these are collective-action problems. A teenager is more likely to get out of the house if his classmates have already made a habit of hanging out. That teen’s parents are more likely to host if their neighbors have also made a habit of weekly gatherings. There is a word for such deeply etched communal habits: <i>rituals</i>. And one reason, perhaps, that the decline of socializing has synchronized with the decline of religion is that nothing has proved as adept at inscribing ritual into our calendars as faith.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">“I have a view that is uncommon among social scientists, which is that moral revolutions are real and they change our culture,” Robert Putnam told me. In the early 20th century, a group of liberal Christians, including the pastor Walter Rauschenbusch, urged other Christians to expand their faith from a narrow concern for personal salvation to a public concern for justice. Their movement, which became known as the Social Gospel, was instrumental in passing major political reforms, such as the abolition of child labor. It also encouraged a more communitarian approach to American life, which manifested in an array of entirely secular congregations that met in union halls and community centers and dining rooms. All of this came out of a particular alchemy of writing and thinking and organizing. No one can say precisely how to change a nation’s moral-emotional atmosphere, but what’s certain is that atmospheres do change. Our smallest actions create norms. Our norms create values. Our values drive behavior. And our behaviors cascade.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">The anti-social century is the result of one such cascade, of chosen solitude, accelerated by digital-world progress and physical-world regress. But if one cascade brought us into an anti-social century, another can bring about a social century. New norms are possible; they’re being created all the time. Independent bookstores are booming—the American Booksellers Association has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/independent-bookstores-membership-growth-66678667daa1e0529ffe6ad9c7273459">reported more than 50 percent growth since 2009</a>—and in cities such as New York City and Washington, D.C., many of them have become miniature theaters, with regular standing-room-only crowds gathered for author readings. More districts and states are banning smartphones in schools, a national experiment that could, optimistically, improve children’s focus and their physical-world relationships. In the past few years, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/board-game-cafes-market">board-game cafés have flowered</a> across the country, and their business is expected to nearly double by 2030. These cafés buck an 80-year trend. Instead of turning a previously social form of entertainment into a private one, they turn a living-room pastime into a destination activity. As sweeping as the social revolution I’ve described might seem, it’s built from the ground up by institutions and decisions that are profoundly within our control: as humble as a café, as small as a new phone locker at school.</p><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true">When Epley and his lab asked Chicagoans to overcome their preference for solitude and talk with strangers on a train, the experiment probably didn’t change anyone’s life. All it did was marginally improve the experience of one 15-minute block of time. But life is just a long set of 15-minute blocks, one after another. The way we spend our minutes is the way we spend our decades. “No amount of research that I’ve done has changed my life more than this,” Epley told me. “It’s not that I’m never lonely. It’s that my moment-to-moment experience of life is better, because I’ve learned to take the dead space of life and make friends in it.”</p><hr><p data-flatplan-paragraph="true"><small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2025/02/">February 2025</a> print edition with the headline “The Anti-Social Century.”</em></small></p><section><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community" data-event-module="affiliate module"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781982130848" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" data-event-element="book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RAbRAqBg3pbTl-32VMhqrUlGd14=/0x0:333x500/80x120/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/41d0YMXmaoL._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/9OGJLObFwI93s8IUT-E9ZyVoAL8=/0x0:333x500/160x240/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/41d0YMXmaoL._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RAbRAqBg3pbTl-32VMhqrUlGd14=/0x0:333x500/80x120/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/41d0YMXmaoL._SL500_/original.jpg" width="80" height="120"></picture></a></div><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness" data-event-module="affiliate module"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780593655030" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" data-event-element="book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/00ZbIvLLih6o8rahMLfcWLvFtIY=/0x0:329x500/79x120/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/51U6lRPzsML._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/W0R8X7vSHNXkzSeIOUiQd7IpFzE=/0x0:329x500/158x240/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/51U6lRPzsML._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/00ZbIvLLih6o8rahMLfcWLvFtIY=/0x0:329x500/79x120/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/51U6lRPzsML._SL500_/original.jpg" width="79" height="120"></picture></a></div><div data-view-action="view - affiliate module" data-view-label="Superbloom: How Technologies of Connection Tear Us Apart" data-event-module="affiliate module"><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781324064619" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-label="Superbloom: How Technologies of Connection Tear Us Apart" data-action="click link - affiliate module - book cover" data-event-element="book cover" target="_blank"><picture><img alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/mHQy4u8ek1wIywdDZ7JfLEFM6Tk=/0x0:331x500/79x120/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/41aD34QGxzL._SL500_/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZDdlAjlWUED6BCsmoZFk8_MMP4Q=/0x0:331x500/158x240/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/41aD34QGxzL._SL500_/original.jpg 2x" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/mHQy4u8ek1wIywdDZ7JfLEFM6Tk=/0x0:331x500/79x120/media/img/book_reviews/2025/01/07/41aD34QGxzL._SL500_/original.jpg" width="79" height="120"></picture></a></div></section><div><hr><p>​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
