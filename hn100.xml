  <article>
    <p>Now that I’ve been retired for a couple of days, I think I can finally tell this story of how I was – very briefly – <strong><a href="mailto:steve@next.com">steve@next.com</a></strong></p>
<p>And Steve Jobs sent me an email saying <strong>“Great idea, thank you."</strong></p>
<p>Wait, what? What was the great idea?</p>
<h2 id="new-guy-at-next">new guy at NeXT</h2>
<p>In October of 1991, I was a new Systems Engineer at NeXT.  NeXT, of course, was the company Steve Jobs had founded after leaving Apple in 1985, and which <a href="https://blog.hayman.net/2021/12/20/apple-next-years-ago-today.html">eventually merged back into Apple</a> in 1996.  I was one of three employees in Canada, and I think NeXT had about 400 people total.</p>
<h2 id="nextmail">NeXTMail</h2>
<p>Mail on the NeXT Computer was pretty amazing in 1991.  Multimedia!  Fonts!  Attachments!  Sounds!  It’s hard to overstate how cool that was compared to the command line plain-text email everybody was used to.
Every NeXT user got this email from Steve when they started up their computer.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2082/2025/welcome-to-the-next-world.jpg" alt="Welcome to the NeXT World." title="Welcome to the NeXT World.jpg" width="432" height="600">
<p>That message included an attachment of what NeXT called <em>Lip Service</em>, the crazy idea that you could embed an audio file inside an email message.  Crazy.</p>
<audio controls="">
  <source src="https://blog.hayman.net/uploads/2025/sj.m4a" type="audio/mp4">
Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
<h2 id="i-have-an-idea">i have an idea</h2>
<p>NeXT automatically set every employee up with a first-initial last-name address in the usual way, so I was <code>shayman@next.com</code>, and the big guy was <code>sjobs@next.com</code>.</p>
<p>A few colleagues had somehow acquired cooler email aliases - single letter things, or their first name, or a nickname or an easier to spell version, or whatever.  Turns out NeXT had set up some sort of form where you could request an email alias that would redirect to whatever your real email address was.</p>
<p>I also noticed that even though there were seven or eight people at NeXT named <em>Steve</em>, nobody was using the email alias <code>steve@next.com</code>.</p>
<p>So late one Friday night, two weeks into the job, I figured, naively, what the heck, nobody else seems to want it, so I filled in the form asking for <code>steve@next.com</code> to be forwarded to me, <code>shayman@next.com</code>.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind was a vague idea that maybe somebody would have to approve this.  But no, it all got set up automatically, and …</p>
<h2 id="that-was-a-bad-idea">that was a bad idea</h2>
<p>well, suddenly a whole cavalcade of misdirected email was winding up in my inbox.  People sent to <code>steve@next.com</code> who <em>thought</em> they were writing to Steve Jobs, and ordinarily it would have bounced back and they’d realize they’d mistyped the address.  I’m getting email from reporters, from other CEOs, from finance people …</p>
<p>Of course I didn’t read any of it.</p>
<p>But I did start panicking.  OMG I’m going to get fired, this was a terrible idea, I should have foreseen this, what am I going to do now? Once they find out, I’m done!</p>
<h2 id="frantic-backpedalling">frantic backpedalling</h2>
<p>As a last desperate gasp, I filled in the form AGAIN, but this time asking for <code>steve@next.com</code> to be forwarded to <code>sjobs@next.com</code> instead of me.</p>
<p>And that went through. Phew.  I figured I better fess up and tell Steve Jobs what I’d done, so I sent him an email, saying approximately</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Hi - I'm new here. I did something dumb and  
set up a mail alias so that steve@next.com  
would go to me.   
This was a bad idea, I'm sorry.   
I've changed it to steve@next.com goes to you,   
not to me. I think that makes more sense.  

My apologies.    
Signed, new guy.
</code></pre><h2 id="a-reply-i-will-cherish">a reply i will cherish</h2>
<p>and I got this response.  This was the only email I ever personally received from Steve Jobs.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2082/2025/stevenext.com.jpg" alt="Email from SJ to me saying 'Great idea, thank you.'" title="steve@next.com.jpg" width="573" height="518">
<p><strong>From: Steve Jobs</strong><br>
<strong>To: Steve Hayman</strong><br>
Great idea, thank you.</p>
<p>I’ve often thought I should print and frame this email, and let people wonder what the Great Idea was.  “We should merge back with Apple!”  “How about a music player that fit in your pocket?”  “We should build something with a touch screen.”    no, nothing quite that cool, but still, it’s one of my favourite messages.</p>
<h2 id="postscript">postscript</h2>
<p>I started my career with an email from Steve Jobs, and I ended with one from Tim Cook. I’ve been a pretty lucky guy.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article aria-label="Chicago native Cardinal Prevost elected pope, takes name Leo XIV"><div>
			<p>VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, the Chicago-born prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops under Pope Francis, was elected the 267th pope May 8 and took the name Pope Leo XIV.</p>
<p>He is the first North American to be elected pope and, before the conclave, was the U.S. cardinal most mentioned as a potential successor of St. Peter.</p>
<p>The white smoke poured from the chimney on the roof of the Sistine Chapel at 6:07 p.m. Rome time and a few minutes later the bells of St. Peter’s Basilica began to ring.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes later the Vatican police band and two dozen members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard marched into St. Peter’s Square. They soon were joined by the marching band of the Italian Carabinieri, a branch of military police, and by units of the other branches of the Italian military.</p>

</div>
<p>As soon as news began to spread, people from all over Rome ran to join the tens of thousands who were already in the square for the smoke watch. Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri was among them.</p>
<p>French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, protodeacon of the College of Cardinals, appeared on the central balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica at 7:12 p.m. He told the crowd: “I announce to you a great joy. We have a pope (‘Habemus papam’),” saying the cardinal’s name in Latin and announcing the name by which he will be called.</p>
<p>Cardinals over the age of 80, who were not eligible to enter the conclave, joined the crowd in the square. Among them were Cardinals Seán P. O’Malley, the retired archbishop of Boston; Donald W. Wuerl, the retired archbishop of Washington; and Marc Ouellet, retired prefect of the Congregation for Bishops.</p>
<p><a href="https://catholicreview.org/u-s-cardinals-resume-demeanor-land-him-on-papabile-lists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A longtime missionary in Peru, the 69-year-old pope holds both U.S. and Peruvian citizenship.</a></p>
<p>La Repubblica, the major Italian daily, described him April 25 as “cosmopolitan and shy,” but also said he was “appreciated by conservatives and progressives. He has global visibility in a conclave in which few (cardinals) know each other.”</p>
<p>That visibility comes from the fact that as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops for the past two years, he was instrumental in helping Pope Francis choose bishops for many Latin-rite dioceses, he met hundreds of bishops during their “ad limina” visits to Rome and was called to assist the world’s Latin-rite bishops “in all matters concerning the correct and fruitful exercise of the pastoral office entrusted to them.”</p>
<p>The new pope was serving as bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, when Pope Francis called him to the Vatican in January 2023.</p>
<p>During a talk at St. Jude Parish in Chicago in August, the then-cardinal said Pope Francis nominated him “specifically because he did not want someone from the Roman Curia to take on this role. He wanted a missionary; he wanted someone from outside; he wanted someone who would come in with a different perspective.”</p>
<p>In a March 2024 interview with Catholic News Service, he said Pope Francis’ decision in 2022 to name three women as full members of the dicastery, giving them input on the selection of bishops “contributes significantly to the process of discernment in looking for who we hope are the best candidates to serve the church in episcopal ministry.”</p>
<p>To deter attitudes of clericalism among bishops, he said, “it’s important to find men who are truly interested in serving, in preaching the Gospel, not just with eloquent words, but rather with the example and witness they give.”</p>

</div>
<p>In fact, the cardinal said, Pope Francis’ “most effective and important” bulwark against clericalism was his being “a pastor who preaches by gesture.”</p>
<p>In an interview in 2023 with Vatican News, then-Cardinal Prevost spoke about the essential leadership quality of a bishop.</p>
<p>“Pope Francis has spoken of four types of closeness: closeness to God, to brother bishops, to priests and to all God’s people,” he said. “One must not give in to the temptation to live isolated, separated in a palace, satisfied with a certain social level or a certain level within the church.”</p>
<p>“And we must not hide behind an idea of authority that no longer makes sense today,” he said. “The authority we have is to serve, to accompany priests, to be pastors and teachers.”</p>
<p>As prefect of the dicastery then-Cardinal Prevost also served as president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, where nearly 40% of the world’s Catholics reside.</p>
<p>A Chicago native, he also served as prior general of the Augustinians and spent more than two decades serving in Peru, first as an Augustinian missionary and later as bishop of Chiclayo.</p>
<p>Soon after coming to Rome to head the dicastery, he told Vatican News that bishops have a special mission of promoting the unity of the church.</p>
<p>“The lack of unity is a wound that the church suffers, a very painful one,” he said in May 2023. “Divisions and polemics in the church do not help anything. We bishops especially must accelerate this movement toward unity, toward communion in the church.”</p>
<p>In September, a television program in Peru reported on the allegations of three women who said that then-Bishop Prevost failed to act against a priest who sexually abused them as minors. The diocese strongly denied the accusation, pointing out that he personally met with the victims in April 2022, removed the priest from his parish, suspended him from ministry and conducted a local investigation that was then forwarded to the Vatican. The Vatican said there was insufficient evidence to proceed, as did the local prosecutor’s office.</p>
<p>Pope Leo was born Sept. 14, 1955, in Chicago, Illinois. He holds a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the Augustinian-run Villanova University in Pennsylvania and joined the order in 1977, making his solemn vows in 1981. He holds a degree in theology from the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago and a doctorate from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.</p>
<p>He joined the Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985 and largely worked in the country until 1999 when he was elected head of the Augustinians’ Chicago-based province. From 2001 to 2013, he served as prior general of the worldwide order. In 2014, Pope Francis named him bishop of Chiclayo, in northern Peru, and the pope asked him also to be apostolic administrator of Callao, Peru, from April 2020 to May 2021.</p>
<p>The new pope speaks English, Spanish, Italian, French, Portuguese and can read Latin and German.</p>

<p>Reservoir sampling is a technique for selecting a fair random sample when you
don't know the size of the set you're sampling from. By the end of this essay
you will know:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you would need reservoir sampling.</li>
<li>The mathematics behind how it works, using only basic operations:
subtraction, multiplication, and division. No math notation, I promise.</li>
<li>A simple way to implement reservoir sampling if you want to use it.</li>

<h2 id="sampling-when-you-know-the-size"><a href="#sampling-when-you-know-the-size">#</a>
Sampling when you know the size</h2>
<p>In front of you are 10 playing cards and I ask you to pick 3 at random. How do
you do it?</p>
<p>The first technique that might come to mind from your childhood is to mix them
all up in the middle. Then you can straighten them out and pick the first 3.
You can see this happen below by clicking "Shuffle."</p>

<p>Every time you click "Shuffle," the chart below tracks what the first 3 cards
were.</p>
<s-card-select-bar-chart id="random-shuffle-chart" target="random-shuffle">
</s-card-select-bar-chart>
<p>At first you'll notice some cards are selected more than others, but if you
keep going it will even out. All cards have an equal chance of being selected.
This makes it "fair."</p>
<p>Click "Shuffle 100 times" until the chart evens out.  You can reset the chart if
you'd like to start over.</p>

<p>This method works fine with 10 cards, but what if you had 1 million cards?
Mixing those up won't be easy. Instead, we could use a random number generator
to pick 3 indices. These would be our 3 chosen cards.</p>

<p>We no longer have to move all of the cards, and if we click the "Select" button
enough times we'll see that this method is just as fair as the mix-up method.</p>
<s-card-select-bar-chart id="random-select-chart" target="random-select">
</s-card-select-bar-chart>

<p>I'm stretching the analogy a little here. It would take a long time to count
through the deck to get to, say, index 436,234. But when it's an array in
memory, computers have no trouble finding an element by its index.</p>
<p>Now let me throw you a curveball: what if I were to show you 1 card at a time,
and you had to pick 1 at random?</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="confused">
  How many cards are you going to show me?
</s-dog>
<p>That's the curveball: you don't know.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="default">
  Can I hold on to all the cards you give me and then pick 1 after you stop?
</s-dog>
<p>No, you can only hold on to 1 card at a time. You're free to swap your card
with the newest one each time I show you a card, but you can only hold one and
you can't go back to a card you've already seen.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="concerned">
  Then it's impossible! Why would I ever need to do this anyway?
</s-dog>
<p>Believe it or not, this is a real problem and it has a real and elegant
solution.</p>
<p>For example, let's say you're building a log collection service. Text logs, not
wooden ones. This service receives log messages from other services and
stores them so that it's easy to search them in one place.</p>
<p>One of the things you need to think about when building a service like this is
what do you do when another service starts sending you way too many logs.  Maybe
it's a bad release, maybe one of your videos goes viral. Whatever the reason, it
threatens to overwhelm your log collection service.</p>
<p>Let's simulate this. Below you can see a stream of logs that experiences
periodic spikes. A horizontal line indicates the <h->threshold</h-> of logs per
second that the log collection service can handle, which in this example is 5
logs per second.</p>
<!--
Yes, this is not web scale.
-->


<p>You can see that every so often, logs per second spikes above the
<h->threshold</h->. One way to deal with this is "sampling." Deciding to send
only a fraction of the logs to the log collection service.  Let's send 10% of
the logs.</p>
<p>Below we will see the same simulation again, but this time logs that don't get
sent to our log collection service will be greyed out. The graph has 2 lines: a
black line tracks <h->sent logs</h->, the logs that are sent to our log
collection service, and a grey line tracks <h->total logs</h->.</p>


<p>The rate of <h->sent logs</h-> never exceeds the <h->threshold</h->, so we never
overwhelm our log collection service. However, in the quieter periods we're
throwing away 90% of the logs when we don't need to!</p>
<p>What we really want is to send <em>at most</em> 5 logs per second.  This would mean
that during quiet periods you get all the logs, but during spikes you discard
logs to protect the log collection service.</p>
<p>The simple way to achieve this would be to send the first 5 logs you see each
second, but this isn't fair. You aren't giving all logs an equal chance of being
selected.</p>
<h2 id="sampling-when-you-don-t-know-the-size"><a href="#sampling-when-you-don-t-know-the-size">#</a>
Sampling when you don't know the size</h2>
<p>We instead want to pick a fair sample of all the logs we see each second. The
problem is that we don't know how many we will see. Reservoir sampling is an
algorithm that solves this exact problem.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="confused">
  1 second isn't a long time, can't we just store all the messages we see and
  then use the select method from way back up there?
</s-dog>
<p>You <em>could</em>, but why live with that uncertainty?  You'd be holding on to an
unknown number of logs in memory. A sufficiently big spike could cause you
problems.  Reservoir sampling solves this problem, and does so without ever
using more memory than you ask it to.</p>
<p>Let's go back to our curveball of me showing you 1 card at a time.  Here's a
recap of the rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'll draw cards one at a time from a deck.</li>
<li>Each time I show you a card, you have to choose to hold it or discard it.</li>
<li>If you were already holding a card, you discard your held card before
replacing it with the new card.</li>
<li>At any point I can stop drawing cards and whatever card you're holding is the
one you've chosen.</li>
</ol>
<p>How would you play this game in a way that ensures all cards have been given an
equal chance to be selected when I decide to stop?</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="triumphant">
  How about we flip a coin every new card? If it's heads, we keep the card we
  have. If it's tails, we swap it out for the new card.
</s-dog>
<p>You're on the right track. Let's have a look at how the coin flip idea plays out
in practice. Below you see a deck of cards. Clicking "Deal" will draw a card and
50% of the time it will go to the <h->discard pile</h-> on the right, and 50% of
the time it will become your <h->held card</h-> in the center, with any
previously held card moving to the discard pile.</p>

<p>The problem is that while the <h->hold</h-> vs <h->discard</h-> counts are
roughly equal, which feels fair, later cards are much more likely to be held
when I stop than earlier cards. The first card drawn has to win 10 coin flips to
still be in your hand after the 10th card is drawn. The last card only has to
win 1.</p>
<p>Scrub the slider below to see how the chances change as we draw more cards. Each
bar represents a card in the deck, and the height of the bar is the chance we're
holding that card when I stop. Below the slider are the chances we're
holding the first card drawn vs. the last card drawn.</p>

<p>Anything older than 15 cards ago is has a less than 0.01% chance of being held
when I stop.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="concerned">
  You said I was on the right track! How can this be the right track when I'm
  more likely to win the lottery than to be holding the card I saw 24 draws ago?
</s-dog>
<p>Because believe it or not, we only have to make one small change to this idea
to make it fair.</p>
<p>Instead of flipping a coin to decide if we'll hold the card or not, instead we
give each new card a <code>1/n</code> chance of being held, where <code>n</code> is the number of
cards we've seen so far.</p>
<s-dog position="right" mode="concerned">
  Wait, that's it? That makes it fair?
</s-dog>
<p>Yep! In order to be fair, every card must have an equal chance of being
selected. So for the 2nd card, we want both cards to have a <code>1/2</code> chance.  For
the 3rd card, we want all 3 cards to have a <code>1/3</code> chance. For the 4th card, we
want all 4 cards to have a <code>1/4</code> chance, and so on. So if we use <code>1/n</code> for the
new card, we can at least say that the new card has had a fair shot.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at the chances as you draw more cards with this new
method.</p>

<s-dog position="right" mode="confused">
  I get how each <b>new</b> card has the right chance of being selected, but how
  does that make the <b>older</b> cards fair?
</s-dog>
<p>So far we've focused on the chance of the new card being selected, but we also
need to consider the chance of the card you're holding staying in your hand.
Let's walk through the numbers.</p>
<h3 id="card-1"><a href="#card-1">#</a>
Card 1</h3>
<p>The first card is easy: we're not holding anything, so we always choose to hold
the first card. The chance we're holding this card is <code>1/1</code>, or <code>100%</code>.</p>

<h3 id="card-2"><a href="#card-2">#</a>
Card 2</h3>
<p>This time we have a real choice. We can keep hold of the card we have, or
replace it with the new one. We've said that we're going to do this with a <code>1/n</code>
chance, where <code>n</code> is the number of cards we've seen so far. So our chance of
replacing the first card is <code>1/2</code>, or <code>50%</code>, and our chance of keeping hold of
the first card is its chance of being chosen last time multiplied by its chance
of being replaced, so <code>100% * 1/2</code>, which is again <code>50%</code>.</p>

<h3 id="card-3"><a href="#card-3">#</a>
Card 3</h3>
<p>The card we're holding has a <code>50%</code> chance of being there. This is true
regardless what happened up to this point. No matter whether we're holding card
1 or card 2, it's <code>50%</code>.</p>
<p>The new card has a <code>1/3</code> chance of being selected, so the card we're holding has
a <code>1/3</code> chance of being replaced. This means that our held card has a <code>2/3</code>
chance of remaining held. So its chances of "surviving" this round are <code>50% * 2/3</code>.</p>

<h3 id="card-n"><a href="#card-n">#</a>
Card N</h3>
<p>This pattern continues for as many cards as you want to draw. We can express
both options as formulas.  Drag the slider to substitute <code>n</code> with real numbers
and see that the two formulas are always equal.</p>
<div>
    <p>
      Hold
    </p>
    <p>
      1/(n-1) * (1-(1/n))
    </p>
    <p>
      -
    </p>
  </div>


<p>If <code>1/n</code> is the chance of choosing the new card, <code>1/(n-1)</code> is the chance of
choosing the new card from the previous draw. The chance of <em>not</em> choosing the
new card is the <em>complement</em> of <code>1/n</code>, which is <code>1-(1/n)</code>.</p>
<p>Below are the cards again except this time set up to use <code>1/n</code> instead of a
coin flip. Click to the end of the deck. Does it feel fair to you?</p>

<p>There's a good chance that through the 2nd half of the deck, you never swap
your chosen card. This <em>feels</em> wrong, at least to me, but as we saw above the
numbers say it is completely fair.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-multiple-cards"><a href="#choosing-multiple-cards">#</a>
Choosing multiple cards</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to select a single card, we can extend this to selecting
multiple cards. There are 2 changes we need to make:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rather than new cards having a <code>1/n</code> chance of being selected, they now have
a <code>k/n</code> chance, where <code>k</code> is the number of cards we want to choose.</li>
<li>When we decide to replace a held card, we choose one of the <code>k</code> cards we're
holding at random.</li>
</ol>
<p>So our new previous card selection formula becomes <code>k/(n-1)</code> because we're now
holding <code>k</code> cards. Then the chance that any of the cards we're holding get
replaced is <code>1-(1/n)</code>.</p>
<p>Let's see how this plays out with real numbers.</p>
<div>
    <p>
      Hold
    </p>
    <p>
      k/(n-1) * (1-(1/n))
    </p>
    <p>
      -
    </p>
  </div>


<p>The fairness still holds, and will hold for any <code>k</code> and <code>n</code> pair. This is
because all held cards have an equal chance of being replaced, which keeps them
at an equal likelihood of still being in your hand every draw.</p>
<p>A nice way to implement this is to use an array of size <code>k</code>. For each new card,
generate a random number between 0 and <code>n</code>. If the random number is less than
<code>k</code>, replace the card at that index with the new card.  Otherwise, discard the
new card.</p>

<p>And that's how reservoir sampling works!</p>
<h2 id="applying-this-to-log-collection"><a href="#applying-this-to-log-collection">#</a>
Applying this to log collection</h2>
<p>Let's take what we now know about reservoir sampling and apply it to our log
collection service. We'll set <code>k=5</code>, so we're "holding" at most 5 log messages
at a time, and every second we will send the selected logs to the log collection
service. After we've done that, we empty our array of size 5 and start again.</p>
<p>This creates a "lumpy" pattern in the graph below, and highlights a trade-off
when using reservoir sampling. It's no longer a real-time stream of logs, but
chunks of logs sent at an interval. However, <h->sent logs</h-> never exceeds
the <h->threshold</h->, and during quiet periods the two lines track each other
almost perfectly.</p>


<p>No logs lost during quiet periods, and never more than <h->threshold</h-> logs
per second sent during spikes.  The best of both worlds. It also doesn't store
more than <code>k=5</code> logs, so it will have predictable memory usage.</p>
<h2 id="further-reading"><a href="#further-reading">#</a>
Further reading</h2>
<p>Something you may have thought while reading this post is that some logs are
more valuable than others. You almost certainly want to keep all error logs, for
example.</p>
<p>For that use-case there <em>is</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling#Weighted_random_sampling">weighted</a> variant of reservoir sampling. I
wasn't able to find a simpler explanation of it, so that link is to Wikipedia
which I personally find a bit hard to follow. But the key point is that it
exists and if you need it you can use it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">#</a>
Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reservoir sampling is one of my favourite algorithms, and I've been wanting to
write about it for years now. It allows you to solve a problem that at first
seems impossible, in a way that is both elegant and efficient.</p>
<p>Thank you again to <a href="https://ittybit.com/?ref=sam">ittybit</a> for sponsoring this
post.  I really couldn't have hoped for a more supportive first sponsor. Thank
you for believing in and understanding what I'm doing here.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who read this post and gave their feedback. You made this
post much better than I could have done on my own, and steered me away from
several paths that just weren't working.</p>

<p dir="auto">An eBPF agent that captures traffic flowing through the Linux kernel. By attaching to TLS/SSL functions, data is intercepted before and after encryption and then passed to flexible plugins with full visibility along with all of the available context - process/container/host/user/protocol/etc. Qtap makes it possible to understand what's happening with your egress traffic, without modifying apps, installing proxies, or managing certs.</p>

<p dir="auto">Qtap shows you exactly what data is being sent and received in its original, unencrypted form while operating out-of-band with minimal overhead, without adding latency or disrupting application performance.</p>

<p dir="auto">Qtap can augment your existing observability piplines or can be used as a foundational component for a custom solution, like <a href="https://www.qpoint.io/qtap" rel="nofollow">Qpoint</a>, in a variety of ways, including:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><strong>Security auditing</strong> - Security professionals can verify sensitive data isn't being unintentionally exposed in network communications.</li>
<li><strong>Debugging network issues</strong> - When APIs return errors or connections fail, seeing the actual data being sent helps identify misconfigured parameters, malformed requests, or unexpected responses.</li>
<li><strong>API development</strong> - Developers can verify their applications are sending correctly formatted requests and properly handling responses without modifying code.</li>
<li><strong>Troubleshooting third-party integrations</strong> - When integrating with external services, Qtap helps confirm what data is actually being exchanged versus what documentation claims.</li>
<li><strong>Learning and exploration</strong> - Understanding how protocols actually work by observing real traffic between applications and services.</li>
<li><strong>Legacy system investigation</strong> - When working with poorly documented or legacy systems, Qtap provides insights into how they communicate without requiring source code access.</li>
<li><strong>Validation testing</strong> - Confirming that application changes don't unexpectedly alter network communication patterns.</li>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://ghiculescu.substack.com/p/nobody-codes-here-anymore">https://ghiculescu.substack.com/p/nobody-codes-here-anymore</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43927914">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>There is plenty of commentary online about how AI will replace coding as we know it in the future. There’s huge amounts of prediction about what the future holds.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-1-162309066" href="https://ghiculescu.substack.com/p/nobody-codes-here-anymore#footnote-1-162309066" target="_self" rel="">1</a></span><span> But I haven’t come across many case studies of rolling out the tools that exist today. So here’s some observations.</span></p><p>For context: SaaS product. Ruby on Rails. Mature (12 years) codebase, in good condition. About 40 developers.</p><p><span>We’ve given every developer the option to buy </span><a href="https://www.cursor.com/en" rel="">Cursor</a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/solutions/coding" rel="">Claude Code</a><span>. (I’ll refer to these as Agents for the rest of this article.) If someone wanted to buy another agentic tool that isn’t one of those we’d probably say yes if the price was similar. In a recent informal survey I did, 8 people answered yes to “I use Cursor/Claude Code for most (or all) of my coding”, and 11 to “I alternate between using them and not using them based on the task, it averages out to about 50% of the time”.</span></p><p>I use Claude Code and don’t really like Cursor. The main reason for that is I’m obsessed with Sublime Text as my editor. So having to change to another editor is basically a deal breaker for me. Most other people are more sane, and thus Cursor adoption has been slightly higher than Claude.</p><p><span>They also different things. Claude (particularly with the newest models) likes to write entire features for you, and can sometimes get a bit carried away. </span><a href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices" rel="">Anthropic’s best practices guide</a><span> is a goldmine, and one great suggestion it made that I’ve successfully adopted is asking Claude to make a plan before writing any code, and then telling it to write the code. </span></p><p>By contrast, Cursor (from what I’ve seen) seems to be content making smaller and more self contained changes. It seems less likely to try and write the entire thing and commit it without your consent. Conversely, it seems less capable of doing ambitious one shot prompts.</p><p>In the future, a “senior engineer” might be someone who knows the right agent to use for the given task.</p><p>It’s the question everyone is asking. And to be honest it’s hard to give a totally objective answer. How did you mention developer productivity before agents?</p><p>That said if forced to pick a number I would say I’m about 20% more productive thanks to agents. But there’s a massive grain of salt there. Agents are really helpful for some things, and barely helpful at all for others, so right now it is all about incorporating them into your workflow where it makes sense.</p><p>Some people online who are against agentic coding argue that with a junior developer you can teach them stuff and so they gradually improve over time. But the same can’t be said for agents, they are always going to be as smart as they are today, so if they are as good as a junior dev now they’ll always be only that good. Presumably this applies to domain specific stuff, since LLMs already know all the generic stuff in the world. Regardless, it’s nonsense, and is easily disproven by two observations:</p><ol><li><p>Using agents well changes how you structure your codebase in a way that makes them more able to work with it over time, ie. they get smarter.</p></li><li><p>The quality of LLMs is improving often. The other week ChatGPT added a feature where it remembers everything you’ve ever said to it and incorporates that into context, which sounds a lot to me like a junior picking up domain knowledge and building on it.</p></li></ol><p>So far the biggest limiting factor is remembering to use it. Even people I consider power users (based on their Claude token usage) agree with the sentiment that sometimes you just forget to ask Claude to do a task for you, and end up doing it manually. Sometimes you only notice that Claude could have done it, once you are finished. This happens to me an embarrassing amount.</p><p>I suspect this is less of an issue for Cursor users because it’s always there in your editor, while Claude Code lives in your terminal.</p><p>We have found agents work really well for increasing the ambition of code that gets written. This can mean a few different things:</p><ul><li><p>Our head of product is a reformed lawyer who taught himself to code while working here. He’s shipped 150 PRs in the last 12 months.</p></li><li><p>The product manager he sits next to has shipped 130 PRs in the last 12 months. When we look for easy wins and small tasks for new starters, it’s harder now, because he’s always got an agent chewing through those in the background.</p></li><li><p>We built a new product for a new region with a single developer working solo (with the help of Claude). Previously we did this slower, with teams of people. Those teams are adopting Claude now too, but using it from the start and getting good at using it really helps.</p></li><li><p>I’m sure everyone comes across feature ideas that sound cool but it’s not obvious right now where to start. Like a coding writers block. Turns out typing a prompt is a lot easier than typing the code and it is a great way to unblock and get started on ideas you wouldn’t otherwise try.</p></li></ul><p>Agents are extremely good at helping you understand parts of the codebase you haven’t seen before - just ask them - and I suspect that’s helping a lot here.</p><p>A few times now we’ve tried to connect agents to Linear or Sentry to try and get automatic draft PRs for bug fixing. So far the results have been mixed.</p><p>All you are really doing here is hoping that the Linear ticket (or context in Sentry issue) is enough that the agent can work out the bug and fix it. In other words you’re hoping the ticket works as well as a one shot prompt that a developer would write. Sometimes this happens, and if it does it’s very impressive.</p><p>More often it doesn’t. The issue I’ve found is that in many cases the proposed fix is incorrect, but in a subtle way, where if you don’t know the codebase you’re looking at (or don’t think about it critically enough) you’ll be led astray. It’s easy to see a draft PR with all tests passing, including new tests full of comments, and not realise that the tests are garbage and the fix is wrong. This is less likely to happen if you have taken time to think about the feature &amp; scope beforehand, but much more likely if you see a bug report and a green draft PR ready to go alongside it.</p><p>For this reason we have avoided pushing automatic draft PRs.</p><p>Claude Code is incredibly good at refactors. Particularly if the refactors involve frontend code.</p><p><span>A recent example was to convert a set of screens built into React into our new design system, that’s built on Hotwire and is all rendered serverside. Using </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/ghiculescu/fa28b988c64e4ca9bc442dbd1d976858" rel="">this prompt</a><span> Claude Code came up with an almost right plan. I made a few tweaks and then asked it to write the code, which it did correctly.</span></p><p>It missed a few client side validations that we only found while testing, which is to say that it’s important to still test. I think if I had explicitly asked it to ensure it included all these sorts of validations in my prompt it would have.</p><p>Doing the refactor by hand would have taken me a few hours, so realistically using the agent probably saved me an hour. But it would have been boooooring. Knowing how boring it would be, I’d been putting off doing it forever, even though it was something I really wanted to see done. Agents are underrated for quickly getting through chores.</p><p>Agents work great at doing straightforward tasks using straightforward parts of well documented frameworks.</p><p>You have to be careful with more complex tasks that are below the surface level, where you could get a wide variety of architectures come back and you need to be critical about getting the best one.</p><p><span>For example, I asked an agent to help me ensure that a specific operation could only happen once at any time. I suggested it used locking. It came back with a custom built Redis locking mechanism. After a nudge, it suggested using the Rails cache. After another nudge, a manually executed Postgres advisory lock. After another nudge, it finally settled on Rails’ </span><code>with_lock</code><span> method. Had I not been thinking critically it would have had me introduce new dependencies to solve a problem where tools to fix it were built into the framework.</span></p><p><span>Cursor has a </span><a href="https://www.cursor.com/pricing" rel="">fixed price</a><span>. I suspect they are thinking about pricing the way gyms do: if everyone used Cursor as much as they allow you to, they’d go out of business. But in practice most people use a lot less tokens than they are paying for.</span></p><p>You can see this in practice when you use Claude Code, which is pay-per-token. Our heaviest users are using $50/month of tokens. That’s a lot of tokens.</p><p>I asked our CFO and he said he’d be happy to spend $100/dev/month on agents. To get 20% more productive that’s a bargain.</p><p><span>This critique may only make sense to sufficiently </span><a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine" rel="">DHH-pilled</a><span> people, but so be it. I haven’t yet come across an agent that can write </span><em>beautiful</em><span> code.</span></p><p>That doesn’t mean it can’t write correct code, or (particularly if you prompt it right) succinct code. And it isn’t to say that all code needs to be beautiful. But in some cases the elegance of the code does matter because it says a lot about the elegance - and the quality - of the architecture. Agents still aren’t there in those cases.</p><p><span>The most common thing that makes agentic code ugly is the overuse of comments. I have tried </span><em>everything </em><span>I can think of and apart from prefacing every prompt with “Don’t write comments” I cannot find a way to get agents to not comment every line they write.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-162309066" href="https://ghiculescu.substack.com/p/nobody-codes-here-anymore#footnote-2-162309066" target="_self" rel="">2</a></span></p><p>In the worst case this means rewriting all the code the agent wrote. I still think this is worthwhile. Often writing the prompt and going back and forth will the agent will help you understand the issue better which will lead to you writing your architecture better. And they write code so quickly, it’s not like you’re wasting days before throwing it away and writing it yourself.</p><p>A related issue is that if everyone uses agents, individual coding styles are lost. When you’ve worked with someone for a while you can tell if they wrote some code just by reading it. That is lost when everything goes through an agent. I’m sure in 10 years time this will seem quaint, like mourning over the assembly that powers the C code that sits under Ruby. But for now it makes me a little bit sad sometimes.</p><p>We’ve done a few things to make the codebase easier for agents to reason with.</p><ul><li><p><span>Setting up </span><a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules" rel="">Cursor rules</a><span> and </span><a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview#initialize-your-project" rel="">Claude.md</a><span>. These end up also holding great context for new teammates.</span></p></li><li><p>Making it easy to run tests with a single command. We used to do development &amp; run tests via docker over ssh. It was a good idea at the time. But fixing a few things so that we could run tests locally meant we could ask the agent to run (and fix!) tests after writing code.</p></li></ul><p><span>Many companies have issued mandates for using AI, some of which have </span><a href="https://x.com/tobi/status/1909251946235437514" rel="">leaked</a><span> </span><a href="https://www.capitalbrief.com/article/employment-hero-tracks-employees-in-push-for-ai-first-within-six-weeks-ec8e88ef-9415-4664-8b99-dd1280edf992/preview/" rel="">publicly</a><span>.</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-3-162309066" href="https://ghiculescu.substack.com/p/nobody-codes-here-anymore#footnote-3-162309066" target="_self" rel="">3</a></span></p><p>We haven’t. That doesn’t mean I don’t expect people to try this stuff out, but I think forcing them to do it is silly. If the productivity gains are as significant as I suspect they are, than anyone who has their self interest (or the company’s interests, if they are so inclined) at heart will quickly pick up agentic coding.</p><p>It is a very exciting time to be in software development. I’ve written this a few times, but it’s really true, and every time I write it I then get more impressed with the quality of agentic coding.</p><p>Similar to being good at writing code, being good at using agents is not a binary thing. There’s a sliding scale of quality. In the future there will be 10x prompters just like today there’s 10x developers.</p><p>I think it’s worth trying to get really good at using agents to code, no matter where in your career you are. Even with agents, the hardest thing in programming remains working out what the software should do, and articulating it well. Bashing out the syntax continues to get easier.</p></div></article></div><div id="discussion"><h4>Discussion about this post</h4></div></div>]]></description>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="2.0">For more than two months, the Trump administration has been subject to a federal court order stopping it from cutting funding related to gender identity and the provision of gender-affirming care in response to President Donald Trump’s executive orders.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.0">Lawyers for the federal government have repeatedly claimed in court filings that the administration has been complying with the order.</p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="3.1">But new whistleblower records submitted in a lawsuit led by the Washington state attorney general appear to contradict the claim.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="4.0">Nearly two weeks after the court’s preliminary injunction was issued, the National Institutes of Health’s then-acting head, Dr. Matthew J. Memoli, drafted a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25928836-wa-case_memoli/">memo that details</a> how the agency, in response to Trump’s executive orders, cut funding for research grants that “promote or inculcate gender ideology.” An internal spreadsheet of terminated NIH grants also references “gender ideology” and lists the number associated with Trump’s executive order as the reason for the termination of more than a half dozen research grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="5.0">The Washington attorney general’s allegation that the Trump administration violated a court order comes as the country lurches toward a constitutional crisis amid accusations that the executive branch has defied or ignored court orders in several other cases. In the most high-profile case so far, the administration has <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/nx-s1-5358421/supreme-court-abrego-garcia-deportation-decision">yet to comply with a federal judge’s order</a>, upheld unanimously by the Supreme Court, requiring it to “facilitate” the return of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="7.0">The records filed in the NIH-related lawsuit last week also reveal for the first time the enormous scope of the administration’s changes to the agency, which has been subject to massive layoffs and research cuts to align it with the president’s political priorities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="8.0">Other documents filed in the case raise questions concerning a key claim the administration has made about how it is restructuring federal agencies — that the Department of Government Efficiency has <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/on-doge--directives--and-doj">limited authority</a>, acting mostly as an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/">advisory body that consults</a> on what to cut. However, in depositions filed in the case last week, two NIH officials testified that DOGE itself gave directions in hundreds of grant terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="9.0">The lawsuit offers an unprecedented view into the termination of more than 600 grants at the NIH over the past two months. Many of the canceled grants appear to have focused on subjects that the administration claims are unscientific or that the agency should no longer focus on under new priorities, such as gender identity, vaccine hesitancy and diversity, equity and inclusion. Grants related to <a href="https://x.com/DOGE/status/1895645518912795109?lang=en">research in China</a> have also been cut, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nih-funding-climate-change-public-health">climate change</a> projects are under scrutiny.</p>
        
    
                    
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="11.0">Andrew G. Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, the NIH’s parent agency, told ProPublica in an email that the grant terminations directly followed the president’s executive orders and that the NIH’s actions were based on policy and scientific priorities, not political interference.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="12.0">“The cuts are essential to refocus NIH on key public health priorities, like the chronic disease epidemic,” he said. Nixon also told ProPublica that its questions related to the lawsuit “solely fit a partisan narrative”; he did not respond to specific questions about the preliminary injunction, the administration’s compliance with the order or the involvement of DOGE in the grant termination process. The White House did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="13.0">Mike Faulk, the deputy communications director for the Washington state attorney general’s office, told ProPublica in an email that the administration “appears to have used DOGE in this instance to keep career NIH officials in the dark about what was happening and why.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="14.0">“While claiming to be transparent, DOGE has actively hidden its activities and its true motivations,” he said. “Our office will use every tool we have to uncover the truth about why these grants were terminated.”</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.0">Since Trump took office in January, the administration has provided limited insight into why it  chose to terminate scientific and medical grants. </p>

<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="16.1">That decision-making process has been largely opaque, until now.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Washington Fights to Overturn Grant Termination</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="19.0">In February, Washington state — joined by Minnesota, Oregon, Colorado and three physicians —&nbsp;sued the administration after it threatened to enforce its executive orders by withholding federal research grants from institutions that provided gender-affirming services or promoted “gender ideology.” Within weeks, a federal judge <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.233.0_5.pdf">issued an injunction</a> limiting the administration from fully enforcing the orders in the four states that are party to the suit.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="20.0">The same day as the injunction, however, the NIH terminated a research grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital to develop and study an online education tool designed to reduce the risk of violence, mental health disorders and sexually transmitted infections among transgender youth, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.0.pdf">records filed in the court case</a>. The NIH stated that it was the agency’s policy not to “prioritize” such studies on gender identity.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="21.0">“Research programs based on gender identity are often unscientific, have little identifiable return on investment, and do nothing to enhance the health of many Americans,” the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.1.pdf">notice stated</a>, without citing any scientific evidence for its claims. The NIH sent another notice <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.244.2.pdf">reiterating the termination</a> four days later.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="22.0">The Washington attorney general’s office requested the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.245.3_1.pdf">termination be withdrawn</a>, citing the injunction. But the administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.243.0.pdf">refused</a>, claiming that it was in compliance as the termination was based on NIH’s own authority and grant policy and was not enforcing any executive order.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="23.0">The Washington attorney general asked the judge to hold the administration in contempt for violating the injunction. While the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.258.0_3.pdf">request was denied</a>, the court granted an expedited discovery process to better assess whether the administration had breached the injunction. That process would have required the administration to quickly turn over internal documents relating to the termination. In response, the administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.267.0_1.pdf">reinstated the grant</a> for Seattle Children’s Hospital and declared the discovery process moot, or no longer relevant. However, U.S. District Judge Lauren J. King, who was appointed by former President Joseph Biden, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.273.0_2.pdf">permitted</a> it to continue.</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Whistleblower Documents Reveal Sweeping Changes at NIH</h3>

        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="25.0">In recent months, whistleblowers have <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.275.0.pdf">made the plaintiffs in the lawsuit aware</a> of internal records that more closely connect the grant terminations to the administration’s executive orders.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="26.0">In an <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.276.4.pdf">internal spreadsheet</a> of dozens of grants marked for cancellation at an NIH institute, the stated reason for termination for several was “gender ideology (EA 14168),” including the grant to Seattle Children’s Hospital.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="27.0">The rationale appears to reference Executive Order 14168, which <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/30/2025-02090/defending-women-from-gender-ideology-extremism-and-restoring-biological-truth-to-the-federal">banned using federal funds</a> to “promote gender ideology,” again seeming to conflict with the administration’s stance that the termination was not based on the executive orders. The termination dates of the grants, according to the spreadsheet, were after the injunction went into effect.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="29.0">Another internal document, which provides extraordinary insight into the administration’s efforts to reshape the NIH, also states the executive order was the impetus for grant terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="30.0">In the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.276.5.pdf">March 11 memo from Memoli</a>, the NIH cataloged all actions that the agency had taken thus far to align with the president’s executive orders. In a section detailing the steps taken to implement the “gender ideology” executive order, one of the 44 actions listed was the termination of active grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="31.0">“NIH is currently reviewing all active grants and supplements to determine if they promote gender ideology and will take action as appropriate,” the memo stated, noting that the process was in progress.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="32.0">While the administration has said in court filings that it is following the judge’s injunction order, the Washington state attorney general’s office told ProPublica that it disagreed.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="33.0">“Their claim to have complied with the preliminary injunction is almost laughable,” said Faulk, the office’s deputy communications director. “The Trump administration is playing games with no apparent respect for the rule of law.”</p>
        
    
                    
<h3>Depositions Reveal DOGE Links</h3>
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="34.0">In depositions conducted last month as part of the lawsuit, the testimony of two NIH officials also raised questions about why the research grants were terminated and how DOGE was involved.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="35.0">Liza Bundesen, who was the deputy director of the agency’s extramural research office, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25919695-liza-bundesen-depo/">testified</a> that she first learned of the grant terminations on Feb. 28 from a DOGE team member, Rachel Riley. Bundesen said she was invited into a Microsoft Teams video call, where Riley introduced herself as being <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/">part of DOGE</a> and working with the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="36.0">Riley, a former consultant for McKinsey &amp; Co., joined HHS on Jan. 27, according to <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.277150/gov.uscourts.dcd.277150.80.5.pdf">court filings in a separate lawsuit</a>, and has <a href="https://www.govexec.com/workforce/2025/03/nih-faces-renewed-doge-directive-cut-staff-pre-covid-levels-putting-thousands-line-rifs/403593/">reportedly served</a> as the DOGE point person at the NIH.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="37.0">The <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency-cost-efficiency-initiative/">executive order</a> detailing DOGE’s responsibilities describes the cost-cutting team as advisers that consult agency heads on the termination of contracts and grants. No language in the orders gives the DOGE team members the <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/on-doge--directives--and-doj">authority to direct the cancellation</a> of grants or contracts. However, the depositions portray Riley as giving directions on how to conduct the terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="38.0">“She informed me that a number of grants will need to be terminated,” Bundesen testified, adding that she was told that they needed to be terminated by the end of the day. “I did not ask what, you know, what grants because I just literally was a little bit confused and caught off guard.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="39.0">Bundesen said she then received an email from Memoli, the NIH acting director, with a spreadsheet listing the grants that needed to be canceled and a template letter for notifying researchers of the terminations.</p>
        
    
                        
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="41.0">“The template had boilerplate language that could then be modified for the different circumstances, the different buckets of grants that were to be terminated,” she said. “The categories were DEI, research in China and transgender or gender ideology.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="42.0">Bundesen forwarded the email with the spreadsheet to Michelle Bulls, who directs the agency’s Office of Policy for Extramural Research Administration. Bundesen resigned from the NIH a week later, on March 7, citing “untenable” working conditions.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="43.0">“I was given directives to implement with very short turnaround times, often close of business or maybe within the next hour,” she testified. “I was not offered the opportunity to provide feedback or really ask for clarification.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="44.0">Bulls confirmed in her own deposition that the termination list and letter template originally came from Riley. When Bulls started receiving the lists, she said she did what she was told. “I just followed the directive,” she said. “The language in the letters were provided so I didn’t question.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="45.0">Bulls said she didn’t write any of the letters herself and just signed her name to them. She also said she was not aware whether anyone had assessed the grants’ scientific merit or whether they met agency criteria. The grant terminations related to gender identity did not stem from an independent agency policy, she testified, appearing to contradict the administration’s assertion that they were based on the agency’s <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459/gov.uscourts.wawd.344459.245.3_1.pdf">own authority and grant policy</a>.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="46.0">As of April 3, Bulls said she had received more than five lists of grants that needed to be terminated, amounting to “somewhere between five hundred and a thousand” grants.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="47.0">Most grant recipients endure a rigorous vetting process, which can <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/policy-and-compliance/policy-topics/peer-review/simplifying-review/background">involve multiple stages of peer review</a> before approval, and before this year, Bulls testified that grant terminations at the NIH have historically been rare. There are generally two main types of terminations, she said, for noncompliance or based on mutual agreement. Bulls said that she has been “generally involved in noncompliance discussions” and since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150220033625/https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2012/11/29/oer-welcomes-michelle-bulls/">she became the director</a> of the office in 2012, there had been fewer than five such terminations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="48.0">In addition to the termination letters, Bulls said she relied on the template language provided by Riley to draft guidance to inform the 27 centers and institutes at the NIH what the agency’s new priorities were to help them scrutinize their own research portfolios.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="49.0">Following the depositions, the Washington state attorney general’s office said that the federal government has refused to respond to its discovery requests. It has filed a motion to compel the government to respond, which is pending.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="50.0">Riley, Bundesen, Bulls and Memoli did not reply to ProPublica’s requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="51.0">While the administration did not answer ProPublica’s questions about DOGE and its involvement in the grant terminations, last week in its <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Fiscal-Year-2026-Discretionary-Budget-Request.pdf">budget blueprint</a>, it generally justified its proposed cuts at the NIH with claims that the agency had “wasteful spending,” conducted “risky research” and promoted “dangerous ideologies that undermine public health.”</p>
        
    
                                  
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="53.0">“NIH has grown too big and unfocused,” the White House claimed in its fiscal plan, adding that the agency’s research should “align with the President’s priorities to address chronic disease and other epidemics, implementing all executive orders and eliminating research on climate change, radical gender ideology, and divisive racialism.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="54.0">Jeremy Berg, who led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH from 2003 to 2011, told ProPublica that the administration’s assessment of the institution was “not fair and not based on any substantial analysis or evidence,” and the proposed cuts “would be absolutely devastating to NIH and to biomedical research in the United States.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p data-pp-blocktype="copy" data-pp-id="55.0">“It is profoundly distressing to see this great institution being reduced to a lawless, politicized organization without much focus on its actual mission,” he said.</p>

While Google has set 2030 goals to reach net zero emissions across its operations and value chain, and to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions, on a 2019 basis,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-asks-large-suppliers-to-commit-to-100-renewable-energy-as-emissions-continue-to-rise/">the company recently reported</a>&nbsp;that its emissions increased by 13% in 2023, and are up by 48% since 2019, as its growing data center electricity consumption has outpaced its ability to bring carbon free energy projects online. Google has also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-achieves-zero-lifetime-net-carbon-footprint-now-aiming-for-100-carbon-free-energy/">set a goal</a>&nbsp;in 2020 to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE) by 2030, matching electricity demand with CFE supply every hour of every day, in every region where the company operates.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/google-signs-first-nuclear-energy-deal-to-address-growing-ai-carbon-footprint/">Google signed its first advanced nuclear agreement</a> with nuclear technology company Kairos Power aimed at deploying a fleet of small advanced nuclear power projects across the U.S. to provide up to 500 MW of carbon-free energy.goals.</p> <p>As part of the new agreement with Elementl, Google will commit early-stage development capital to advance the development of three projects, each of which will be able to generate at least 600 MW of power capacity.</p> <p>Amanda Peterson Corio, Global Head of Data Center Energy at Google, said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Google is committed to catalyzing projects that strengthen the power grids where we operate, and advanced nuclear technology provides reliable, baseload, 24/7 energy. Our collaboration with Elementl Power enhances our ability to move at the speed required to meet this moment of AI and American innovation.”</p></blockquote> <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.esgtoday.com/amazon-google-and-meta-join-pledge-to-help-triple-global-nuclear-energy-capacity/">Google and Meta</a> joined a group of major companies pledging to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. The pledge notes that “energy demand in many industries is expected to increase significantly in the coming years,” adding that tripling nuclear capacity will “help achieve global goals for enhanced energy resiliency and security, and continuous firm clean energy supply.”</p> <p>Established in 2023, Elementl Power develops, finances, and manages nuclear power projects, using next-generation technology that it claims is the safest form of energy generation.</p> <p>With the support of Google, Elementl said that it is advancing its goal to bring more than 10 gigawatts online in the U.S. by 2035, working collaboratively with regulated utilities, independent power producers and technology suppliers.</p> <p>Elementl Power Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chris Colbert said:</p> <blockquote><p>“Innovative partnerships like this are necessary to mobilize the capital required to build new nuclear projects, which are critical to deliver safe, affordable and clean baseload power and help companies advance their long-term net zero goals. We look forward to working with Google to execute these projects and bring safe, carbon-free, baseload electricity to the grid.”</p></blockquote> <div id="esgto-864566167"><p><a data-no-instant="1" href="https://www.esgtoday.com/esgtoday-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" aria-label="1280×250"><img alt="" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" width="900" height="180" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NDkwOjk0OQ==-1" src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg" srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1.jpg 1280w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-300x59.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-1024x200.jpg 1024w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-768x150.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-610x119.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/images/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1280x250-1-260x51.jpg 260w"></a></p></div></div> </div>  </article>  <div> <p> <img alt="" itemprop="image" height="96" width="96" nitro-lazy-srcset="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d2e27b1c085c926922a9c0c597d43a6c.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83 2x" nitro-lazy-src="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef5655eaf5fddd7fe4013e3e70d592ee.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83" content="https://www.esgtoday.com/nitropack_static/AjApzYHKTBFsgsoAybETApeNFPMWoZxY/assets/desktop/optimized/rev-5cfe44c/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/ef5655eaf5fddd7fe4013e3e70d592ee.d53ceb0da52c862b51108768da3086bf6f13e9d9a9009a5ff085191c745b7e83" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty="" id="NTAzOjM3MQ==-1" src="data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTAzOjM3MQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTYgOTYiIHdpZHRoPSI5NiIgaGVpZ2h0PSI5NiIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4="> </p> <p> <h4> <span> ESG Today Writing Staff </span> </h4> </p> </div>        </main>  </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><blockquote><p><em>Why splitting your codebase too early can quietly destroy your team’s velocity — and what to do instead</em>.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/frame.jpg" alt="microservice vs monolith"></p><p>In a startup, <strong>your survival depends on how quickly you can iterate, ship features, and deliver value to end-users</strong>. This is where the foundational architecture of your startup plays a big role; additionally, things like your tech stack and choice of programming language directly affect your team’s velocity. The wrong architecture, especially premature microservices, can substantially hurt productivity and contribute to missed goals in delivering software.</p><p>I’ve had this experience when working on greenfield projects for early-stage startups, where questionable decisions were made in terms of software architecture that led to half-finished services and <em>brittle, over-engineered and broken local setups</em>, and <strong>demoralized teams</strong> who struggle maintaining unnecessary complexity.</p><p>Before diving into specific pitfalls, here’s what you’re actually signing up for when introducing microservices prematurely:</p><p><strong>Microservices Early On: What You’re Paying For</strong></p><table><thead><tr><th>Pain Point</th><th>Real-World Manifestation</th><th>Developer Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Deployment Complexity</td><td>Orchestrating 5+ services for a single feature</td><td><strong>Hours lost per release</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Local Dev Fragility</td><td>Docker sprawl, broken scripts, platform-specific hacks</td><td><strong>Slow onboarding, frequent breakage</strong></td></tr><tr><td>CI/CD Duplication</td><td>Multiple pipelines with duplicated logic</td><td><strong>Extra toil per service</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cross-Service Coupling</td><td>“Decoupled” services tightly linked by shared state</td><td><strong>Slower changes, coordination tax</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Observability Overhead</td><td>Distributed tracing, logging, monitoring</td><td><strong>Weeks to instrument properly</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Test Suite Fragmentation</td><td>Tests scattered across services</td><td><strong>Brittle tests, low confidence</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Let’s unpack why microservices often backfire early on, where they genuinely help, and how to structure your startup’s systems for speed and survival.</p><h2 id="monoliths-are-not-the-enemy">Monoliths Are Not the Enemy</h2><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/monolith.svg" alt="Monolith architecture" width="500"></figure><p>If you’re building some SaaS product, even a simple SQL database wrapper eventually may bring a lot of internal complexity in the way your business logic works; additionally, you can get to various integrations and background tasks that let transform one set of data to another.</p><p>With time, sometimes unnecessary features, it’s inevitable that your app may grow messy. The great thing about monoliths is: they still work. <strong>Monoliths, even when messy, keep your team focused on what matters most</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Staying alive</strong></li><li><strong>Delivering customer value</strong></li></ul><p>The biggest advantage of monoliths is their simplicity in deployment. Generally, such projects are built around existing frameworks — it could be Django for Python, ASP.Net for C#, Nest.js for Node.js apps, etc. When sticking to monolithic architecture, you get the biggest advantage over fancy microservices — a wide support of the open source community and project maintainers who primarily designed those frameworks to work as a single process, monolithic app.</p><p>At one real-estate startup where I led the front-end team, and occasionally consulted the backend team on technology choices, we had an interesting evolution of a Laravel-based app. What started as a small dashboard for real-estate agents to manage deals gradually grew into a much larger system.</p><p>Over time, it evolved into a feature-rich suite that handled hundreds of gigabytes of documents and integrated with dozens of third-party services. Yet, it remained built on a fairly basic PHP stack running on Apache.</p><p>The team leaned heavily on best practices recommended by the Laravel community. That discipline paid off, we were able to scale the application’s capabilities significantly while still meeting the business’s needs and expectations.</p><p>Interestingly, we never needed to decouple the system into microservices or adopt more complex infrastructure patterns. We avoided a lot of accidental complexity that way. The simplicity of the architecture gave us leverage. This echoes what others have written — like Basecamp’s take on the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith/">“Majestic Monolith”</a>, which lays out why simplicity is a superpower early on.</p><p>People often point out that it’s hard to make monoliths scalable, but it’s bad modularization <em>inside</em> the monolith that may bring such problems.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: A well-structured monolith keeps your team focused on shipping, not firefighting.</strong></p><h2 id="but-isnt-microservices-best-practice">But Isn’t Microservices “Best Practice”?</h2><p>A lot of engineers reach for microservices early, thinking they’re “the right way.” And sure — at scale, they can help. But in a startup, that same complexity turns into drag.</p><p>Microservices only pay off when you have real scaling bottlenecks, large teams, or independently evolving domains. Before that? You’re paying the price without getting the benefit: duplicated infra, fragile local setups, and slow iteration. For example, <strong>Segment</strong> eventually <a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/">reversed their microservice split</a> for this exact reason — too much cost, not enough value.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Microservices are a scaling tool — not a starting template.</strong></p><h2 id="where-microservices-go-wrong-especially-early-on">Where Microservices Go Wrong (Especially Early On)</h2><p>In one early-stage team I advised, the decision to split services created more PM-engineering coordination overhead than technical gain. Architecture shaped not just code, but how we planned, estimated, and shipped. That organizational tax is easy to miss — until it’s too late.</p><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/pm-coordination.svg" alt="Coordination between teams" width="600"></figure><p><em><strong>Diagram:</strong> Coordination overhead grows linearly with services — and exponentially when you add product managers, deadlines, and misaligned timelines.</em></p><p>Here are the most common anti-patterns that creep in early.</p><h3 id="1-arbitrary-service-boundaries">1. Arbitrary Service Boundaries</h3><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/premature-microservice.svg" alt="Arbitrary service boundaries in microservices" width="600"></figure><p>In theory, you often see suggestions on splitting your applications by business logic domain — users service, products service, orders service, and so on. This often borrows from Domain-Driven Design or Clean Architecture concepts — which make sense at scale, but in early-stage products, they can ossify structure prematurely, before the product itself is stable or validated. You end up with:</p><ul><li>Shared databases</li><li>Cross-service calls for simple workflows</li><li>Coupling disguised as “separation”</li></ul><p>At one project, I watched a team separating user, authentication, and authorization into separate services, which led to deployment complexity and difficulties in service coordination for any API operation they were building.</p><p>In reality, business logic doesn’t directly map to service boundaries. Premature separation can make the system more fragile and often times difficult to introduce changes quickly.</p><p>Instead, isolate bottlenecks surgically — based on real scaling pain, not theoretical elegance.</p><p>When I’ve coached early-stage teams, we’ve sometimes used internal flags or deployment toggles to simulate future service splits — without the immediate operational burden. This gave product and engineering room to explore boundaries organically, before locking in premature infrastructure.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Don’t split by theory — split by actual bottlenecks.</strong></p><h3 id="2-repository-and-infrastructure-sprawl">2. Repository and Infrastructure Sprawl</h3><p>When working on the application, typically a next set of things is important:</p><ul><li>Code style consistency (linting)</li><li>Testing infrastructure, including integration testing</li><li>Local environment configuration</li><li>Documentation</li><li>CI/CD configuration</li></ul><p>When dealing with microservices, you need to multiply those requirements by the number of services. If your project is structured as a monorepo, you can simplify your life by having a central CI/CD configuration (when working with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI). Some teams separate microservices into separate repositories, which makes it way harder to maintain the code consistency and the same set of configurations without extra effort or tools.</p><p><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/tests.svg" alt="tests environments diagram"></p><p>For a three-person team, this is brutal. Context switching across repositories and tooling adds up to the development time of every feature that is shipped.</p><h4 id="mitigating-issues-by-using-monorepos-and-a-single-programming-language">Mitigating issues by using monorepos and a single programming language</h4><p>There are various ways to mitigate this problem. For early projects, the single most important thing is — keeping your code in a monorepo. This ensures that there’s a single version of code that exists on prod, and it’s much easier to coordinate code reviews and collaborate for smaller teams.</p><p>For Node.js projects, I strongly recommend using a monorepo tool like <code>nx</code> or <code>turborepo</code>. Both:</p><ul><li>Simplify CI/CD config across subprojects</li><li>Support dependency graph-based build caching</li><li>Let you treat internal services as TypeScript libraries (via ES6 imports)</li></ul><p>These tools save time otherwise spent writing glue code or reinventing orchestration. That said, they come with real tradeoffs:</p><ul><li>Complex dependency trees can grow fast</li><li>CI performance tuning is non-trivial</li><li>You may need faster tooling (like bun) to keep build times down</li></ul><p>To summarize: Tooling like <code>nx</code> or <code>turborepo</code> gives small teams monorepo velocity — if you’re willing to invest in keeping them clean.</p><p>When developing <code>go</code>-based microservices, a good idea early in the development is to use a single <code>go</code> workspace with the <code>replace</code> directive in <code>go.mod</code>. Eventually, as the software scales, it’s possible to effortlessly separate <code>go</code> modules into separate repositories.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: A monorepo with shared infra buys you time, consistency, and sanity.</strong></p><h3 id="3-broken-local-dev--broken-velocity">3. Broken Local Dev = Broken Velocity</h3><p><strong>If it takes three hours, a custom shell script, and a Docker marathon just to run your app locally, you’ve already lost velocity.</strong></p><p>Early projects often suffer from:</p><ul><li>Missing documentation</li><li>Obsolete dependencies</li><li>OS-specific hacks (hello, Linux-only setups)</li></ul><p>In my experience, when I received projects from past development teams, they were often developed for a single operating system. Some devs preferred building on macOS and never bothered supporting their shell scripts on Windows. In my past teams, I had engineers working on Windows machines, and often it required rewriting shell scripts or fully understanding and reverse engineering the process of getting the local environment running. With time, we standardized environment setup across dev OSes to reduce onboarding friction — a small investment that saved hours per new engineer. It was frustrating — but it taught a lasting lesson on how important it is to get the code running on any laptop your new developer may be using.</p><p>At another project, a solo dev had created a fragile microservice setup, that the workflow of running Docker containers mounted to a local file system. Of course, you pay a little price for running processes as containers when your computer runs Linux.</p><p>But onboarding a new front-end dev with an older Windows laptop turned into a nightmare. They had to spin up ten containers just to view the UI. Everything broke — volumes, networking, container compatibility — and the setup very poorly documented. This created a major friction point during onboarding.</p><p>We ended up hacking together a Node.js proxy that mimicked the nginx/Docker configuration without containers. It wasn’t elegant, but it let the dev get unblocked and start contributing.</p><figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/dev-env.svg" alt="complex dev environment in microservices" width="600"></figure><p><strong>Takeaway: If your app only runs on one OS, your team’s productivity is one laptop away from disaster.</strong></p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ideally, aim for <code>git clone &lt;repo&gt; &amp;&amp; make up</code> to have the project running locally. If it’s not possible, then maintaining an up-to-date README file with instructions for Windows/macOS/Linux is a must. Nowadays, there are some programming languages and toolchains that don’t work well on Windows (like OCaml), but the modern widely popular stack runs just fine on every widely used operating system; by limiting your local setup to a single operating system, it’s often a symptom of under-investment in DX.</p><h3 id="4-technology-mismatch">4. Technology Mismatch</h3><p>Beyond architecture, your tech stack also shapes how painful microservices become — not every language shines in a microservice architecture.</p><ul><li><strong>Node.js and Python:</strong> Great for rapid iteration, but managing build artifacts, dependency versions, and runtime consistency across services gets painful fast.</li><li><strong>Go:</strong> Compiles to static binaries, fast build times, and low operational overhead. More natural fit when splitting is truly needed.</li></ul><p>It’s very important to pick the right technical stack early on. If you look for performance, maybe look for the JVM and its ecosystem and ability to deploy artifacts at scale and run them in microservice-based architectures. If you do very fast iterations and prototype quickly without worrying about scaling your deployment infrastructure — you’re good with something like Python.</p><p>It’s quite often for teams to realise that there are big issues with their choice of technology that wasn’t apparent initially, and they had to pay the price of rebuilding the back-end in a different programming language (like <a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/?utm_source=blog.quastor.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=khan-academy-s-migration-from-python-to-go">those guys</a> were forced to do something about legacy Python 2 codebase and migrated to Go).</p><p>But on the contrary, if you really need to, you can bridge multiple programming languages with protocols like <strong>gRPC</strong> or async message communication. And it’s often the way to go about things. When you get to the point that you want to enrich your feature set with Machine Learning functionality or ETL-based jobs, you would just separately build your ML-based infrastructure in Python, due to its rich ecosystem of domain-specific libraries, that naturally any other programming language lacks. But such decisions should be made when there’s enough head count to justify this venture; otherwise, the small team will be eternally drawn into the endless complexity of bridging multiple software stacks together.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Match the tech to your constraints, not your ambition.</strong></p><h3 id="5-hidden-complexity-communication-and-monitoring">5. Hidden Complexity: Communication and Monitoring</h3><p>Microservices introduce an invisible web of needs:</p><ul><li>Service discovery</li><li>API versioning</li><li>Retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks</li><li>Distributed tracing</li><li>Centralized logging and alerting</li></ul><p>In a monolith, a bug might be a simple stack trace. In a distributed system, it’s “why does service A fail when B’s deployment lags C by 30 seconds?”
You would have to thoroughly invest in your observability stack. To do it “properly”, it requires instrumenting your applications in specific ways, e.g. integrating OpenTelemetry to support tracing, or relying on your cloud provider’s tools like AWS XRay if you go with a complex serverless system. But at this point, you have to completely shift your focus from application code towards building complex monitoring infrastructure that to validate whether your architecture is <strong>actually</strong> functioning in production.</p><p>Of course, some of the observability instrumentation is needed to be performed on monolith apps, but it’s way simpler than doing that in terms of the number of services in a consistent way.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> Understand that <strong>distributed systems <em>aren’t free.</em></strong> They’re a commitment to a whole new class of engineering challenges.</p><h2 id="when-microservices-do-make-sense">When Microservices <em>Do</em> Make Sense</h2><p>Despite the mentioned difficulties with microservices, there are times where service-level decoupling actually is very beneficial. There are cases where it definitely helps:</p><ul><li><strong>Workload Isolation</strong>: a common example for that would be in AWS best practices on using S3 event notifications — when an image gets loaded to S3, trigger an image resizing/OCR process, etc. Why it is useful: we can decouple obscure data processing libraries in a self-isolated service and make it API focused solely on image processing and generating output from the uploaded data. Your upstream clients that upload data to S3 aren’t coupled with this service, and there’s less overhead in instrumenting such a service because of its relative simplicity.</li><li><strong>Divergent Scalability Needs:</strong> — Imagine you are building an AI product. One part of the system (<strong>web API</strong>) that triggers ML workloads and shows past results isn’t resource intensive, it’s lightweight, because it interacts mostly with the database. On the contrary, ML model runs on GPUs is actually heavy to run and requires special machines with GPU support with additional configuration. By splitting these parts of the application into separate services running on different machines, you can scale them independently.</li><li><strong>Different Runtime Requirements:</strong> — Let’s say you’ve got some legacy part of code written in C++. You have 2 choices — magically convert it to your core programming language or find ways to integrate it with a codebase. Depending on the complexity of that legacy app, you would have to write glue code, implementing additional networking/protocols to establish interactions with that service, but the bottom line is — you will likely have to separate this app as a separate service due to runtime incompatibilities. I would say even more, you could write your main app in C++ as well, but because of different compiler configurations and library dependencies, you wouldn’t be able to easily compile things together as a single binary.</li></ul><p>Large-scale engineering orgs have wrestled with similar challenges. For instance, Uber’s engineering team <a href="https://www.uber.com/en-HR/blog/microservice-architecture/">documented their shift to a domain-oriented microservice architecture</a> — not out of theoretical purity, but in response to real complexity across teams and scaling boundaries. Their post is a good example of how microservices can work when you have the organizational maturity and operational overhead to support them.</p><p>At one project, that also happens to be a real-estate one, we had code from a previous team that runs Python-based analytics workloads that loads data into MS-SQL db, we found that it would be a waste to build on top of it a Django app. The code had different runtime dependencies and was pretty self-isolated, so we kept it separate and only revisited it when something wasn’t working as expected. This worked for us even for a small team, because this analytics generation service was a part that required rare changes or maintenance.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Use microservices when workloads diverge — not just because they sound clean.</strong></p><h2 id="practical-guidance-for-startups">Practical Guidance for Startups</h2><p>If you’re shipping your first product, here’s the playbook I’d recommend:</p><ul><li><strong>Start monolithic.</strong> Pick a common framework and focus on getting the features done. All known frameworks are more than good enough to build some API or website and serve the users. Don’t follow the hype, stick to the boring way of doing things; you can thank yourself later.</li><li><strong>Single repo.</strong> Don’t bother splitting your code into multiple repositories. I’ve worked with founders who wanted to separate repos to reduce the risk of contractors copying IP — a valid concern. But in practice, it added more friction than security: slower builds, fragmented CI/CD, and poor visibility across teams. The marginal IP protection wasn’t worth the operational drag, especially when proper access controls inside a monorepo were easier to manage. For early-stage teams, clarity and speed tend to matter more than theoretical security gains.</li><li><strong>Dead-simple local setup.</strong> Make <code>make up</code> work. If it takes more, be very specific on the steps, record a video/Loom, and add screenshots. If your code is going to be run by an intern or junior dev, they’ll likely hit a roadblock, and you’ll spend time explaining how to troubleshoot an issue. I found that documenting every possible issue for every operating system eliminates time spent clarifying why certain things in a local setup didn’t work.</li><li><strong>Invest early in CI/CD.</strong> Even if it’s a simple HTML that you could just <code>scp</code> to a server manually, you could automate this and rely on source control with CI/CD to do it. When the setup is properly automated, you just forget about your continuous integration infrastructure and focus on features. I’ve seen many teams and founders when working with outsourced teams often be cheap on CI/CD, and that results in the team being demoralized and annoyed by manual deployment processes.</li><li><strong>Split surgically.</strong> Only split when it clearly solves a painful bottleneck. Otherwise, invest in modularity and tests inside the monolith — it’s faster and easier to maintain.</li></ul><p>And above all: <strong>optimize for developer velocity.</strong></p><p><strong>Velocity is your startup’s oxygen.</strong> Premature microservices leak that oxygen slowly — until one day, you can’t breathe.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: Start simple, stay pragmatic, and split only when you must.</strong></p><h2 id="if-you-go-with-a-microservice-based-approach">If you go with a microservice-based approach</h2><p>I had micro-service-based projects created earlier than they should have been done, and here are the next recommendations that I could give on that:</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluate your technical stack</strong> that powers your micro-service-based architecture. Invest in developer experience tooling. When you have service-based separation, you now need to think about automating your microservice stack, automating config across both local and production environments. In certain projects, I had to build a separate CLI that does administrative tasks on the monorepository. One project I had contained 15-20 microservice deployments, and for the local environment, I had to create a cli-tool for generating docker-compose.yml files dynamically to achieve seamless one-command start-up for the regular developer.</li><li><strong>Focus on reliable communication protocols</strong> around service communication. If it’s async messaging, make sure your message schemas are consistent and standardized. If it’s REST, focus on OpenAPI documentation. Inter-service communication clients must implement many things that don’t come out-of-the-box: retries with exponential backoff, timeouts. A typical bare-bones gRPC client requires you to manually factor those additional things to make sure you don’t suffer from transient errors.</li><li><strong>Ensure that your unit, integration testing, and end-to-end testing setup</strong> is stable and scales with the amount of service-level separations you introduce into your codebase.</li><li>On smaller projects that use micro-service-based workloads, you would likely default to a shared library with common helpers for instrumenting your observability, communication code in a consistent way. An important consideration here — <strong>keep your shared library as small as possible</strong>. Any major change forces a rebuild across all dependent services — even if unrelated.<figure><img src="https://nexo.sh/posts/microservices-for-startups/shared-dep.svg" alt="shared library dependency" width="600"></figure></li><li><strong>Look into observability earlier on.</strong> Add structured-JSON logs and create various correlation IDs for debugging things once your app is deployed. Even basic helpers that output rich logging information (until you instrumented your app with proper logging/tracing facilities) often save time figuring out flaky user flows.</li></ul><p>To summarize: if you’re still going for microservices, you should beforehand understand the tax you’re going to pay in terms of additional development time and maintenance to make the setup workable for every engineer in your team.</p><p><strong>Takeaway: If you embrace complexity, invest fully in making it manageable.</strong></p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p><strong>Premature microservices are a tax you can’t afford. Stay simple. Stay alive.</strong> Split only when the pain makes it obvious.</p><p><strong>Survive first. Scale later. Choose the simplest system that works — and earn every layer of complexity you add.</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html">Monolith First</a> — Martin Fowler</li><li><a href="https://signalvnoise.com/svn3/the-majestic-monolith">The Majestic Monolith</a> — DHH / Basecamp</li><li><a href="https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices">Goodbye Microservices: From 100s of problem children to 1 superstar</a> — Segment Eng.</li><li><a href="https://shopify.engineering/deconstructing-monolith-designing-software-maximizes-developer-productivity">Deconstructing the Monolith</a> — Shopify Eng.</li><li><a href="https://www.uber.com/blog/microservice-architecture/">Domain‑Oriented Microservice Architecture</a> — Uber Eng.</li><li><a href="https://blog.khanacademy.org/go-services-one-goliath-project/">Go + Services = One Goliath Project</a> — Khan Academy</li></ul></div></div>]]></description>

But it is.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>French <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gendarmerie"><em>gendarmes</em></a> have been busy policing crypto crimes, but these aren't the usual financial schemes, cons, and <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp">HODL!</a> shenanigans one usually reads about. No, these crimes involve abductions, (multiple) severed fingers, and (multiple) people rescued from the trunks of cars—once after being doused with gasoline.</p>
<p>This previous weekend was particularly nuts, with an older gentleman snatched from the streets of Paris' 14th <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrondissements_of_Paris"><em>arrondissement</em></a> on May 1 by men in ski masks. The 14th is a pleasant place—I highly recommend a visit to the catacombs in Place Denfert-Rochereau—and not usually the site of snatch-and-grab operations. The abducted man was apparently the father of someone who had made a packet in crypto. The kidnappers demanded a multimillion-euro ransom from the man's son.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2025/05/04/abducted-dad-of-crypto-firm-boss-freed-in-french-police-raid_6740891_7.html%20">Le Monde</a>, the abducted father was taken to a house in a Parisian suburb, where one of the father's fingers was cut off in the course of ransom negotiations. Police feared "other mutilations" if they were unable to find the man, but they did locate and raid the house this weekend, arresting five people in their 20s. (According to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/kidnapped-father-french-crypto-millionaire-150730032.html?guccounter=1">the BBC</a>, French police used "phone signals" to locate the house.)</p>
<p>Sounds crazy, but this was the second such incident this year. In January, crypto maven David Balland was also abducted along with his partner on January 21. Balland was taken to a house, where he also had a finger cut off. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/04/french-police-investigate-spate-of-cryptocurrency-millionaire-kidnappings">The Guardian</a><em>,</em> "Police were contacted by Balland’s business partner, who received a video of the finger alongside a demand for a large ransom in cryptocurrency, of around €10m. Balland was freed in a police raid soon after. His partner was found tied up in the boot of a car in a carpark in the Essonne area south of Paris the next day."</p>
<p>And a few weeks before that, attackers went to the home of someone whose son was a "crypto-influencer based in Dubai." At the father's home, the kidnappers "tied up [the father's] wife and daughter and forced him into a car. The man’s influencer son received a ransom demand and contacted police. The two women were then quickly freed. The father was only discovered 24 hours later in the boot of a car in Normandy, tied up and showing signs of physical violence, having been sprinkled with petrol."</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            

<p>Yggdrasil is an experimental compact routing scheme that is <strong>fully decentralised</strong> and only requires a small amount of state to work. It is predominanently a shortest-path scheme, whereby the network will attempt to find the most direct path to the destination.</p>

<p><img src="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/assets/images/about/first.svg"></p>

<p>Nodes are equal participants and connect to each other using <strong>peering connections</strong> which carry network traffic. Peerings can be set up over any IP network — whether that’s a direct wired or wireless link, a local area network or even the Internet. In some cases, peerings can also be set up automatically by nearby devices on the same network using multicast discovery.</p>

<p>All nodes on an Yggdrasil network are routers and will automatically pass traffic to help it get closer to its destination where possible. This means that, even in a network that is only sparsely connected, <strong>all nodes will be reachable</strong> by all other nodes on that network. It doesn’t even matter if a node is behind a NAT — once a peering is established, traffic flows in both directions over that peering.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil is also designed to tolerate changes in the network. For example, if a link fails, the network will self-heal and use other links to route traffic where available. This makes it <strong>suitable for use in mesh networks</strong>, where the network topolopy can and often will change.</p>

<p>Each node on the network has a location-independent <strong>cryptographic identity</strong> and, in our <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">current experimental implementation</a>, stable IPv6 addresses are generated from this key. This allows IPv6-supporting applications to work over Yggdrasil largely without modification. The address is fully mobile and stays with the node as it moves around the network.</p>

<h3 id="why-yggdrasil">Why Yggdrasil?</h3>

<p>Many networks that exist today are hierarchical in nature, require extensive manual configuration and often rely on a certain degree of centralisation in order to scale. This often makes it difficult or impractical to set up networks quickly on an ad-hoc basis and so most people are heavily reliant on their Internet Service Providers (ISPs).</p>

<p>On the other hand, Yggdrasil requires <strong>very little configuration</strong> in order to work and full multi-hop networks can be built up very quickly and easily using Yggdrasil.</p>

<p>Nodes do not need to be assigned an address from a centralised authority; they can <strong>generate their own cryptographic identity</strong> and, more importantly, they can keep this address as they roam. Once peering connections are established, routing information is propagated quickly and automatically throughout the network.</p>

<p>This ability to provide full end-to-end routability between all network nodes means that Yggdrasil is potentially an enabling technology for true edge computing scenarios, as well as real-world mesh networks, as it <strong>does not rely on the Internet</strong> to function.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-yggdrasil-compare-to-other-projects">How does Yggdrasil compare to other projects?</h3>

<p>Yggdrasil is often compared to other projects attempting to create anonymous overlays, such as Tor, I2P, Lokinet and others. These projects are very different to Yggdrasil, in part because they try to guarantee anonymity. Yggdrasil does not aim to provide and <strong>does not guarantee anonymity</strong>. These projects are also intentionally overlay-by-design rather than by convenience, whereas Yggdrasil only exists as an overlay network today because it is an easy way to test the design.</p>

<p>Yggdrasil is frequently compared with VPN projects such as Wireguard, Tailscale, Nebula and Zerotier. Although it is possible to use Yggdrasil to build up private networks and/or point-to-point VPN links, this isn’t explicitly our primary goal. It’s also important to understand that connecting any single node of a private network to another network (such as a public peer) will result in <strong>both networks being bridged together</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, Yggdrasil has <strong>no native exit nodes</strong>, nor does it have any concept of exit nodes, for providing access to the public Internet or to other networks. This can be achieved using proxies or other tunnelling solutions on top of Yggdrasil but this is not something we explicitly aim to provide.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-status-of-the-project">What is the status of the project?</h3>

<p>Yggdrasil is currently an <strong>alpha-level research project</strong>, with on-going development but actively maintained. Our expectation is that a future beta-quality release should know enough to be compatible in the face of wire format changes, and reasonably feature complete. A “stable” 1.0 release, if it ever happens, would probably be feature complete, with no expectation of future wire format changes, and free of known critical bugs.</p>

<p>The true goal of this project is to test the scalability of the Yggdrasil routing scheme and we are doing so with our <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/implementation.html">overlay network implementation</a>. Studying the behaviour of the network in the real world is most easily achieved with a large number of participants running the software and joining the public test network. We’ve done our best to support <a href="https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation.html">as many platforms as possible</a> and have a number of <a href="https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/public-peers">public peers</a> that you can connect to in order to join the network, so please feel free to experiment.</p>

<p>That said, we <strong>recommend against running any mission-critical workloads</strong> over Yggdrasil and it may be dangerous to rely solely on Yggdrasil for any life-or-death situation. There may be failure modes that we don’t yet know about yet!</p>

<p>The project is likely to reach a number of possible outcomes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The project may reach a reasonably stable state but never attract a large enough number of users</li>
  <li>The project may attract a large enough number of users but reveal inherent design flaws in the process (a learning exercise for a future project or protocol version perhaps)</li>
  <li>The project may end up working perfectly even as the network grows, in which case it will become worthwhile to look at writing better-optimised implementations and/or moving the important parts into other projects</li>
</ol>
