<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-8302647573373825375" itemprop="description articleBody">
<p>The Minuteman missile was introduced in 1962 as a key part of America's nuclear deterrent.
The Minuteman III missile is currently the only US land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), with
400 missiles ready for launch, spread across five central states.<span id="fnref:counts"><a href="#fn:counts">1</a></span>
The missile contains a precision guidance system, capable of delivering a warhead to a target 13,000 km away (8000 miles) with an
<a href="https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/minuteman-iii/">accuracy</a> of 200 meters (660 feet).</p>
<p>The diagram below shows the guidance system of the Minuteman III missile (1970).
This guidance system contains over 17,000 electronic and mechanical parts, <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0877971.pdf#page=279">costing</a> $510,000 (about $4.5 million in current dollars).
The heart of the guidance system is the gyro stabilized platform, which uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to measure the missile's orientation and acceleration.
The computer uses the measurements from the platform to determine the missile's position and guide the missile on its trajectory
to the target. Other key components are the missile guidance set controller, which contains electronics to support the gyro stabilized platform, and the
amplifier, which interfaces the computer with the rest of the missile.
In this blog post, I take a close look at the components of the guidance system that was used until the early 2000s.<span id="fnref:disclaimers"><a href="#fn:disclaimers">2</a></span></p>

<p>Fundamentally,
the guidance computer constantly compares the missile position to the desired trajectory and generates the appropriate
steering commands to keep the missile on track.<span id="fnref:algorithms"><a href="#fn:algorithms">3</a></span>
The diagram below shows how directing the engine nozzles causes the missile to rotate around its three axes: roll, pitch, and yaw.<span id="fnref:nozzles"><a href="#fn:nozzles">4</a></span>
In the silo, the roll angle (the azimuth) is aligned with the direction to the target.
The missile takes off vertically and then the missile gradually rotates along the pitch axis to tilt over toward the target.
During flight, adjustments along all three axes keep the missile on target.
The Minuteman III has four rocket stages so the guidance computer jettisons each rocket stage and ignites the next stage in sequence.</p>
<!--
For an analogy, if you're standing up, the roll axis determines what direction you're facing, and you can roll by shuffling your
feet in a circle.
The analogy is if you bend forward at the hips and pitch yourself forward; note that the pitch axis is left-right, but your
motion is forward-backward.
If you're standing, yaw would be the equivalent of bending side-to-side as a yoga stretch. Again, the axis (front-back through your
belly button) is orthogonal to the direction of motion (left-right). (Of course, the rocket is moving rigidly, not bending.)
-->

<h2>The guidance platform</h2>
<p>The idea behind inertial navigation is to keep track of the missile's position by constantly measuring its acceleration.
By integrating the acceleration, you get the velocity. And by integrating the velocity, you get the position.
Inertial navigation is self-contained, a big advantage for a missile since the enemy can't jam your navigation.
The hard part is measuring the acceleration and angles with extreme accuracy, since even tiny errors are multiplied as
the missile travels.</p>
<p>In more detail, the Minuteman's inertial guidance is built around a gyroscopically stabilized platform, which is
kept in a fixed orientation. The platform is
mounted on two beryllium gimbals. Feedback from gyroscopes drives three torque motors to rotate the gimbals to keep
the stable platform in exactly the same orientation
no matter how the missile twists and turns.</p>
<!-- The Atlas missile (1957) was originally guided by sending it commands from the ground, but the Atlas E (1961) moved to an all-inertial system. The Minuteman kept the inertial approach. -->

<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/imu-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The Minuteman III stable platform.

Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="700"></a></p>
<p>The diagram below shows the components of the stable platform, in approximately the same orientation as the photo above.
Three accelerometers are mounted on the stable platform to measure acceleration. The accelerometers are oriented along three perpendicular axes so each one measures acceleration along one axis.
(The accelerometer axes are not aligned with the platform axes; this distributes the acceleration (mostly "up") across the 
accelerometers, increasing accuracy.)
The two alignment mirrors allow the stable platform to be aligned with a precise device called an autocollimator, as will be described below.
The gyrocompass uses the Earth's rotation to precisely determine North, providing a backup alignment technique.
Both the alignment mirrors and the gyrocompass can be rotated to a precise angle, reported by the resolver.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/platform.jpg"><img alt="The stable platform for Minuteman II and III. Modified from Minuteman weapon system history and description." height="454" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/platform-w600.jpg" title="The stable platform for Minuteman II and III. Modified from Minuteman weapon system history and description." width="600"></a></p>
<p>To target a Minuteman I missile, the missile had to be physically rotated in the silo to be aligned with the target,
an angle called the launch azimuth.
This angle had to be extremely precise, since even a tiny angle error will be greatly magnified over the missile's journey.
Aligning the missile was a tedious process that used the North Star to determine North.
Since the star was not visible from inside the silo, a complex surveying technique was used, using a surveyor's theodolite to measure the angles between the North Star and three concrete monuments outside the silo.
Inside the silo, the closest monument was visible through a sighting tube, allowing the precise angle measurement to be
transferred to the silo.
After many more measurements inside the silo, a special device called an autocollimator was positioned precisely 90° from
the desired launch azimuth.
The autocollimator shot a beam of light through a window in the side of the missile, where it bounced off a mirror
on the stable platform and returned to the autocollimator.
If the returning beam wasn't exactly parallel, the autocollimator sent a signal to the missile, causing the stable platform to
rotate as needed.
The result of this process was that the stable platform was exactly aligned with the desired angle to the target.<span id="fnref:azimuth"><a href="#fn:azimuth">5</a></span></p>
<p>The guidance platform was completely redesigned for Minuteman II and III, eliminating the time-consuming alignment that
Minuteman I required.
The new platform had an alignment block with rotating mirrors.
Instead of rotating the missile, the autocollimator remained fixed in the East position and the mirror (and thus the
stable platform) was rotated to the desired launch azimuth.
The new guidance platform also added a gyrocompass under the alignment block, a special compass that could precisely align itself to North by precessing against the Earth's rotation.
At first, the gyrocompass was used as a backup check against the autocollimator, but eventually the gyrocompass became the primary alignment.
For calibration, the alignment block also includes electrolytic bubble levels to position the stable platform in known orientations with respect to local gravity.<span id="fnref:calibrations"><a href="#fn:calibrations">6</a></span></p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mirrors.jpg"><img alt="The alignment block with mirrored surfaces. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="407" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mirrors-w450.jpg" title="The alignment block with mirrored surfaces. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="450"></a></p>
<p>The photo above shows the alignment block on top of the gyrocompass.
The front and back of the block are the precision mirrors that reflect the light beam from the autocollimator.
The circles on top of the block and at the right are two level detectors, with set screws for exact adjustment.
The platform has four level detectors, allowing it to be aligned against gravity in multiple positions.
Like the gimbals, the gyrocompass assembly is made of beryllium due to its rigidity and light weight; it has a warning sticker because beryllium is highly toxic.</p>
<p>The diagram below shows how the axes align with the gimbals of the stable platform.<span id="fnref:axes"><a href="#fn:axes">7</a></span>
Note the window at the top of the photo.
Light from the autocollimator shines in through the window, reflects off the mirror on the alignment block, and returns through
the window to the autocollimator. 
The autocollimator detects any error in alignment and signals the guidance system to correct its position accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/coordinates.jpg"><img alt="Coordinate system for the stable platform.

<p>The stable platform uses gyroscopes to maintain its fixed orientation as the missile turns.
The idea behind a gyroscope is that a spinning disk will tend to maintain its spin axis.
The problem is that any friction, even from precision ball bearings, will reduce the accuracy.
The solution in the Minuteman is a "gas bearing", where the gyroscope rotor is supported by an extremely thin layer of hydrogen.
As shown below, the gyroscope is built around a stationary marble-sized ball (blue), fastened to the gyroscope frame at the top and bottom.
The rotor (pink) is clamped around the equator of the ball and spins at high speed, powered by an induction motor (windings green, rotor yellow).
If the gyroscope frame is tilted, the rotor will stay in its orientation. The resulting change in angle between the frame and the rotor is detected by sensitive capacitive pickups (purple).
The gyroscope is sensitive to tilt in two axes: left-right, and front-back.
Since nothing touches the rotor except the thin layer of gas around the ball, the influence of friction is minimal.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/gyroscope.jpg"><img alt="A gas-bearing gyroscope. Based on patent 3,025,708." height="379" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/gyroscope-w450.jpg" title="A gas-bearing gyroscope. Based on patent 3,025,708." width="450"></a></p>
<p>A gas-bearing gyroscope has the problem that when it starts or stops, the gas layer dissipates, allowing the rotor and the bearing to rub.
The Minuteman missile's guidance system was kept continuously running, so starts and stops were infrequent.
Moreover, when the gyroscope did need to be started, the electronics gave it a 40-volt jolt to get it up to speed quickly.
Because the Minuteman's guidance system was always running—and its solid-fuel engines didn't require fueling—the missile 
could be launched in under a minute.</p>
<p>To summarize the guidance trajectory,
a Minuteman flight is typically about 35 minutes,<span id="fnref:trajectories"><a href="#fn:trajectories">8</a></span> but only the first few minutes are powered by the rockets; the warheads
coast most of the way on a ballistic trajectory.
The first three rocket stages are active for just 180 seconds; this completed the boost phase for Minuteman I and II.
However, the innovation of Minuteman III was that it held three warheads, a system called MIRV (Multiple Independently-targeted Reentry Vehicles).
To direct these warheads to their targets, Minuteman III has a fourth stage, called PSRE (Propulsion System Rocket Engine),
mounted just below the guidance system.
The PSRE was active for <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0757212.pdf#page=79">440 seconds</a>,
directing each warhead on its specific path.
(Meanwhile, a retro-rocket sent the third stage in a random direction. Otherwise, it would tag along with the warheads, acting as a giant
radar beacon for enemy anti-ballistic-missile systems.)
The warheads travel very high, typically over 800 nautical miles (1500 km), more than three times the altitude of the International Space Station.
As for the multiple-warhead MIRV, the Minuteman III missiles were converted back to single warheads as part of the New START
arms reduction treaty, with the last MIRV removed in <a href="https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/article/485611/malmstrom-completes-final-minuteman-iii-configuration/">June 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The guidance computer has a key role in the Minuteman missile, determining the missile's position from the stable platform data,
executing a guidance algorithm, and steering the missile on the desired trajectory.
Before explaining the D-37 computer used in Minuteman II and III, I'll start by discussing the D-17B computer used in the first Minuteman, since its characteristics strongly influenced the later computers.
The Minuteman I computer was very primitive by modern standards.
Although it was a 24-bit machine, it was a serial computer, operating on one bit at a time. 
The big advantage of serial processing is that it dramatically reduces the hardware requirements. Since the computer only processes one bit at a time,
it uses a one-bit ALU. Moreover, the buses and datapaths are one bit wide rather than 24 bits.
The disadvantage, of course, is that a serial computer is slow; the D-17B took 27 clock cycles (24 bits and three overhead) to perform any operation. At best, the computer could perform 12,800 additions per second.</p>
<p>The computer has an unusual cylindrical structure, 29 inches (74 cm) in diameter, designed to fit the diameter of the Minuteman missile.
The computer itself is the bottom half of the cylindrical shell.
The top half is the <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/D17_Surplus_Annoucement.pdf#page=9">electronic equipment chassis</a>, holding the power supplies for the computer and the stable platform, as well as
servo control amplifiers, oscillators, and converters.</p>

<p>The computer doesn't have any RAM. Instead, all instructions, data, and registers are stored on a hard disk, but not like a modern hard disk.
The disk has separate, fixed heads for each track so it can access tracks without seeking. 
(This approach is similar to a computer built around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drum_memory">drum memory</a>, except the drum is flattened.)
In total, the disk held just 2727 24-bit words (approximately 8 Kbytes).
The computer's serial processing and its disk-based storage worked well together. The disk provided data one bit at a time, which the computer would process serially.
The results were written back to the disk, one bit at a time as calculation proceeded.
The write head was positioned just behind the read head so a value could be overwritten as it was computed.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the numerous read and write heads for the D-17B's hard disk.
Note that the heads are fixed (unlike modern hard drives), and the heads are widely distributed across the surface.
(There is no need for different tracks to be aligned.)
I believe that the green and white heads in pairs are for the "regular" tracks, while the heads with other spacings implement
registers and short-term storage called <em>loops</em>.<span id="fnref:timing"><a href="#fn:timing">9</a></span></p>

<p>The D-17B computer was transistorized. The photo below shows one of its circuit boards, crammed with transistors (the black cylinders), resistors, diodes, and other components.
(This board is a read amplifier, amplifying the signals from the hard disk.)
The computer used diode-resistor logic and diode-transistor logic to minimize the number of transistors;
as a result, it used 6282 diodes and 5094 resistors compared to 1521 silicon and germanium transistors (<a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/AD-760_757_Reutilization_of_the_Minuteman_Guidance_Computer_as_a_Numerical_Process_Controller_Mar73.pdf#page=28">source</a>).</p>

<p>The computer supported 39 instructions.
Many of the instructions are straightforward: add, subtract, multiply (but no divide), complement, magnitude, AND, left shift, and right shift. 
The computer handled 24-bit words as well as 11-bit split words, so many of these instructions had "split" versions to operate on a shorter
value.
One unusual instruction was "split compare and limit", which replaced the accumulator value with a limit value from memory, if the
accumulator value exceeded the limit.</p>
<p>The focus of the computer was I/O with 48 digital inputs, 26 incremental inputs, 28 digital outputs, 12 analog voltage outputs, and 3 pulse outputs for gyro control.
The computer had special instructions to support the various inputs and outputs.<span id="fnref:analog"><a href="#fn:analog">10</a></span>
For example, to integrate pulse signals from the stable platform, the computer had instructions to enter and exit "Fine Countdown" mode, which caused two special registers to operate
as digital integrators, in parallel with regular computation (<a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0760757.pdf#page=62">details</a>).</p>
<h2>The D-37 computer</h2>
<p>For the Minuteman II missile, Autonetics built the D-37 computer, one of the earliest integrated circuit computers.
By using integrated circuits, the guidance computer was dramatically shrunk, increasing range, functionality, and accuracy.
The photo below compares the size of the older D-17B computer (half-cylinder) with the D-37B (held by the engineer).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/computers.jpg"><img alt="The Minuteman D-17B computer (cylinder) and D-37B computer (being held).

Using modern definitions, the computer was a minicomputer, not a microcomputer.</p>
<p>Although the main task of the computer is guidance,
with the increased capacity of the D-37, the computer took over many of the tasks formerly performed by ground support equipment.
The D-37 managed "ground control and checkout, monitoring, communication coding and decoding, as well as the airborne tasks of navigation, guidance, steering, and control" (<a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1982-1550">link</a>). <!--andreMinutemanInertialGuidance1982--></p>
<p>The D-37 had several models. The D-37A was the prototype system, while the D-37B was deployed in the first 60 Minuteman II missiles.
The Air Force soon realized that
nuclear radiation posed a threat to the computer, so they developed the radiation-hardened D-37C.<span id="fnref:radiation"><a href="#fn:radiation">11</a></span>
The Minuteman III used the D-37D, an improved and slightly larger version.
Even with additional disk space, program memory was so tight that software features were dropped to save just <a href="https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0757212.pdf#page=86">47 words</a>.</p>
<p>As far as architecture and performance, the D-37 computer is almost the same as the D-17B, but extended.
Most importantly, the D-37 kept the serial architecture of the D-17B, so it had the same slow instruction speed.
The D-37 kept the instruction set of the D-17B, with additional instructions such as division, logical OR, bit rotates, and more I/O, giving it 58 instructions versus 39 in the older computer.
It expanded the hard disk storage, but with a double-sided disk providing 7222 words of storage in the D37-C.<span id="fnref:capacity"><a href="#fn:capacity">12</a></span>
The D-37 included division implemented in hardware (which the D-17B didn't have), along with a faster hardware implementation of multiplication, improving the speed of those instructions.<span id="fnref:instructions"><a href="#fn:instructions">13</a></span>
The D-37C added more I/O lines, as well as radio input and 32 analog voltage inputs. <!-- https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0760757.pdf --></p>
<p>The diagram below shows the D-37C computer, used in the Minuteman II.
At the left is the hard disk that provides the computer's memory. Most of the computer is occupied by complex circuit boards
covered with flat-pack integrated circuits. At the right is the advanced switching power supply, generating numerous
voltages for the computer (±3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 volts).
The connectors at the top provide the interface between the computer and the rest of the system.
Because the computer has so many digital (discrete) and analog signals, it uses multiple 61-pin connectors (<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/AD-777_244_Conversion_of_the_D37C_Computer_For_General_Purpose_Applications_Mar74.pdf#page=117">details</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/computer-labeled.jpg"><img alt="The D-37C computer.

Image courtesy Martin Miller, www.martin-miller.us." width="700"></a></p>
<p>The D-37C computer was built from 22 different integrated circuits, custom-built by Texas Instruments for the Minuteman project.
These chips ranged from digital functions such as NAND gates and a flip-flop to linear amplifiers to specialized functions such as a demodulator/chopper. 
Texas Instruments sold the Minuteman series integrated circuits on the open market, but the chips were
spectacularly expensive ($55 for a flip-flop, over $500 in current dollars) and not as popular as 
TI's general-purpose integrated circuits.<span id="fnref:flip-flop"><a href="#fn:flip-flop">14</a></span>
The circuit boards were very complex for the time, with 10 interconnected layers. Each board was about 4 × 5½ inches and
held about 150 flatpack integrated circuits, with components on both sides.</p>
<p>The growth of the integrated circuit industry owes a lot to the 
Minuteman computer and the Apollo Guidance Computer, both developed during the early days of the integrated circuit.
These projects bought integrated circuits by the hundreds of thousands, helping the IC industry move from low-volume prototypes
to mass-produced commodities, both by providing demand and by motivating companies to fix
yield problems.
Moreover, both computers required high-reliability integrated circuits, forcing the industry to improve its manufacturing processes.
Finally, Minuteman and Apollo gave integrated circuits credibility, showing that ICs were a practical design choice.</p>
<p>The Minuteman III used the D-37D computer,
which had about twice the disk capacity, 14,137 words.
The layout is similar to the D-37C above, with the disk drive on the left and the power supply on the right.
Since the computer is mounted "upside down", the boards are not visible inside, blocked by the
interconnect board.<span id="fnref:exploded"><a href="#fn:exploded">15</a></span>
Note the use of flexible PCBs, advanced technology for the time, soldered with low-melting-point indium/tin solder.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/d37d.jpg"><img alt="The D-37D computer. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="382" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/d37d-w700.jpg" title="The D-37D computer. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="700"></a></p>
<p>By 1970, the D-37 computer had made the cylindrical D-17B obsolete. The government gave away <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/D17_Surplus_Annoucement.pdf">surplus</a> D-17B computers to universities and other organizations for use as general-purpose microcomputers.
Dozens of organizations, from Harvard to the Center for Disease Control to Tektronix jumped at the chance to obtain a free computer, even if it was slow and difficult to use,
forming a large <a href="http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/MCUG-3-72_Proceedings_of_the_Fourth_Meeting_of_the_Minuteman_Computer_Users_Group_Jun72.pdf">users group</a> to share programming tips.</p>
<h2>The P92 amplifier</h2>
<p>The amplifier provides the interface between the computer and the rest of the missile.
The amplifier sends control signals to the missile's four stages, controlling the engines and steering.
(The electronic circuitry
from the Minuteman I's nozzle control units was moved to the amplifier, simplifying maintenance.) <!-- Minuteman: A technical history, page 224 -->
Moreover, the Minuteman has explosive ordnance in many places, ranging from small squibs that activate valves to explosives that separate the missile stages.
The amplifier sends the high-current (30 amp) signals to detonate the ordnance, while monitoring the current to detect faults.<span id="fnref:incident"><a href="#fn:incident">16</a></span>
The amplifier acts as a safety device for the ordnance, blocking signals unless the amplifier has been armed with the proper code.
The amplifier sends control signals to the reentry system (i.e. the warheads) as well as the chaff dispenser, which emits
clouds of wires to jam enemy radar.
The amplifier also sends and receives signals through the umbilical cable from the ground equipment.</p>
<!-- See LCC page 3-8 for connections. -->

Click this (or any other image) for a higher-resolution version.</p>
<p>The photo above shows the amplifier with its cover removed.
The amplifier is constructed as two stacks of six circuit boards, on top of a double-width power supply board.
At the top and bottom of each board, connectors with thick cables connect the boards to the rest of the system.
Each board is a multi-layer printed-circuit board built on a thick magnesium frame for cooling.
The amplifier has five power switching boards, a valve driver board, three servo amplifier boards, and an ACTR control board (whatever that is).
The system board is visible on the left, with large capacitors and precision 0.01% resistors. To its right is the decoder board, presumably decoding computer commands
to select a particular I/O device.
Note the extensive use of Texas Instruments flat-pack integrated circuits on this board, the tiny white rectangles.</p>
<h2>Missile Guidance Set Control</h2>
<p>The Missile Guidance Set Control (MGSC) contains the electronics to power and run the inertial measurement unit (IMU),
providing the interface to the computer.
The MGSC handles the platform servo loop, accelerometer server loops, gyroscope torquing, gyrocompass torquing and slew,
and accelerometer temperature control.<span id="fnref:platform-control"><a href="#fn:platform-control">17</a></span>
One unexpected function of the MGSC is powering the computer's hard disk,
supplying 400 Hz, 3-phase power at 27.25 volts (<a href="https://bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/AD-777_244_Conversion_of_the_D37C_Computer_For_General_Purpose_Applications_Mar74.pdf#page=28">source</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mgsc.jpg"><img alt="The Missile Guidance Set Control with the modules labeled. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." height="840" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/mgsc-w600.jpg" title="The Missile Guidance Set Control with the modules labeled. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="600"></a></p>
<p>The MGSC is constructed from hinged metal modules, each with a particular function, shown above. The modules are constructed around
printed circuit boards.
Two large connectors at the right of the MGSC provide electrical connectivity with the IMU and computer.
At the top and bottom of the MGSC are connections for coolant.
The MGSC is roughly equivalent to the top half of the Minuteman I's cylindrical guidance system, opposite the computer half.
The MGSC is unchanged between the Minuteman II and Minuteman III.
The MGSC is normally covered with a metal cover that provides radiation protection, but the cover is missing in the photo above.</p>
<h2>Battery</h2>
<p>The battery in the Minuteman Guidance System is very unusual, since it is a "reserve battery", completely inert until activated.
It is a silver/zinc battery with the electrolyte stored separately, giving the battery an essentially infinite shelf life.
To power up the battery during a launch, a gas generator inside the battery is ignited by a squib. The gas pressure forces the potassium hydroxide electrolyte out of a
tank and into the battery, energizing the battery in under a second.
The battery can only be used once, of course, and you can't test it. 
The battery was built by Delco-Remy (a division of General Motors) (<a href="https://www.delcoremyhistory.com/Products/missilebattery.htm">details</a>).
It provides 28 volts at 14.5 Amp-hours, powering the guidance system and most of the missile; a separate battery powers the
first-stage rocket.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/battery.jpg"><img alt="The battery inside the Minuteman III. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." height="565" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/battery-w250.jpg" title="The battery inside the Minuteman III. Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="250"></a></p>
<p>The photo above shows the battery mounted inside the guidance system. Note the two thin wires attached to the posts on the left front of the battery to enable the battery, and the thick power wires bolted to the posts on the right.
Above these posts is an "electrolyte vent port"; I'm not sure what prevents caustic electrolyte from spraying out under high
pressure.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the construction of a Minuteman I battery, similar but with two independent battery blocks. The two round gas generators on the front of the electrolyte tube force
the electrolyte into the battery sections.</p>

<h2>Squib-activated switch</h2>
<p>Another unusual component is the squib-activated switch.
This switch is activated by a small explosive squib; when fired, the squib forces the switch to change positions.
This switch may seem excessively dramatic, but it has a few advantages over, say, an electromagnetic relay.
The squib-activated switch will switch solidly, while the contacts on a relay may "chatter" or bounce before settling into their new positions.
An electromagnetic relay may require more current to switch, especially if it has large contacts or many contacts.
However, like the battery, the squib-activated switch can only be used once.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/squib-switch.jpg"><img alt="The squib-activated switch, next to a coolant line.

Image from <a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/collection-objects/guidance-system-minuteman-iii/nasm_A19770995000">National Air and Space Museum</a>.</p>
<p>The purpose of the switch is to disconnect important signals, known as <a href="https://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/autonetics/d17/D17_Florida_State_University_Sep70.pdf#page=16">critical leads</a>, during launch.
The Minuteman missile has an umbilical connection that provides power, cooling, and signals while the missile is in the silo.
Just before the umbilical cable is disconnected, the switch severs the connections for the
master reset signal along with an enable and disable signal.
Presumably, these control signals are cleanly disconnected to avoid stray signals or electrical noise that could cause
problems when the umbilical connection is pulled off.</p>
<p>The photo below shows the umbilical cable connected to a Minuteman II missile in its silo.
Also note the window in the side of the missile to allow the light beam from the autocollimator to reflect off the guidance
platform for alignment.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/silo.jpg"><img alt="A Minuteman II missile in its silo.

Photo by Kelly Michals, CC BY-NC 2.0." width="500"></a></p>
<h2>Cooling</h2>
<p>The guidance system is water-cooled while in the silo, using a solution of sodium chromate to inhibit corrosion.
After launch, the guidance system operated for just a few minutes before releasing the warheads, so it operated without
water cooling.
(The stable platform has a fan and heat exchanger to keep it cool during flight.)
The diagram below highlights the cooling lines.
Coolant is provided from the ground support equipment through the umbilical connector in the upper right.
It flows through the computer, diode assembly, 
MGSC, and stable platform.
Finally, the coolant exits through the umbilical connector.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/cooling.jpg"><img alt="Original image from National Air and Space Museum." height="599" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/cooling-w600.jpg" title="Original image from National Air and Space Museum." width="600"></a></p>
<h2>Diode assembly</h2>
<p>In the middle of the guidance system, the diode assembly consists of seven power diodes.
These diodes control the power flow when switching from ground power to battery power.
The photo below shows the diode assembly, with coolant connections at the top and bottom.
The thick gray wire in the center of the diode assembly receives power from the battery just to the left.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/diode-assembly.jpg"><img alt="The diode assembly. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="391" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/diode-assembly-w400.jpg" title="The diode assembly. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="400"></a></p>
<h2>Permutation plug</h2>
<p>The Permutation plug (or P-plug) was the key cryptographic element of the guidance system, defining the launch codes for a particular missile.
The P-plug looked similar to a hockey puck and plugged into a 55-pin socket attached to the amplifier.
The retaining bar held the P-plug in place.</p>
<p><a href="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/p-plug.jpg"><img alt="The connector that receives the Permutation plug. Image from National Air and Space Museum." height="438" src="https://static.righto.com/images/minuteman-mmiii/p-plug-w450.jpg" title="The connector that receives the Permutation plug. Image from National Air and Space Museum." width="450"></a></p>
<p>Because the security of the missile hinged on the P-plug, the P-plug was handled in a highly ritualized way, transported by a two-person team, an airman and an officer, both armed (<a href="http://www.siloworld.net/STORIES/storiespg5.htm">source</a>).
After the guidance system underwent maintenance, the P-plug team would ensure that the plug was properly installed, just before
the missile was bolted back together.
There was also a lot of ritual around the disk memory, since it held security codes and targeting information.<span id="fnref:targeting"><a href="#fn:targeting">18</a></span> Before anyone could work on the computer, a special team would come to the silo and erase the memory.
Afterward, another team would load up the computer from a magnetic tape (in the case of Minuteman III) or punched tape (earlier).<span id="fnref:fill"><a href="#fn:fill">19</a></span></p>
<p>The missile launch codes are <a href="https://nuclearcompanion.com/rapid-execution-and-combat-targeting-react-armageddon-with-a-floppy-disk-and-trackball/">said</a> to be split between the hard disk
and the permutation plug.
In particular, the missile software holds a two-word code for each of the five launch control facilities.<span id="fnref:launch-control"><a href="#fn:launch-control">22</a></span>
The launch code in an Execute Launch Command (ELC) must match the combination of the P-plug value and the site-specific value on disk.<span id="fnref:select"><a href="#fn:select">23</a></span>
Thus, the launch code is unique to each launch control site and each missile.<span id="fnref:csd"><a href="#fn:csd">24</a></span>
As another security feature, a launch requires messages from two launch control sites, unless only one was available.<span id="fnref:vote"><a href="#fn:vote">25</a></span></p>
<h2>Transient current detector</h2>
<p>A nuclear blast has many bad effects on semiconductors and can cause transient errors.
A rather brute-force approach was used to minimize this risk in the D-37C and D-37D computers: if a nuclear blast is detected, the computer stops writing to disk until the burst of radiation
passes by.
When the radiation level drops, the computer carries on from where it left off, extrapolating to make up for the lost time
to minimize the error.
Since all data is stored on the hard disk, the system doesn't need to worry about memory corruption as could happen with semiconductor RAM.</p>
<p>The Minuteman documents euphemistically refer to "operating in a hostile environment" for the ability to handle large pulses of radiation from a nearby nuclear explosion.
Another euphemism is "seismic environment", when a nuclear blast near a silo could disturb the missile's targeting alignment.
To get an idea of the expected forces, note that the launch officers were strapped into their seats with four-point harnesses to protect against the seismic environment.<span id="fnref:displacement"><a href="#fn:displacement">27</a></span></p>

<p>The "transient current detector" above detects dangerous levels of radiation. 
I couldn't find any details, but I suspect that it contains a semiconductor and detects transient current through the semiconductor induced by radiation.
It would make sense to use a semiconductor similar to the ones in the computer so the detector's response matches the response of the computer, perhaps a matching Texas Instruments IC.</p>
<p>The Minuteman III also has two "field detectors" mounted on the outside of the guidance ring. These presumably detect large fluctuations in the electromagnetic field, indicating an electromagnetic pulse (EMP), different from the ionizing radiation picked up by the Transient Current Detector.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>The Minuteman guidance system is full of innovative technologies. Among other things, Minuteman I used an early transistorized
computer, and Minuteman II used one of the first integrated circuit computers.
The Minuteman missile isn't just something from the past, though. There are currently 400 Minuteman missiles in the United States, ready
to launch at a moment's notice and create global devastation.
Thus, its technical achievements can't be glorified without reflecting on the negativity of its underlying purpose.
On the other hand, Minuteman has succeeded (so far) in its purpose of deterrence, so it can also be viewed in a positive, peacekeeping role.
In any case, the Minuteman technology is morally ambiguous, compared to, say, the Apollo Guidance Computer.</p>
<p>I plan to write more about the role of Minuteman and Apollo in the IC industry, so follow me on Mastodon as <a href="https://oldbytes.space/@kenshirriff">@<span data-cfemail="adc6c8c3dec5c4dfdfc4cbcbedc2c1c9cfd4d9c8de83deddcccec8">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a>

  <div>
  <p>Recently a Dutch hacker was able to take control of 4 million solar panel installations
(<a href="https://www.ftm.nl/artikelen/hacker-kan-stekker-uit-zonnepanelen-trekken-en-stroomnet-platleggen?share=vxhD9wJigd%2BV9Hxm%2FzJhJ8Ki24WROlg0mGxB7I%2B3Sbp08mD0JfFSgg9OfCbaxdU%3D">FTM, Dutch</a> and
<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/hacker-shines-spotlight-on-vulnerability-of-solar-panels-installed-in-europe/">Euractiv, English</a>). And this wasn’t the first time either something like this has
happened (<a href="https://www.pv-magazine.com/2022/09/06/dutch-agency-investigates-cybersecurity-of-pv-inverters-after-hack/">PV Magazine</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As usual, huge thanks are due to the many beta readers and experts who helped improve this article with their feedback, valuable insights and knowledge! This post was machine translated (not too well) <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/de-gigantische-en-ongereguleerde-elektriciteitscentrales-in-de-cloud/">from the original Dutch version</a>, which was also more focused on The Netherlands. What follows mostly applies to EU countries, but if you squint, you can also read it from a more international perspective.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The short version: most consumer and business solar panels are centrally managed by a handful of companies, mostly from countries outside of Europe. In the Netherlands alone, these solar panels generate a power output equivalent to at least 25 medium sized nuclear power plants. There are almost no rules or laws in Europe governing these central administrators. We pretend that these companies only deserve the regulation we’d apply to (say) an online birthday calendar.</p>
<p>These cloud-based management platforms could, by accident, after a hack, or intentionally, simultaneously shut down all their millions of solar panels (permanently). And then the entire European electricity grid would collapse. Given the recent findings of fine ethical hackers (<a href="https://www.divd.nl/newsroom/articles/divd-responsibly-discloses-six-new-zero-day-vulnerabilities-to-vendor/">DivD</a>) and the confirmation from Dutch electricity network manager (TSO) TenneT, this is not a theoretical scenario.</p>
<p>We’ve sleepwalked into this situation – individual solar panels can’t cause much damage, and didn’t need too many rules. But over time, the number of installations has increased enormously, and their management (needlessly) has become concentrated on just a few places, with lots of new risks as a consequence.</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/panel-panel-english.png"></p>

</center>
<p>Things can’t go on like this. The central capability to shut down gigawatts of power must be removed, or we need to regulate the central administrators as energy companies. It is one or the other.</p>
<p><a href="https://topsectorenergie.nl/documents/1241/2024-Secura-Publicatieversie-Scenarios_en_Maatregelen_Cyberweerbare_Zonnestroo_vqXh809.pdf">We are now more vulnerable than ever</a>, since in a country like The Netherlands, 15 GW of power is currently controlled from far-off places, and we don’t even know exactly by whom. And those parties fall under virtually no law or regulation. The same thing goes for heat pumps, home batteries, and EV charging points, by the way.</p>
<p>The upcoming EU NIS2 directive offers some opportunities for improvement, but it’s necessary to make this explicit. Otherwise the concentrated solar power suppliers will claim not to fall under this regulation. Industry group SolarPower Europe <a href="https://api.solarpowereurope.org/uploads/Solar_Power_Europe_2024_A_harmonised_cybersecurity_baseline_for_solar_PV_cbfbbd0f1b.pdf">has also called for explicit NIS2 rules for solar</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-longer-story">The longer story</h2>
<p>I’m not telling anything new on this page, but I would like to summarize this terrible situation. First of all, we must thank <a href="https://nluug.nl/evenementen/nluug/voorjaarsconferentie-2018/talks/willem-westerhof-how-an-intern-hacked-the-power-grid/">Willem
Westerhof</a> who has been trying to get attention for this problem since 2016.</p>
<p>Willem worked together with his employer <a href="https://www.secura.com/">Secura</a> on a recent large report for the Dutch “Topsector Energie” about the problematic situation.</p>
<p>So, what’s going on. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_grid_of_Continental_Europe">Synchronous Grid of Continental Europe</a> is a massive achievement, integrated over most of Europe and even beyond. It enables us to share the capacity of thousands of large power stations (solar panels, wind turbines) with each other.</p>
<p>Besides these large power generators, there are also tens of millions of European households and companies that contribute to the grid with solar panels.</p>
<p>The power grid must be balanced at all times. Exactly as much energy must be fed into the network as is used in that instance. If too much power goes onto the network, it
leads to an elevated frequency and possibly excess voltage. And vice versa, too little power leads to a depressed frequency. To protect the European network, parts of countries or entire countries could then be disconnected, with devastating consequences. Getting the network back on track afterwards is quite a challenge.</p>
<p>Recently, for example, there was an international outage <a href="https://www.voxnews.al/english/aktualitet/raporti-i-fshehte-shqiperia-shkaktoi-kolapsin-energjitik-ne-qershor-i69928">in Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and
Croatia</a>, and that was no fun at all.</p>
<p>That’s why we set high standards for large power providers. Their power plants are under surveillance, their equipment must meet many requirements, and personnel must have the right diplomas and certifications. Incidents are investigated, and fines can be levied. European networks and providers are continuously working together to keep the network stable and safe.</p>
<p>But who regulates the gigantic power output from Europe’s solar panels?</p>
<h2 id="what-we-do-regulate">What we do regulate</h2>
<p>A solar panel can not be connected directly to the grid; there’s an
<em>inverter</em> between the panel and the network. This device converts the power from the panel into a form that the electrical grid can handle.</p>
<p>These devices must meet rules, including rules that say when an installation should disconnect itself from an over-full local network (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2016_112_R_0001">see article
13</a> of the Rules for Generators). There are also rules on how inverters should be connected physically So, this part is (in theory) well taken care of. A single inverter can’t do much damage to the broader power grid. It might blow up your fuses though.</p>
<p>In the Netherlands, we have decided that only inverters approved by the Belgian <a href="https://www.synergrid.be/nl/">Synergrid</a> may be installed (<a href="https://www.netbeheernederland.nl/publicatie/lijst-van-omvormers-rfg-type">see publication from
NetbeheerNederland</a>). However, insiders tell me that we never enforce this and lots of stuff is connected to the grid.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-are-not-regulating">What we are not regulating</h2>
<p>Most inverters are directly or indirectly linked to the internet. The setup makes a connection with its manufacturer, and uploads statistics about the solar panels and power production.</p>
<p>The owner of the panels and inverters can meanwhile establish a connection with that manufacturer using an app or website, and <em>via the manufacturer</em> see how their own panels are doing:</p>
<center>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/cloud-solar-panel-english.webp"></p>
</div>
</center>
<p>It wasn’t necessary from a technical standpoint to let everything run through the manufacturer’s servers, but it was chosen to do it this way. Almost all consumer devices now work like this. Compare surveillance cameras or modern cars. Everyone seems to want to do something with your data somehow!</p>
<p>Through the website or app, the owner can not only see how things are going with the panels, but these can also be turned on and off. It’s also possible to install new <em>software</em> (firmware) on the inverters via the manufacturer, either automatically or manually.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Turning the power on or off can also happen if your own app doesn’t have a button for it. There is support to do so for use by installers/mechanics.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="and-thats-when-things-get-exciting">And that’s when things get exciting</h2>
<p>Because everything runs through the manufacturer, they are able to turn all panels on and off. Or install software on the inverters so that the <em>wrong</em> current flows into the grid. Now, a manufacturer won’t do this intentionally, but it is easy enough to mess this up.</p>
<p>As an example, computer security company CrowdStrike also installs new software automatically for users, and recently an error in an update caused millions of computers worldwide to crash, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_CrowdStrike_incident">costing days and billions to fix</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that the manufacturer gets hacked, and subsequently sends out attacker controlled and wrong software updates to the inverters, with possibly dire consequences.</p>
<p>There are also people that claim that the many Chinese companies managing our power panels for us might <em>intentionally</em> want to harm us. Who knows.</p>
<p>In these exciting times, <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/cyber-security-pre-war-reality-check/">this situation is not robust or trustworthy enough</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-can-happen-then">What can happen then?</h2>
<p>Above, we saw that the electrical network is very sensitive. There must be exactly as much power going in as out. To make this possible, various generators stand by to add more power, or remove it, when imbalances occur.</p>
<p>Beyond this “fine tuning”, there is also larger capacity available to <a href="https://netztransparenz.tennet.eu/electricity-market/about-the-electricity-market/balancing-markets/">relatively quickly (for example) absorb a failed
power plant</a>.</p>
<center>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/Overview_of_balancing_process.png">
The three levels of balancing. Source: <a href="https://netztransparenz.tennet.eu/electricity-market/about-the-electricity-market/balancing-markets/">TenneT</a>.</p>

</center>
<p>This is managed so well that we even account for partial solar eclipses (which lead to a predictable reduction in solar power). It’s really very impressive.</p>
<p>The exciting thing is that manufacturers of solar inverter panels can switch the power on or off for millions of installations at people’s homes, or on the roofs of businesses.</p>
<p>And if you turn all those panels off at the right moment, half of the European power grid collapses. The largest players manage far more power than the balancing methods (FCR, aFFR, mFFR) could ever handle. TenneT, the Dutch transport operator, has indicated the grid could absorb a 3 GW disruption. In total (including large installations), there are now over 25 GW of solar panels installed in the Netherlands, much more than that 3 GW. There is a single inverter
manufacturer that globally controls 195 GW, with probably half of that located in Europe.</p>
<p>Also very alarming is that Dutch ethical hackers Wietse Boonstra and Hidde Smit (impressive people) managed to modify software <em>in</em> solar panel installations, <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-21881">without permission from the
manufacturer</a>. This makes the damage you can cause much greater, and also much slower to resolve. Because that software can seriously mess with the power grid, or possibly even permanently disrupt an installation.</p>
<h2 id="oh-no">Oh no</h2>
<p>If you had a control panel to switch off dozens of nuclear reactors simultaneously, you’d have to comply with all kinds of safety regulations, and inspectors would come by to check if you were doing it right. This applies also to large solar and wind installations, by the way.</p>
<p>Because inverters and solar panels at home are “ordinary” consumer appliances, there is no inspection and no legislation. This makes sense since a single installation can’t cause that much damage.</p>
<p>But because we didn’t pay attention, the management of those “consumer appliances” has now moved to just a few suppliers who, on sunny days, even measured individually, control a significant part of our power supply.</p>
<center>
<div>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://berthub.eu/articles/nuclear-control.webp"><br>
The power of 25 medium-sized (“Borssele”) nuclear reactors all in one handy app!</p>
</div></center>
<p>And we regulate these large suppliers just as strictly as an online birthday calendar, which is to say: almost not at all.</p>
<h2 id="and-now">And now?</h2>
<p>Some steps are being taken. The recent Secura report commissioned by the Dutch <a href="https://topsectorenergie.nl/documents/1241/2024-Secura-Publication-Version-Scenarios_and_Measures_Cybersecurity_for_Solar_PV.pdf">Topsector
Energie</a> is very valuable in determining just how bad things are.</p>
<p>This all screams for legislation of course. For now, the big central management platforms mostly escape legislation. The panels in the field must individually comply with <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:JOL_2016_112_R_0001">(lightweight)
rules</a>. And the website where you manage those panels is considered to be just a website, and not part of the power grid.</p>
<p>At least, that is how we look at things now. To improve this situation quickly, it might be possible to start regarding these central management companies as “grid managers” instead of as birthday calendar managers. You’d have to read some laws very creatively to make this happen, I fear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a new directive is emerging at the European level, NIS2, which is being implemented in EU countries right now, but is not quite there yet.</p>
<p>This is a general directive that applies to all kinds of service providers. The directive states that “energy” falls under the category of “Very Critical Sectors”. So, there should be some room to improve things.</p>
<p><strong>Crucially, when EU member states implement this directive, they should make it very explicit that solar panel managers fall
under its scope, as long as they have the ability to install updates or switch many panels on or off.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, there is another European law in the making, the <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/eu-cra-secure-coding-solution/">Cyber Resilience Act</a> (CRA). This law focuses on devices (inverters, panels), but I suspect that the accompanying central control panel, app and services will also be included (since your device won’t function without them). The CRA has strong hooks to require a high level of security.</p>
<p>SolarPower Europe, an interest group, <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/hacker-shines-spotlight-on-vulnerability-of-solar-panels-installed-in-europe/">has also thought about it</a> and
writes in <a href="https://api.solarpowereurope.org/uploads/Solar_Power_Europe_2024_A_harmonised_cybersecurity_baseline_for_solar_PV_cbfb.pdf">this document</a>: “In the context of the broad cybersecurity principles established in NIS2, <strong>requirements specific to the solar sector should be in place for its implementation</strong>. Such requirements should apply to entities that control sufficient capacities to disrupt the grid”. It also mentions that Australia and Germany already have rules, although they don’t enforce them. SolarPower Europe also mentions the Cyber Resilience Act in their report.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incidentally, why are all those panels centrally connected anyway? I’d like to know what my panels are doing, but you don’t need the internet for that. My (now somewhat older) panels have never been  connected to the internet. Despite this, I have beautiful graphs.
This requires a different way of working, but it is technically perfectly possible to connect directly with your own installation to get graphs. It would also be a good idea for cameras, washing machines, heat pumps, cars/charging stations, and <em>home batteries</em>. Since the last three also have the ability to disrupt the electricity grid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As an interim step, we might need to demand that control panels stick to providing pretty graphs, and make it impossible to remotely switch panels/loaders/batteries on or off.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We are <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/publicspaces-digitale-autonomie-7-juni-2024/">sleepwalking</a> into a terrible situation where <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/5g-elephant-in-the-room/">a few
parties</a> have almost complete control over our entire energy supply, while these parties don’t fall under any energy law. We regulate them as if they were a normal website, which means we hardly regulate them at all.</p>
<p>We could creatively examine existing legislation to see if it offers possibilities to do something about it, but that looks to be tricky.</p>
<p>New laws are emerging that could help subject these parties to stricter rules. NIS2 and the Cyber Resilience Act appear suitable for this purpose. And to remove any doubt, it could be explicitly stated in the member state implementations that central management parties indeed fall under its scope, something <a href="https://www.solarpowereurope.org/advocacy/position-papers/setting-a-harmonised-cybersecurity-baseline-for-solar-pv">SolarPower Europe also advocates
for</a> (<a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/hacker-shines-spotlight-on-vulnerability-of-solar-panels-installed-in-europe/">article in Euractiv</a>).</p>
<p>Because gigantic non-EU companies might not be impressed by individual country laws, it is essential to collaborate within the EU.</p>

    <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey HN! We’re Max, Alex, and Austin, the team behind Sorcerer (<a href="https://sorcerer.earth/">https://sorcerer.earth</a>). Sorcerer builds weather balloons that last for over six months, collecting 1000x more data per dollar and reaching previously inaccessible regions.</p><p>In 1981, weather disasters caused $3.5 billion in damages in the United States. In 2023, that number was $94.9 billion (<a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series" rel="nofollow">https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/time-series</a>). The National Weather Service spends billions annually on its network of weather balloons, satellites, and aircraft sensors – generating hundreds of terabytes of data every day. This data, called observation data, is fed into massive supercomputers running advanced physics to produce global weather forecasts. Despite this cost, there are still places in the US where we don't know what the temperature will be two days from now: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2024/how-accurate-is-the-weather-forecast/" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interacti...</a>. And for the rest of the world that lacks weather infrastructure? There’s always the Weather Rock: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_rock</a>.</p><p>The most important data for these forecasts come from vertical data ‘slices’ of the atmosphere, called soundings. Every day 2,500 single-use latex radiosondes are launched across the globe to collect these soundings. They stay aloft for about two hours before popping and falling back to Earth. Launch sites for these systems are sparse in Latin America and Africa, and they’re completely non-existent over oceans. This leaves about 80% of the globe with inadequate weather data for accurate predictions.</p><p>The coverage gap became painfully evident to Max and Alex during their time at Urban Sky. While building balloons for high-altitude aerial imaging, they kept running into a problem: no matter what weather forecast they used, they couldn’t get accurate wind predictions for the upper atmosphere. They tried all of the free and commercial forecast products, but none of them were accurate enough. Digging into it more, we learned that a big part of the problem was the lack of high-quality in-situ data at those altitudes.</p><p>To solve this problem, our systems ascend and descend between sea level and 65,000ft several times a day to collect vertical data soundings. Each vehicle (balloon + payload) weighs less than a pound and can be launched from anywhere in the world, per the FAA and ICAO reg. Here’s one we launched from Potrero Hill in SF, <a href="https://youtu.be/75fN5WpRWH0" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/75fN5WpRWH0</a> and here’s another near the Golden Gate Bridge, <a href="https://youtu.be/7yLmzLPUFVQ" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/7yLmzLPUFVQ</a>. Although we can’t “drive” these balloons laterally, we can use opposing wind layers to target or avoid specific regions. Here’s what a few simulated flight paths look like, to give you an idea: <a href="https://youtu.be/F_Di8cjaEUY" rel="nofollow">https://youtu.be/F_Di8cjaEUY</a></p><p>Our payload uses a satellite transceiver for communications and a small, thin film solar panel array to generate power. In addition to the weather data, we also get real-time telemetry from the vehicles, which we use to optimize their flight paths. This includes maintaining the optimal spacing between balloons and steering them to a recovery zone at the end of their lifespan so we can recycle them.</p><p>These systems spend most of their time in the stratosphere which is an extremely unforgiving environment. We’ll often see temperatures as low as -80°C while flying near the equator. Throughout the day, we experience extreme temperature cycling as they ascend and descend through the atmosphere. We’ll often encounter 100mph+ wind shears near the boundary with the troposphere (the tropopause) that can rip apart the balloon envelope. These conditions make the stratosphere a very difficult place to deploy to prod.</p><p>The real magic of what we’re building will come into play when we have hundreds of these systems in the air over data-sparse regions. But even now, we can do useful and interesting things with them. Some of our early customers are companies who fly very big, very expensive things into the stratosphere. They use our balloons to give them a clear idea of what conditions are ahead of their operations, and we’re working on a forecast product specifically designed for the stratosphere.</p><p>The combination of long duration and low cost is novel. We can theoretically maintain thousands of balloons in the atmosphere at any given time for a tenth of the cost of one useful weather satellite. We’re also using the data we collect to train AI models that produce forecasts with better accuracy than existing numerical (supercomputer) forecasts. Because we’re collecting totally unique data over areas that lack observation, our models will maintain a consistent edge versus models that are only trained on open data.</p><p>We’re really excited to be launching Sorcerer here with you! We’d love to hear what you think. And if you find one of our balloons in the Bay Area: Sorry! It’s still a work in progress (and please get it back to us).</p><p>I’ll leave you all with a bonus video of Paul Buchheit launching one of our balloons, which we thought was pretty cool: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sngF9VvDzg" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sngF9VvDzg</a></p></div></td></tr>        <tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

        <h2 id="tldr">TLDR:</h2>
        <summary>
            I classified the entirety of SafeDocs using a mixture of LLMs, Embeddings Models, XGBoost
            and just for fun some LinearRegressors. In the process I too created
            some really pretty graphs!
        </summary>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>How would you classify all the pdfs in the internet? Well, that is
            what I tried doing this time.</p>
        <p>Lets begin with the mother of all datasets: Common Crawl or CC is a
            web archive of all of the internet, it currently is petabytes in size
            and has been running since 2007. Maybe, you know about the <a href="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/archive.org">Internet Archive</a> which
            is almost the same but
            with the main difference being that Common Crawl focuses more on
            archiving the internet for scientists and researchers instead of digital
            preservation.</p>
        <p>What this translates into is that CC doesn’t save all of the pdfs
            when it finds them. Specifically, when Common Crawl gets to a pdf, it
            just stores the first megabyte of information and truncates the
            rest.</p>
        <p>This is where <a href="https://digitalcorpora.org/corpora/file-corpora/cc-main-2021-31-pdf-untruncated/">SafeDocs</a>
            or CC-MAIN-2021-31-PDF-UNTRUNCATED enters the picture. This corpus was
            originally created by the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/safe-documents">DARPA SafeDocs
                program</a> and what it did was refetch all the different pdfs from a
            snapshot of Common Crawl to have untruncated versions of them. This
            dataset is incredibly big, it has roughly 8.4~ million pdfs that
            uncompressed total 8TB. This corpus is the biggest pure pdf dataset on
            the internet<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
        <p>So I tried classifying it because it doesn’t sound that hard.</p>
        <h2 id="dataset-generation">Dataset generation</h2>
        <p>Lets define what classifying all of this pdfs using different labels
            actually means. For example: I wanted to tag a <em>Linear Algebra</em>
            pdf as <em>Math</em> or an <em>Anatomy</em> textbook as
            <em>Medicine</em>.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/fineweb_edu_pipeline.svg" alt="Training pipeline for the embeddings model in FineWeb-Edu">
            
        </figure>
        <p>The reason for all of this is because I wanted to use LLMs in my
            personal projects and I got this idea after reading the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceFW/blogpost-fineweb-v1">Fineweb
                technical blog / paper</a>. The FineWeb team endedup creating a subset
            for “educational” content based on the bigger FineWeb dataset. What they
            did was use a Teacher and student approach where the LLM generates
            labels from unstructured text and then you train a smaller student or
            “distilled” learner capable of classifying based on the labels
            generated.</p>
        <p>So I decided to follow the same approach. The problem is that 8TB of
            data is still a lot of information. I don’t have 8TB laying around, but
            we can be a bit more clever. The original dataset has the metadata
            available for download. Its only 8GB of pure text!</p>
        <p>In particular I cared about a specific column called
            <code>url</code>. I really care about the urls because they essentially
            tell us a lot more from a website than what meats the eye. For
            example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf</code></pre>
        <p>Specifically this part:</p>
        <pre><code>Introduction_to_Python_Programming_-_WEB.pdf</code></pre>
        <p>Tells us a lot of information.</p>
        <p>I know that this url is going to be <em>education</em> or
            <em>technology</em> adjacent. For now, lets just say its education
            because it has the “Introduction” part in its name.
        </p>
        <p>Here is where the bit of prompt engineering that I used enters the
            picture.</p>
        <h3 id="few-shot-prompting">Few shot prompting</h3>
        <p>Few shot prompting is a fancy name for making an LLM learn with
            examples without training it. Its a really cool trick that you can use
            to make the models outputs more coherent and consistent. I am going to
            give you an extremely easy example of how one of this prompts look
            like:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/few_shot_prompting.gif" alt="Few Shot prompting example of an addition">
            
        </figure>
        <p>This might feel like magic if it is the first time you are using it,
            but LLMs are incredible at following patterns and just showing how to do
            things can make it improve their performance.</p>
        <p>Using this method I generated 100k labels (to start) using this
            specific <a href="https://github.com/snat-s/m/blob/main/classify_metadata/prompt.txt">prompt</a>
            and the Llama-3-70B model through the <a href="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/together.ai">together</a>
            API.</p>
        <p>The distribution of 100k labels looks originally like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pdf_classification_piechart.png" alt="Distribution of 100k labels">
            
        </figure>
        <p>So, as you can see, there is a lot of really small data points that
            are going to be extremely annoying to classify. So guess what I’m going
            to do? I’m going to ditch anything with less than 250 labels and label
            them as <code>other</code> just to keep the most frequent classes.</p>
        <p>Because this labels are unbalanced, I decided to balance them and
            just take 5k samples at the most of each possible label. This left me
            with a total of 59k labels:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pdf_classification_piechart_equally_distributed.png" alt="59k label pie chart, more distributed">
            
        </figure>
        <p>With this newly minted dataset, I decided to start going after the
            training of the new student classifier!</p>
        <h2 id="model-training">Model Training</h2>
        <h3 id="idea-1">Idea 1</h3>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/embeddings.svg" alt="Example of embeddings">
            
        </figure>
        <p>I am going to introduce the idea of an embeddings model. For short,
            an embeddings model is a model capable of passing things like text,
            images, video or any other “unstructured” information to vectors in an
            ndimensional space with semantic meaning. In other words, you can have
            some points that are near each other like dog, cat, elephant and this
            ones are going to be separated from something like car, truck or
            vehicle.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, this models are great for generating clusters of
            meaning. This is going to be extremely useful for us, because we are
            going to just make this model be capable of classifying the specific
            labels that we ended up having through a process called finetuning.</p>
        <p>Finetuning is were you grab an already trained model for a generic
            task and just train it a little bit more for your particular problem.
            This case being classification. If you want to learn more about
            finetuning you should check out the first <a href="https://course.fast.ai/Lessons/lesson1.html">fast.ai
                lecture</a>
            where they finetune a model.</p>
        <p>In the FineWeb paper, they used a total of 500k labels. Thats a lot
            more than what I currently had, but at the time, I decided to ignore
            this<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I went on with my
            life and decided
            to just start testing some models. And oh boy, I realized that you can
            do a lot with just a gaming laptop.</p>
        <p>In FineWeb Edu they used a specific embeddings model based on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-embed-m">snowflake-arctic-embed-m</a>.
            But it is not the best embeddings model based on the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard">Massive Text
                Embeddings Benchmark</a>. So I decided to try some models that ranked
            really well in here. The problem with this benchmark is that most of the
            models are too big, with roughly 7B parameters, I can not afford to run
            that and expect it to classify 8 million pdfs quickly. So I decided to
            instead go for the next best thing, <a href="https://huggingface.co/dunzhang/stella_en_400M_v5">Stella_en_400M</a>.
            But the problem was that I wanted to read how it worked and I don’t
            really like when a model is published and you go to a Github link that
            has a <strong>TODO: add the rest of info</strong> in their README.</p>
        <p>So, I decided to try out a range of models including the base model
            for Stella called gte-large-1.5 and Arctic Embed. Along with others like
            all-mpnet-base, distillbert, flant-t5-small and bert-base-uncased.</p>
        <p>Finetuning a model is pretty simple with Huggingface because it
            abstracts a lot of the code from you and thanks to just freezing the
            main model and training the embeddings and the classifier head I could
            run the entire thing in my laptop without the need of an external GPU<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>. After a series of runs, I found
            that for my problem the most performant model was
            <code>Alibaba-large-gte-1.5</code>, it got up to 59.14% of accuracy.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/accuracy_first_experiments.png" alt="accuracy of different models through time">
            
        </figure>
        <p>I was a bit disappointed at this point because I had paid for a bunch
            of labels and it seemed that I needed to be more careful on the training
            or generate a bigger dataset.</p>
        <p>But in my true lowest moment, I remembered that XGBoost existed. Yes,
            this story is going to become an traditional ML story.</p>
        <h3 id="idea-2">Idea 2</h3>
        <p>For those of you in the know, you could see this coming, XGBoost is
            THE undisputed king of tabular data, it currently is the state of the
            art. If you don’t know the internals for XGBoost, I’m not explaining it
            in detail but don’t worry about it, the <a href="https://youtu.be/OtD8wVaFm6E?si=jDFbWR25-FakqryZ">StatsQuest
                Youtube Channel</a> has an amazing series of videos where they explain
            them in like two hours.</p>
        <p>For now, think about XGBoost as the <code>if else</code> version of
            AI. They are THE simple transparent box that classifies extremely
            well.</p>
        <p>This time, I am going to reframe the problem. Do you remember that
            the model that I used in the first place was really good at generating
            this embeddings? Well, what if this embeddings could be used to train
            another model? What if we could pass from having text to training on
            tabular data? This time the pipeline to train the model would look like
            the following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/xgb_pipeline.svg" alt="xgboost training pipeline">
            
        </figure>
        <p>Another big extra from this would be that I can run a lot more
            experiments because training an XGBoost model is way faster than
            training an embeddings model. So I decided to generate all of the
            embeddings for the PDF links. Generating all of the embeddings is a
            total of <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiagopedroza/url-embeddings-cc-provenance">40GBs</a>
            uncompressed.</p>
        <p>Finally, the last change that I decided to do was to train simpler
            models. Instead of training a big classifier, it could potentially be
            better to just train a binary classifier per class. This idea I learned
            from an old <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/cdeotte/xgboost-baseline-0-680">Kaggle
                competition</a>. Thanks you <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte">Chris</a>! The main idea behind
            this is to have tiny models that are really good capable of super fast
            inference for specific problems, instead of trying to solve all of it
            with just one big model.</p>
        <p>With this in mind, the combined models have this as result!</p>
        <pre><code>Average Performance:
accuracy     0.839750
precision    0.859758
recall       0.819733
f1           0.838937</code></pre>
        <p>This approach is already winning against the original naïve deep
            learning approach that I had by <strong>24.83%</strong>.</p>
        <h3 id="idea-3">Idea 3</h3>
        <p>But guess what? You don’t actually need deep learning to generate
            embeddings. You can just split the text into smaller parts and count the
            occurrences of it. There is a this thing called TFIDF (Term
            Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) that is almost that but it has a
            fancier formula. TFIDF is a numerical statistic that reflects how
            important a word is to a document in a collection. It’s calculated
            as:</p>
        <pre><code>TFIDF(t,d,D) = TF(t,d) * IDF(t,D)

Where:
TF(t,d) = (Number of times term t appears in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)
IDF(t,D) = log(Total number of documents in corpus D / Number of documents containing term t)</code></pre>
        <p>This method assigns higher weights to terms that are frequent in a
            specific document but rare across the entire corpus, making it great for
            feature extraction in text analysis. So I decided to go full on out and
            just go back to the basics of NLP. To my surprise, the resulting models
            where not complete garbage!</p>
        <p>They were actually capable of predicting something that wasn’t as bad
            as I was expecting:</p>
        <pre><code>Average Performance:
accuracy     0.675200
precision    0.683185
recall       0.646316
f1           0.662497</code></pre>
        <p>Better than my naïve approach!</p>
        <p>I even trained a Linear Regressor ensemble that is better than the
            baseline deep learning model.</p>
        <pre><code>Average Performance:
accuracy     0.706802
precision    0.723558
recall       0.663038
f1           0.690286</code></pre>
        <p>This is the moment where I felt that I messed up and I should have
            gone back to the basics. If the point of this was actual production, I
            would be happy with this models!</p>
        <p>But lets be real, I am just having fun in here, I don’t really care
            about what is the best, I want to try new things and I won’t let Deep
            Learning down.</p>
        <h3 id="idea-4">Idea 4</h3>
        <p>Back to the world of Deep Learning, at the end of the day, all of
            this are just experiments and I wanted to see how far I could stretch my
            capacity of using a single Deep Learning Classifier. My goal was
            extremely simple. I wanted to get to at least 70% accuracy.</p>
        <p>The first thing that I made was generate a lot more labels, I feel
            like I did Deep Learning a disservice by using so little data. So I
            generate another 400k labels using Llama3.1-7B (this time a smaller
            model because I don’t want to break the bank on inference).</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/accuracy_for_new_dataset.png" alt="Some of the runs I did for the new dataset">
            
        </figure>
        <p>I did some experiments and to not bore you I saw that the more data
            the better for my specific runs. So I decided to just do a dry run with
            two different models, this time, influenced by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21783">The Llama 3
                Herd of Models</a>
            from Meta I used the <code>roberta-base</code> model and the good old
            <code>gte-large</code> from before.
        </p>
        <p><code>gte-large</code> got me a lot closer to what I was expecting
            with results of up to 69.22% accuracy on the training dataset[2].</p>

        <p>I genuinely think that it was a skill issue from my side that I was
            uncapable of making the Deep Learning model perform at the top of the
            performance chart. Anyways, for now I am just going to grab the best
            model which was the XGBoost embeddings model and really dial it in
            because I want to do other projects in my free time.</p>

        <p>The last thing that I tried was a hyper parameter sweep on the
            XGBoost embeddings model because it was the most performant overall. A
            hyperparameter sweep is basically a way to move all the different nobs
            that the base model has so that it can perform to the best of its
            abilities.</p>

        <p>Now that we have some models, we can do the fun part and generate
            labels for the rest of the entire dataset!</p>
        <h2 id="classifying-all-the-corpus">Classifying all the corpus</h2>
        <p>The code is nothing fancy. It literally loads to memory some
            embeddings and then predicts them. The distribution of predictions looks
            like the following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/predictions_8448751_pie.png" alt="Distribution of predictions for XGBoost ensemble">
            
        </figure>
        <p>It took roughly an hour to predict all of the pdf tags but this was
            because I didn’t make it run on GPU because I forgot to set it up that
            way. But even then, I would have to say that it is not that bad times
            wise!</p>
        <p>Finally, I wanted to generate some incredibly aesthetically pleasing
            pictures. And after doing some test runs on my local machine I decided
            to do some PCA and UMAP visualizations of a looot of points. Like, ALL
            of the predictions + embeddings. I am pretty sure this are not the
            biggest runs of PCA and UMAP but they might be up there.</p>
        <p>For PCA I made a visualization of the entire dataset. All of the
            eight and a half million dots in a single picture:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pca_visualization_8448751_no_classes.png" alt="PCA of all the points">
            
        </figure>
        <p>For the classifications, it looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pca_visualization_8448751_samples.png" alt="PCA classification of all the points">
            
        </figure>
        <p>And if we decouple each class it looks like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/pca_visualization_all_classes_no_na.png" alt="PCA classification decoupled">
            
        </figure>
        <p>Finally, for UMAP, I had to rent out a bigger machine and thanks to
            the kind sponsorship of some credit from my internship. I rented out a
            Standard_E48s_v3 from Azure, this machine has 48 cores, 384 GB RAM and
            768 GB disk. I ran only 6.5 million points through UMAP because 6.5
            million was the closest I could get the machine before it went out of
            memory. I have a screenshot that shows all of the might of UMAP draining
            the RAM.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/chonky_ram.jpg" alt="Chonky use of RAM">
            
        </figure>
        <p>So finally, for the UMAP visualization, it looks like the
            following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/umap_visualization_6500000_no_classes.png" alt="UMAP unclassified">
            
        </figure>
        <p>And the classifications look like this:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/umap_visualization_6500000_samples.png" alt="UMAP classified">
            
        </figure>
        <p>Per class plot looks like the following:</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="https://snats.xyz/pages/articles/assets/umap_visualization_all_classes_no_na.png" alt="UMAP classified">
            
        </figure>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I feel like it was a fun experience to do overall but I could have
            done a little bit better. Specifically with the Deep Learning stuff. At
            the time I hadn’t rented a lot GPUs and I was just using my laptop, so I
            got desperate and decided to call it quits in the sake of time. This
            article is already pretty long as it is.</p>
        <p>At the same time, its impressive to have gone this far. I really
            think that it is a big project that I got out this time. Considering
            that pdfs are a mixture of data and images, I think we are going to
            start seeing them more and more in training pipelines for VLMS/Omni
            models. If you want to try another massive dataset, you should try <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11271">MINT-1T</a> which has a mixture
            of PDFs + websites!</p>
        <p>After all of this, I can confidently tell you that even now, I am
            pretty sure you can do a lot better and you can easily surpass this.</p>
        <p>That is why, I am releasing all of the datasets in this <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/snats/url-classifications">huggingface
                repo</a>. If you are just interested in the embeddings, you can find
            them in Kaggle right <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiagopedroza/url-embeddings-cc-provenance">here</a>.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>An exciting feature <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D99517">just landed in the main branch of the Clang
compiler</a>. Using the <code>[[clang::musttail]]</code> or
<code>__attribute__((musttail))</code> statement attributes, you can now get guaranteed
tail calls in C, C++, and Objective-C.</p>



<p>While tail calls are usually associated with a functional programming style, I
am interested in them purely for performance reasons.  It turns out that in
some cases we can use tail calls to get better code out of the compiler than
would otherwise be possible—at least given current compiler
technology—without dropping to assembly.</p>

<p>Applying this technique to protobuf parsing has yielded amazing results: <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb/pull/310">we
have managed to demonstrate protobuf parsing at over
2GB/s</a>, more than double the
previous state of the art.  There are multiple techniques that contributed to
this speedup, so “tail calls == 2x speedup” is the wrong message to take away.
But tail calls are a key part of what made that speedup possible.</p>

<p>In this blog entry I will describe why tail calls are such a powerful
technique, how we applied them to protobuf parsing, and how this technique
generalizes to interpreters. I think it’s likely that all of the major language
interpreters written in C (Python, Ruby, PHP, Lua, etc.) could get significant
performance benefits by adopting this technique.  The main downside is
portability: currently <code>musttail</code> is a nonstandard compiler extension, and
while I hope it catches on it will be a while before it spreads widely enough
that your system’s C compiler is likely to support it.  That said, at build
time you can compromise some efficiency for portability if you detect that
<code>musttail</code> is not available.</p>

<h2 id="tail-call-basics">Tail Call Basics</h2>

<p>A tail call is any function call that is in tail position, the final action to
be performed before a function returns.  When <em>tail call optimization</em> occurs,
the compiler emits a <code>jmp</code> instruction for the tail call instead of <code>call</code>.
This skips over the bookkeeping that would normally allow the callee <code>g()</code> to
return back to the caller <code>f()</code>, like creating a new stack frame or pushing the
return address.  Instead <code>f()</code> jumps directly to <code>g()</code> as if it were part of
the same function, and <code>g()</code> returns directly to whatever function called
<code>f()</code>. This optimization is safe because <code>f()</code>’s stack frame is no longer
needed once the tail call has begun, since it is no longer possible to access
any of <code>f()</code>’s local variables.</p>

<p>While this may seem like a run-of-the-mill optimization, it has two very
important properties unlock new possibilities in the kinds of algorithms we can
write.  First, it reduces the stack memory from from ++O(n)++ to ++O(1)++ when
making ++n++ consecutive tail calls, which is important because stack memory is
limited and stack overflow will crash your program.  This means that certain
algorithms are not actually safe to write unless this optimization is
performed.  Secondly, <code>jmp</code> eliminates the performance overhead of <code>call</code>, such
that a function call can be just as efficient as any other branch. These two
properties enable us to use tail calls as an efficient alternative to
normal iterative control structures like <code>for</code> or <code>while</code>.</p>

<p>This is by no means a new idea, indeed it goes back to at least 1977 when Guy
Steele wrote <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/5753">an entire paper</a>
arguing that procedure calls make for cleaner designs than <code>GOTO</code>, and that
tail call optimization can make them just as fast. This was one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Scheme_programming_language#The_Lambda_Papers">“Lambda
Papers”</a>
written between 1975 and 1980 that developed many of the ideas underlying Lisp
and Scheme.</p>

<p>Tail call optimization is not even new to Clang: like GCC and many other
compilers, Clang was already capable of optimizing tail calls. In fact, the
<code>musttail</code> attribute in our first example above did not change the output of
the compiler at all: Clang would already have optimized the tail call under
<code>-O2</code>.</p>

<p>What is new is the <em>guarantee</em>. While compilers will often optimize tail calls
successfully, this is best-effort, not something you can rely on. In
particular, the optimization will most likely not happen in non-optimized
builds:</p>



<p>Here the tail call was compiled to an actual <code>call</code>, so we are back to ++O(n)++
stack space. This is why we need <code>musttail</code>: unless we can get a guarantee from
the compiler that our tail calls will <em>always</em> be optimized, in all build
modes, it isn’t safe to write algorithms that use tail calls for iteration.  It
would be a pretty severe limitation to have code that only works when
optimizations are enabled.</p>

<h2 id="the-trouble-with-interpreter-loops">The Trouble With Interpreter Loops</h2>

<p>Compilers are incredible pieces of technology, but they are not perfect.  Mike
Pall, author of LuaJIT, decided to write LuaJIT 2.x’s interpreter in assembly
rather than C, and he cites this decision as a major factor that explains <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/badl2/luajit_2_beta_3_is_out_support_both_x32_x64/c0lrus0/">why
LuaJIT’s interpreter is so
fast</a>.
He later went into more detail about <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2011-02/msg00742.html">why C compilers struggle with interpreter
main loops</a>.  His two
most central points are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The larger a function is, and the more complex and connected its control
flow, the harder it is for the compiler’s register allocator to keep the most
important data in registers.</li>
  <li>When fast paths and slow paths are intermixed in the same function, the
presence of the slow paths compromises the code quality of the fast paths.</li>
</ul>

<p>These observations closely mirror our experiences optimizing protobuf parsing.
The good news is that tail calls can help solve both of these problems.</p>

<p>It may seem odd to compare interpreter loops to protobuf parsers, but the
nature of the protobuf wire format makes them more similar than you might
expect.  The protobuf wire format is a series of tag/value pairs, where the tag
contains a field number and wire type.  This tag acts similarly to an
interpreter opcode: it tells us what operation we need to perform to parse this
field’s data.  Like interpreter opcodes, protobuf field numbers can come in any
order, so we have to be prepared to dispatch to any part of the code at any
time.</p>

<p>The natural way to write such a parser is to have a <code>while</code> loop surrounding a
<code>switch</code> statement, and indeed this has been the state of the art in protobuf
parsing for basically as long as protobufs have existed. For example, <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/f763a2a86084371fd0da95f3eeb879c2ff26b06d/src/google/protobuf/descriptor.pb.cc#L2175-L2227">here is
some parsing code from the current C++ version of protobuf</a>.  If we represent the
control flow graphically, we get something like this:</p>

<center>
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vRKuMNm6Tw_Sn2xJxBDQMHT0u0osp9DUA0Ldr-MhMVp63GPinzYB9JT0qRY9HTymmsesomq3aZe7QEs/pub?w=740">
</center>

<p>But this is incomplete, because at almost every stage there are things that
can go wrong.  The wire type could be wrong, or we could see some corrupt
data, or we could just hit the end of the current buffer.  So the full
control flow graph looks more like this.</p>

<center>
<img src="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTGgQuAThUGv9ejI_pjujfKRM8rgo7c5b8lP7uveSkJTkJMbZDrtDbJzmRA4HOoDozwjj9WWPlDu8JX/pub?w=740">
</center>

<p>We want to stay on the fast paths (in blue) as much as possible, but when we
hit a hard case we have to execute some fallback code to handle it.  These
fallback paths are usually bigger and more complicated than the fast paths,
touch more data, and often even make out-of-line calls to other functions to
handle the more complex cases.</p>

<p>Theoretically, this control flow graph paired with a profile should give the
compiler all of the information it needs to generate the most optimal code.  In
practice, when a function is this big and connected, we often find ourselves
fighting the compiler.  It spills an important variable when we want it to keep
it in a register.  It hoists stack frame manipulation that we want to shrink
wrap around a fallback function invocation.  It merges identical code paths
that we wanted to keep separate for branch prediction reasons.  The experience
can end up feeling like trying to play the piano while wearing mittens.</p>

<h2 id="improving-interpreter-loops-with-tail-calls">Improving Interpreter Loops With Tail Calls</h2>

<p>The analysis above is mainly just a rehash of of Mike’s <a href="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2011-02/msg00742.html">observations about
interpreter main
loops</a>.  But instead of
dropping to assembly, as Mike did with LuaJIT 2.x, we found that a tail call
oriented design could give us the control we needed to get nearly optimal code
from C.  I worked on this together with my colleague Gerben Stavenga, who came
up with much of the design.  Our approach is similar to the design of the
<a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3">wasm3 WebAssembly interpreter</a> which describes
this pattern as a <a href="https://github.com/wasm3/wasm3/blob/main/docs/Interpreter.md#m3-massey-meta-machine">“meta
machine”</a>.</p>

<p>The code for our 2+GB/s protobuf parser was submitted to
<a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb">upb</a>, a small protobuf library written
in C, in <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb/pull/310">pull/310</a>.  While it
is fully working and passing all protobuf conformance tests, it is not rolled
out anywhere yet, and the design has not been implemented in the C++ version of
protobuf.  But now that <code>musttail</code> is available in Clang (and <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/upb/pull/390">upb has been
updated to use it</a>), one of
the biggest barriers to fully productionizing the fast parser has been removed.</p>

<p>Our design does away with a single big parse function and instead gives each
operation its own small function.  Each function tail calls the next operation
in sequence.  For example here is a function to parse a single fixed-width
field.  (This code is simplified from the actual code in upb; there are many
details of our design that I am leaving out of this article, but will hopefully
cover in future articles).</p>

<p>For a function this small and simple, Clang gives us code that is
basically impossible to beat.</p>

<pre><code>upb_pf32_1bt:                           # @upb_pf32_1bt
        mov     rax, r9
        shr     rax, 24
        bts     r8, rax
        test    r9b, r9b
        jne     .LBB0_1
        mov     r10, r9
        shr     r10, 48
        mov     eax, dword ptr [rsi + 1]
        mov     dword ptr [rdx + r10], eax
        add     rsi, 5
        jmp     dispatch                        # TAILCALL
.LBB0_1:
        jmp     fallback                        # TAILCALL
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is no prologue or epilogue, no register spills, indeed there is
no usage of the stack whatsoever.  The only exits are <code>jmp</code>s from the two tail
calls, but no code is required to forward the parameters, because the arguments
are already sitting in the correct registers.  Pretty much the only improvement
we could hope for is to get a conditional jump for the tail call, <code>jne
fallback</code>, instead of <code>jne</code> followed by <code>jmp</code>.</p>

<p>If you were looking at a disassembly of this code without symbol information,
you would have no reason to know that this was an entire function. It could
just as easily be a basic block from a larger function.  And that, in essence,
is exactly what we are doing.  We are taking an interpreter loop that is
conceptually a big complicated function and programming it block by block,
transferring control flow from one to the next via tail calls.  We have full
control of the register allocation at every block boundary (well, for six
registers at least), and by using the same set of parameters for each function,
we eliminate the need to shuffle any values around from one call to the next.
As long as the function is simple enough to not spill those six registers,
we’ve achieved our goal of keeping our most important state in registers
throughout all of the fast paths.</p>

<p>We can optimize every instruction sequence independently, and crucially, the
compiler will treat each sequence as independent too because they are in
separate functions (we can prevent inlining with <code>noinline</code> if necessary).
This solves the problem we described earlier where the code from fallback paths
would degrade the code quality for fast paths. If we put the slow paths in
entirely separate functions from the fast paths, we can be guaranteed that
the fast paths will not suffer.  The nice assembly sequence we see above is
effectively frozen, unaffected by any changes we make to other parts of the
parser.</p>

<p>If we apply this pattern to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/badl2/luajit_2_beta_3_is_out_support_both_x32_x64/c0lrus0/">Mike’s example from
LuaJIT</a>,
we can more or less <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/K8Mo6hcGa">match his hand-written assembly with only minor code
quality defects</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>#define PARAMS unsigned RA, void *table, unsigned inst, \
               int *op_p, double *consts, double *regs
#define ARGS RA, table, inst, op_p, consts, regs
typedef void (*op_func)(PARAMS);
void fallback(PARAMS);

#define UNLIKELY(x) __builtin_expect(x, 0)
#define MUSTTAIL __attribute__((musttail))

void ADDVN(PARAMS) {
    op_func *op_table = table;
    unsigned RC = inst &amp; 0xff;
    unsigned RB = (inst &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff;
    unsigned type;
    memcpy(&amp;type, (char*)&amp;regs[RB] + 4, 4);
    if (UNLIKELY(type &gt; -13)) {
        return fallback(ARGS);
    }
    regs[RA] += consts[RC];
    inst = *op_p++;
    unsigned op = inst &amp; 0xff;
    RA = (inst &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff;
    inst &gt;&gt;= 16;
    MUSTTAIL return op_table[op](ARGS);
}
</code></pre></div>

<p>The resulting assembly is:</p>

<pre><code>ADDVN:                                  # @ADDVN
        movzx   eax, dh
        cmp     dword ptr [r9 + 8*rax + 4], -12
        jae     .LBB0_1
        movzx   eax, dl
        movsd   xmm0, qword ptr [r8 + 8*rax]    # xmm0 = mem[0],zero
        mov     eax, edi
        addsd   xmm0, qword ptr [r9 + 8*rax]
        movsd   qword ptr [r9 + 8*rax], xmm0
        mov     edx, dword ptr [rcx]
        add     rcx, 4
        movzx   eax, dl
        movzx   edi, dh
        shr     edx, 16
        mov     rax, qword ptr [rsi + 8*rax]
        jmp     rax                             # TAILCALL
.LBB0_1:
        jmp     fallback
</code></pre>

<p>The only opportunity for improvement I see here, aside from the <code>jne fallback</code>
issue mentioned before, is that for some reason the compiler doesn’t want to
generate <code>jmp qword ptr [rsi + 8*rax]</code>. Instead it prefers to load into <code>rax</code>
and then follow with <code>jmp rax</code>.  These are minor code generation issues that
could hopefully be fixed in Clang without too much work.</p>

<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>One of the biggest caveats with this approach is that these beautiful assembly
sequences get catastrophically pessimized if any non tail calls are present.
Any non tail call forces a stack frame to be created, and a lot of data spills
to the stack.</p>

<p>To avoid this, we tried to follow a discipline of only calling other functions
via inlining or tail calls.  This can get annoying if an operation has multiple
points at which an unusual case can occur that is not an error.  For example,
when we are parsing protobufs, the fast and common case is that varints are
only one byte long, but longer varints are not an error.  Handling the unusual
case inline can compromise the quality of the fast path if the fallback code is
too complicated.  But tail calling to a fallback function gives no way of
easily resuming the operation once the unusual case is handled, so the fallback
function must be capable of pushing forward and completing the operation.  This
leads to code duplication and complexity.</p>

<p>Ideally this issue could be solved by adding
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#preserve-most"><code>__attribute__((preserve_most))</code></a>
to the fallback functions and then calling them normally, without tail calls.
The <code>preserve_most</code> attribute makes the callee responsible for preserving
nearly all registers, which moves the cost of the register spills to the
fallback functions where we want it.  We experimented some with this attribute
but ran into some mysterious problems that we were not able to get to the
bottom of.  It may have been an error on our part; revisiting this is future
work.  <em>[<strong>Update: 2023-03-14:</strong> it turns out this was a bug in Clang, which was
<a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D141020">fixed two months ago</a>]</em></p>

<p>The other major limitation is that <code>musttail</code> is not portable.  I very much
hope that the attribute will catch on, spreading to GCC, Visual C++, and other
popular compilers, and even get standardized someday.  But that day is far off,
so what to do in the meantime?</p>

<p>When <code>musttail</code> is not available, we need to perform at least one true
<code>return</code>, without a tail call, for every conceptual loop iteration.  We have
not yet implemented this fallback in upb, but I expect it will involve a macro
that either tail calls to dispatch or just returns, based on the availability
of musttail.</p>

<p>One can choose to focus on the car crash, or the lessons learned from the car crash.</p>



<p>Let’s do a little of both.</p>



<p>The proposition of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/livingcomputermuseum.org" data-type="link" data-id="https://web.archive.org/web/20240000000000*/livingcomputermuseum.org">Living Computer Museum</a> was initially simple, and rather amusing in a <a href="https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/12/10/26/1826239/living-computer-museum-opens-to-public-in-seattle">Slashdot-baity</a> sort of way: You could apply to get an account on a real, actual ancient Mainframe hooked up to the Internet, which meant you could literally connect into real, actual ancient hardware. I assure you that to a segment of the population, this is an irresistible proposition. It’s also, ultimately, one that even the most ardent fans of “how it was” will leaf away from, because mainframes are their own wacky old world, like using a taffy-pull hook, and appeal on a day-to-day basis to a relative handful of die-hards.</p>



<p>But in 2011, the Living Computer Museum announced itself with the kind of slick webpage that promised computer history buffs a new wonderland.</p>

<p>There’s a lot to take in with this verbiage, but let’s keep going, for now.</p>



<p>In 2012, the Living Computer Museum opened its actual, physical doors to the public in Seattle. A year later, I visited. It was rather nice. I got a grand and lovely tour by some very polite and friendly people, some of whom I’d known for years. The rooms, well appointed, well-lit, and in the case of the machine rooms, done to a sparkling arrangement, clamored for my attention and approval.</p>

<p>There were computer museums for years, decades before Living Computer Museum, scattered among the United States and the world. I’ve been to many of them – sometimes as an honored guest and backstage VIP, and sometimes just because I hastily read my “find me weirdo geek stuff” Google Maps results and negotiated public transit to walk into the door and walk around like a strutting mayor to see what’s what. In that pantheon, I would put LCM in the realm of “very well appointed, especially the mainframes” but not in the realm of “nobody, ever, has ever tried anything like this”. Just off the top of my head, the <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum in Mountain View</a> has brought not just mainframes and historical computers back from oblivion, but hosted events in which their maintainers and figures have gotten a chance to get their stories on record.</p>



<p>Still, one couldn’t argue with it – the LCM was a solid new outpost in Telling Computer History, and it was on my shortlist of potential homes for materials I might donate in the future. I had a lovely conversation with a member of management about how they maintained functionality and also what their contingencies were for any sort of “endgame” that might befall the endeavor. He assured me they had storage aplenty, in the extremely unlikely event they had to face a closure. Ultimately I didn’t donate my materials there, simply because I found nearer geographic or mission-aligning homes.</p>



<p>My next, and it turns out last, major visit to the Living Computer Museum (outside of a few drive-bys) came in 2018, when I spoke at an event being held there. This gifted me with a chance to see how things had changed in 5 years, and how they had.</p>

<p>Here, then, was something approaching a dream. We had the display cases of technology and the clean carpets and cathedral ceilings of available space, filled not just with computers on desks but entire computer-related environments: classroom, arcade, basement, that showed youngsters what sort of context these computers had lived in.  I met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyndemoya/?originalSubdomain=au">Cynde Moya</a>, who had been described to me years earlier as a hard-nosed disciplined caretaker of the materials, and who turned out to be everything they said except hard-nosed – a truly dear overseer of things physical within these walls. </p>



<p>This was April 2018. I lived in the world I live all the time: full of hope, equally full of expectation of doom. But hope was winning.</p>



<p>In October of 2018, Paul Allen was dead.</p>

<p>I suppose everyone has opinions on billionaries, their position in the world, what they represent, and maybe almost everyone has, spoken or unspoken, an awareness that the level of money billions represents disengages you, whether you think so or not, from humanity.</p>



<div><p>I mean, sure, they cry, laugh, stub their toe, wonder if that’s rain coming, get surprised when the killer’s revealed in a well-done noir thriller. But there’s this cloud of wealth that is ever-present and depending on how it is maintained, or manifested, it slowly bleaches out the edges of living until you realize there is a shocking serenity in their countenance, a noise-cancelling blur that surrounds them, because there are always people whose job is to be aware of them and whose job is to ensure the serenity is maintained. </p><p>And there’s the sheer spending power of a billion. I’m sure I could toss out a hundred funny examples of the sheer numerical force of a billion dollars. For example, you could have someone buy a 2025 Subaru Outback, itself the rough amount on the lower end (nationally) of a Domino’s Pizza General Manager’s yearly salary before taxes, and push it into a lake. Taking Christmas and the pusher’s birthday off, to run through a billion dollars of Subaru Outbacks would take you 61 solid years. </p></div>



<p><em>But that’s not even very accurate</em>. During that 61 years of pushing Subaru Outbacks into a lake (in Neutral, of course, I’m not a <strong>monster</strong>), the remaining amount of the money not being spent to purchase lake-bound outbacks would actually be<em> <strong>MORE. THAN. A. BILLION. </strong></em>You would actually be richer than you started, if you invested it in even the most brain-dead obvious multi-percent-a-year funds, or left it in any bank. That’s because time and space warp around money.</p>



<p>So do people.</p>

<div><p>In 2018, after getting cancer in 2009 and 1982, Allen got it again, and this third (public) bout with it ended him, at age 65. His net worth at the time of his demise is the kind that publications who make it their business to will guess at, and the guess sat around $20 billion. Everyone has kind of accepted that, but it’s not really important if it’s $50, $15 or $5 billion. It’s a lot of money. </p><p>With his billions, over the decades, Allen owned or partly owned three sports teams, at least 10 companies ranging from airplanes, scientific research, media, and space flight. He owned massive real estate, a movie theater, threw buckets of cash at schools, the arts, and ultimately, a few museums.</p><p>To manage it all, he had a company whose purpose was to manage the money, because he wasn’t going to do it himself. The company’s name is Vulcan, Inc. Even after divestment and shutdown after Allen’s death, it has 700 employees. It is one of the largest trusts in the world. It is also now called Vale Group, but I’m going to keep calling it Vulcan.</p></div>

<p>Vulcan, a company whose job is to manage money and where that goes, is still quite intensely active as an entity, even with Paul Allen’s death. His sister, Jody Allen, chairs the organization she co-founded with her brother in 1986. This company is absolutely gargantuan in its scope and range, and remember, it is a company that just manages a ton of money – that’s the company’s entire purpose. </p>



<p><em>I wish to take a short moment to not demonize Jody Allen. </em>As the remaining sibling in charge of this company, functionally working through her brother’s holdings, many of which she clearly had no interest or extant position in, and doing so for six years and counting, can’t be anything else than the strangest mixture of pain and endless complication. The $20 billion she’s now in charge of might soften the blow, but likely not by much.</p>



<p>And I apologize for the whiplash here. I’m not overly interested in going down the paths of describing what Jody should be doing, or what her responsibilities are. I am not privy to whatever deep law and lore and functions buried within Vulcan’s iron heart she and her army of people are dealing with, that <em>six years later</em> they are still slowly divesting organizations. I know she has personally called for cullings but I am not informed about the deepest depths of how the aspects of these billions function.</p>



<p>I want to refocus to the fact that Vulcan is divesting itself of the Living Computer Museum.</p>



<p><strong>I want to refocus to the fact that the Living Computer Museum was never a museum.</strong></p>

<p>Look, don’t jump down my throat about this. I’m as shocked as you are.</p>



<p>I didn’t get some inkling from the phone call I had a decade before about potentially donating to Living Computer Museum. I don’t have some spidey-sense about failure or darkness – I just see it everywhere in everything and I treat every day like it’s the one before they find a lump.</p>



<div><p>If, before it closed, you had made me stand in the center of the LCM and answer whether it was a museum, I’d have happily held up my top hot and shouted “Why yes! One of the finest in all the realms!”</p><p>And for all I’d know, it <em>was</em> a museum. There’s no laws on what a thing can call itself regarding being a museum, exhibition, tour, or display. It’s against the law to take money to attend the museum and you get led to an empty lot, sure. But if something has the vestements and affectation of a museum, and you see the big sign saying Museum out front and you go in and there’s displays and staff and events and meetings, you would certainly think it was a museum.</p></div>



<p>Turns out it wasn’t.</p>

<div><p>The auction house Christie’s announced it was doing an auction of some of the best portions of Paul Allen’s estate, first with art, and now it would be selling off technology. To fans and studiers of the Living Computer Museum, these items seemed familiar – some of them were on display in the museum. </p><p>I found out that some of these to-be-auctioned items would be on display near where I live, so I hopped in my car, parked grandiosely illegally in front of the building, and let myself in. </p></div>

<p>On display were all sorts of computer history of the “early major days” variety, ranging from a Xerox Star to an Englebart Mouse and even a Pac-Man machine. All had descriptions, all were held out where you could get very near them assuming the guard wasn’t watching too closely, and all of it with a starry-eyed disco-ball aesthetic indicating you were in a space lounge.</p>



<p>So yes, items from the museum were now going to be sold to the highest bidder in a few months. These were some of them, and likely there would be more.</p>



<p>And then, among the relics, I found Stephen Jones.</p>

<p>Stephen Jones and I go a long way back. He was interviewed by me for the BBS Documentary in 2003. So that’s 20 years I’ve known the guy. At our interview session, he showed me his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PXL2000">PXL-2000</a> and his Delorean, both of which I can assure you are high-end geek possessions of the time. And I found his conversation style charming, and his passion for technical subjects perfect for my film. </p>



<p>Stephen’s primary non-profit endeavor, the <a href="https://sdf.org/">SDF Public Access UNIX system</a>, was in full swing back then, and is still around now.  “Do cool computer things, but don’t try to turn everything into a financial instrument” is not the motto, but it should be. It represents, to me, a lovely ideal of a truly living computer community, incorporating new technology as it expresses itself being something neat, or worth bringing in. Laptop Amish, if you’re stretching around for an anology, which you shouldn’t be. It’s a computer club. And he’s a big part of it.</p>



<p>He was also my initial “in” for the dish on the now-not-so-Living Computer Museum. We’d gone a long way, and here we were, in Christie’s in New York City, standing among offered-for-auction pieces of a gone billionaire’s museum, and maybe we needed to talk in detail, so we did. And I grilled him.</p>



<p>Let’s go back to that initial 2011 announcement page on the Living Computers Museum website, before it was officially an open building.</p>

<p>In the light of its piecemeal disassembly, a lot of this writing hits different. Here’s what I’ve picked up, from Stephen and others, and which I assume for some readers will be new information.</p>



<p>First, this was always intended to be an actual, non-profit, independent/independent-subsidiary museum. It never became that. It is not that. At best, the Living Computer Museum was a billionaire’s (sorry, multi-billionaire’s) collection of computers and technology. </p>



<p>Think of it another way: Jay Leno has a <a href="https://www.lenosgarage.com/">very famous garage</a> that has many wonderful cars and vehicles in it. It is currently, as of this writing, run by a very competent manager named <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernard-juchli-27a57311/">Bernard Juchli</a>, who has been keeping the collection in line for over 20 years. That is, to say, that Leno has a massive collection of cars, competent staff to take care of it, facilities to show them (he has had a number of documentaries and television shows about the garage) and he could probably even open it to the public for an admission price. But you would be hard pressed to call it a “museum” in any sense beyond “it is a display people see videos about”.</p>



<div><p>As per the request in that 2011 webpage grab, people donated many computers and pieces of history to go into the museum. They expected, no doubt, that they and their children and their childen’s children could stop by displays and point and talk about the family connection to these items. </p><p>That was a mirage, a misunderstanding.</p></div>



<div><p>This was Paul’s collection of computers, aided by friends and fans. It was always that. The Living Computer Museum, it turns out, cost millions, over ten million a year, to operate as it was set up, and it never came close to making that amount of income from door sales and t-shirts. It never came close to even figuring out how it would.</p><p>It’s perhaps not surprising this misunderstanding could happen, and with what felt like all the time in the world, a mere five years and change of being open to the public might have seemed like a mere revving up for the grand plan of what would come next. But nothing came next. It was a collection you could walk through in a really, really nice display case.</p></div>



<p>And now it’s time to sell the collection.</p>

<p>Before I end up on a huge rant about what it means to be a museum, let me at least give you some relative good news.</p>



<p>The current rough plan is that the big-ticket items, like this Apple I, will be sold at auction. They’ll make beaucoup bucks, go into private collections or maybe even other institutions, and that’s that for the headliners. But that leaves a lot of other stuff.</p>



<p>SDF has a rough plan to raise funds and digitize software, documentation and other related items that are <em>not </em>part of these big-ticket sales (which will be relatively few) so that unique bits of history that are <em>not</em> headline-grabbing trinkets will, potentially, have a chance at being shared with the public.</p>



<p><strong>And I’ve stepped into it. I’ve offered to take software and documentation and store it at the Internet Archive, and of course to work with SDF on ways to digitize/rip/scan materials and, also, host them at the Internet Archive.</strong></p>



<p>It’s all preliminary, but my card is in the hat. Things are not going to be discarded, if I have anything to do with it. A lot can change, and we’ve already seen expectation vs. outcome with this whole experience, but rest assured, I’ve at least tried to provide one last safety net for the kind of history that easily finds itself gone because nobody steps forward. Internet Archive has stepped forward. Stay tuned to see how that works out.</p>

<p>But you know, what did we <em>learn</em> here? What did we actually <em>come away with</em> in the realm of lessons or teachings about what issues this whole mishegaas has churned up?</p>



<p>I have found, perhaps not to my surprise, that a few people in my orbit are displeased I have punched the dead billionaire, ostensibly about all the good the dead billionaire did. But I wish to point out the dead billionaire did give away all that money and yet still had 20 billion dollars at the end, money that went off and did not do as many nice things as the money given away. So much contributed, tax-free, and yet there’s even more. Perhaps this is not the best place to point out that every billionaire is, in many ways, a failure of society, but maybe we can put a pin in it when we have our first trillionaire, assuming that criticizing a trillionaire is not made illegal at that soonish juncture.</p>



<p>I did have some people say, in not so many words, that <em>of course </em>the Living Computer Museum would collapse once its Master of the House was no longer in charge, and I would take this time to point out that Gordon Bell, co-founder of the Computer History Museum, passed on in May of 2024 and yet the Computer History Museum lives and breathes in his absence. It wasn’t a hard problem.</p>



<p>It’s easy to call me ungrateful, but my ungratefulness comes from the narrative people weave near the power of money, like those myths formed around gods and devils, to explain why things are how they are. I appreciate life and its little whorls and eddies that capture us by surprise and we sink or swim. I do not appreciate acting like someone spending a lot of money on something that slightly amuses them earns them the greatest respect. Especially when, as I do now, I walk among a literal army of people working to clean up the mess left behind, after their march to oblivion.</p>

<p>A previously lost cache of celebrity and historical interviews from a long-dormant radio show have been discovered, digitized, and made available for all.</p>



<p>The Internet Archive is now home to 53 episodes of <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe">The Famous Computer Cafe</a>, a 1980s radio show about the new world of home computers. The program included computer industry news, product reviews, and interviews, and aired from 1983 through 1986 on radio stations in southern and central California.</p>



<p>The creators of The Famous Computer Cafe saved every episode on reel-to-reel tapes, but over the years the tapes were forgotten, and, ultimately, lost. Earlier this year archivist Kay Savetz recovered several of the tapes in a property sale, and recognizing their value and worthiness of professional transfer, launched a GoFundMe to have them digitized, and <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe">made them available at Internet Archive</a> with the permission of the show’s creators.</p>



<p>While full of time-capsule descriptions of 1980s technology news, the most exciting aspect of the show has been the variety and uniqueness of the interviews. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zx56qfqhKMmgaGyN6ZQ1lqaaNAohDXqgRHS1qM_vID0/edit?usp=sharing">list of people</a> that the show interviewed is a who’s-who of tech luminaries of the 1980s: computer people, musicians, publishers, philosophers, journalists. Interviews in the recovered recordings include <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe?tab=collection&amp;query=Timothy+leary&amp;and%5B%5D=mediatype:%22audio%22">Timothy Leary</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1984-12-21_Douglas_Adams_and_Steve_Meretzky">Douglas Adams</a>, <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1984-11-17_Bill_Gates_and_Kazuhiko_Nishi">Bill Gates</a>, Atari’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-famous-computer-cafe-1985-01-17_Jack_Tramiel_and_Bobby_Kotick">Jack Tramiel</a>, Apple’s <a href="https://archive.org/details/famous-computer-cafe?tab=collection&amp;query=atkinson">Bill Atkinson</a>, and dozens of others. The recovered shows span November 17 1984 through July 12, 1985.</p>



<p>Many more of the original reel-to-reel tapes — including shows with interviews with Ray Bradbury, Robert Moog, Donny Osmond, and Gene Roddenberry — are still lost, and perhaps are still waiting to be found in the Los Angeles area.</p>



<p>The stories of how The Famous Computer Cafe was created — and saved, 40 years later —&nbsp;is explored in <a href="https://www.radiosurvivor.com/2024/08/podcast-342-the-famous-computer-cafe/">an episode of the Radio Survivor podcast</a>. The podcast interviewed show co-creator Ellen Fields and archivist Kay Savetz, providing a dual perspective of how the show was created and how it was recovered.</p>



<p>The recovery of these interviews, 40 years after their original airing, holds out hope that many more relics and treasures still await discovery.</p>

  <p>Everyone knows Roblox is huge. But as COVID receded into memory, Roblox shifted from “new” to “familiar,” and gaming experienced its <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/gaming2024" target="_blank">largest contraction in nearly a quarter century</a>, the platform continued to grow. And grow. And grow. As a result, there is now a significant disparity between the perceived size of Roblox and its actual, unprecedented scale.</p><p>During the average day, more than 80MM people log onto Roblox. As a historical point of contrast, this means that more people log onto Roblox every 10 or so minutes than used <em>Second Life</em> in a month at its peak. On a monthly basis, Roblox now counts more than 380MM users according to RTrack – 2x as many as PC gaming leader Steam, 3x that of Sony’s PlayStations, 3x the number of unique <em>annual </em>users of the Nintendo Switch in a <em>year</em>, and 5x as many as have bought an Xbox console in the last decade. After accounting for duplication across these platforms, as well as the gap between monthly and annual Switch users, it’s likely Roblox has more monthly users than the entire AAA gaming ecosystem combined. What’s more, NPD/Circana reports that Roblox is <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1823016887443509700/photo/1" target="_blank">typically</a> one of the 3–7 most played games on PlayStation and Xbox (Roblox is not available on Switch or Steam), and SensorTower <a href="https://sensortower.com/state-of-mobile-2024" target="_blank">says that in 2023</a>, Roblox averaged more iOS/Android monthly active users than any other game (including <em>Candy Crush</em>!).</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723939387829_17010">
  <p>Compared to its most similar competitors—the social virtual world platforms, <em>Minecraft </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> — Roblox has about 5x and 2.25x as many monthly players. For non-gamers, Roblox has about two thirds as many monthly users as Spotify and half as many as Snap (though it probably has a lower share of daily-to-monthly active users) and is roughly as popular as Instagram circa Q4 2015, and Facebook in Q3 2009. </p><p>Each month, players spend close to six billion hours using Roblox. This time excludes the viewing of Roblox content on Twitch or YouTube, the largest video platform on earth and which counts non-live gaming content as its second most popular genre, with Roblox one of its five most watched games. Most estimates suggest the average Disney+ account watches no more than 20 hours per month, which would mean about 3.1 billion hours in total monthly watch time—barely half of Roblox’s total.</p>

<p>Not only is Roblox enormously popular, but its growth has been shockingly linear (there is some quarter-to-quarter seasonality, which is common to all media products and particularly significant for Roblox given its over-indexing to children and thus the school calendar). Even at its present scale, it’s difficult to argue that growth won’t continue and that the platform should pass a half billion MAUs and 100 million DAUs. This growth is also resilient. And in contrast to other supposed pandemic darlings such as Zoom, Shopify, and Peloton, Roblox never contracted after the pandemic. Instead, it maintained its overall “pull forward” as well as its accelerated rate of growth. </p>

<p>The composition of Roblox’s growth has also been healthy. The share of Roblox’s total monthly users who use the platform on the average day has grown from 16%–19% pre-pandemic to 22% today. The hours played per DAU and per MAU has also grown, showing that new users are not less engaged users. The share of players over 13 has grown from 40% to 58% (in total there are now 2.5x as many users over 13 as there were users of any age pre-pandemic). Though U.S. and Canadian players are up 250% since the pandemic, their share of the total user base has fallen from 35% to 22% because APAC and ROW users surged 650% and 750%, respectively, taking their share from ~16% and ~21% to 24% and 27%. The global share of players also maps nearly exactly to the global share of playtime, demonstrating that Roblox, like all major social platforms, is a global phenomenon.</p>




















  
  



</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723921664409_30295">
  <p>Although Roblox has diversified its playerbase away from high-income markets and toward more developing ones, revenues per MAU and DAU are up compared to pre-pandemic levels (spending has come down a bit since the peak of the pandemic, though spending was inflated due to a surge in new users that spent heavily to fill their otherwise empty virtual closets). More impressively, spend per hour is also up since before the pandemic—even though users currently play more per month than at any point during Roblox’s existence, with the sole exception of the peak of the pandemic. In other words, Roblox continues to scale its appeal, usage, and monetization.</p><p>Annual spending on Roblox is over $3.8 billion and will pass $4 billion by the end of the year, a quarter of which goes to developers. Given these figures, it is no surprise that Roblox users are hyper-productive. In 2022, Roblox’s users designed 170,000 virtual clothing/accessory items and 15,000 virtual worlds each day (current figures are not known, though average daily users have grown 40% and the ease of creation has improved, as has the quality of the output). Over a hundred user-created worlds have been played over a billion times (and one has over 50 billion plays). </p>

  <p>So yes, Roblox is unquestionably “working.” Yet Roblox is also unprofitable. <em>Very</em> unprofitable. What’s more, Roblox’s losses continue to swell because its impressive rate of revenue growth has been outpaced by that of its costs. Over the last four quarters, Roblox’s income from operations was ($1.2B) on revenues of $3.2B, representing a -38% profit margin. During the company’s four pre-pandemic quarters, income was ($66MM) on $508MM, for a -13% profit margin. Put another way, revenues are now 6.2x greater, but losses are 18x greater. This is not the typical path of a company, least of all a tech company that is a <em>platform</em> and at Roblox’s scale. So what gives and what’s the significance of the answer?</p><p><strong>Growth, But Not Profits</strong></p><p>Obviously, Roblox has a cost<em>s</em> problem. Over the last twelve months it has averaged $138 in costs for every $100 in revenue. </p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_8732">

<p>Unfortunately, many of these costs are outside of Roblox’s control. To start, an average of 23% of revenues are consumed by various App Store/platform fees (this sum is less than 30% because roughly 20% of sales are direct via browser or PC, where Roblox pays credit card processing fees but not 30% store commissions). Another 26% of revenues are paid out to Roblox’s UGC developers. Though the company could theoretically reduce these payments, doing so would harm both brand and developer investment, both of which drive topline. If anything, Roblox wants to grow revenue share, as it would enable developers to invest even more into the platform (many developers are also understandably annoyed they <em>only</em> get a quarter of the revenue they generate, too). In total, Roblox loses 49% of revenue before it even gets to its own costs (let alone the potential of profits).</p>




















  
  



</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_10383">
  <p>Infrastructure and Trust &amp; Safety devours another 28% of revenues on average, down from a peak of 37% but only a point below its six-year average. Unlike App Store fee and developer revenue shares, these costs are not strictly marginal ones. There is a fixed cost per hour for Roblox to operate, and it’s not particularly low, but it does not increase if users increase their spending. As such, this category can see declines on a percentage revenue basis. However, this will not be easy. For example, the clearest way to increase spending is usually to increase playtime, which results in incremental services costs (Roblox has three times the users of PlayStation, but Roblox has only 50% more playtime because its players play half as much per month).</p><p>In order to attract more players—especially older players with money to spend and the discretion to spend it—more playtime per player, and more spend per player and play hour, Roblox is also investing in experiences that, on average, are more expensive to operate, as is the case with Generative AI. Roblox is increasingly focused on using GenAI to provide real-time player communications (e.g., transcription and translation), as well as power asset and world creation, and operate AI agents and NPCs – none of which is cheap to create or operate. The company is also investing deeply in more AI tools and human moderators in order to combat harassment, predation, and more. In August 2024, Turkey banned Roblox outright for the “protection of our children”; a month earlier, <em>Bloomberg</em> published <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/">a brutal report</a> on the platform’s “pedophile problem.”</p><p>So after just three of Roblox’s six cost categories, 77% of revenues are eaten. Combined, the next three are about as costly today—though they have comparatively greater room for improvements and are more under Roblox’s control. Both General &amp; Administrative (13%) and Sales &amp; Marketing (5%) costs are down a few points compared to a few years ago and should continue to decline. Yet even if Roblox cuts these categories down by a third each, that’s only six points of the thirty-eight needed just to break even.</p><p>The biggest and most interesting category is R&amp;D. As a platform, R&amp;D is not just the foundation of Roblox’s present-day scale, it’s essential to all future growth - and to that end, the company reinvests much of its current revenues in order to grow future ones (and the company’s history of doing so is precisely why they are so large today). Specifically, improvements in Roblox’s tools and capabilities help attract developers and enable them to produce “better” and “more” experiences, which helps attract more users, retain users as they age up, and encourage more user spend—all of which increases Roblox’s revenue, which in turn funds more R&amp;D and provides more money to developers, who can then invest more in their experiences. As already mentioned, much of Roblox’s R&amp;D investments are in Generative AI. Roblox Founder and CEO David Baszucki <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23775268/roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-gaming-metaverse-robux-virtual-reality">has said</a> he believes generative AI will enable users to type or speak entire worlds into existence by 2028, and earlier this year, the company <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/06/robloxs-road-to-4d-generative-ai">began to demo</a> these tools, too, inclusive of detailed object components and attributes (e.g., when a car is created, it is made up of many parts, rather than just being a “car,” and the car not only moves but has the properties of reflection, the ability to inflict and sustain damage, etc.). Roblox has also said they are working to integrate LLMs into their NPCs and to power real-time translation. By dropping the cost, time, and difficulty involved in creating Roblox experiences while also bolstering their levels of immersion and facilitating more/easier social play, Roblox should be able to increase the platform’s popularity, usage, and revenue.</p><p>At the same time, Roblox’s R&amp;D investments are <em>enormous</em>. R&amp;D now takes up 44% of revenues on average, equivalent to $1.5B on a run-rate basis. In comparison, Sony’s PlayStation <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/sony-boost-gaming-unit-with-217-bln-rd-war-chest-2024-nikkei-2023-07-12/" target="_blank">anticipates spending</a> $2.2B in 2024, with these investments spanning R&amp;D at its twenty-one largely independent studios, virtual reality devices, accessories (including the cloud-based PlayStation Portal), the PlayStation 6 (and, it is rumored, handheld), its network technologies, and so on. In 2024, Unity Technologies will spend “only” $1.1B on R&amp;D, and even the most fantastical (and doubtless egregious) forecasts for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI,</em> anticipated to drop in October 2025, suggest it will cost a billion to develop in total after close to a decade. It is difficult to imagine R&amp;D will continue to grow with sales—let alone in excess of sales, as has been the case over the last few years. For most large technology companies, R&amp;D stabilizes at 6%–12%. Yet even if R&amp;D dropped to 10% (about as much as Spotify and Uber spend), Roblox would still be unprofitable.</p>

  <p><strong>Profit Light but Cash Heavy?</strong></p><p>Though Roblox isn’t profitable, there are some significant caveats to the situation. Over the last twelve months, operating cash flow—a far more important measure than accounting-defined profits—were $650MM, about 20% of revenue. Roblox has been cash-positive for at least twenty-four quarters. Hard to say that’s not a business that’s “working!”</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_12138">
  <p>Part of the cause for this discrepancy is Roblox’s approach to revenue recognition. When a user buys $30 in Robux, the platform’s virtual currency, Roblox recognizes $30 in bookings. An average of $3 of that $30 is spent on a “consumable” (i.e., a single-user or otherwise perishable good), and so Roblox recognizes that $3 as revenue right away. The remaining $27 is spent on “durable” goods such as an avatar. As an avatar can and often will be used over time, Roblox recognizes this revenue over the average lifetime of a Roblox user. This lifetime is currently 27 months, and so the remaining $27 is allocated as $1 for each of the next $27 months, which means that Month One has a total of $4 recognized ($3+$1) and $26 deferred.</p><p>Roblox’s accounting practices are generally viewed as conservative. To point, Roblox notes that on average, a user uses all of their newly purchased Robux within only three days. Users do not, as Roblox’s revenue recognition policies seem to suggest, take more than two years to spend their Robux account balance on a miscellany of avatars, outfits, and other items. Roblox also does not allow refunds of Robux or virtual goods, and so the company does not hold a liability to the user (the spend is due to the App Store and developers). Most evidence suggests that the usage of virtual goods, like most cosmetics, is front-loaded. As such, a straightline allocation is probably a misfit versus, say, a double or triple declining balance. Furthermore, Roblox is effectively P&amp;L penalized when it increases the lifetime of a customer—which should be a good thing!—because it extends the revenue recognition period. If Roblox users go from an average of 27 months to 30, for example, then the Month One “loss” above increases from $4.50 to $4.60. Indeed, this has happened since the company went public. In Q1 2021, Roblox users averaged 23 months on the platform, and now they last 27.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_13529">
  <p>Roblox’s accounting methodology does mean that some costs (i.e., App Store fees and developer payments) are also deferred, which partly offsets the consequence of delayed revenue recognition. But all operating costs (i.e., Infrastructure, Trust &amp; Safety) and personnel costs (R&amp;D, S&amp;M, G&amp;A) are incurred right away, and so the net effect of Roblox’s revenue recognition policy is that it shrinks accounting profits as long as total user spend is growing (and the degree of this compression increases as the rate of user spending increases). On average, Roblox’s bookings per quarter (i.e., the money users are spending on Roblox that quarter) exceed the revenues recognized by Roblox by about 23%. This isn’t enough to overcome Roblox’s 138% in costs per dollar, but as a percentage of bookings, costs shrink down to 114%.</p><p>So how does Roblox generate so much cash? Over the last twelve months, Roblox’s total compensation to its employees was $1.8B. However, 53% of this compensation was in the form of stock, a non-cash expense. As such, Roblox is able to “shield” its operating cash flow by a sum equivalent to about 31% of revenues (between 2-4x that of most tech companies).</p>
</div><div data-block-type="2" data-border-radii="{&quot;topLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;topRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomLeft&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0},&quot;bottomRight&quot;:{&quot;unit&quot;:&quot;px&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:0.0}}" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1723922947689_14836">
  <p>It would be misleading to ignore the cost of stock-based compensation – especially since companies tend to shift total compensation toward cash and away from stock as they mature, which would decrease profits at the very time a company is supposed to be steadily earning them. If stock-based compensation is normalized to around 10%, then another 21% of revenue would be consumed by cash expenses. This would increase Roblox’s costs from 114% of bookings to 135%—just short of the 138% provided by Roblox’s GAAP methodology.</p><p><strong>How Does Roblox Get Profitable? </strong></p><p>A detailed picture of Roblox’s P&amp;L paints both a better picture (Roblox is generating lots of operating cash flow, R&amp;D should eventually fall by a quarter of revenue or more) and a worse one (30% of costs are paid in stock, at least half of revenue must be paid out). So how does Roblox become a “great” business? </p><p>First, one additional profit caveat is necessary. For users in the United States and Canada, Roblox’s Average Billings per Daily Active User (“ABPDAU,” a Roblox measure) is $37 per quarter, more than four times as high as European ABPDAU, over six times as high as the Asia-Pacific market, and nearly nine times that of all other markets (Rest of Word). This gap is so large that UCAN net ABPDAU (i.e. after 23% App Store fees and 26% developer revenue share) is still a multiple of gross ABPDAU elsewhere.</p><p>On a globally blended basis, ABPDAU is $13, and we know that Roblox loses roughly 35% on that spend, meaning costs are about $18. In UCAN, Roblox more than doubles that cost basis.</p>

<p>The more than 50% net income margins on UCAN users is important because not only is Roblox “working” for developers and consumers, it is working as a business . . . for at least 25% of players. Sure, that’s a bit cheap: “Roblox does make money, just not all the time and not enough for the times they don’t!” But Roblox is also unique as a social platform.</p>

  <p>Because of Roblox’s high cost to serve per hour, users in lower-income or lower-propensity-to-spend markets typically reduce profitability, rather than just harm overall margins. For Facebook, Twitter, Snap, etc., low monetizing users are still accretive because however little revenue they generate, the marginal costs incurred are near zero. This issue is exacerbated on the revenue side, too. Unlike other social platforms, Roblox’s revenue is nearly all via user spending rather than advertising. As such, Roblox pays 25% of its revenue to Apple and Google (30% of transactions on those platforms) whereas Facebook, Snap, et al pay effectively 0. Note that Facebook, which has structurally lower costs to service users than Roblox and is far more mature, has an operating margin of roughly 40% — if the company had to pay out 25-30% first, it would never have “tech company” profit margins, let alone profit dollars.</p><p>So to achieve overall profitability, Roblox needs to either increase its average bookings per DAU from $13 to at least $18 or achieve a level of revenue scale such that all fees other than developer payouts (currently $3.38 per $13) are effectively halved. In practice, both pushes will likely be needed; fortunately, there are a few mechanisms for each.</p><p>First is <strong>App Store</strong> <strong>fees</strong>. In various markets around the world, Apple’s iOS platform and Google’s Android are being forced to open up their app distribution and monetization models, at least in part. The specifics vary by market, by platform, and sometimes type of transaction. There’s not yet reliable data to suggest the degree to which Roblox might save on commissions (at a minimum, they will substitute a 30% fee with a 4% credit card processing expense, but additional iOS/Android fees might also apply), and the more complicated purchasing flow may require discounts and/or lead to fewer transactions, which would harm revenue. Accordingly, the net opportunity may be a reduction from 25% to 20% in the medium term, with a longer-term possibility of something closer to 10%.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>increase</strong> <strong>ABPDAU</strong> so that profitable users are more directly profitable and unprofitable users are less directly unprofitable. This would mean more revenue, which reduces the mostly-fixed costs of R&amp;D, G&amp;A, and S&amp;M. In the average month, fewer than 6% of users and 17% of average DAUs purchase Robux. There are many natural reasons to skip buying Robux in a given month—some MAUs are just trying Roblox for the first time, others don’t use the platform enough to routine spenders, a large portion of users are likely too young and thus purchasing depends on parental permissions, there are financial discounts for bulk purchasing (which naturally results in a delay to the next purchase), and so on. But there is clearly upside here. As a point of example, PlayStation, which has 120MM MAUs to Roblox’s 375MM and 50MM DAUs to Roblox’s 80MM, generated over $31 billion in revenue over the last twelve months compared to Roblox’s $3.8 billion in bookings.</p><p>These increases can come from further aging up Roblox’s userbase (older users can typically spend more—mainly because they’re no longer reliant on their parents for money), higher-end experiences (PlayStation is evidence of the premium users will pay for “premium” games), growing cultural cachet (which should enable higher prices for Roblox’s virtual goods), as well as more playtime per user (PlayStation has about twice the hours per user per month).</p><p><strong>Advertising</strong> solves a few goals for Roblox. First, it turns all users into revenue-generating users (no matter how miniscule) while also increasing the revenue for high-spending customers (which helps cover all other costs and/or subsidize the money-losing users). Second, it means that marginal consumption will continuously result in marginal revenues rather than just marginal cost (primarily via Infrastructure and Trust &amp; Safety expenses). Third, neither the Apple App Store nor Google’s Google Play collect a portion of ad revenues. Accordingly, all advertising would necessarily decrease app store fees as a percentage of revenue. For instance, if Roblox currently earns $10 per month from each paying user, they pay $2.40 to app stores, which is 24% of their revenue. However, if they generate an additional $3 from advertising on top of that $10, the $2.40 payment to stores would now represent just 18% of their total revenue. Moreover, as already stated, that additional revenue from non-paying users would go directly to Roblox (i.e. 0% would go to app stores). There are marginal IT&amp;S costs to support advertising on a per-hour basis, as well as R&amp;D to continuously improve Roblox’s ad platform, plus incremental G&amp;A for ad sales, ad ops, and ad service, etc. However, IT&amp;S should be relatively modest (and far cheaper than the other way to increase ABPDAU—more playtime), and the latter cost categories should be mostly fixed costs and thus offer greater operating leverage.</p><p>Advertisers have been investing in Roblox for years through the production of their own branded worlds. As with all of Roblox’s worlds, Roblox doesn’t charge for their creation (though certainly, some brands do pay agencies to construct them). Instead, Roblox is “compensated” through the engagement and purchases that world might inspire (to this end, Roblox might even be <em>paying</em> the advertiser through its developer royalty payments). At the same time, Roblox did have ways to generate <em>advertising</em> revenue from these world-builders, as well as from those whose <em>primary</em> business was the creation and operation of Roblox worlds. Specifically, Roblox would sell banner ads inside its launcher/application (think the Netflix homescreen), as well as sponsored search results. However, these ads were limited to the promotion of virtual worlds or items (e.g., Starbucks could promote Starbucks World or virtual Starbucks aprons, but not real-world Starbucks drinks or coupons, etc.). These restrictions, though “good” for users, had pretty severe constraints on advertising revenue as it meant that advertiser’s who lacked Roblox worlds or integrations couldn’t buy any ads (lots of Facebook ad spend is for local businesses, but your local hair stylist can’t build a Roblox world, nor can a local doctor’s office, etc., and even if they could, they probably shouldn’t). And those companies or organizations that <em>did</em> have a world or various items had the business cases from platform advertising effectively limited constrained to the efficacy of those worlds or various items (yes, in theory Starbucks advertising a sellable apron also aided Starbuck’s overall brand awareness, but that’s a pretty inefficient way to advertise online).</p><p>Since late 2022, Roblox has begun to prioritize new ad units and technologies to support its burgeoning ad business. In 2024, for example, Roblox launched in-world billboards that, unlike other ad units, could advertise whatever (e.g. an upcoming music, real world sneakers, etc.), and could be programmatically bid upon by advertisers and served across any worlds that chose to support billboard ads. This sort of advertising has existed “unofficially” for years (a developer would just build a billboard and either sell the ad slot directly or, more commonly, hook into an outside ad network to have the unit filled). In 2023, however, Roblox began to block developers from pinging a third-party server for ad units. Developers are still permitted to sell custom ads inside their world, but programmatic insertion, dynamic pricing, and/or targeting all require the use of Roblox’s ad network. </p>

<p>Another new unit are “Immersive Ads,” which are portals that enable a user to travel directly from one Roblox experience into another. In this case, Pepsi or Nike might (programmatically) purchase a “portal” inside hit sports-themed worlds (e.g. a Golden State Warriors world, a FIFA world, etc.) that make it easier to directly acquire these world’s users compared to just throwing up a digital billboard. This format, too, was originally “hacked” by independent Roblox developers whom would cut their own deals with other world developers, but Roblox has since built it natively into their platforms and requires developers to use their system. Developers can still try to bypass Roblox through custom deals, but only Roblox's platform provides advanced analytics, such as tracking how many users entered the portal, how long they stayed in the destination, and what activities they engaged in, and advertisers can only programmatically purchase immersive ads through Roblox.</p>

  <p>The last new ad unit lets advertisers sponsor items that users can claim for free. For example, Nike might do a deal through Roblox whereby any users who visit Developer World A on a given weekend would receive a free virtual pair of Air Jordan Sneakers. Again, this could be achieved through a direct deal between Nike and Developer A, but Roblox’s own platform offers programmatic placement, better analytics, a greater number of partnering worlds, related tools, etc. </p><p>It’s not clear how big Roblox’s advertising business might become. In November 2023, Baszucki <a href="https://stratechery.com/2023/an-interview-with-roblox-ceo-david-baszucki-about-advertising-and-ai/">told Ben Thomspon</a> “Yeah, I don’t think we’ve ever said advertising is going to be the meat of our business” – but he also argued “the size of the potential immersive advertising experience is uncharted right now. It’s immersive, there’s so much time spent there, the memories are really profound when I go with a friend to do that. So I do think it’s uncharted and very big.” Baszucki also mentioned “someday on Roblox, when we go to Nike World, we will not just be trying on virtual Nike shoes. We may be buying the physical versions as well from that place because it’s been such a connection for us with that brand.” Regardless of any physical tie-ins, it’s obvious that with over 350 million young, and otherwise hard-to-reach players, Roblox has the potential to generate meaningful revenue even if <em>most</em> of its business is based on user subscription.</p><p><strong>Master Builder(man)</strong></p><p>Smaller App Store payments, more ARPU, and a bigger ad platform are the <em>linear </em>opportunities for Roblox.</p>

Very few products ever get to Roblox’s size, let alone continue growing. And at this present size, altogether “new” opportunities start to emerge.</p>

  <p>In 2023, for example, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/08/roblox-connect-avatar-calling/" target="_blank">Roblox launched new features</a> that enabled “basic” communications capabilities between connected players that were <em>not</em> actively using a Roblox word, including messaging and voice calling, as well as avatar-to-avatar "video calling” that uses a phone or tablet’s front-facing camera to power real-time motion capture. This functionality puts Roblox in more direct competition with social networks and platforms such as Snap and WhatsApp, which boast 800MM and 2.8B users each, but underindex to younger Gen Zs and especially Gen Alphas. Moreover, such functionality is not just “bigger” than immersive socializing, it’s also cheaper to operate and easier to advertise through. Roblox Founder/CEO David Baszucki seems to believe instant messaging is just one of many 2D use cases that the company will soon be able to conquer. At the Roblox Developer Conference in 2023, he teased a forthcoming dating product for verified users over the age of 17, corporate recruiting integrations, and educational programs, among others.</p><p><strong><em>Matthew Ball (</em></strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew"><strong><em>@ballmatthew</em></strong></a><strong><em>)</em></strong></p>

<p dir="auto">This app extends the functionality of the FlipperZero's bluetooth capabilities, enabling it to act as an Apple AirTag, Samsung SmartTag, or a Tile Tracker. It utilizes the FlipperZero's BLE beacon to broadcast a SmartTag signal to be picked up by the FindMy Network. I made this to serve as a versatile tool for tracking purposes, offering the ability to clone existing tags, generate OpenHaystack key pairs for integration with Apple's FindMy network, and always know where your FlipperZero is.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Features</h2><a id="user-content-features" aria-label="Permalink: Features" href="#features"></a></p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Tag Emulation: Clone your existing Apple AirTag, Samsung SmartTag, or Tile Tracker to the FlipperZero, or generate a key pair for use with the FindMy network without owning an actual AirTag.</li>
<li>Customization: Users can adjust the interval between beacon broadcasts and modify the transmit power to suit their needs, optimizing for both visibility and battery life.</li>
<li>Efficient Background Operation: The app is optimized to run in the background, ensuring that your FlipperZero can still be tracked with minimal battery usage and without stopping normal use.</li>

  <summary><b>Option A: Cloning Existing Tag (Preferred and allows you to track without additional setup)</b></summary>
<p dir="auto">1A. Scan and import tag via ESP32 with BLE. Use the Airtag scanner ESP32 firmware and Flipper app.</p>
<ol dir="auto">
<li><strong>Pair a Tag:</strong> First, pair an AirTag, Samsung SmartTag or Tile Tracker with your device.</li>
<li><strong>Enter 'Lost' Mode:</strong> Keep the tag away from the device it's registered to for approximately 15 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>Download nrfConnect or use an ESP32</strong> Install nrfConnect from the Google Play Store. (Apple version doesn't reveal the needed Raw data, looking for a workaround)</li>
<li>OR <strong>Use an ESP32-WROOM / ESP32-S3</strong> Don't have an android? No problem! You can get all the data you need from an ESP32: <a href="https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/ESP32-AirTag-Scanner">https://github.com/MatthewKuKanich/ESP32-AirTag-Scanner</a> (Skip to step 7 if using an ESP32)</li>
<li><strong>Filter and Scan:</strong>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Open the app, click on filters, and exclude all except for the brand of your tag (Apple/Samsung).</li>
<li>Adjust the RSSI to the lowest setting (-40 dBm).</li>
<li>Initiate a scan. Wait for your SmartTag to appear as a "FindMy" device.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Capture Data:</strong> Click <strong>Raw</strong> or <strong>View Raw</strong> to capture your <strong>payload</strong> and note your tag's <strong>MAC Address</strong>. Immediately remove the tag's battery to prevent key/MAC rotation.
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The AirTag has now been cloned, if you put the battery back into the AirTag it will eventually rotate its keys with the Apple servers. This will invalidate the current keys on the Flipper. To prevent this you must keep the AirTag powered off / battery removed. You can always repeat these steps to return functionality to the Flipper. No need to get rid of the AirTag, you can always return to it if you desire, you just can't use both at the same time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Enter Data in FlipperZero App:</strong> Input the captured <strong>payload</strong> and <strong>MAC Address</strong> into the FlipperZero app.</li>

<p dir="auto">Move the '.Keys' file to your Flipper device by connecting it to your computer and using the Flipper's file management system.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>For ease of use, drag your <code>.keys</code> file onto your FlipperZero's SD card in the apps_data-&gt;findmy folder. You can import it directly from the app!
<ol dir="auto">
<li>Open the app and navigate to the config menu.</li>

<p dir="auto">Finally, run the <code>RequestReport&amp;Map.py</code> script to generate an interactive map of all location data in the past 24 hours. This script automates the process by requesting the location report using the hashed adv key in your <code>keys</code> folder, then decrypting that data from your private key located in the same <code>.keys</code> file. After the data is decrypted it will be displayed in the terminal. It then launches a mapping script that maps all the coordinates, connects them to show movement, displays a plethora of location metadata, and saves to an html file named by the date of the report.</p>
<p dir="auto">You're done!</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>
<p dir="auto">If you want to use OpenHaystack or Macless instead, then you can follow the steps below. I don't recommend these methods due to reliability issues and setup complexity.
To use OpenHayStack for tracking, you must use MacOS lower than version 14 (Mail Plug-in Incompetiablity of MacOS 14+ <a data-error-text="Failed to load title" data-id="5910354" data-permission-text="Title is private" data-url="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/224" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/224/hovercard" href="https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/discussions/224">seemoo-lab/openhaystack#224</a>). If you do own a device, I believe a convertor script can be provided without much of effort. If you do not own a Mac device or the system has been upgraded to 14 and beyond. The alternative solutions includes,</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">If using this solution, be sure to only use the <code>generate_keys.py</code> script from this repo in the AirTagGeneration folder. Not the ones included in that repo as the formatting of the key file changes. (Mine includes data that the FlipperZero needs for proper importing)</p>

<p dir="auto"><h3 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">On The Flipper: Configuration on the FlipperZero (if not completed yet)</h3><a id="user-content-on-the-flipper-configuration-on-the-flipperzero-if-not-completed-yet" aria-label="Permalink: On The Flipper: Configuration on the FlipperZero (if not completed yet)" href="#on-the-flipper-configuration-on-the-flipperzero-if-not-completed-yet"></a></p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Upon launching the app, open the config menu and either click <code>Import Tag From File</code> or <code>Register Tag Manually</code>. Put your generated .keys file onto the FlipperZero SD card inside the AppsData/FindMyFlipper folder to import from file. Or you can manually enter the tag information. When using the cloning method, you can export a .txt file from nrfConnect (click save button) amd place that in the same folder in order to import.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Customization</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Beacon Interval: Adjust how frequently your FlipperZero broadcasts its presence.</li>
<li>Transmit Power: Increase or decrease the signal strength to balance between tracking range and battery life.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Background Use</p>
<p dir="auto">The app is designed to have a negligible impact on battery life, even when running in the background. This allows for continuous tracking without the need for frequent recharging.</p>
<p dir="auto">Compatibility</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Apple devices for AirTag tracking via the FindMy network.</li>
<li>Any device that supports Samsung SmartTag tracking, including web browsers (previously FindMyMobile).</li>
<li>Tile Trackers via the Tile App</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Thanks</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Huge thanks to all the people that contributed to the OpenHaystack project, supporting projects, and guides on the subject. This wouldn't be a thing without any of you! Special thanks to Chapoly1305 for introducing me to the FindMy network and WillyJL for helping get the app input working and overall overhaul of the apps functions!</li>
