	<h2>Why You Should NEVER Buy a Diamond, and What You Should Buy Instead...</h2>

	<p>I recently got engaged, and found myself in the market for a suitable engagement ring. Over the past few months, I've done quite a bit of research on diamonds and the diamond industry. What I learned, quite frankly, pissed me off.</p>
	<p>This site is about two very simple truths: (1) diamonds are an incredible rip-off, and (2) a little known naturally-occuring gemstone called <em>moissanite</em> is superior to diamonds in every essential way: cut, color, clarity, durability, fire, brilliance, and cost.</p>
	<p>I (obviously) don't work in the diamond industry. I don't work for anyone who sells moissanite. The intent of this website is to raise awareness among big-ticket jewelry purchasers (primarily couples buying engagement rings) about moissanite and its many benefits vs. diamond.</p>
	<p>If I can prevent a single reader from needlessly dropping $6,000-10,000+ on a diamond engagement ring, this site will be a success.  Financial worries are the #1 cause of stress in a married relationship - there is absolutely NO excuse to start your married life by taking on that level of debt.</p>
	<p>If you're in the market for diamond jewelry, or think you may be soon, please take a few minutes to read through this site.  I hope you learn something useful.</p>

	<h3>What is Moissanite?</h3>
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moissanite" title="Moissanite" target="_blank">Moissanite</a> is a rare, naturally-occuring gemstone that is typically found in very small quantities in meteorites, corundum deposits, and kimberlite.  (The chemical name of moissanite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_carbide" target="_blank">Silicon Carbide</a>.)  Moissanite has several qualitites in common with diamond: it is transparent, extremely hard (9.25 on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale" target="_blank">Mohs scale</a>, compared to 10 for diamond), and has a high index of refraction (2.65 - 2.69, compared to 2.42 for diamond).  When a large rough moissanite sample is cut and polished, the end result is a very bright, brilliant, transparent gemstone that is indistinguishable from diamond to the human eye.</p>

	<p>Moissanite is also brighter, more lusterous, and has more fire than diamond. These criteria define how "pretty" the jewel is - the shine, the sparkle, and the prismatic qualities.  Check out this table on how moissanite compares to diamonds and other gemstones:</p>

	<p>The big difference between moissanite and diamond is that moissanite can be manufactured reliably and efficiently in a laboratory. The result: flawless, brilliant gemstones at about 1/10th the cost of a comparable diamond.</p>

	<h3>7 Reasons Why You Should NEVER Buy a Diamond:</h3>

	<p>1. The price of diamonds has been artificially inflated since the 1880's via the De Beers diamond cartel. For a detailed exposé of the De Beers cartel, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/198202/diamond" target="_blank">read this article by Edward Jay Epstein in the February 1982 issue of <em>The Atlantic Monthly</em></a>.</p>
	<p>2. Current public perception of diamonds is the direct result of a masterfully executed marketing campaign by De Beers that began in 1938, not inherent scarcity or value. If you've <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/print/198202/diamond" target="_blank">read the article by Edward Epstein (you really should)</a>, you know all of the gory details.  Isn't it amazing (and scary) how brainwashed people are about the "value" of diamonds, even though they're not actually worth that much?</p>
	<p>3. A diamond is an illiquid asset, not an "investment". Don't believe me? Try to sell a second-hand diamond ring on eBay or at a pawn shop.  Do you really think you'll get anything close to what you paid for it?  Do you really think the price of any diamond you purchase today is going to go up significantly over time? A diamond ring isn't even a good "insurance policy" to fall back on during hard times - it's an illiquid asset that you'll have a hard time selling for a price anywhere close to what you paid for it.</p>
	<p>4. The diamond industry funds warfare, genocide, and terrorism. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict_diamond" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, <em>"a conflict diamond (also called a blood diamond or a war diamond) is a diamond mined in a war zone and sold, usually clandestinely, in order to finance an insurgent or invading army's war efforts."</em>  Profits from conflict diamonds are used to finance warlords in Angola, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, who use their weapons to kill and maim innocent people.  Isn't that romantic?</p>
	<p>5. A diamond is - by nature - just a pretty rock. Think of the oft-quoted "rule" of diamond ring buying: the ring should cost a minimum of two month's salary (pre-tax), and you should spend as much on a ring as you can afford. Let's put this rule in its proper context: <em>according to the people who sell pretty rocks, you're supposed to trade a full two months of your time and effort for one of their pretty rocks.</em> Does that seem wise?</p>
	<p>6. People notice the setting more than the diamond itself. To the naked human eye, most decent quality diamonds look the same. Unless the stone is yellow, has major inclusions, or has a distinctly lopsided cut, no one will be able to distinguish an ideal cut, E color, VS-1 stone from a lesser-quality diamond just by looking at it.  <u>What people do notice is the setting</u> - how the stone is featured or placed, side stones, and the craftsmanship and artistry of the band. Knowing this - does it make more sense to focus your attention and dollars on a better stone, or on a better setting?</p>
	<p>7. The opportunity cost of buying a diamond is huge. Opportunity cost is what you give up by spending your scarce resources on a single option.  In other words, if you drop ten grand on a diamond ring, you have $10,000 less to spend on other things, like a fantastic honeymoon, a car, furniture, a down payment on a house, investing for the future, or further education.  Are all of these options worth giving up for a little piece of colorless carbon?</p>

	<h3>8 Reasons Why Moissanite is a Better Choice than Diamond for Fine Jewelry, Particularly Engagement Rings:</h3>
	<p>1. Engagement/wedding rings have sentimental value, not asset/investment value. Wedding rings do only two things: (1) look pretty and (2) provide a symbol / memento of the event. Accordingly, you're best served by purchasing a high quality ring that meets these two criteria at the lowest possible cost. The cost/quality/durability attributes of moissanite make it much more attractive than diamond for use in wedding rings.</p>
	<p>2. All moissanite gems are near flawless. Since moissanite can be reliably made in a laboratory, it's easy to do quality control.  Instead of selling anything that comes out of the ground, flawed moissanite can be identified and discarded. This means the moissanite you buy will be a much better quality stone than a more expensive diamond.</p>
	<p>3. Spending less on the stone means you can spend more on the setting. Since people notice the setting more than the stone itself, the lower cost of moissanite means you have <u>far</u> more options to make your ring unique while keeping within your budget.  Side stones, crafted bands, and bezel-set accents are all suddenly within your budget.</p>
	<p>4. You won't start your married life in crushing debt. It's often said that financial issues are the biggest cause of arguments and difficulties in a marriage, sometimes leading all the way to divorce.  Doesn't it make sense to ensure you and your wife-to-be are in the black as soon as humanly possible?  Saving for a down payment, creating an emergency fund, and putting aside money to invest are all substantially easier when you're not paying hundreds of dollars a month to the lending institution that financed the diamond purchase.</p>
	<p>5. Speaking of financing: you'll probably be able to pay cash for moissanite. If you plan ahead, you'll be able to purchase the ring with cash, avoiding interest charges that make a diamond ring even more expensive. (<a href="http://www.bluenile.com/services_channel.asp?track=59" target="_blank">9.99% - 27.99% APR, anyone?</a>)</p>
	<p>6. Other people will assume the ring is made of diamond, since they won't be able to tell the difference. I'm not one to pass something off as another, but the reality is that people are so brainwashed about diamonds that everyone who sees your fiancée's ring will assume it is made out of diamond.  (Most of the time, it's not worth explaining to them it's not.)  In the 6 months my fiancée has had her ring, 100% of the people who have seen it think it's diamond.  If you're worried about a "loss in prestige" if someone notices, rest assured that other people will never know unless you tell them.  (Note: <u>do not try to buy your fiancée a moissanite ring and pass it off as a diamond</u>. Honesty is key - talk to her about it first.)</p>
	<p>7. You can rest assured that your hard-earned money isn't subsidizing African warlords. Sleep easy - no innocent people were killed in the creation of your fine jewelry.</p>
	<p>8. You get more bling for your buck. Given a fixed budget, you have far more creative options with moissanite than you do with diamond. Want a 2 carat solitaire?  Go for it!  Custom design also becomes a very affordable option. Design a ring that fits your fiancée perfectly! Your bride-to-be will love the fact that you put your creativity into the purchase, and she'll love telling her friends what good taste you have.</p>

	<h3>Go See Moissanite for Yourself</h3>
	<p>I've put a lot of hours into making sure moissanite is all it's cracked up to be, and have put my own hard-earned dollars on the line in purchasing a moissanite engagement ring.  The research I did took days, but I consider it time well-spent: I bought a custom-designed, extremely well-made engagement ring my fiancée loves for thousands of dollars less than what I would have paid for a diamond. If you're in the market for jewelry, you owe it to yourself to go see moissanite in person before buying a diamond.</p>

	<p>Good luck, and may you and your loved one have a long, happy life together!</p>

<p>Compared with Python, Rust+Wasm apps could be 1/100 of the size, 100x the speed, and most importantly securely run everywhere at full hardware acceleration without any change to the binary code. <a href="https://blog.stackademic.com/why-did-elon-musk-say-that-rust-is-the-language-of-agi-eb36303ce341" target="_blank">Rust is the language of AGI</a>.</p>
<p>We created a very simple <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive" target="_blank">Rust program</a> to run inference on llama2 models at native speed. When compiled to Wasm, the <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/blob/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive.wasm" target="_blank">binary application</a> (only 2MB) is completely portable across devices with heterogeneous hardware accelerators. The Wasm runtime (<a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge" target="_blank">WasmEdge</a>) also provides a safe and secure execution environment for cloud environments. In fact, the <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/start/build-and-run/docker_wasm" target="_blank">WasmEdge runtime works seamlessly with container tools</a> to orchestrate and execute the portable application across many different devices.</p>

We adopted the original C++ program to run on Wasm. It works with the <a href="https://github.com/philpax/ggml/blob/gguf-spec/docs/gguf.md" target="_blank">GGUF formatted</a> model files.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1. Install WasmEdge with the GGML plugin</strong></p>
<p>Use the following command on Linux or Mac devices to install everything. <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/blob/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive/README.md#requirement" target="_blank">See here for more details.</a></p>
<pre><code>curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/master/utils/install.sh | bash -s -- --plugin wasi_nn-ggml
</code></pre><p><strong>Step 2. Download a pre-built Wasm app and the model</strong></p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/raw/main/chat/llama-chat.wasm
</code></pre><p>You should also download a llama2 model in GGUF format. The example below downloads the llama2 7B chat-tuned model quantized to 5-bit weights (<a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/convert-pytorch-to-gguf/" target="_blank">see more here</a>).</p>
<pre><code>curl -LO https://huggingface.co/wasmedge/llama2/resolve/main/llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf
</code></pre><p><strong>Step 3. Run it!</strong></p>
<p>Use WasmEdge to run the wasm inference application, and pass the GGUF model to it. You can now enter a question to chat with the model.</p>
<pre><code>wasmedge --dir .:. --nn-preload default:GGML:AUTO:llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf llama-chat.wasm

<pre><code>wasmedge --dir .:. --nn-preload default:GGML:AUTO:llama-2-7b-chat-q5_k_m.gguf llama-chat.wasm

[USER]:
Who is the "father of the atomic bomb"?
[ASSISTANT]:
The "father of the atomic bomb" is a term commonly associated with physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer was a leading figure in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, serving as the director of the Manhattan Project, which was responsible for the development and deployment of the first nuclear weapons. He is often referred to as the "father of the atomic bomb" due to his significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics and his leadership in the development of the bomb.
[USER]:
Was he a communist?
[ASSISTANT]:
J. Robert Oppenheimer was not a communist. While he was associated with the Manhattan Project, which was a secret government project, and was involved in the development of the atomic bomb, he was not a member of the Communist Party or had any known political affiliations with communism. Oppenheimer was a physicist and a scientist, and his primary focus was on the development of nuclear weapons during World War II.
</code></pre><p><strong>Configure the model behavior</strong></p>
<p>There are command line options you can use to configure how to interact with the model.</p>
<pre><code>Options:
 -m, --model-alias &lt;ALIAS&gt;
         Model alias [default: default]
 -c, --ctx-size &lt;CTX_SIZE&gt;
         Size of the prompt context [default: 4096]
 -n, --n-predict &lt;N_PRDICT&gt;
         Number of tokens to predict [default: 1024]
 -g, --n-gpu-layers &lt;N_GPU_LAYERS&gt;
         Number of layers to run on the GPU [default: 100]
 -b, --batch-size &lt;BATCH_SIZE&gt;
         Batch size for prompt processing [default: 4096]
 -r, --reverse-prompt &lt;REVERSE_PROMPT&gt;
         Halt generation at PROMPT, return control.
 -s, --system-prompt &lt;SYSTEM_PROMPT&gt;
         System prompt message string [default: "[Default system message for the prompt template]"]
 -p, --prompt-template &lt;TEMPLATE&gt;
         Prompt template. [default: llama-2-chat] [possible values: llama-2-chat, codellama-instruct, mistral-instruct-v0.1, mistrallite, openchat, belle-llama-2-chat, vicuna-chat, chatml]
     --log-prompts
         Print prompt strings to stdout
     --log-stat
         Print statistics to stdout
     --log-all
         Print all log information to stdout
     --stream-stdout
         Print the output to stdout in the streaming way
 -h, --help
         Print help
</code></pre><p>For example, the following command specifies a context length of 2048 tokens and the max number of tokens in each response to 512. It also tells WasmEdge to print out statistics and to stream the model response back to <code>stdout</code> one token at a time. The program generates about 25 tokens per second on a low-end M2 macbook.</p>

</code></pre><p><strong>LLM agents and apps</strong></p>
<p>We have also created an OpenAI-compatible API server using Rust and WasmEdge. It allows you use any OpenAI-compatible developer tools, such as <a href="https://flows.network/" target="_blank">flows.network</a>, to create LLM agents and apps. <a href="https://www.secondstate.io/articles/wasm-runtime-agi/#build-a-super-lightweight-ai-agent" target="_blank">Learn more here.</a></p>

Llama on the edge. Image generated by Midjourney.</p>
<h2 id="why-not-python"><strong>Why not Python?</strong></h2>
<p>LLMs like llama2 are typically trained in Python (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow, and JAX). But to use Python for inference applications, which is about 95% of the computing in AI, would be a bad mistake.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://x.com/santiviquez/status/1676677829751177219" target="_blank">Python packages have complex dependencies</a>. They are difficult to set up and use.</li>
<li>Python dependencies are huge. A Docker image for Python or PyTorch is typically <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch/tags" target="_blank">several GBs</a> or even <a href="https://github.com/pytorch/serve/issues/1420" target="_blank">tens of GBs</a>. That is especially problematic for AI inference on edge servers or on devices.</li>
<li>Python is a very slow language. <a href="https://www.modular.com/blog/how-mojo-gets-a-35-000x-speedup-over-python-part-1" target="_blank">Up to 35,000x slower</a> than compiled languages such as C, C++, and Rust.</li>
<li>Because Python is slow, most of the actual workloads must be <a href="https://x.com/gdb/status/1676726449934331904" target="_blank">delegated to native shared libraries</a> beneath the Python wrapper. That makes Python inference apps <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/ph/podcast/expanding-ai-chip-capabilities-beyond-nvidia-with/id315114957?i=1000627798935" target="_blank">great for demos, but very hard to modify</a> under the hood for business-specific needs.</li>
<li>The heavy dependency on native libraries, combined with complex dependency management, makes it very hard to port Python AI programs across devices while taking advantage of the device’s unique hardware features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commonly used Python packages in LLM toolchain are directly conflicting with each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Lattner" target="_blank">Chris Lattner</a>, of the LLVM, Tensorflow, and Swift language fame, gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap0VLOPyGqM" target="_blank">a great interview</a> on the This Week in Startup podcast. He discussed why Python is great for model training but the wrong choice for inference applications.</p>
<h2 id="the-advantages-of-rustwasm"><strong>The advantages of Rust+Wasm</strong></h2>
<p>The Rust+Wasm stack provides a unified cloud computing infra that spans devices to edge cloud, on-prem servers, and the public cloud. It is a strong alternative to the Python stack for AI inference applications. No wonder Elon Musk said that Rust is the language of AGI.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ultra lightweight.</strong> The inference application is just 2MB with all dependencies. It is less than 1% of the size of a typical PyTorch container.</li>
<li><strong>Very fast.</strong> Native C/Rust speed in all parts of the inference application: pre-processing, tensor computation, and post-processing.</li>
<li><strong>Portable.</strong> The same Wasm bytecode application can run on all major computing platforms with support for heterogeneous hardware acceleration.</li>
<li><strong>Easy to set up, develop and deploy.</strong> There are no more complex dependencies. Build a single Wasm file using standard tools on your laptop and deploy it everywhere!</li>
<li><strong>Safe and cloud-ready.</strong> The Wasm runtime is designed to isolate untrusted user code. The Wasm runtime can be managed by container tools and easily deployed on cloud-native platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-rust-inference-program"><strong>The Rust inference program</strong></h2>
<p>Our demo inference program is written in Rust and compiled into Wasm. The core <a href="https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils/blob/main/simple/src/main.rs" target="_blank">Rust source code</a> is very simple. It is only 40 lines of code. The Rust program manages the user input, tracks the conversation history, transforms the text into the llama2’s chat template, and runs the inference operations using the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-nn" target="_blank">WASI NN API</a>.</p>
<pre><code>fn main() {
   let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
   let model_name: &amp;str = &amp;args[1];

   let graph =
       wasi_nn::GraphBuilder::new(wasi_nn::GraphEncoding::Ggml, wasi_nn::ExecutionTarget::AUTO)
           .build_from_cache(model_name)
           .unwrap();
   let mut context = graph.init_execution_context().unwrap();

   let system_prompt = String::from("&lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as short as possible, while being safe. &lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;");
   let mut saved_prompt = String::new();

   loop {
       println!("Question:");
       let input = read_input();
       if saved_prompt == "" {
           saved_prompt = format!("[INST] {} {} [/INST]", system_prompt, input.trim());
       } else {
           saved_prompt = format!("{} [INST] {} [/INST]", saved_prompt, input.trim());
       }

       // Set prompt to the input tensor.
       let tensor_data = saved_prompt.as_bytes().to_vec();
       context
           .set_input(0, wasi_nn::TensorType::U8, &amp;[1], &amp;tensor_data)
           .unwrap();

       // Execute the inference.
       context.compute().unwrap();

       // Retrieve the output.
       let mut output_buffer = vec![0u8; 1000];
       let output_size = context.get_output(0, &amp;mut output_buffer).unwrap();
       let output = String::from_utf8_lossy(&amp;output_buffer[..output_size]).to_string();
       println!("Answer:\n{}", output.trim());

       saved_prompt = format!("{} {} ", saved_prompt, output.trim());
   }
}
</code></pre><p>To build the application yourself, just install the Rust compiler and its <code>wasm32-wasi</code> compiler target.</p>
<pre><code>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
</code></pre><p>Then, check out the source project, and run the <code>cargo</code> command to build the Wasm file from the Rust source project.</p>
<pre><code># Clone the source project
git clone https://github.com/second-state/llama-utils
cd llama-utils/chat/

# Build
cargo build --target wasm32-wasi --release

# The result wasm file
cp target/wasm32-wasi/release/llama-chat.wasm .
</code></pre><h2 id="running-in-the-cloud-or-on-the-edge"><strong>Running in the cloud or on the edge</strong></h2>
<p>Once you have the Wasm bytecode file, you can deploy it on any device that supports the WasmEdge runtime. You just need to <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/wasmedge-ggml-llama-interactive#requirement" target="_blank">install the WasmEdge with the GGML plugin</a>. We currently have GGML plugins for generic Linux and Ubuntu Linux — both on x86 and ARM CPUs and Nvidia GPUs, as well as Apple M1/M2/M3.</p>
<p>Based on <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp</a>, the WasmEdge GGML plugin will automatically take advantage of any hardware acceleration on the device to run your llama2 models. For example, if your device has Nvidia GPU, the installer will automatically install a CUDA-optimized version of the GGML plugin. For Mac devices, the Mac OS build of the GGML plugin uses the Metal API to run the inference workload on M1/M2/M3’s built-in neural processing engines. The Linux CPU build of the GGML plugin uses the OpenBLAS library to auto-detect and utilize the advanced computational features, such as AVX and SIMD, on modern CPUs.</p>
<p>That’s how we achieve portability across heterogeneous AI hardware and platforms without sacrificing performance.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next"><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>
<p>While the WasmEdge GGML tooling is usable (and indeed used by our cloud-native customers) today, it is still in its early stages. If you are interested in contributing to the open source projects and shaping the direction of future LLM inference infrastructure, here are some low-hanging fruits that you can <a href="https://wasmedge.org/docs/contribute/overview" target="_blank">potentially contribute to</a>!</p>
<ul>
<li>Add GGML plugins for more hardware and OS platforms. We are also interested in TPUs, ARM NPUs, and other specialized AI chips on Linux and Windows.</li>
<li>Support more <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp" target="_blank">llama.cpp</a> configurations. We currently support passing some config options from Wasm to the GGML plugin. But we would like to support all the options GGML provides!</li>
<li>Support WASI NN APIs in other Wasm-compatible languages. We are specifically interested in Go, Zig, Kotlin, JavaScript, C and C++.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-ai-models"><strong>Other AI models</strong></h2>
<p>As a lightweight, fast, portable, and secure Python alternative, WasmEdge and WASI NN are capable of building inference applications around popular AI models beyond LLMs. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/mediapipe-rs" target="_blank">mediapipe-rs</a> project provides Rust+Wasm APIs for Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/mediapipe" target="_blank">mediapipe</a> suite of Tensorflow models.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2768" target="_blank">WasmEdge YOLO</a> project provides Rust+Wasm APIs to work with <a href="https://ultralytics.com/yolov8" target="_blank">YOLOv8</a> PyTorch models.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/second-state/WasmEdge-WASINN-examples/tree/master/openvino-road-segmentation-adas" target="_blank">WasmEdge ADAS demo</a> shows how to perform road segmentation in self-driving cars using an Intel OpenVINO model.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/WasmEdge/WasmEdge/issues/2356" target="_blank">WasmEdge Document AI</a> project will provide Rust+Wasm APIs for a suite of popular OCR and document processing models.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/data-from-connected-cloudpets-teddy-bears-leaked-and-ransomed-exposing-kids-voice-messages/">When someone passed me hundreds of thousands of records on kids taken from CloudPets a few years ago</a>, I had a nightmare of a time getting in touch with the company. They'd left a MongoDB instance exposed to the public without a password and someone had snagged all their data. Within the data were references that granted access to voice recordings made by children, stored in an S3 bucket that also had no auth. So, why didn't CloudPets respond to attempts to contact them? Their CEO later explained it very succinctly:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">"We did have a reporter, try to contact us multiple times last week, you don't respond to some random person about a data breach.</p>— Michael Kan (@Michael_Kan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Michael_Kan/status/836593923304767488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">February 28, 2017</a></blockquote> <p>Problem is, random people are <em>precisely</em> the sorts of people that find data breaches.

I'd done this so many times by then that I was <em>very </em>conscious of how scammy these messages can look. Alas, all reasonable measures were exhausted without response, I loaded the data into <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">Have I Been Pwned</a> (HIBP) and <em>then </em>they took notice:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1306" height="716" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/Adult-FanFiction.png 1306w"></figure><p>In order of sentences: Yes there is, that's bullshit, that's true, that's also bullshit, no they won't, they never did.

And that's a real possibility; I've created dozens of courses on infosec (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/hack-yourself-first?ref=troyhunt.com">including one that includes a module on clickjacking!</a>), I've written hundreds of blog posts on the topic, I've travelled the world running <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/workshops/">my Hack Yourself First workshop</a> (over 100 times now), I've somehow <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/heres-what-im-telling-us-congress-about-data-breaches/">even ended up in US Congress talking about cybersecurity</a>! But I can make mistakes. Coding mistakes. Configuration mistakes. Or someone else makes one in a library or platform I'm dependent on and wammo! It is I who is pwned. But not this time:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-1.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1010" height="341" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-1.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w1000/2021/11/image-1.png 1000w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-1.png 1010w"></figure><p><a href="https://awesomeplaces.troyhunt.com/login?ref=troyhunt.com">That link Mayank shared</a> leads to a page that literally has this at the bottom of it (conveniently cropped off the earlier image he attached):</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-2.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="606" height="189" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-2.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-2.png 606w"></figure><p>This is why my email above says "beg bounty" and it's exactly what it sounds like - someone begging for a bounty. <a href="https://news.sophos.com/en-us/2021/02/08/have-a-domain-name-beg-bounty-hunters-may-be-on-their-way/?ref=troyhunt.com">Sophos wrote up a bunch of good examples earlier this year</a> and they typically amount to easily discoverable configurations that are publicly observable and minor in nature. DMARC records. A missing CSP. Anything that as Sophos puts it, is "scaremongering for profit". And just to be crystal clear, these are "reports" submitted to website operators <em>who do not have a published bug bounty</em>. I love bug bounties (<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/play-by-play-bug-bounties-researchers?ref=troyhunt.com">2 of my Pluralsight courses are on them with friend and Bugcrowd founder Casey Ellis</a>), but we're not talking about organisations with the resources to invest in formal programs that pay money (which, incidentally, <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/tech-blog/pluralsights-security-bounty-program/?ref=troyhunt.com">Pluralsight also runs</a>). No, we're talking about resources like my blog and free community projects like HIBP. Hence the "beg" component of the bounty.</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Feel free to use this as often as you’d like. <a href="https://t.co/1kVSqjLeut?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1kVSqjLeut</a></p>— Steve Edwards (@sedward5) <a href="https://twitter.com/sedward5/status/1319653212681609217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">October 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <p>Want to be a bounty beggar? It's dead simple, you just use tools like <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=haveibeenpwned.com&amp;s=2606%3A4700%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A0%3A6812%3Aad0d&amp;latest=&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">Qualys' SSL Labs</a>, <a href="https://dmarcian.com/dmarc-inspector/?domain=haveibeenpwned.com&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">dmarcian</a> or <a href="https://securityheaders.com/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhaveibeenpwned.com%2F&amp;followRedirects=on&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">Scott Helme's Security Headers</a>, among others. Easy point and shoot magic and you don't need to have any idea whatsoever what you're doing! But hold on, why does that HIBP report on Scott's site only score a "B"? Where's the CSP? And the referrer-policy? They're on HIBP (go and check for yourself in your browser), but they're not there on the interstitial page Cloudflare is serving up to Scott's crawler as part of the anti-automation defences I've put in place. But hey, that takes knowledge and understanding to establish which is why I've received beg bounty requests for precisely this in the past.</p><p>I was finally prompted to write this after yet another run-in with someone seeking a beg bounty. Here's the thread:</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I fucking hate beg bounties 😡 <a href="https://t.co/Giv4JRRaty?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/Giv4JRRaty</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944042353172487?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote>

</figure><p>It was <em>immediately</em> clear that Hammad was going to beg for a bounty, but it was a quiet Saturday night here and I thought it would be entertaining to see just how far down the rabbit hole he wanted to go. So, I responded, positively:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1OEkJDHHcH?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1OEkJDHHcH</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944048527183878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I took my usual signature off the email (the one you can see in an earlier screen grab), just to ensure Hammad held onto the glimmer of hope that he may successfully extract some hard-earned money from me. Of course, he took the bait:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/epM9YTSz1L?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/epM9YTSz1L</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944054269214720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>It's like dealing with scam phone calls: if you want to see where they lead, you need to play the game and not come on too strong too early. Hammad continued a few minutes later:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uoaGstoASH?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/uoaGstoASH</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944060296413189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>And there we have it. The beg. It was always going to come, he just neglected to mention it in the first message. Maybe he forgot? Or maybe he's done this enough times now (which subsequent replies to this thread with his previous attempts suggest) that he's learned enough social engineering to know not to go too hard on the first approach. This dismayed me:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/yfVR8UkXBv?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/yfVR8UkXBv</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944066143272965?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>On a (slightly) more serious note for a moment, this is what specifically pisses me off: I don't know how many disclosures I've done of both serious security vulnerabilities and complete breaches of data (100+, surely), but I have never, ever - <em>not even once</em> - asked for money. But Hammad isn't me:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/hhBpyBQG6y?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/hhBpyBQG6y</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944072791248900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>Now, as many people subsequently pointed out in the thread, the irony is that Hammad <em>did </em>actually already do the "work" for free and whether I paid him or not, the effort had already been invested. Ok, patience exhausted, time to put the signature back in and take Hammad to school:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/We6F17ZOZY?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/We6F17ZOZY</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456944080936599557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I did genuinely have this blog post in draft and had been adding bits to it as the Hammads of the world popped their begs into my inbox. If he stopped responding here, then that would have been the end of it; I might have just added a couple more notes and come back to this post in the distant future. However, after this next reply I knew where my Sunday afternoon was going:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/1KtYck2WEF?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/1KtYck2WEF</a></p>— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1456947217839714311?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>I bet it was clickjacking! Maybe on <a href="https://hack-yourself-first.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">hack-yourself-first.com</a> 🤣</p><p>Clearly, I didn't forget and I also didn't forgive and he probably should have expected me (sorry, couldn't help myself!) If I'm honest, I was surprised at how much traction this thread got and I woke up on Sunday morning to hundreds of mentions and thousands of likes across the tweet thread. It struck a chord. <em>Many </em>of you fucking hate beg bounties and shared my lack of sympathy for Muhammad Kamran (the full name will help SEO the next time someone he targets starts searching for him 🙂). However, there was a very small single-digit number of people that disagreed, and I want to address those arguments here:</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm not happy with this approach either. If he is a scammer with no vuln found then go ahead and waste his time. I wouldn't call people trying to make money as a begger. He sounds kind and sincere to me. I don't public humiliate a person asking to wash my windows for a dollar</p>— JohnΞ (@j3g) <a href="https://twitter.com/j3g/status/1457094782736470017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>First sentence - good! Onto the "scammer" comment and it raises an interesting question: is this a scam? I agree with this use of the term in that this behaviour amounts to "a dishonest scheme" and, depending on the definition you read, the intent is to "deceive and defraud". Attempting to scare people with an alleged vulnerability then withholding information about it until a financial commitment is made all whilst claiming to be a "white hat" is dishonest, deceptive, and fraudulent. As for the rest, firstly, "beg bounty" is becoming a pretty broadly adopted term as you saw from the Sophos article. A quick nod also to Michael Argast and Chester Wisniewski (who, incidentally, wrote the earlier mentioned Sophos article) for their role in coining the phrase:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love the fact a term I coined with <a href="https://twitter.com/chetwisniewski?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@chetwisniewski</a> after running into a bunch of these a couple of years ago is getting tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@troyhunt</a>, one of my infosec heros. 😆 <a href="https://t.co/heOQjWgySz?ref=troyhunt.com">https://t.co/heOQjWgySz</a></p>— Michael Argast 💉💉🤗 (@michaelargast) <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelargast/status/1456994041279639554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>As for Hammad having a "kind and sincere" demeanour, <a href="https://learningenglish.voanews.com/a/get-what-you-want-with-honey-/5755865.html?ref=troyhunt.com">you get more flies with honey than vinegar</a>. <em>Of course he's going to be nice!</em> Have you ever had someone try to scam you who started out being obnoxious? No, you'd hang up on them right away. Gaining someone's trust by coming across as approachable and building rapport is scamming 101. It's also no excuse whatsoever for this behaviour. As for the "wash my windows for a dollar" remark, firstly, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/irl-analogies-to-explain-digital-concepts-are-terrible/">IRL analogies explaining digital concepts are terrible</a>. Secondly, if we really want to go down that path then the correct analogy is a random stranger telling you there's something important wrong with your car, but they won't tell you what it is unless you give them money. A lot less nice, that example, isn't it?</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">sorry Troy, but I don't think that your answers were appropriate. While these people obviously want some free money, you don't need to lower yourself to that level, you could have handled it better. Remember that this could have been an example which people would follow</p>— opsxcq (@opsxcq) <a href="https://twitter.com/opsxcq/status/1456952074206425088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>The responses to that tweet speak for themselves (Hammad, is that you?) but the last sentence hit a nerve. <em>This is exactly the example I would like people to follow!</em> I'd like them to waste the time of the beg bounty hunter, give them a stern talking to and <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-effectiveness-of-publicly-shaming-bad-security/">shame them publicly</a>. Look, if you really want to inject some warm fuzzies into your own messaging then suggest the likes of Hammad go and get involved as a genuine security researcher at <a href="https://www.bugcrowd.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">Bugcrowd</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerone.com/?ref=troyhunt.com">HackerOne</a>. There has never been a better time for <em>actual </em>security researchers to get involved in this industry and there is no shortage of opportunities that don't involve shaking down unsuspecting victims for cash. And people <em>have </em>been actively sharing their own experiences with the same guy:</p><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One must simply love these "White Hat Hackers"... <a href="https://t.co/xfxgVuuX4t?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/xfxgVuuX4t</a></p>— Ondřej Surý (@oerdnj) <a href="https://twitter.com/oerdnj/status/1455820710492975106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That name is familiar… I found this back in 2019 <a href="https://t.co/7rxcZl0Tms?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/7rxcZl0Tms</a></p>— Parrilla (@nubeblog) <a href="https://twitter.com/nubeblog/status/1457084154219221004?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">muhammad hammad loves <a href="https://twitter.com/elhackernet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">@elhackernet</a> too 😂 <a href="https://t.co/JJ9q9uqUTu?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/JJ9q9uqUTu</a></p>— elhacker.NET (@elhackernet) <a href="https://twitter.com/elhackernet/status/1457459693262184450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yea he has been floating around begging for a while. <a href="https://t.co/yRAuUQMvQ6?ref=troyhunt.com">pic.twitter.com/yRAuUQMvQ6</a></p>— (╯°□°）╯︵ zɔɹʎp ʎpuɐ (@adyrcz) <a href="https://twitter.com/adyrcz/status/1457035316552998912?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">November 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <p>This illustrates why on balance, I'm comfortable using the name Muhammad Kamran or Muhammad Hammad in this post as others have done in their tweets; I'd like for the next person he tries to scare into coughing up cash to search for his name, find this post and understand the principle of the beg bounty and why it can be safely ignored. Equally, I'd be perfectly happy if someone used my name to highlight my approach to disclosure, because this is what it looks like:</p><figure><img src="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="854" height="510" srcset="https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/11/image-3.png 600w, https://www.troyhunt.com/content/images/2021/11/image-3.png 854w"></figure><p>I picked this example because it's very recent and if you read <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1448593628096458756?ref=troyhunt.com">my tweet thread about the Thingiverse breach</a>, a very frustrating experience. <em>But it's the right way to go about it!</em> Open. Honest. Transparent. But above all, bereft of ulterior motives. I only wanted one thing out of the Thingiverse disclosure and that was simply for them to be aware of the breach and to inform their customers accordingly.</p><p>Getting back to my original point, is it any wonder companies are standoff-ish when someone like myself attempts to report a genuine <em>serious </em>security issue? Just look at <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=troyhunt+%22anyone+got+a+security+contact%22&amp;src=typed_query&amp;f=live&amp;ref=troyhunt.com">a Twitter search for me asking for security contacts at a company</a>. It shouldn't be this way and shady approaches by bounty beggars makes it all the harder. I'm sitting on literally <em>billions</em> of records from undisclosed data breaches because the burden of disclosure is so high. </p><p>Finally, I'm a <em>massive </em>supporter of <a href="https://securitytxt.org/?ref=troyhunt.com">the security.txt standard</a> and have been for many years now, and I just hate hearing stories from people about how it's being abused for beg bounties. This is literally one of the barriers to entry: as soon as security contacts are published, organisations have to deal with garbage reports that create noise and cause genuine, <em>legitimate </em>reports to sink amongst all the crap they're dealing with.</p><p>This is why I have no patience for beg bounties and no hesitation exposing those who partake in them to the detriment of absolutely everyone other than themselves. If you receive this garbage, respond with a stern word and a link to this post... and perhaps a tweet thread of your own 🙂</p><blockquote data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From now on, I won't ignore this kind of emails.

<p dir="auto">This project was part of my undergraduate thesis for electrical engineering.

<p dir="auto">The main body of the stylus was 3D printed as two halves, shown below. The stylus contains a force sensor, a Li-ion battery which charges over USB-C, and an Arduino-based development board for logic and Bluetooth.

<li><strong>Perspective-n-Point (PnP):</strong> From these corner positions, we use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective-n-Point" rel="nofollow">PnP</a> algorithm to estimate the pose of the stylus relative to the camera. When possible, we use the pose from the previous frame as a starting point to refine with virtual visual servoing (VVS), otherwise we fall back to SQPnP.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinate conversion:</strong> Using the calibrated pose of the stylus and the drawing surface relative to the camera, we calculate the position and orientation of the stylus tip relative to the drawing surface.</li>
</ol>
<h3 tabindex="-1" id="user-content-inertial-fusion" dir="auto"><a href="#inertial-fusion">Inertial fusion</a></h3>
<p dir="auto">We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse the VPE estimates with the inertial data from the accelerometer and gyroscope, and refine the estimates in real-time using the Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) algorithm. To account for time delay from the camera frames, we use a negative-time measurement update algorithm. The EKF is implemented using NumPy and <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/" rel="nofollow">Numba</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using inertial measurements allows us to dramatically reduce latency compared to a camera-only implementation, while also improving accuracy and report rate for fast movements.</p>

  <p>So I was on math stackexchange the other day, and I saw <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4767549/the-book-youll-need-when-someone-came-up-with-a-random-car-plate-number/4790221#4790221">a cute post</a> 
looking for a book which lists, for many many integers, facts that Ramanujan 
could have told Hardy if he’d taken a cab other than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)">1729</a>. A few days ago 
OP answered their own question, saying that the book in question was 
<a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/mbk-64"><em>Those Fascinating Numbers</em></a> by Jean-Marie De Koninck. I decided to take 
a glance through it to see what kinds of facts lie inside 
(and also to see <em>just</em> how many integers are covered!). Not only was I 
overwhelmed by the number of integers and the number of facts about them, 
the <em>preface</em> already includes one of the single wildest facts I’ve ever heard, 
and I have to talk about it here! Here’s a direct quote from the preface:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>37, the median value for the second prime factor of an integer; 
thus the probability that the second prime factor of an integer 
chosen at random is smaller than 37 is approximately $\frac{1}{2}$;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My jaw was on the floor when I read this, haha. First it sounded totally 
unbelievable, since 37 is a tiny number in the grand scheme of things. Then 
it started to sound slightly more plausible… After all, about half of all 
integers have $2$ as their smallest prime factor. It makes sense that smaller 
primes should be more frequent among the smallest factors of numbers! But then 
I thought “how can you possibly <em>prove</em> this!?”. I’m not much of an analytic 
number theorist<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, but I know that they have good estimates on a lot of 
facts like this. I decided it would be fun to try and find and understand a 
proof of this fact, and also write some <a href="https://sagemath.org/">sage</a> code to test it!</p>

<p>So then let’s go ahead and do it ^_^</p>

<hr>

<p>First, I think, the sage code. I want to know if this really works!</p>

<p>“Obvoiusly” there’s no uniform distribution on the natural numbers, so 
what does it even mean to choose a “random” one? The way the number theorists 
usually solve this problem is by fixing a large number $N$ and looking at 
the probabilities when you pick a random number between $1$ and $N$. Then you 
look at the $N \to \infty$ limit of these probabilities.</p>

<p>So for us, we’ll want to first fix a large number $N$ and then work with 
numbers $\leq N$. For $N$ kind of small, we can just find the second prime 
factor of each number $\leq N$ and <em>check</em> the median!</p>



<p>When I first ran this code, it honestly felt like magic, haha. What the 
<em>hell</em> is going on here!?</p>

<hr>

<p>The key idea, found in a paper of De Koninck and Tenenbaum<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, 
is that we can compute the density of numbers whose second prime is $p$ 
(which the authors denote $\lambda_2(p)$) by cleverly using the ideas in the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>!</p>

<p>Let’s do a simple example to start. What fraction of numbers have $5$ as 
their second prime? In the language of the paper, what is $\lambda_2(5)$?</p>

<p>Well it’s not hard to see that the numbers whose second prime is $5$ are 
those numbers whose prime factorization looks like</p><p>

\[2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots\]

</p><p>or</p><p>

\[2^0 3^a 5^b \cdots\]

</p><p>so we need to count the density of numbers of these forms.</p>

<p>But a number is of the first form ($2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots$) if and only if 
it has a factor of $2$, a factor of $5$, and <em>no</em> factors of $3$.</p>

<p>To bring this back to elementary school<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>, we can highlight all of 
our numbers with a factor of $2$</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-evens.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>numbers with no factors of $3$</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-no-threes.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>and numbers with a factor of $5$</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-fives.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>Then the numbers whose prime factorization starts $2^a 3^0 5^b \cdots$ are 
exactly the numbers highlighted by all three of these colors!</p>

<p>
<img src="https://grossack.site/assets/images/37-median/number-grid-intersection.png" width="50%">
</p>

<p>It’s intuitively clear that $\frac{1}{2}$ the numbers are blue, 
$\frac{2}{3}$ are orange, and $\frac{1}{5}$ are pink.
So taken together, 
$\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{15}$ of numbers 
are of this form!</p>

<p>So now we have our hands on the density of numbers of the form $2^a 3^0 5^b$,
but this is only one of two ways that $5$ can be the second smallest prime. 
A similar computation shows that 
$\left ( 1 - \frac{1}{2} \right ) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{30}$ 
of numbers are of the form $2^0 3^a 5^b$.</p>

<p>It’s easy to see that these sets are disjoint, so their densities add, and 
$\frac{1}{15} + \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{10}$ numbers have $5$ as their 
second smallest factor!</p>



<p>Now with the warm-up out of the way, let’s see how we can compute 
$\lambda_2(p)$ for our favorite prime $p$!</p>

<p>We’ll play exactly the same game. How can $p$ be the second smallest prime?
Exactly if the prime factorization looks like</p><p>

\[p^b q^a \prod_{q \neq r \lt p} r^0\]

</p><p>for some $q \lt p$.</p>

<p>But we can count these densities as before! For each choice of $q$, we know 
that $\frac{1}{p}$ numbers are multiples of $p$, $\frac{1}{q}$ are 
multiples of $q$, and for each $r$ we know $\left (1 - \frac{1}{r} \right )$
numbers are <em>not</em> multiples of $r$! For each $q$, then, we want to land 
in the intersection of all of these sets, then we want to sum over our 
choices of $q$. Taken together, we see that</p>

<div>
  <p>The density of numbers whose second prime is $p$ is</p><p>

\[\lambda_2(p) = 
\sum_{q \lt p} 
\frac{1}{p} 
\frac{1}{q} 
\prod_{q \neq r \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{r} \right )\]

  </p><p>We can rearrange this to</p>

  <p>\(\displaystyle
\lambda_2(p) = 
\frac{1}{p}
\left [ \prod_{q \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right ) \right ]
\sum_{q \lt p} \frac{1}{q} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right )^{-1}\)</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>As a cute exercise, write $\lambda_k(p)$ for the density of numbers 
whose $k$th prime is $p$.</p>

  <p>De Koninck and Tenenbaum mention in passing that</p><p>

\[\displaystyle
\lambda_k(p) = 
\frac{1}{p} 
\left [ \prod_{k \lt p} \left ( 1 - \frac{1}{q} \right ) \right ]
s_{k-1}(p)\]

  </p><p>where
$s_j(p) = \sum \frac{1}{m}$
is a sum over all $m$ who have exactly $j$ prime factors, all of which are $\lt p$.</p>

  <p>Can you prove that this formula is correct<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>?</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>But remember the goal of all this! We want to know the prime \(p^*\) so that 
half of all numbers have their second prime \(\leq p^*\). That is, so that 
the sum of densities</p><p>

\[\lambda_2(2) + \lambda_2(3) + \lambda_2(5) + \ldots + \lambda_2(p^*) 
\approx 
\frac{1}{2}.\]

</p><p>But we can implement $\lambda_2(-)$ and just <em>check</em> for which prime this 
happens!</p>



<p>Again we see that $37$ is the prime where roughly half of all numbers 
have something $\leq 37$ as their first prime! So we’ve proven that 
$37$ is the median second prime!</p>

<p>Also, this shows that we expect the actual density to be $\approx .5002$. 
If we set $N = 10^7$ in the code from the first half<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>
to get a better approximation, we get $.5002501$, which is <em>remarkably</em> 
close to the truth!</p>

<div>
  <p>As another cute exercise – using the ideas in this post, 
can you compute the median <em>third</em> prime?</p>

  <p>As a (much) harder exercise<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup>, can you get asymptotics for how 
the median $k$th prime grows as a function of $k$?</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>Thanks for hanging out, all! This was a really fun post to write up, 
and I’m really excited to share it with everybody!
This fact about $37$ was all I could think about for like a week, haha.</p>

<p>I have more blog posts coming, of course, so I’ll see you all soon!</p>

<p>Stay safe, and stay warm ^_^</p>

The process of mechanization shifted power to the hands of the capitalists, and was only wrestled back with blood.</p><p>The real key of the future with AI will be the question of generalization. Multimodal AI does show a reasonable amount of ability on predicting real world events. For example, show a picture of a kid opening a bike and ask what is next  in image form, and the AI will return a picture of the kid riding a bike. This ability of reasonable prediction based on sets of 'real world' input is not something that we've had in previous generations of computer systems. Again, if these systems generalize well, rapidly become cheaper, and enable the capitalist class to gain more wealth expect their use to explode at a near exponential rate.</p><p>Very few reasonably educated people say "AI will never reach human ability", the only question that is really being asked is when, and in a lot of peoples eyes when has moved much sooner.

WHAT A TIME TO BE ALIVE" on literally every video...) that would have you think every single subject is an absolute major breakthrough when the reality is that many of them simply produced cool-looking demos that look good in a youtube thumbnail.<p>Sorry if that's too harsh. The channel isn't all bad. The title of the channel is up front about being a quick synopsis that you can watch from time to time to keep up with the latest updates. That's still useful for many people.

Yudkowsky tends not to respond well or at all to criticism either. For real just go see the criticisms written on that site about his views on runaway AGI and how we get "one critical chance" to stop it from killing us all. His response is effectively "this post is very long, could you summarize the best bits?" and then doesn't respond any further.<p>Less on topic, I'm becoming convinced that lesswrong is where researchers who couldn't get published go to feel like they got published and peer reviewed, when in reality they are getting peer reviewed by a massive echo chamber. Even less on topic and potentially downvote-inciting; it looks less like an echo chamber and more like a sort of social-media-first cult every day.

<p dir="auto">However, OpenAI's service is hosted, closed-source, and heavily restricted:</p>

The problem appears to be rather complex. According to Häfele, the&nbsp;components&nbsp;used&nbsp;in these SSDs are too big for the&nbsp;circuit board,&nbsp;causing&nbsp;weak connections&nbsp;(i.e., high impendence and high temperatures)&nbsp;and making them prone to breaking.&nbsp;He also says that the soldering material used&nbsp;to attach these components is prone to forming bubbles and breaking easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It remains unknown whether the cause is cheap solder, the componentry, or both contribute to the issues observed. However, newer&nbsp;revisions&nbsp;of these&nbsp;SanDisk Extreme Pro&nbsp;SSDs seem to have been modified with extra epoxy resin to secure the oversized components. This suggests that Western Digital might know about the hardware problems. Nevertheless, these newer models are still failing, thus sending data recovery&nbsp;service customers to firms like Attingo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to the head of Attingo, the issue seems to be affecting&nbsp;multiple product lineups, including&nbsp;both&nbsp;SanDisk Extreme Portable SSD&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;the SanDisk Extreme Pro Portable SSD.</p><h2 id="a-strange-attitude-3">A Strange Attitude?</h2><p>Western Digital's handling of this situation, especially in communicating with customers and the media,&nbsp;can easily be criticized. Our colleagues from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/22291828/sandisk-extreme-pro-portable-my-passport-failure-continued">The Verge</a>&nbsp;first reported back on August 8 that Western Digital's SanDisk Extreme 3TB SSDs can suddenly lose data, requiring expensive data recovery services to recoup precious files — if you're lucky. As it turns out, one of The Verge's editors lost a video stored on one of these drives and, after a quick investigation, discovered that he is far from alone with this problem. He noted that people continued losing data on 2TB SSDs after May, which is when Western Digital promised a firmware update for the 4TB drives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To follow up on its investigation, the Verge quizzed Western Digital about the recurring issue with its Extreme Pro SSDs but&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23837513/western-digital-sandisk-ssd-corrupted-deleted-questions" data-url="https://www.theverge.com/23837513/western-digital-sandisk-ssd-corrupted-deleted-questions">did not receive a response as of August 19, 2023</a>. The website asked WD why storage that could potentially lose data was suddenly on sale at several retailers and whether the company planned to offer free data recovery services to its customers. The editors also questioned whether Western Digital proactively warned users about the possible issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>NAND memory-based drives can lose data due to multiple factors. Sometimes, the flash drive itself might have manufacturing defects that can cause data loss. This is more common with low-quality or counterfeit drives, but this is certainly not the case with the SanDisk Extreme Pro products bought from prominent retailers like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://html-first.com/">https://html-first.com/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38241304">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content">
  

<p>HTML First is a set of principles that aims to make building web software <strong>easier</strong>, <strong>faster</strong>, more <strong>inclusive</strong>, and more <strong>maintainable</strong> by...</p>

<ol>
<li>Leveraging the default capabilities of modern web browsers.</li>
<li>Leveraging the extreme simplicity of HTML's attribute syntax.</li>
<li>Leveraging the web's ViewSource affordance.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>The main goal of HTML First is to <strong>substantially widen the pool of people who can work on web software codebases</strong>. This is good from an individual perspective because it allows a greater number of people to become web programmers, to build great web software, and increase their income. It's also good from a business perspective as it decreases the cost of building software, and decreases the amount of resources required to hire - a notoriously resource intensive process. </p>

<p>A second goal of HTML First is to make it more <ins>enjoyable</ins> and <ins>seamless</ins> to build web software. Most web programmers are familiar with the excitement of seeing their product come together rapidly as they transition smoothly between the text editor and the browser, with very few unexpected potholes or context switches. But today it takes several years of mastering tools and frameworks to get to that stage. HTML First principles should allow people to unlock that feeling, and level of mastery, much earlier on in their coding journey.</p>

<p>The way we achieve these goals is by acknowledging that <a href="https://new.tonyennis.com/blog/M3WoiPA5P-comparing-the-readability-and-learning-curve-of-html" target="_blank">HTML is very easy to understand</a>, and thus using HTML as the bedrock of our product - not only to define content and structure, but also to set styling and behaviours.</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="#vanilla-approaches">Prefer Vanilla approaches</a></li>
<li><a href="#attributes-for-styling-behaviour">Use HTML attributes for styling and behaviour</a></li>
<li><a href="#attributes-for-libraries">Use libraries that leverage HTML attributes</a></li>
<li><a href="#build-steps">Avoid Build Steps</a></li>
<li><a href="#naked-html">Prefer Naked HTML</a></li>
<li><a href="#view-source">Be View-Source Friendly</a></li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Use "vanilla" approaches to achieve desired functionality over external frameworks</strong></h2>

<p>The range of things that browsers support out of the box is large, and growing. Before adding a library or framework to your codebase, check whether you can achieve it using plain old html/css.<br>
<strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;details&gt;
  &lt;summary&gt;Click to toggle content&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This is the full content that is revealed when a user clicks on the summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;    
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>import React, { useState } from 'react';

const DetailsComponent = () =&gt; {
  const [isContentVisible, setContentVisible] = useState(false);

  const toggleContent = () =&gt; {
    setContentVisible(!isContentVisible);
  };

  return (
    &lt;details&gt;
      &lt;summary onClick={toggleContent}&gt;Click to toggle content&lt;/summary&gt;
      {isContentVisible &amp;&amp; &lt;p&gt;This is the full content that is revealed when a user clicks on the summary&lt;/p&gt;}
    &lt;/details&gt;
  );
};

export default DetailsComponent;
</code></pre>



<h2>Where possible, default to defining style and behaviour with inline HTML attributes</h2>

<p>For styling this can be enabled with an SPC library like <a href="https://github.com/tonyennis145/dumb-tailwind" target="_blank">Tailwind</a> or <a href="http://tachyons.io/" target="_blank">Tachyons</a>. For behaviour, you can use libraries like <a href="https://hyperscript.org/" target="_blank">hyperscript</a>, <a href="https://alpinejs.dev/" target="_blank">Alpine</a>, or similar. Yes, this does mean your HTML will <em>look</em> busy. But it also means it will be easier for other developers to find and understand behaviour, navigate it, and make changes to it.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div onlick="this.classList.add('bg-green')"&gt;
  Click Me
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="results-pane"&gt;
  Click Me
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>#results-pane.active {
  background-color: green;
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>var resultsPane = document.getElementById("myDiv");
resultsPane.addEventListener("click", function() {
    this.classList.add("active");
});
</code></pre>

<p>You may notice that this approach seems to violate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns" target="_blank">Separation of Concerns</a> - one of the most commonly-touted software design principles. We believe an all-or-nothing approach to SoC is flawed, and instead advocate an approach that accounts for Locality of Behaviour and acknoweldges the trade-offs between the two.   </p>

<li><a href="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/" target="_blank">Adam Wathan on separation of styling concerns</a>.</li>
</ul>



<h2><strong>Where libraries are necessary, use libraries that leverage html attributes over libraries built around javascript or custom syntax</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/<a href="https://html-first.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d8b0a1a8bdaaabbbaab1a8ac98e8f6e8f6ef">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/dist/hyperscript.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" _="on input put me into #output"&gt;
  &lt;div id="output"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/<a href="https://html-first.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="bbc8cfd2d6ced7cec8fb89958b958b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/dist/stimulus.umd.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;div data-controller="echo"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" data-echo-target="source" data-action="input-&gt;echo#update"&gt;
  &lt;div data-echo-target="output"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  const application = Stimulus.Application.start();

  application.register("echo", class extends Stimulus.Controller {
      static targets = ["source", "output"]

      update() {
          this.outputTarget.textContent = this.sourceTarget.value;
      }
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>


      

<h2>Steer Clear of Build Steps</h2>

<p>Libraries that require transforming your files from one format to another add significant maintenance overhead, remove or heavily impair the ViewSource affordance , and usually dictate that developers learn new tooling in order to use them. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36517829/what-does-multiplexing-mean-in-http-2/36519379#36519379" target="_blank">Modern browsers don't have the same performance constraints</a> that they did when these practices were introduced. And if we use HTML First libraries like static tailwind or htmx, the amount of additional CSS and JS needed is usually minimal.</p>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;link href="/dist/output.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code>npx css-compile -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
</code></pre>

<p>Aside: The build step practice is so deeply ingrained that even one year ago this opinion was considered <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyennis/status/1579610085499998208" target="_blank">extremely fringe</a>. But in the last year has begun to gain significant steam. Some recent examples:</p>

<li><a href="https://social.lol/@bw/111293266036805485" target="_blank">Blake Watson - "There has never been a better time to ditch build steps"</a></li>
</ul>



<h2>Prefer "naked" HTML to obfuscation layers that compile down to HTML</h2>

<p>This principle is most applicable to backend implementation. The underlying idea again here is readability. If a developer who has familiarity with HTML but not with your backend framework looks through your view files, they should still be able to understand 90%+ of what they see. As with above, this means sacrificing brevity for understandability. </p>

<p><strong>Encouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="&lt;%= new_signup_path %&gt;" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;label for="first_name"&gt;First Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="first_name" type="text" value="&lt;%= @signup&amp;.first_name %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;label for="last_name"&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="last_name" type="text" value="&lt;%= @signup&amp;.last_name %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;label for="email"&gt;Last Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id="email" type="text" value="&lt;%= @signup&amp;.email %&gt;" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Discouraged</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= form_with url: "#", local: true do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :first_name %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :first_name %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :last_name %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.text_field :last_name %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="field"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.label :email %&gt;
    &lt;%= form.email_field :email %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div class="actions"&gt;
    &lt;%= form.submit %&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>



<h2>Where possible, maintain the right-click-view-source affordance</h2>

<p>The beauty of the early web was that it was always possible to "peek behind the curtains" and see the code that was responsible for any part of any web page. This was a gift to aspiring developers, as it allowed us to bridge the gap between the theoretical (reading about how code works) and the practical - seeing both code and interface alongside each other. For many sites, we could copy and paste the html or css and run it in ourselves to get a close-to-identical replica. "Remixing" existing snippets was not only a way to learn, but often formed the basis of our new creations.</p>

<p>In the time since, the industry has adopted several "improvements" which have made this practice much rarer. For example, if we use React - the most popular frontend framework, we cannot hit "View Source", copy the code, and remix it, because 1. React has a build step, meaning the code we see in the developer tools is different to the code that the developer wrote, and 2. React code snippets must be wrapped in a react application in order for them to work.</p>

<p>For sites that follow HTML First principles, we regain the ViewSource affordance again. In fact, HTML First sites often go one step further. Because if you define your <strong>UI interactions</strong> using HTML attributes, you can now also preserve these interactions when copy pasting into a new codebase, (provided your destination file includes the same js library). At some point we intend to levearge this to build an HTML First code snippet library. </p>

</ul>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>The practices and principles described on this site are still considered niche in the industry as a whole, and the community of people using them small. One of my hopes with creating this site is to act as a Honeypot to find and connect like minded people with whom we can discuss and sharpen these ideas. If any of this resonates with you, I'd love to <a href="https://twitter.com/tonyennis" target="_blank">hear from you</a>.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/11/google_proxy_plan_cma/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/11/google_proxy_plan_cma/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38241237">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p><span>Exclusive</span> Google's plan to prevent marketers from tracking Chrome users across different websites by anonymizing IP addresses is being challenged by, surprise surprise, a marketing advocacy group.</p>
<p>The Movement for an Open Web (MOW), an organization that has lobbied against Google's Privacy Sandbox initiative by claiming it's harmful to rival internet advertising businesses, has filed a complaint with the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) over <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/23/google_ip_proxy/">Google's IP Protection</a> proposal.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection">IP Protection</a>, previously referred to as "<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/spanicker/ip-blindness">ip-blindness</a>" or "Gnatcatcher," is a proxy system similar to Apple's Privacy Relay. It's designed to run Chrome browser connections through two proxies, one operated by Google and one operated by a third-party (eg, Cloudflare), so that the true public IP address of the user is obscured, hopefully thwarting attempts to track them around the web using that address.</p>

    

<p>IP Protection is expected to appear in a future version of Chrome, possibly as soon as January 2024 with the debut of Chrome 122.</p>

        


        

<p>The Google-run proxy can observe the user's IP address but not the websites being visited and the third-party proxy can see the web servers being visited but not the IP address of the visitor. By separating the user's IP address from the user's destination through Google's service, websites and intermediaries cannot (without additional information) link people's IP addresses to their browsing habits to create marketing profiles.</p>
<p>Initially, IP Protection will be opt-in, but Google <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection/issues/8#issuecomment-1606214206">intends</a> to make it the default setting for the Chrome browser.</p>

        

<p>MOW objects to this project as a violation of Google's <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases/investigation-into-googles-privacy-sandbox-browser-changes">commitments</a> to the CMA, a set of promises the ad biz made to the UK competition watchdog to win approval for its plan to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/google_privacy_sandbox/">replace</a> third-party cookies with Privacy Sandbox technologies.</p>
<p>"Google's IP Protection means ISPs will no longer have visibility of data via an IP address whist leaving Google with the ability to monitor and process data at all times," says a letter from MOW's London-based legal representative Preiskel &amp; Co LLP to the CMA and to UK telecom regulator Ofcom, which was provided to <em>The Register</em>.</p>
<p>"This will make the provision of child protection services more difficult for ISPs."</p>

        

<p>The CMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment and subsequently acknowledged receipt of MOW's complaint.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/23/google_ip_proxy/">Google - yes, that Google - testing proxy scheme to hide IP addresses for privacy</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/07/google_privacy_sandbox/">Google Chrome Privacy Sandbox open to all: Now websites can tap into your habits directly for ads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The need to protect children has become a common rationale for efforts to weaken encryption <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/09/eu_casm_expert_identities/">in Europe</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/09/20/uk_online_safety_bill_passes/">the UK</a>, and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity">the US</a>. And marketers, like law enforcement agencies, fear that privacy technologies will leave them in the dark and without the lucrative data they've come to depend upon.</p>
<p>Such concerns have already surfaced in the IP Protection GitHub repo. For example, one pseudonymous individual who claims to help advertising clients optimize Google AdWords campaigns says that IP addresses play a critical role in fraud prevention.</p>
<p>"By monitoring individual IP address activity for each campaign and those IP addresses clicking on keywords 10+ times per day, we have been able to exclude these IP addresses," the purported marketer <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ip-protection/issues/4#issuecomment-1660812341">wrote</a> in early August.</p>
<p>"The result is that we have maintained the performance of each campaign but significantly reduced the monthly spend for our clients. If we do not have access to granular IP addresses, we will no longer be able to help our clients save money, this will lead to reduced campaign performance and will no doubt lead to us turning off a number of campaigns as the economics will no longer work."</p>
<p>For MOW, the concern is that Google would still have data denied to rivals.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>IP Protection is an anti-competitive technology that Google is attempting to impose upon the web under the veil of privacy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"This is a blatant and egregious breach of the commitments made by Google to the CMA to prevent it acting in an anti-competitive fashion," said Tim Cowen, co-founder of MOW, in a statement provided to <em>The Register</em>. "They have started to roll out a clearly self-preferencing technology as part of Privacy Sandbox without adequate notice or testing.</p>
<p>"As with all aspects of the Sandbox, IP Protection is an anti-competitive technology that Google is attempting to impose upon the web under the veil of privacy. It removes an important piece of data from Google’s competitors whilst they can continue to make use of it."</p>
<p>MOW's letter to the CMA cites specific objections as to why IP Protection contravenes Google's promises to the agency. IP Protection, it's claimed, makes it more difficult for VPN operators to compete; restricts access to data that Google's ad systems rely on; lacks the testing Google promised to do; and removes functionality without proof of its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The missive also notes that Google has not sought a design review from the W3C's Technical Architecture Group (TAG). According to MOW, the likely reason is to avoid criticism "for the feature's anticompetitive impact and its blatant attempt to privatize the Open Web."</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Google were unavailable for comment. ®</p>

        <!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3 id="why-cpu-knowledge-is-no-longer-enough">Why CPU Knowledge Is No Longer Enough</h3>

<p>In today's AI age, the majority of developers train in the CPU way. This knowledge has been part of our academics as well, so it's obvious to think and problem-solve in a <strong>CPU-oriented way</strong>.</p>

<p>However, the problem with CPUs is that they rely on a <strong>sequential architecture</strong>. In today's world, where we are dependent on numerous parallel tasks, CPUs are unable to work well in these scenarios.</p>

<p>Some problems faced by developers include:</p>

<h4 id="executing-parallel-tasks">Executing Parallel Tasks</h4>

<p>CPUs traditionally operate linearly, executing one instruction at a time. This limitation stems from the fact that CPUs typically feature a few powerful cores optimized for single-threaded performance.</p>

<p>When faced with multiple tasks, a CPU allocates its resources to address each task one after the other, leading to a sequential execution of instructions. This approach becomes inefficient in scenarios where numerous tasks need simultaneous attention.</p>

<p>While we make efforts to enhance CPU performance through techniques like multi-threading, the fundamental design philosophy of CPUs prioritizes sequential execution.</p>

<h4 id="running-ai-models-efficiently">Running AI Models Efficiently</h4>

<p>AI models, employing advanced architectures like transformers, leverage parallel processing to enhance performance. Unlike older <strong>recurrent neural networks (RNNs)</strong> that operate sequentially, modern transformers such as <strong>GPT</strong> can concurrently process multiple words, increasing efficiency and capability in training. Because when we train in parallel, it will result in bigger models, and bigger models will yield better outputs.</p>

<p>The concept of parallelism extends beyond natural language processing to other domains like <strong>image recognition</strong>. For instance, <a href="https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/concept-of-alexnet-convolutional-neural-network-6e73b4f9ee30?ref=journal.hexmos.com">AlexNet</a>, an architecture in image recognition, demonstrates the power of parallel processing by processing different parts of an image simultaneously, allowing for accurate pattern identification.</p>

<p>However, CPUs, designed with a focus on single-threaded performance, struggle to fully exploit parallel processing potential. They face difficulties efficiently distributing and executing the numerous parallel computations required for intricate AI models.</p>

<p>As a result, the development of GPUs has become prevalent to address the specific needs of parallel processing in AI applications, unlocking higher efficiency and faster computation.</p>

<h4 id="how-gpu-driven-development-solves-these-issues">How GPU Driven Development Solves These Issues</h4>

<p><strong>Massive Parallelism With GPU Cores</strong></p>

<p>Engineers design GPUs with <strong>smaller, highly specialized cores</strong> compared to the <strong>larger, more powerful cores</strong> found in CPUs. This architecture allows GPUs to execute a multitude of parallel tasks simultaneously.</p>

<p>The high number of cores in a GPU are well-suited for workloads depending on parallelism, such as graphics rendering and complex mathematical computations.</p>

<p>We will soon demonstrate how using GPU parallelism can reduce the time taken for complex tasks.</p>

<p><img alt="GPUDemo1" src="https://journal-wa6509js.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/ee0bdbd2103cbed5d0fa894432cc476065984dcd3921bb9158e608a50fe62f7b.png"></p>

<p><strong>Parallelism Used In AI Models</strong></p>

<p>AI models, particularly those built on deep learning frameworks like <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/?ref=journal.hexmos.com">TensorFlow</a>, exhibit a high degree of parallelism. Neural network training involves numerous matrix operations, and GPUs, with their expansive core count, excel in parallelizing these operations. TensorFlow, along with other popular deep learning frameworks, optimizes to leverage GPU power for accelerating model training and inference.</p>

<p>We will show a demo soon how to train a neural network using the power of the GPU.</p>

<p><img alt="GPUDemo1" src="https://journal-wa6509js.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/5078635f14fc266b48058cafe1f214608eecd89f0ddfebfc481df24704a7bba9.png"></p>

<h3 id="cpus-vs-gpus-whats-the-difference">CPUs Vs GPUs: What’s the Difference?</h3>

<h4 id="cpu">CPU</h4>

<p><strong>Sequential Architecture</strong></p>

<p>Central Processing Units (CPUs) are designed with a focus on sequential processing. They excel at executing a single set of instructions linearly.</p>

<p>CPUs are optimized for tasks that require high single-threaded performance, such as</p>

<ul>
<li>General-purpose computing</li>
<li>System operations</li>
<li>Handling complex algorithms that involve conditional branching</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Limited Cores For Parallel Tasks</strong></p>

<p>CPUs feature a smaller number of cores, often in the range of <strong>2-16</strong> cores in consumer-grade processors. Each core is capable of handling its own set of instructions independently.</p>

<h4 id="gpu">GPU</h4>

<p><strong>Parallelized Architecture</strong></p>

<p>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are designed with a parallel architecture, making them highly efficient for parallel processing tasks.</p>

<p>This is beneficial for</p>

<ul>
<li>Rendering graphics</li>
<li>Performing complex mathematical calculations</li>
<li>Running parallelizable algorithms</li>
</ul>

<p>GPUs handle multiple tasks simultaneously by breaking them into smaller, parallel sub-tasks.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands Of Cores For Parallel Tasks</strong></p>

<p>Unlike CPUs, GPUs boast a significantly larger number of cores, often numbering in the thousands. These cores are organized into streaming multiprocessors (SMs) or similar structures.</p>

<p>The abundance of cores allows GPUs to process a massive amount of data concurrently, making them well-suited for parallelisable tasks, such as image and video processing, deep learning, and scientific simulations.</p>

<h3 id="get-started-with-the-cuda-framework">Get Started with the Cuda Framework</h3>

<p>As we have installed the CUDA Framework, let's start executing operations that showcases its functionality.</p>

<h4 id="array-addition-problem">Array Addition Problem</h4>

<p>A suitable problem to demonstrate the parallelization of GPUs is the <strong>Array addition problem</strong>.</p>

<p>Consider the following arrays:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Array A = [1,2,3,4,5,6]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Array B = [7,8,9,10,11,12]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to store the sum of each element and store it in Array C.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like C = [1+7,2+8,3+9,4+10,5+11,6+12] = [8,10,12,14,16,18]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the CPU is to execute such operation, it would be executing the operation like the below code.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div><pre><span></span><span>#include</span><span> </span><span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

<span>    </span><span>}</span>

<span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The previous method involves traversing the array elements one by one and performing the additions sequentially. However, when dealing with a <strong>substantial volume of numbers</strong>, this approach becomes sluggish due to its <strong>sequential nature</strong>.</p>

<p>To address this limitation, GPUs offer a solution by <strong>parallelizing the addition process</strong>. Unlike CPUs, which execute operations one after the other, GPUs can concurrently perform multiple additions.</p>

<p>For instance, the operations 1+7, 2+8, 3+9, 4+10, 5+11 and 6+12 can be executed simultaneously through parallelization with the assistance of a GPU.</p>

<p>Utilizing CUDA, the code to achieve this parallelized addition is as follows:</p>

<p>We will use a kernel file (.cu) for the demonstration.</p>

<p>Let's go through the code one by one.</p>

<div><pre><span></span><span>__global__</span><span> </span><span>void</span><span> </span><span>vectorAdd</span><span>(</span><span>int</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>int</span><span>*</span><span> </span><span>c</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
<span>    </span><span>int</span><span> </span><span>i</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>threadIdx</span><span>.</span><span>x</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>c</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>a</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>b</span><span>[</span><span>i</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
<span>    </span><span>return</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</pre></div>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>__global__</code> specifier indicates that this function is a kernel function, which will be called on the GPU.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>vectorAdd</code> takes three integer pointers (a, b, and c) as arguments, representing vectors to be added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>threadIdx.x</code> retrieves the index of the current thread (in a one-dimensional grid).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sum of the corresponding elements from vectors a and b is stored in vector c.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Now lets go through the main function.</p>

<p>Pointers <code>cudaA</code>, <code>cudaB</code> and <code>cudaC</code> are created to point to memory on the GPU.</p>

</pre></div>

<p>Using <code>cudaMalloc</code>, memory is allocated on the GPU for the vectors cudaA, cudaB, and cudaC.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/11/apple_tax_bill_hiring/">https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/11/apple_tax_bill_hiring/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38240363">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Apple managed to escape a whopping €13 billion ($13.9 billion) tax bill in the European Union a few years ago, though now the advocate general of the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) is asking judges to take another look.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2023-11/cp230171en.pdf" rel="nofollow">According</a> [PDF] to the CJEU's Advocate General Giovanni Pitruzzella, a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/07/15/apple_13bn_irish_tax_ruling_overturned/">2020 ruling</a> that absolved Apple of the expense should be set aside due to "a series of errors in law" when it made the ruling.</p>
<p>"The General Court failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors," the AG's office said.</p>

    

<p>For those having trouble recalling the nature of the disagreement, it reaches back a few years, beginning with a decision in 2018 that told Apple to hand over the aforementioned €13 billion to Irish tax officials after the European Commission <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2018/09/19/apple_alleged_state_aid_ireland/">decided</a> Apple and Irish authorities had together broken state aid rules.</p>

        


        

<p>Ireland, where Apple has its European headquarters, is known for its favorable tax rules that have attracted a number of large US-based tech companies to set up shop on the Emerald Isle. Apple, EU officials report, split itself into two entities – Apple Sales International (ASI) and Apple Operations International (AOE) – after obtaining permission from Irish tax authorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those officials gave that permission in two rulings issued in 1991 and 2007, the AG's office said. In 2016, the European Commission figured those two rulings allowed Apple to exclude profits derived from intellectual property licenses held by ASI and AOE. That meant Apple didn't have to pay as much tax in Europe as one might expect, and the EC was OK with that at the time.</p>

        

<p>Then, as we said, in 2018, the commission had a change of heart, felt rules had been broken, and wanted that €13 billion in tax from Apple.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2020, and the General Court of the European Union decided Apple didn't actually need to pay the tax due to the arrangement the iPhone maker had in Ireland seemingly being above board. We got a hint of how the EC planned to appeal against that general court decision, and extract billions from Apple, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/01/european_commission_outlines_its_appeal/">in 2021</a>, and the filing by Pitruzzella's office makes largely the same argument.</p>
<p>Whether Apple will end up having to cough up the cash again (a considerable amount - the iGiant's <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/11/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/" rel="nofollow">calendar Q3 profit</a> this year amounted to $23 billion) is unknown. As the AG's office notes, its opinions aren't binding on the CJEU, and will require the court to review the case and issue a new decision.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>US hiring discrimination charges mean pocket-change payout for Apple</h3>
<p>The iMaker will also cough up $25 million (with an M) the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-25-million-landmark-agreement-apple-resolve-employment" rel="nofollow">announced</a> this week, settling claims the tech titan "illegally discriminated in hiring and recruitment against&nbsp;US citizens and certain non-US citizens whose permission to live in and work in the United States does not expire."</p>
<p>According to the DoJ, Apple violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (<a href="https://www.uscis.gov/laws-and-policy/legislation/immigration-and-nationality-act" rel="nofollow">INA</a>) when recruiting for jobs that fell under the permanent labor certification program (<a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent" rel="nofollow">PERM</a>), a US Department of Labor scheme that allows employers to sponsor workers for permanent residence status, provided program requirements are met. Among those requirements are rules that employers can't illegally discriminate in hiring or recruitment based on citizenship or immigration status.&nbsp;</p>

        

<p>According to the DoJ, that's just what Apple did.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/02/apple_batterygate_uk/">Batterygate bound for Blighty as UK court approves billion-dollar Apple compensation case</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/06/apple_sales_wages_settlement/">Apple pays $500K to make sales bods' complaint about wage theft go away</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/10/11/microsoft_irs_tax_bill/">Hell no, we won't pay, says Microsoft as Uncle Sam sends $29B bill for back taxes</a></li>

<li><a href="https://www.theregister.com/2023/01/28/apple_sued_privacy/">Apple sued for promising privacy, failing at it</a></li>
</ul>
<p>"The department's investigation found that Apple did not advertise positions Apple sought to fill through the PERM program on its external job website … [and] required all PERM position applicants to mail paper applications," the DoJ said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"These less effective recruitment procedures nearly always resulted in few or no applications to PERM positions from applicants whose permission to work does not expire."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, if a US company wants to sponsor an employee's green card, so that the staffer can get permanent residency in America, the biz usually (but not always) has to apply for a PERM certificate from the Dept of Labor so that the foreign worker's immigration process can be completed. To get that PERM cert, the business has to demonstrate that no US citizen or someone already with a green card is available and qualified to do that employee's role in America and thus the foreigner needs permanent status in the country to fill the position.</p>
<p>By demonstrate, we mean that the employer is expected to re-advertise that foreign staffer's job widely so that US persons have a chance to come forward to show they ought to have it instead; if you put barriers up, such as only accepting mailed applications or hiding the job ads in little-seen corners of the internet, it's not a fair situation, and that makes Uncle Sam unhappy. And the government is upset at the iPhone giant doing stuff like that, allegedly.</p>
<p>We reached out to Apple for comment, and haven't heard back. Cook and Co did <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/apple-to-pay-up-to-25-million-to-settle-u-s-discrimination-charges-3f81fad4?st=df2t03ajuss4fo1&amp;reflink=article_copyURL_share" rel="nofollow">tell</a> the Wall Street Journal that its violation of government standards was an accident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"When we realized we had unintentionally not been following the DOJ standard, we agreed to a settlement addressing their concerns," an Apple spokesperson said. "We have implemented a robust remediation plan to comply with the requirements of various government agencies as we continue to hire American workers and grow in the US."</p>
<p>Apple's payout will be split between $6.75 million in civil penalties and an $18.25 million back pay fund for discrimination victims. As noted above, Apple made $23 billion in profit in one quarter alone. That $25 million fine amounts to a tenth of one percent of its Q3 net income. ®</p>

  <h2>
    What is Free Oberon?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Free Oberon is a cross-platform integrated development environment for development in
       Oberon programming language, made in the classical pseudo-graphic style.
  </p>
  <p>
    Compilation is done using the
       <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Oleg-N-Cher/OfrontPlus">Ofront+ Oberon translator</a>,
       the compiled console programs are executed independently or in the built-in cross-platform terminal
       emulator. Free Oberon uses the latest revision of the Oberon programing language (Oberon-07).
       The size of type CHAR is 2 bytes and it supports Unicode. The base modules were rewritten with
       this in mind: In, Out, Files, Texts, etc. The language extensions include pointers to arrays.
  </p>
  <p>
    The IDE includes a cross-platform module Graph for graphics programming.
       It is built on top of Allegro5 library.
  </p>
  <p>
    The interface of the IDE as well as the compiler error messages are translated
       in other languages. Anyone can add a language by editing a text file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Free Oberon is free software and is shipped under
       <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GNU General Public License version 3</a>
       with source code. It can be compiled under Windows, GNU/Linux and other operating systems.
       Windows version contains a precompiled Ofront+ compiler, and truncated MinGW bundle,
       necessary for its operation. The compiled programs are “native” Windows applications
       and do not require additional DLL files to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Free Oberon is part of a larger project, which includes writing a series of textbooks on
       programming, creating educational materials, and the development of a native Oberon compiler and other
       programs with the aim of developing informatics as science and popularizing it as science among
       programmers and students.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>You push (or better, merge) to master, and the deployment happens automagically. No
further work required. That's the promise of GitHub-Actions (GHA), and probably
every other CI service provider.</p>
<p>However, things are not as shiny as they seem at first glance. There are many
problems with the approach that GHA and co. use. Some are addressable by more
disciplined usage behavior<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, but others are not.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>My first and foremost problem with them is: you cannot run them locally. There
are some projects, that attempt to enable you to do that, e.g. 
<a href="https://github.com/nektos/act">act</a>, but they are very limited. And that is because
of my second-biggest issue with GHA: the runner is closed source.</p>
<p>Hosting a git repo is hardly more than providing a file system and SSH access.
The actual mechanism they use to keep you on their platform is the CI-pipelines
(and maybe the issue system and wiki, but less so). Half a year ago, I started
porting my teams Azure-Devops pipelines to GHA, investing ~1 day per week. AND I
AM STILL NOT DONE.</p>
<p>The fact that you have to push a commit to the repo to test a change, and then 
wait for a runner delays everything indefinitely, and makes iterating really
painful.</p>
<p>Additionally, writing pipelines in YAML is just painful. It's super verbose,
and you have a lot of "code" duplication. Quite soon in the process I invested
3 days to write a small DSL that compiles to GHA<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>. This already took care
of the code duplication, and I integrated <a href="https://github.com/rhysd/actionlint">actionlint</a> to reduce the number of pushes I'd need. Sadly, actionlint
catches a similar percentage of your bugs like a C-compiler (which is not very
high). Originally, that DSL hat two backends: One to compile to GHA, and one
to run stuff locally. The second one is not in use anymore. Why? Because there
are tons of actions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> that you want to use, e.g. for terraform. To use those
locally, I'd have to reimplement the complete GHA runner, or at least, locally
reimplement all the actions I want to use.</p>
<p>Many of those actions are written by 3rd parties, not by GitHub/Microsoft,
but it benefits them a lot by strengthening their position against their
competition. It's a network effect. And it's bad for everyone except MS. I'm
only somewhat knowledgeable in Azure-Devops and GitHub actions (much to my own
dismay), but I assume that more or less every CI provider does its own thing,
and there is a lot of duplicated efforts. </p>
<h2>An attempt at a solution</h2>
<p>The base idea is the same for every CI provider: You define a "workflow" that
runs some scripts. Some of which run in parallel, some of which require others
to finish first. They need access to a git repository, and they might have
to interact with it. Defining a language to run scripts in parallel with some
constraints is actually quite easy if you just pass the script to an existing
interpreter and let the language mainly deal with the constraints around order
and parallelism (and code reuse). However, if this is then just a new solution,
little is gained. So it would be necessary to have different "generators" that
generate small wrappers for your CI-provider of choice that call the actual
definitions, and maybe to call a subset of functionality that is shared by
more or less everyone (e.g. creating issues, merging a branch, etc.). If people
who currently write "plugins" for different CI providers instead focus on this
hypothetical language, we would end up with an ecosystem of CI tools that can run
everywhere, including your PC. I'm thinking of something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Graph of the hypothetical System" src="https://felix-knorr.net/assets/img/common_action_runtime.svg"></p>
<p>And yes, I'm aware of <a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">XKCD #927</a>, but It's actually not the same
as a CI-Provider, and I'm not aware of a similar project. Corrections are welcome.
And while I'd love to work on this, I don't see myself having enough free time in the
foreseeable future to do this. So I hope, someone feels inspired.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shellz, 37, a nurse from Houston, spends at least two hours a day with her husband playing a casino-style smartphone game called Jackpot Magic.</p><p>The app offers a variety of typical casino games to play, including their favorite, called Reel Rivals, a game in which players accrue points by playing a virtual slot machine. As in a real casino, players exchange money for coins to bet.</p><p>Unlike in a real casino, there is no way to win money back or earn a payout on coins.</p><p>But that has not stopped Shellz and her husband from spending about $150,000 in the game in just two years. She asked to use her in-game username so her family does not find out how much money they have spent on the game.</p><p>"We lie in bed next to each other, we have two tablets, two phones and a computer and all these apps spinning Reel Rivals at the same time," she said. "We normalize it with each other."</p><p>Jackpot Magic is an app made by Big Fish Games of Seattle, one of the leaders in an industry of "free-to-play" social games into which some people have plowed thousands of dollars. Big Fish Games also operates a similar app, Big Fish Casino. Both are labeled as video games, which allows the company and others like it to skirt the tightly regulated U.S. gambling market.</p><p>But unlike the gambling market, apps like Jackpot Magic and Big Fish Casino are under little oversight to determine whether they are fair or whether their business practices are predatory.</p><p>NBC News spoke to 21 people, including Shellz and her husband, who said they were hooked on the casino-style games and had spent significant sums of money. They described feelings of helplessness and wanting to quit but found themselves addicted to the games and tempted by the company's aggressive marketing tactics.</p><p>Most of the 21 players wished to remain anonymous, as they were ashamed of their addictions and did not want their loved ones to find out about their behavior.</p><p>A 42-year-old Pennsylvania woman said she felt saddened that she spent $40,000 on Big Fish Casino while working as an addiction counselor.</p><p>"The whole time I was working as an addiction counselor, I was addicted to gambling and with no hope of winning any money back," she said.</p><p>Big Fish Games did not make anyone available for an interview, nor did the company respond to detailed questions. The company has said in previous <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6878099-206-2.html#document/p4/a561949">court filings</a> that only a fraction of the game's players actually spend money.</p><p>In a response to NBC News' inquiries, the company issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6896112-BF.html">statement</a> saying its games are not gambling and should not be regulated as such.</p><p>"These games are not gambling because, among other reasons, they offer no opportunity for players to win money or anything of value," the statement said in part.</p><p>"Our games are offered for free purely for entertainment, with an opportunity for customers to spend money within the game to enhance their gameplay experience," it said. "The vast majority of Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic Slots customers play without ever paying any money. No court has yet considered all of the facts relating to how these games operate."</p><p>Players have had some recourse in recent months thanks to successful lawsuits.</p><p>After a long legal battle, 2 million players, including Shellz and her husband, will be eligible to get a small part of their losses back — about 20 percent for those who lost $10,000 to $100,000.</p><p>The money will come in a $155 million class-action settlement, announced at the end of July, that will cover two major lawsuits filed against Big Fish Games; its former owner, Churchill Downs; and its current Australian parent company, Aristocrat Leisure, alleging that they were operating "unlawful gambling devices."</p><p>The preliminary agreement was recently approved by a federal judge in Tacoma, Washington. Churchill Downs and Aristocrat Leisure both declined to comment on the settlement. Aristocrat Leisure released a public <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7205179-21354134-b761-4dd7-a3a2-266d8a52056c-1.html">statement</a> in May outlining the general contours of the settlement, but it has not said anything further.</p><p><em><strong><a href="https://smart.link/5d5ad16083f88" target="_blank">Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics</a></strong></em></p><p>While Big Fish Games admits no wrongdoing, it has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/7006464-171.html#document/p8/a573737">agreed</a> to implement "addiction-related resources" and a "self-exclusion policy" that would allow players who feel out of control to opt in to be blacklisted from playing the game.</p><p>Big Fish Games also declined to comment on the settlement.</p><p>While some players are happy to recoup some of their losses, gambling addiction experts and some lawmakers say it does not go far enough to help those whose lives have spiraled out of control after they got hooked on social casino games. They call for further regulation of the industry.</p><p>"What we would have welcomed as part of this settlement as a wake-up call for the industry is a change in practices," said Keith Whyte, the executive director of the <a href="https://www.ncpgambling.org/">National Council on Problem Gambling</a>.</p><p>"I think their model is so lucrative and in some ways so aggressive that they're doubling down, and it's going to do a lot more harm. I think it's going to eventually be reined in, but it appears they are prioritizing short-term profit over long-term sustainability and responsibility," Whyte said.</p><h2><strong>The game</strong></h2><p>Joann, 46, who lives in southwest Florida, said she began playing Big Fish Casino about eight years ago.</p><p>She estimates that she has spent $100,000 on the game.</p><p>"You know what I tell people? It's a cult, and they suck you in, and once you're in you can't get out," said Joann, who asked to use only her middle name. "You want to play, and you want to spin."</p><p>One of the named plaintiffs in the settlement is Crystal Fair of Texas, who said in a sworn declaration that she has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6782706-128-8.html#document/p3/a551787">spent $500,000</a> and described herself as being "addicted" to Big Fish Casino, playing it sometimes "nearly 24 hours a day."</p><p>"I have considered walking away for good but then I think of all my time and more importantly all my money and it's hard to walk away," she wrote. "That's how I know I'm addicted."</p><p>She concluded: "But if I could go back to the point in time when I installed Big Fish Casino, I'd never ever have done it."</p><p>Several people said they felt the apps were engineered to keep them spending money in a variety of ways, including tiered clubs for players who spend significant amounts of money and free chips for people who try to quit.</p><p>Suzie Kelly of Dallas previously told <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/harpooned-by-facebook/">Reveal News</a> how she spent about $400,000 on the game. She took out a home equity loan and used the money she inherited when her mother died to fund her habit.</p><p>When she tried to cancel her account on several occasions, Kelly said, a "VIP representative" would call her and offer her free chips so she would continue playing.</p><p>The Big Fish apps in some ways are similar to many other apps that offer casino games that can be played on smartphones.</p><p>The home screen of Big Fish Casino, known as the "lobby," offers players a chance to try various types of casino-style games, including roulette, blackjack, Texas Hold 'em, Video Poker and the most prominently featured game: slots.</p><p>Shortly after they install the app, players are encouraged to join clubs — Big Fish Casino even offers a "one time join bonus" of 50,000 chips for joining a club. Once they are in a club, players can use a chat feature to strike up conversations with their counterparts and develop friendships. While anyone can create a club, the real action is in the invitation-only ranked clubs that compete against one another.</p><p>Winning more chips and playing at higher stakes unlock new features, like high-roller rooms. There is also a <a href="https://www.bigfishgames.com/game/jackpotmagicslots/help/articles/115000134954-What-is-the-VIP-Rewards-Program-/">system</a> of "levels" and "tiers" to unlock as players spend and win more. Higher tiers come with larger potential winnings and bigger bets, which makes it easier to lose chips faster.</p><p>Players who lose but want to continue playing in high-roller rooms can do so by either rebuilding their digital fortunes through hours of gameplay or taking a shorter route: buying more chips.</p><p>Most people who play the Big Fish games do not end up spending real money. Less than 10 percent of users have ever bought virtual items while playing the games, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6878099-206-2.html#document/p4/a561949">according to an October court filing</a>.</p><p>But that 10 percent has translated into a lucrative business. According to data provided by Apptopia, an app analytics company, Big Fish Games took in an estimated $139.3 million from Big Fish Casino and Jackpot Magic players from February 2019 through July 2020.</p><p>The app's tier system, along with its social functions, can be a powerful trap for some players. Joann said she continues to play, as Big Fish Casino grants her a set of free chips (known as a "boost") every day. Even so, she said, she spends at least $600 a month, largely to maintain her status within her club.</p><p>"I want to quit the club, and I want to stop, but I have friends," she said.</p><h2>No recourse</h2><p>Big Fish Games is one of the clearest examples of the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/multinational-regulators-join-together-to-fight-gambling-in-video-games/">convergence</a> of the small-time harmless fun of video games and the rapidly expanding world of real-money gambling.</p><p>While many video games have added premium features in recent years, including <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/loot-boxes-gambling-video-games-ftc-look-it-n941256">loot boxes</a> — a mechanism to pay small, fixed fees for chances to win in-game prizes that has attracted the ire of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/video-games/video-game-loot-boxes-face-final-boss-missouri-senator-n1003471">some lawmakers</a> — no other type of game appears to allow players to lose so much credit so quickly and be constantly encouraged to spend more.</p><p>But for the time being, there does not seem to be anything stopping these gambling-style smartphone games from continuing. No federal legislation would halt this model, nor would any state-level legislation mitigate losses created by this type of game. Washington state legislators considered a bill that would have formally defined games like Big Fish Casino to not be considered gambling, but the bill did not pass.</p><p>Some players of Big Fish games have filed class-action lawsuits against the company, arguing that its games should be regulated just like traditional gambling, which is unlikely to happen any time soon.</p><p>Conventional slot machines, for example, are subject to rigorous outside testing to ensure that the odds are consistent for all players. In Nevada, there are rules about how many slot machines can be <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6922257-All-Regulations-as-of-01-30-20.html#document/p46/a565021">placed in liquor stores</a>, among hundreds of pages of regulations.</p><p>In Washington state — where Big Fish Games is located — slot machines are <a href="https://www.wsgc.wa.gov/regulation-enforcement/illegal-activities">banned</a> outright. But Washingtonians can download a smartphone game that offers would-be gamblers the chance to spend money on an experience nearly identical to that of an in-person slot machine, only without any chance of actually winning money.</p><p>Still, the recent legal victories are a welcome bit of help for some players, particularly because many have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Neva Barker, 58, a retiree in Portland, Oregon, estimated that she had spent $80,000 on Big Fish Casino and said she was thrilled to hear that she likely would get some of her money back.</p><p>It is particularly needed now, because, Barker says, she lost some of her income to coronavirus-related cutbacks.</p><p>"This has been going through so many ups and downs," she said. "I thought it was a myth that it was ever going to happen. That would be life-changing for me at this point."</p></div><div data-activity-map="expanded-byline-article-bottom"><div data-testid="byline-thumbnail"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/cyrus-farivar-ncpn973741"><picture data-testid="picture"><source srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:eco,dpr_2.0/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg 1x"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_11/2784541/cyrus-farivar-1500.jpg" alt="" height="48" width="48"></picture></a></div><p><span data-testid="byline-name"><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/cyrus-farivar-ncpn973741">Cyrus Farivar</a></span><span><a href="https://twitter.com/cfarivar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a><a href="mailto:cyrus.farivar@nbcuni.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span></span></a></span></p><p>Cyrus Farivar is a reporter on the tech investigations unit of NBC News in San Francisco.</p></div></div>]]></description>

      When Laura Larocca visited Denmark in 2019, the climate scientist sifted through thousands of old aerial photographs of Greenland’s icy coastline, which were rediscovered in a castle outside Copenhagen about 15 years ago.
  </p>

      Now housed in the Danish National Archives, the historical images inspired her and other researchers to reconstruct the territory’s glacial history and how it has changed amid a rapidly warming climate.

      After digitizing thousands of archived paper images dating back to the 1930s, Larocca’s team combined them with satellite images of Greenland today to measure how much its frozen landscape has changed.

      The comparison found Greenland’s glaciers have experienced an alarming rate of retreat that has accelerated over the last two decades. The study, published this week in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-023-01855-6" target="_blank">journal Nature Climate Change</a>, found that the rate of glacial retreat during the 21st century has been twice as fast as the retreat in the 20th century.

      The work was “very time consuming, and it took a lot of people, a lot of hours of manual labor,” said Larocca, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor at Arizona State University School of Ocean Futures. “The change is stunning — it really highlights the fast pace at which the Arctic is warming and changing.”
  </p>

      Over the past several decades, the Arctic has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/us/arctic-rapid-warming-climate/index.html">warmed four times faster </a>than the rest of the world, a 2022 study showed. The fallout of that warming is mounting. For the first time on record, it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/19/weather/greenland-summit-rain-climate-change/index.html">rained at the summit of Greenland</a> — roughly two miles above sea level during the summer of 2021. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/07/climate/greenland-ice-shelf-glacier-melt-climate-intl/index.html">scientists found</a> that northern Greenland’s huge glaciers, which were long thought to be relatively stable, now pose potentially “dramatic” consequences for sea level rise.

      “It is quite interesting that a lot of these photos were taken because of military operations,” she said. “So, they have ties with a lot of international and US history, as well.

      “[The paper] really reinforces that our choices over the next few decades and how much we reduce our emissions really matter to these glaciers,” Larocca said. “Every incremental increase in temperature will have significant consequences for these glaciers, and that swift action to limit global temperature rise will really help to reduce their future loss and contribution to sea level.”

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>This post lays out a roadmap to try to get Polonius on stable by Rust 2024. It identifies some high-level milestones and summarizes the key goals, as well as the recent progress.</p>
<h2>Background on Polonius</h2>
<p>Polonius refers to a few things. It is a <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/">new formulation</a> of the borrow checker. It is also a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/polonius">specific project</a> that implemented that analysis, based on datalog. Our current plan does not make use of that datalog-based implementation, but uses what we learned implementing it to focus on reimplementing Polonius within rustc.</p>
<p>The motivating example for Polonius is the so-called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2094-nll.md#problem-case-3-conditional-control-flow-across-functions">"Problem Case #3: conditional control flow across functions"</a>: here, returning a reference out of a function, from a conditional.</p>
<pre><code>fn get_default&lt;'r, K: Hash + Eq + Copy, V: Default&gt;(
    map: &amp;'r mut HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;,
    key: K,
) -&gt; &amp;'r mut V {
    match map.get_mut(&amp;key) { // -------------+ 'r
        Some(value) =&gt; value,              // |
        None =&gt; {                          // |
            map.insert(key, V::default()); // |
            //  ^~~~~~ ERROR               // |
            map.get_mut(&amp;key).unwrap()     // |
        }                                  // |
    }                                      // |
}                                          // v
</code></pre>
<p>Returning the mutable reference <code>value</code> in the <code>Some</code> path requires the mutable loan on <code>map</code> to live until the end of the function. This prevents mutation in the <code>None</code> path even though no mutable loan on <code>map</code> would exist there in the first place.</p>
<p>Fixing this borrowck issue requires more precision about flow-sensitivity. It also hints at limitations in our modeling of lifetimes, which appear more clearly in cases with only slightly more complicated control flow, like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47680">issue #47680</a>:</p>
<pre><code>struct Thing;

impl Thing {
    fn maybe_next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt; { None }
}

fn main() {
    let mut temp = &amp;mut Thing;

    loop {
        match temp.maybe_next() {
            Some(v) =&gt; { temp = v; }
            None =&gt; { }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The current borrow checker rejects this code. It does this because it sees that there is a loan of <code>temp</code> to call <code>temp.maybe_next()</code>. It also sees that this loan can flow around the loop — in particular, the loan is referenced by <code>v</code>, which is then stored into <code>temp</code>. Therefore, it reports an error when we attempt to mutably borrow <code>temp</code> at the top of the loop, since there may be a loan still existing from a prior iteration.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, a more careful read shows that, while the borrow may flow around the loop, it only does so on the <code>Some</code> path, and on that path <code>temp</code> is overwritten. This means that the <code>temp</code> we will be borrowing on the next iteration is in fact a different location than the one we borrowed on the previous iteration. On the <code>None</code> path, meanwhile, the loan ends.</p>
<p>This kind of "case by case" distinguishing — seeing that the flow only occurs on one path, and that on that path there is a reassignment, requires more precision than the current borrow checker can achieve.</p>
<p>Issues like "NLL problem case #3", issue #47680 and others, were therefore deferred from NLLs, and left as future work, <a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/04/27/an-alias-based-formulation-of-the-borrow-checker/">Polonius</a>.</p>
<p>The key ideas being:</p>
<ul>
<li>switching from a model of <em>lifetimes</em> as sets of points in the CFG (with <em>outlives</em> relationships), to a model of <em>origins</em> as sets of loans (with <em>subset</em> relationships).</li>
<li>computing and tracking the subset relationships at each point in the Control Flow Graph (whereas the existing borrowck computes a single subtype relation).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>This is a rough roadmap, where we have the most visibility on the first steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>each step has unknowns that will define what things need to be done in the later steps</li>
<li>therefore we're talking more about milestones for the longer term roadmap, and proper tasks for the shorter term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the roadmap's milestones:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.rust-lang.org/images/inside-rust/2023-10-06-polonius-update/roadmap.png" alt="Graph of the Polonius roadmap"></p>
<h3>1. Factoring out higher-ranked concerns from the main path</h3>
<p>Today, the trait solver produces higher-ranked outlives constraints and the borrow checker solves them. In the future, we would like to make the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/trait-system-refactor-initiative/">next trait solver</a> responsible for solving these higher-ranked constraints itself, so that it only produces the simpler <code>subset</code> constraint used in Polonius. This would allow us to solve implication predicates like <code>for&lt;T&gt; { if (T: 'a, 'a: 'b) { T: 'b } }</code> without having to effectively reproduce the same trait solving logic again. <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2019/01/21/hereditary-harrop-region-constraints/">This blog post</a> describes the problem and possible solution in more detail.</p>
<p>In the shorter term, we are exploring refactoring the borrow checker to separate out the higher-ranked processing from the ordinary processing. The goal would be to preprocess the outlives constraints in a kind of Polonius <a href="https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/traits/hrtb.html#basic-matching-and-placeholder-leaks">"leak check"</a>, where we can compute the higher-ranked errors. This could then be removed once the trait solver can solve these constraints.</p>
<p>Current status: ⏳ members of the types team are starting to work on this task in the next few days.</p>
<h3>2. Location-insensitive loans in scope</h3>
<p>Out of the two key differences between Polonius and the existing borrow check (regions as "sets of loans", and computing subtyping relations at each point in the CFG), this step is aimed at resolving the <em>first</em> difference, but not the second, so we call it the "location <em>in</em>sensitive loans in scope" (because subtyping is being done once, not per location): the idea can be described as "NLLs with the Polonius model".</p>
<p>Note that other aspects of the existing borrow checker are still flow-sensitive.</p>
<p>In this step, we will compute the set of live loans via outlives constraints only, instead of computing the CFG points where regions are live (which is then used to compute when loans go out of scope). We believe this is equivalent to the existing borrow check in terms of the errors that get reported.</p>
<p>Importantly, this change paves the way for adding location sensitivity (sets of loans are also a better foundation for far-future improvements to the borrow checker such as safe internal references).</p>
<p>Current status: ✅ we have completed prototypes, and have <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/113218">an open PR</a> to land this under a <code>-Z</code> flag, which should happen in the near future.</p>
<h3>3. Verify full test suite passes with location-insensitive Polonius</h3>
<p>That PR does pass the full 15000+ tests in our suite, but we haven't yet checked on the crates published on crates.io with a crater run.</p>
<p>Compared to our internal test suite, the vast majority of published crates are expected to build without errors. In that regard, it should be unlikely that issues would be found there, but it will be done regardless.</p>
<p>Current status: ⏳ in-progress, the crater run itself will be done before the PR lands.</p>
<h3>4. Replace parts of the borrow checker with location-insensitive Polonius</h3>
<p>The prototype only does additional work, and does not modify the existing analysis.</p>
<p>In this step, we will refactor the borrow checker so that its data structures store sets of loans, and do more performance work: for example, remove redundant computation, investigate worst-case scalability and constant factors.</p>
<p>It's expected that performance will be similar, and we can then imagine enabling the location-insensitive pass without the feature flag, and removing some of the old code.</p>
<p>To keep the high quality diagnostics from the years of work of many contributors, it's possible that the new analysis could run, and if errors are detected, only then use the existing analysis and diagnostics.</p>
<p>Current status: we've done some early investigations on the data-structures changes needed, some of redundant parts that could be removed, etc.</p>
<h3>5. Location-sensitive pass on nightly</h3>
<p>Then the (harder-to-do-efficiently) work to incorporate location-sensitivity can start. This step will implement the first version of the analysis.</p>
<p>At this point it can still be inefficient, and use the feature flag, but this is when the borrow checker should accept more expressive code than the current NLLs.</p>
<p>Current status: we're in the design phase here, to adapt our datalog prototype and algorithms to rustc, imagining alternative ways to compute and propagate the subset constraints along the CFG.</p>
<h3>6. Model borrow checking and Polonius in a-mir-formality</h3>
<p>The Types team is building a model of Rust's MIR and trait system called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/a-mir-formality"><code>a-mir-formality</code></a>. Once it reaches a sufficiently complete status, the intent is that the model will always be extended to cover new language features prior to stabilization. We are therefore working to add Polonius into the model. This will in fact be the second time doing such modeling, as we already added Polonius to a previous incarnation of a-mir-formality. In fact, that modeling work is what gave us the insights that enabled the location-insensitive Polonius formulation now landing on nightly.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this work is completely independent of rustc, and could in theory be started soon, and done in parallel with the other efforts.</p>
<h3>7. Location-sensitive pass stable</h3>
<p>In this milestone, we expect a lot of work on optimizations, and productization.</p>
<p>If a similar experience to NLLs in edition 2018 is to be expected again, another substantial amount of work and polish will also be needed to handle diagnostic differences and issues, ensuring errors and notes are clear enough, as well as the documentation.</p>
<p>At this point, the location-sensitive pass is hopefully efficient enough, tested in practice, somewhat formally verified, and can be enabled in edition 2024.</p>
<p>Around this time, librarification efforts can also be rebooted, to turn the in-tree Polonius into a library, maybe using <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/729">Stable MIR</a>. This is so that it could be reused elsewhere, for example in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">gccrs</a>, or by researchers working on verification tools (like <a href="https://github.com/model-checking/kani/">kani</a>, <a href="https://github.com/viperproject/prusti-dev/">prusti</a> and <a href="https://github.com/xldenis/creusot">creusot</a>).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>We are very excited to see the plan for Polonius coming into focus. At the moment, as we are still doing foundational work, we are not looking for volunteers or contributors unless they are well versed in the compiler. We do expect that as the project proceeds, there will be more and more need for new contributions. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <h2 id="user-content-speaker-support-in-asahi-linux"><a href="#speaker-support-in-asahi-linux">Speaker support in Asahi Linux</a></h2>
<p>We are progressively enabling speaker support on Asahi Fedora Remix.</p>
<p>Currently supported models:</p>
<ul>
<li>M1 MacBook Air 13" (J313)</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper speaker support has been a multi-year development effort involving many people across all parts of the Linux audio stack. We want to offer the best speaker support of any Linux laptop platform, and that has meant driving Linux desktop audio forward a couple decades so that we can do what is expected of a modern laptop audio subsystem!</p>
<h2 id="user-content-current-state"><a href="#current-state">Current state</a></h2>
<p>We are ready to begin releasing preliminary speaker support to users. Keep in mind that as Asahi Linux is the first desktop Linux platform with integrated advanced speaker DSP, there will likely be bugs. In addition, the DSP profiles will be improved and adjusted over time, and do not represent the absolute best possible results.</p>
<p>Speaker DSP is currently only supported on Fedora Asahi Remix (things are moving fast), however alternative distros should be able to integrate this work relatively painlessly once things settle down (see the section below).</p>
<h2 id="user-content-known-limitations"><a href="#known-limitations">Known limitations</a></h2>
<p>The DSP processing uses too much power, due to limitations of the default scheduler. Uclamp support will be enabled with an upcoming PipeWire release, and it should greatly reduce the power consumption of the DSP processing, even doubling battery life while playing audio in some cases.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-known-bugs"><a href="#known-bugs">Known bugs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>In KDE Plasma, if you toggle mute using the keyboard hotkey while the master volume is set at anything other than 100%, on unmute the speaker volume will be too low. Touching the volume control (or pressing a volume hotkey) will restore the intended volume.</li>
<li>The DSP chain introduces excessive delay, and trailing audio is "buffered" (if you stop playing something and start something else, you get a bit of the end of the first when the second starts).</li>
<li>There is no final limiter/compressor in the current DSP chains (although there is an input compressor), so inputs with content in high-gain regions of the EQ curve might cause distortion or clipping (and speakersafetyd limiting). This is most prominent in the 200Hz region right now. This should not cause damage, but we recommed lowering the volume if you notice the sound is noticeably distorted.</li>
<li>The 13" MacBook Air EQ curve might be a bit harsh on the treble; pending re-calibration with an individually calibrated microphone to confirm/fix.</li>
<li>Bankstown (the "fake bass" plugin) uses a relatively naïve algorithm right now, which doesn't work well for all music.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-content-project-goals"><a href="#project-goals">Project goals</a></h2>
<p>Our DSP profiles aim to provide a balanced sound, with the features that people expect from high-quality laptop/small-speaker audio. In particular, we aim for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A balanced (neutral) tone at moderate listening volumes, with a mostly flat frequency response from a typical listening position</li>
<li>Reasonably high peak volume with acceptable sound degradation (compression, limiting, etc.)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_fundamental#Audio_processing_applications" rel="nofollow">"Fake bass" processing</a> to make audible frequencies that cannot be physically reproduced by the speakers, extending the perceived frequency response of the system.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour" rel="nofollow">Equal-loudness volume compensation</a>, so that the sound does not become noticeably tinny as the system master volume is lowered.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all techniques that are in wide use in consumer microspeaker systems in tablets and phones, though sadly not common on laptops from most non-Apple brands. All of these processing tricks are also used by macOS.</p>
<p>Our goal is explicitly <em>not</em> to clone the full/exact macOS audio experience. We consider the macOS speaker DSP processing to be too tryhard; some of the things it does work well, some do not (or are outright buggy!), and some are just strange. Although audio is ultimately subjective, and we recognize that some people might prefer the "macOS sound", we aim for a more objectively neutral and balanced sound than macOS as a baseline. Users are encouraged to try adding their own effects (e.g. with EasyEffects) if they want to customize their experience and achieve certain sonic profiles. We believe that a balanced baseline that allows users to shape the sound to their own preference if they so desire is a better option than hard-coding specific effects (such as macOS' spatial audio processing) with no option to turn them off. There is no user-friendly (GUI) way to modify or tweak our DSP chains, so it's best if additional effects are left to existing utilities like EasyEffects that can be easily customized by the user.</p>
<p>That said, for the types of processing we <em>do</em> intend to apply, failing to work properly where macOS does (e.g. objectively bad audio quality for certain kinds of inputs in particular, such as bad-sounding compression or distortion at high volumes where macOS sounds better at an equal output volume) is considered a bug. Feel free to file issues if you find test cases where macOS does a clearly better job. We're particularly talking about program-dependent problems here, not "I like the macOS EQ/spatial/whatever stuff better in general".</p>
<h2 id="user-content-smart-amp--safety-support"><a href="#smart-amp--safety-support">"Smart Amp" / safety support</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the DSP processing, we also have the world's first (as far as we know) open source "smart amp" implementation. This allows the speakers to be driven to much higher peak levels than the worst-case safe volume level, greatly extending their dynamic range. Our implementation, <a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/speakersafetyd">speakersafetyd</a>, monitors feedback signals from the amplifiers, estimates speaker voice coil temperature using a two-stage thermal model, and reduces the hardware speaker volumes when the speakers get too warm. We also have kernel-side interlocks to disable or limit speaker volumes if speakersafetyd is not running or non-responsive.</p>
<p>Right now, we are shipping with a hard volume reduction limit of -7dBFS to catch potential bugs or misbehavior. If you notice that your speakers cut off for approximately one second and then come back at a reduced volume level, it is likely that you triggered this safety limit. Stop playback to let the speakers cool down (just in case) and let the limit re-arm, and then check <code>/var/lib/speakersafetyd/blackbox</code> for any blackbox dumps and <a href="">file a bug</a> attaching them together with any speakersafetyd logs (try <code>journalctl -S '10m ago' -u speakersafetyd</code>). If you play full-scale test tones or "extreme" music at maximum volume, it is expected that you will hit this limit and trigger a blackbox dump / panic. This is intended to help catch any badness while playing normal music, and we will remove this conservative limit once we are confident in the software stack (speakersafetyd has other safety limits built in and will gain more over time).</p>
<p>You can watch speakersafetyd in action by using <code>sudo journalctl -fu speakersafetyd</code>. As a rule of thumb, with the speaker volume at max, you should expect speakersafetyd not to kick in when playing loudness-normalized music (e.g. YouTube). Playing overly loud music without normalization (e.g. increasing the browser app volume to 100% in the Plasma applet while using YouTube, which bypasses the normalization limit it applies, or using media players without normalization) is likely to trigger some gain reduction from speakersafetyd, but it should not hit the -7 dB panic limit unless it's something <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6uvGw7zcCyMzYKKqXp9D3z" rel="nofollow">ridiculous</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Speaker safety models have yet to be fully validated on all models. We are enabling audio only on models where we are confident things are ready and safe to use. If you use any undocumented overrides to force-enable speakers on any other machine models, <strong>you are entirely on your own</strong> and may very well blow up your speakers.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-distro-integration-notes"><a href="#distro-integration-notes">Distro integration notes</a></h2>
<p>You need:</p>
<ul>
<li>The latest Asahi kernel (tag asahi-6.5-25 or later)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/AsahiLinux/alsa-ucm-conf-asahi">alsa-ucm-conf-asahi</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/asahilinux/asahi-audio">asahi-audio</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/asahilinux/speakersafetyd">speakersafetyd</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/chadmed/bankstown/">bankstown</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://lsp-plug.in/" rel="nofollow">LSP plug-ins</a> (LV2 version)</li>
<li>PipeWire 0.3.84. Depending on your packaging rules, you might need your package to create a few empty directories (see <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/pipewire/commits/rawhide" rel="nofollow">here</a>) so <code>asahi-audio</code> can put files there.</li>
<li>PipeWire <code>module-filter-chain-lv2</code> (this may be a separate package or flags depending on distro)</li>
<li>WirePlumber 0.4.15 with an <a href="https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/merge_requests/558" rel="nofollow">unreleased patch</a>. Please do not enable speakers without that patch, as it'll leave the raw speaker device visible which is confusing and could trigger bugs elsewhere. Either get your WirePlumber package to add the patch, or wait for the next release.</li>
</ul>
<p>The correct deployment order is asahi-audio/speakersafetyd &gt; (whatever you use to get those installed for users, e.g. metapackage) &gt; kernel. If you push the kernel first before asahi-audio, users will get either a nonfunctional (if no speakersafetyd) or functional but bad-sounding (if speakersafetyd is installed) raw speaker device with no DSP.</p>

            <pubDate>Sun, 12 Nov 2023 11:40:22 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://arne.me/articles/archive-your-old-projects">https://arne.me/articles/archive-your-old-projects</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38239358">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article><header></header><p>Yesterday, while looking through a folder called <em>old things lol glhf</em>, I fell
into a rabbit hole of old abandoned projects—mostly websites and graphic
design, but I also found one or two Flash<sup><a href="#fn-1" id="fnref-1" data-footnote-ref="">1</a></sup> projects and compiled <code>.exe</code>
files<sup><a href="#fn-2" id="fnref-2" data-footnote-ref="">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>And, while it was really fun remembering projects I’ve long forgotten, there
was no structure, and it was often difficult to figure out what a project did
and what it looked like—some even missed crucial data.
This made me think about how I want to archive my projects going forward.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is my new strategy:</p>
<h2>Leave it online</h2>
<p>If the project is on the web, doesn’t require maintenance and doesn’t cost you
money, leave it online.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you’ll need to move to a different domain, for example when re-doing
a website.
When talking to <a href="https://flbn.sh/">Ollie</a> about this, he told me that some people
leave their old websites online at <code>&lt;year&gt;.&lt;domain&gt;</code> and I love that idea<sup><a href="#fn-3" id="fnref-3" data-footnote-ref="">3</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can look up old content and redirect links, so your
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">URIs stay cool</a>.
And in ten years it’ll probably still be online.</p>
<h2>Archive it</h2>
<p>If you can’t leave it online, save it to your file system.
You don’t have to go all <a href="https://johnnydecimal.com/">Johnny.Decimal</a>, but at
least create a dedicated folder and subfolders for every year.</p>
<p>But instead of just copying your project to the archive folder and be done with
it, consider these points to make life easier for your future self:</p>
<dl><dt>Make screenshots</dt>
<dd>
<p>Having a screenshot allows you to relive your memories more easily without
going through the hassle of setting up a project.
If you want to go the extra mile, do a screen recording showcasing your
project—this has the bonus effect of hearing your voice from years ago, and it
has more context.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Add a README</dt>
<dd>
<p>Explain what the project did, when it was created and abandoned, who
contributed and how to get it running again.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Back up the database</dt>
<dd>
<p>Some of my projects are missing a database dump, so all the actual content is
gone. Run <code>sqldump</code> or whatever export functionality your database supports
and add it next to your files.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Keep generated assets</dt>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content-parent"><p>Just a heads up, this article is written from a strong perspective on privacy, autonomy, and financial freedom (with a focus on data mining, AI, and the future). If you prefer less opinionated pieces, you may want to skip this one. However, if you are open to a civil discussion about these topics, you are always welcome to comment.</p>
<p>Imagine a world, where everything and anything you purchase is tightly regulated by a governing entity. If you want to purchase a product – it has to follow <em>extreme rules and regulations</em> to be viable for purchase. If it does not follow regulations, you have no physical way of actually buying it (or for it to exist). Now imagine this entity is constantly changing and updating its regulations, allowing the market to be ruled by one specific brand because it is the only brand that follows the exact rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Think about the implications of such a reality, every decision you make will have to comply with these entities’ agenda, and since those entities mostly care about their profits, you will essentially have no freedom of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds like a dystopian fantasy right?</strong></p>
<p>This is the world we are heading into in the next two to three decades, and that is why it is critically important you understand the importance of physical cash in a free, functioning and technical society.</p>
<p>You have probably noticed the global trend that is making it harder and harder for us to use cash in our daily lives. In my home country, you cannot use cash to pay for certain goods and services (credit only). Coincidentally (or not) these goods and services are often controlled by, or directly attached or affiliated with a governing entity. There is also a risk of criminal charges for business owners willing to accept more than a certain amount of cash from a client, and it is illegal to hold more than a certain amount of cash in your possession, at all times.</p>
<p>This global trend is being pushed relentlessly which is why it is important to understand what the absence of cash truly means for us, the people.</p>
<p>Our world is functioning on exchangeable currencies, this was the way humans operated from the beginning of time. The actual currency and methods of payment changed over the years – if you go back long enough, you will notice we have used barter systems that exchanged goods and services for other goods and services. Throughout history, we have used rare gems like diamonds, rubies and sapphires – which are a finite natural resource. We have also used precious metals like gold and silver – which are also finite, and therefore – hold value.</p>
<p>Crypto currencies are another example of finite currencies (depending on each protocol), and therefore they hold value. However, in the past couple of years, I began to see signs that the crypto market is also being controlled and manipulated. So crypto-currencies are not a viable solution to the issue this article is about (they are just an example of a finite currency).</p>
<p><strong>Notice the trend – throughout history, currencies have always held some sort of real-life bound value, that is finite.</strong></p>
<p>Before 1971, the US dollar was tied to gold, meaning its value was derived from the gold “stock” (which is a finite resource), therefore – the US dollar held a realistic value up until 1971. In 1971, the United States declared that they were abandoning the gold-tied US dollar, and it is now a fiat currency.</p>
<h3 id="heading-what-are-fiat-currencies-and-why-does-any-of-this-matter">What are fiat currencies and why does any of this matter?</h3>
<p>A fiat currency is a currency that holds no real-life value besides the fact that a governing entity says so. Gold is a finite resource because we know that there is a limit to the amount of gold on the planet, therefore it’s valuable. Fiat currency, on the other hand, holds value just because a governing entity is endorsing it.</p>
<p>Derived from this, we know that the same entities can also decide what sort of value the fiat holds, which can be easily manipulated by adding to the circulation to dilute the value (money printer goes BRRR). Or improve the confidence of its users in its stability through mass media, to raise its value.</p>
<p>The more people trust these entities, the more value the fiat currency holds. An excellent example of how mass media used to influence whole nations for a specific agenda would be the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and there are many others.</p>
<p><strong>By their nature, fiat currencies are manipulatable.</strong></p>

<h3 id="heading-so-what-is-the-problem-with-a-cashless-society">So, what is the problem with a cashless society?</h3>
<p>You are probably thinking “What is the problem? Carrying around cash is messy and uncomfortable. I much rather use my card anyway”. I hope you change your mind after you are done reading this article, you must understand that you should not give up freedom for comfort.</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about the obvious reasons cash is important for our society.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> having your physical cash is important for your financial freedom, the fact you can spend, store, invest or do whatever you want with your hard-earned money without interference is crucial for your well-being. If you want to buy anything (within your rights as a human being) you should be able to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Control:</strong> Owning physical cash means you will never be bound by banks or entities that usually want to limit, influence or pinpoint your financial actions and decisions.</p>
<p>I will give the tiniest example from my personal life - these past few weeks a dear family member has been trying to take out a sum of money from their bank in the form of cash. However, they very quickly encountered irrelevant and overblown bureaucracy (even though it was their money). This prevented them from withdrawing the money until they complied with certain regulations that the bank required them to comply with.</p>
<p>Therefore, they currently have no control over their own money until they comply with the bank's unrealistic demands (which means, they don’t even own their own money that is deposited in the bank – their ownership is essentially an illusion).</p>
<p><strong>Legal Grey Market:</strong> This ties to the same concept of “control” and holds the same importance. A healthy economy consists of trading between two (or more) individuals without a middleman. For an economy to flourish, we must enable ordinary people like you and I, to trade between themselves, and keep the circulation of money going around.</p>
<p>If you are selling a vintage Gameboy DMG in pristine condition with the original Pokémon games that your dad bought you 30 years ago - I should be able to pay you $150 (or whatever price we both agree on) without anyone taking a chunk off that transaction, or even knowing it happened. Note that your father already paid his taxes for the transaction when he purchased the Gameboy, 30 years ago.</p>
<p>A healthy, legal grey market keeps the cash circulation going because ordinary people who are not businesses or legal entities can trade between themselves, not having to worry about additional taxes or privacy issues (data mining).</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that if society went completely cashless, we would be solely dependent on a software system – which (I am sure we can all agree) are all just sand castles riddled with bugs and potential exploits, waiting for a wave big enough to wash them away (or raise a critical bug alert on a Friday night).</p>
<p>Just a pessimistic thought away, these governing entities might be able to block you, your family and your friends from purchasing or accessing goods and services, since they control the only method of payment (take a look at China’s social credit system).</p>
<p>Another issue with being completely dependent on software is that during a catastrophic event that tears down or renders our infrastructure useless, it is safe to assume you will not have access to your money (which is crucial for your survival and well-being).</p>
<h3 id="heading-okay-physical-cash-is-important-for-financial-freedom-but-is-it-the-end-of-the-world-if-our-cash-just-went-digital-isnt-that-the-natural-course-of-things-in-our-technological-society">Okay, physical cash is important for financial freedom, but is it the end of the world if our cash just went digital? Isn’t that the natural course of things in our technological society?</h3>
<p>Great question, glad you asked, but there is more to it! Living in a world where all of your transactions and microtransactions are controlled, and monitored – practically means that you live in a world where you have no control over your actions. It is a world where every move you make is recorded, processed and sent to multiple systems for reference and collection.</p>
<p>Our society is only functioning because of the control (autonomy) we have over our (financial) actions and decisions. It is crucial to maintain the financial status quo (or even better, get rid of fiat entirely) and give as much control as possible to the people, not to corporations, banks or governing entities.</p>
<p>With the modern rise of the World Wide Web, corporations and the like understood that the most valuable currency out there is… data! The reason that services like WhatsApp, Facebook or Twitter are free, is because your data is the product up for sale. Your data, my data, essentially all of our data is being processed and sold from entity A to entity B to entity C and then back to entity A and all over again.</p>
<h3 id="heading-what-is-the-goal-of-such-extensive-data-mining-and-processing">What is the goal of such extensive data mining and processing?</h3>
<p>I believe that with great power comes great responsibility, but the ones in power forgot all about the responsibility part. The goal of our society going cashless is for these governing entities to own more data, and therefore establish their powerful (rich) position in a digital era.</p>
<p>They essentially want to know everything about you (down to the most intrinsic detail). The only problem is that it will most likely be used against you.</p>
<p>Eventually, in years to come, when society will become more and more digital and therefore centralized - In one way or another, subtly or blatantly, you will not fit into the exact template of their perfect citizen. When that happens know that it was this article that tried to warn you.</p>
<p>They will own the data of your transactions, your location history, your daily routines, your hobbies, your diet, your sleep schedule, your sexual orientation, your health conditions and more.</p>
<p>All of this information and more can be withdrawn from your transactional history, and it’s all done automatically using sophisticated software and AI.</p>
<h3 id="heading-and-now-for-the-technical-part-data-mining-and-analysis">And now for the technical part - data mining and analysis</h3>
<p>I took some time to come up with a simple example of a made-up transaction list and the information that can be withdrawn from it (presented in a fun and colorful graph display).</p>
<p>Take a look at how much information can be extracted about a single person from his or her transactional history over the imaginary course of just three days. I am not a data engineer – this is just a tiny example of how it is possible to extract data on you based on your transactions and interactions. The concept is that as data is collected, the algorithm builds a graph of your traits as a person. The more nodes (data) the algorithm has, the more accurate its idea (or “image”) of your persona, of who you are.</p>
<p>The same approach is used by social media companies to show you targeted advertisements, and present content that will appeal to you (or piss you off), and make you spend more time engaging with the platform.</p>
<p>Take a look at the color of the transaction and the nodes withdrawn from that transaction. The optional nodes (marked with a ?) are not conclusive and will be made conclusive, narrowed down or expanded when more data is presented to the algorithm.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699545856694/8a7b3119-2c64-48e9-bffc-1730452dc58a.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1699545879498/2618648c-529f-4e7e-9f60-c96d446b1508.png?auto=compress,format&amp;format=webp" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, from a made-up list of eight transactions, It took me 20 minutes to analyze and extract 17 nodes that now make up the persona of that specific person. Just imagine how much information can be extracted from a thousand transactions over many years.</p>
<h3 id="heading-lets-use-ai">Let's use AI!</h3>
<p>I was interested to see what the publicly available ChatGPT (GPT 3.5) has to say about my made-up transaction list. Here is the transcript of my conversation with the free-to-use and publicly available AI that <em>was not designed for this purpose</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Prompt</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will give you a list of made-up transactions. You will act as the most sophisticated and talented data engineer on the planet and extract as much data as possible about the person who made the transactions in my made-up list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Response</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the most sophisticated and talented data engineer, I will extract as much data as possible from the list of made-up transactions to gain insights into the person who made these transactions. Here's what I can infer from the data:</p>
<p>Transaction Pattern:</p>
<p>The person made a series of transactions over a span of a few days. There are two transactions on 27th July 2023, three transactions on 28th July 2023, and two transactions on 29th July 2023. This pattern suggests they are active in spending and might have a regular daily routine.</p>
<p>Transaction Locations:</p>
<p>Coffee Mill: The person visited this place on 27th July at 09:23 AM.</p>
<p>Kyoto Sushi Palace: The person visited this place on 27th July at 14:09 PM.</p>
<p>Someville Train Station: The person visited this place on 28th July at 09:55 AM.</p>
<p>Mon Cheri Jewells: The person visited this place on 28th July at 11:43 AM.</p>
<p>Someville Coffee Hut: The person visited this place on 28th July at 15:23 PM.</p>
<p>Animal Supply Shop: The person visited this place on 28th July at 18:12 PM.</p>
<p>Downtown Pharmacy: The person visited this place on 29th July at 10:27 AM.</p>
<p>Apple Store: The person visited this place on 29th July at 12:18 PM.</p>
<p>Spending Behavior: The person spends varying amounts on different transactions. For example, they spent $119 at Mon Cheri Jewells, which indicates they might be buying jewelry or expensive items occasionally.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they made small transactions at Someville Coffee Hut ($6) and Coffee Mill ($15.2), suggesting they are regular coffee drinkers.</p>
<p>The person also spent a relatively higher amount at the Apple Store ($90), which could indicate a tech enthusiast or someone purchasing electronic devices.</p>
<p>Time of Transactions: The person made transactions at various times of the day, ranging from morning (09:23 AM) to evening (18:12 PM). This indicates they are active throughout the day and might have a flexible schedule.</p>
<p>Location Preferences: The person seems to be spending time at various places, including restaurants (Kyoto Sushi Palace), coffee shops (Coffee Mill, Someville Coffee Hut), and shopping locations (Mon Cheri Jewells, Animal Supply Shop, Downtown Pharmacy, Apple Store). This suggests they have diverse interests and might enjoy exploring different places.</p>
<p>Potential Interests: Based on the locations they visited, the person could be interested in fashion (Mon Cheri Jewells), tech gadgets (Apple Store), and pets (Animal Supply Shop).</p>
<p>Geographical Location: The data mentions names of locations such as Someville, indicating that the person might reside or frequently visit this area. However, the specific geographical location is not provided.</p>
<p>It's important to note that this analysis is purely speculative and based on the limited data provided. To draw more accurate and detailed conclusions about the person, additional data and context would be required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, both I and GPT came to very similar conclusions. Imagine what is already possible today with sophisticated models far more capable than GPT 3.5, models that were designed to create personas based on such information (It’s scary to think about).</p>
<h3 id="heading-conclusion-just-use-cash">Conclusion - Just use cash!</h3>
<p>With the emerging “Internet of Things”, where every aspect of your life will be connected to the cloud – every single aspect of your life will eventually be monitored, processed and sold as data. If such entities record and process every single transaction and interaction you make, after a relatively short period – they will know everything there is to know about you.</p>
<p>This article is not meant to scare you about the future, it is just meant to make you aware of the current situation, of the importance of your data, and of the importance of cash in a free and functioning society.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: Just use cash! Whenever you can, wherever you can. Endorse the use of cash and do not promote businesses that exclusively rely on credit. If you come across a business that refuses cash, point them to this article and kindly let them know that the use of cash is beneficial for all of us.</p>
