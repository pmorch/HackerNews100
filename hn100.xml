<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was going through the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.12.html">release notes</a> of the new Python 3.12 version the other day, and one item caught my attention in the deprecations section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>datetime.datetime</code>’s <code>utcnow()</code> and <code>utcfromtimestamp()</code> are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have followed my web development tutorials you must have seen me use <code>utcnow()</code> a lot, so I will clearly need to re-train myself to use an alternative, in preparation for the eventual removal of this function (likely a few years out, so no need to panic!).</p>
<p>In this short article I'll tell you more about why these functions are getting the axe, and what to replace them with.</p>
<h2>What's Wrong with utcnow() and utcfromtimestamp()?</h2>
<p>The problem that the Python maintainers have found comes from the fact that these functions return <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#aware-and-naive-objects">"naive" datetime objects</a>. A naive <code>datetime</code> object is one that does not have a timezone, which means that it can only be used in a context where the timezone does not matter or is already known in advance. This is in contrast to "aware" <code>datetime</code> objects, which do have a timezone attached to them explicitly.</p>
<p>If you ask me, I think the names of these functions are misleading. A function that is called <code>utcnow()</code> should be expected to return UTC datetimes, as implied by the name. I would have made it more clear that these functions work with naive time, maybe by calling them <code>naive_utcnow()</code> and <code>naive_utcfromtimestamp()</code>.</p>
<p>But their names are not the problem here. The specific issue is that some Python date and time functions accept naive timestamps and assume that they represent local time, according to the timezone that is configured on the computer running the code. There is a <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/81669">GitHub issue from 2019</a> that provides some background into this, with the following example:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt
datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1, 0, 0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; dt.timestamp()
18000
</code></pre>
<p>The example above was executed on a computer that was configured for Eastern Standard Time (EST). First, <code>dt</code> is assigned a naive <code>datetime</code> that is converted from the "zero" time or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">UNIX epoch</a>, which is January 1st, 1970 at midnight.</p>
<p>When this object is converted back to a timestamp, the <code>dt.timestamp()</code> method finds that it does not have a timezone to use in the conversion, so it uses the computer's own timezone, which in this example was EST (note that the EST timezone is 5 hours, or 18,000 seconds behind UTC). So we have a UNIX timestamp that originated as midnight on January 1st, 1970, and after being converted to a <code>datetime</code> and back ends up as 5 am.</p>
<p>If you read the issue linked above, they suggest that this ambiguity did not exist in Python 2 and for that reason this was not a problem for a long time, but it now is and needs to be addressed. This sounded strange, so I had to go and check, and sure enough, the <code>timestamp()</code> method that returns the incorrect UNIX time in the example was introduced in Python 3.3 and nothing similar appears to have existed back in Python 2 times.</p>
<p>So basically, at some point they've added a <code>datetime.timestamp()</code> method (and possibly others as well) that accept both aware and naive datetimes and this was a mistake, because these methods must have a timezone to work.</p>
<p>These methods should have been designed to fail when a naive <code>datetime</code> object is passed to them, but for some strange reason they decided that when a timezone is not provided the timezone from the system should be used. This is really the bug, but instead of fixing the broken implementations of these methods they are now trying to force people to move to aware datetimes by deprecating the two main functions that generate naive ones. They think that because a few functions assume that naive timestamps represent local times, all naive uses that are not in local time should be discouraged.</p>
<p>I may be missing something here, but I don't really follow this logic.</p>
<h2>Do We Need Naive Datetimes Anyway?</h2>
<p>To me it is clear that the Python maintainers behind this deprecation have a problem with naive datetimes and are using this supposed problem as an excuse to cripple them.</p>
<p>So why would you want to work with naive datetimes in the first place?</p>
<p>An application may be designed in such a way that all dates and times are in a single timezone that is known in advance. In this case there is no need for individual <code>datetime</code> instances to carry their own timezones, since this uses more memory and processing power for no benefit, since all these timezones would be the same and it would never be necessary to perform timezone math or conversions.</p>
<p>This is actually very common in web applications or other types of networking servers, which are configured with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">UTC</a> time and normalize all dates and times to this timezone when they enter the system. It is also a best practice to store naive datetimes representing UTC in databases. The <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/stable/core/type_basics.html#sqlalchemy.types.DateTime">DateTime</a> type in SQLAlchemy represents a naive <code>datetime</code> object by default, for example. This is such a common database pattern that SQLAlchemy provides a <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/core/custom_types.html#store-timezone-aware-timestamps-as-timezone-naive-utc">recipe</a> for applications that use aware <code>datetime</code> objects to convert these to and from naive ones on the fly as they are saved to or loaded from the database.</p>
<p>So yes, I expect naive <code>datetime</code> objects will continue to be used, in spite of these deprecations.</p>
<h2>Updating Your Code</h2>
<p>Even though the deprecations are disappointing, it is important to keep in mind that it may take a few years for the functions to actually be removed. The problem is that once you switch to Python 3.12 or newer you will start seeing deprecation messages on your console and your logs, and these can get annoying. Here is an example of what you can expect to see:</p>
<pre><code>$ python
Python 3.12.0 (main, Oct  5 2023, 10:46:39) [GCC 11.4.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; from datetime import datetime
&gt;&gt;&gt; datetime.utcnow()
&lt;stdin&gt;:1: DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() is deprecated and scheduled for removal in a future version. Use timezone-aware objects to represent datetimes in UTC: datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC).
datetime.datetime(2023, 11, 18, 11, 22, 54, 263206)
</code></pre>
<p>I'm only using Python 3.12 in a small number of projects, and I'm already tired of seeing these warnings. So let's go ahead and look at how these two functions can be replaced.</p>
<p>The advice from the Python maintainers is to switch to aware <code>datetime</code> objects. The deprecation warning provides a hint of what they think we should use, and the deprecation notices included in the documentation are even more specific. Here is what the notice for the <code>utcnow()</code> function says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecated since version 3.12: Use <code>datetime.now()</code> with <code>UTC</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below you can see the one for <code>utcfromtimestamp()</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deprecated since version 3.12: Use <code>datetime.fromtimestamp()</code> with <code>UTC</code> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this gives us an idea of what can be done. Here are my custom versions of the deprecated functions, with the additional option to choose between aware or naive implementations:</p>
<pre><code>from datetime import datetime, timezone

def aware_utcnow():
    return datetime.now(timezone.utc)

def aware_utcfromtimestamp(timestamp):
    return datetime.fromtimestamp(timestamp, timezone.utc)

def naive_utcnow():
    return aware_utcnow().replace(tzinfo=None)

def naive_utcfromtimestamp(timestamp):
    return aware_utcfromtimestamp(timestamp).replace(tzinfo=None)

print(aware_utcnow())
print(aware_utcfromtimestamp(0))
print(naive_utcnow())
print(naive_utcfromtimestamp(0))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you are using Python 3.11 or newer, you can replace <code>datetime.timezone.utc</code> with a shorter <code>datetime.UTC</code>.</p>
<p>Running this script I get the following results:</p>
<pre><code>2023-11-18 11:36:35.137639+00:00
1970-01-01 00:00:00+00:00
2023-11-18 11:36:35.137672
1970-01-01 00:00:00
</code></pre>
<p>You can tell that the first and second lines show aware <code>datetime</code> instances from the <code>+00:00</code> suffix that indicates that the timezone is 00:00 or UTC. The third and fourth lines show abstract timestamps without a timezone, fully compatible with those returned by the deprecated functions.</p>
<p>What I like about these implementations is that they give you the choice to work with or without timezones, removing any ambiguity. Explicit is better than implicit, as <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">the old adage</a> says.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				<p id="speakable-summary">This morning at Scaleway’s <a href="https://www.ai-pulse.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ai-PULSE conference</a>, French billionaire and Iliad CEO Xavier Niel gave some extra details about <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/french-billionaire-xavier-niel-pledges-to-invest-up-to-210-million-in-ai/">his plans</a> for an AI research lab based in Paris.</p>
<p>This new lab, called <a href="http://kyutai.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kyutai</a>, will be a privately funded nonprofit working on artificial general intelligence. It will work with PhD students, postdocs and researchers on research papers and open source projects. When Iliad originally unveiled this research lab, the firm said that Niel was committing €100 million to this project ($109 million at today’s exchange rate).</p>
<p>“Thanks to some amazing friends who are there today, now we are close to €300 million for the financing of this initiative,” Niel said at the conference. Among those “friends” is another French billionaire, Rodolphe Saadé, the CEO of French shipping and logistics giant CMA CGM, who is putting €100 million too. There are other smaller contributors, such as Eric Schmidt’s foundation and some unnamed donators.</p>
<p>This is just a starting point, as Kyutai is open to more donations. “What’s interesting with so many journalists in the room is that the project will potentially interest other investors,” Saadé said at a press conference after the announcement.</p>
<p>As Kyutai will work on foundational models, they will also need some compute power. The good news is that Scaleway, the cloud division of Iliad, recently acquired a thousand Nvidia H100 GPUs. These top-of-the-line GPUs are essential for inference and model training and will be available at cost for Kyutai.</p>
<p>Kyutai has already started hiring for its core scientific team. Six men took the stage this morning to talk about their previous work and what they have in mind for the research lab — Patrick Perez, Edouard Grave, Hervé Jegou, Laurent Mazaré, Neil Zeghidour and Alexandre Defossez. They previously worked for Meta’s AI research team FAIR, Google’s DeepMind division, Inria, etc.</p>
<p>Patrick Perez, who previously worked for Valeo, is going to be the director of the research lab. Kyutai has also put together a team of scientific advisors who are well-known AI researchers — Yejin Choi, Yann LeCun and Bernhard Schölkopf. They will just check everyone’s work once or twice a year and give feedback.</p>
<p>One of the reasons Kyutai thinks it can convince some researchers to join its lab is that researchers will be able to publish research papers.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, big tech companies tolerate scientific publications less and less. Beyond the ego boost for researchers, it helps to advance research and contribute to the common good,” Niel said during the press conference.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first open AI research lab. OpenAI, as the name still indicates, started as a nonprofit. But things changed drastically after Sam Altman started working full time on OpenAI in 2019. OpenAI moved to a more traditional corporate structure and raised funding from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Other companies have also been working on open source foundational models, such as Meta with its <a href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Llama model</a> and <a href="https://mistral.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mistral AI</a>. Kyutai’s models will be open source too, but the researchers describe their work as open science. They plan to release open source models, but also the training source code and data that explain how they released these models.</p>
<p>“When it comes to the timeline, I don’t think our aim is necessarily to go as fast as Mistral, because our ambition is to provide a scientific purpose, an understanding and a code base to explain the results,” Defossez said at the press conference. But they expect to have something to share within a year.</p>
<p>Mazaré, another researcher from Kyutai’s team, still described <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/27/mistral-ai-makes-its-first-large-language-model-free-for-everyone/">Mistral AI’s first open source model</a> as a success because many community members have been fine-tuning it and exploring use cases based on the Mistral 7B model.</p>
<p>It’s also going to be interesting to see if a research lab is more efficient at releasing foundational models compared to private companies, and how private companies are going to leverage Kyutai’s work for commercial applications.</p>

<p>“I’m also a strong believer in open source, and we need to turn it into a French asset,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in a prerecorded video message at the conference.</p>
<h2>France’s position: Regulating use cases, not models</h2>
<p>Macron also used this opportunity to define and defend France’s position on Europe’s AI Act, saying that use cases should be regulated, not model makers. France has been pushing to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/14/eu-ai-act-trilogue-crunch/">water down the AI Act</a> in trilogues (a trilogue is a negotiation between Europe’s three main instances, the Parliament, the Commission and the Council).</p>
<p>“Regulation is not the enemy of innovation, quite the contrary. It’s not a question of defining good models, but we need to ensure that the services made available to our citizens are safe for them, for other economic players and for our democracy,” Macron said.</p>
<p>“With work on the European regulation for artificial intelligence currently in ‘trilogues,’ regulation must be controlled and not punitive, to preserve innovation and regulate usage rather than technology as such,” he added.</p>
<p>Niel basically sided with France’s position on this topic during the press conference. According to him, Europe is lagging behind when it comes to AI innovation, and regulation will slow down European newcomers and diminish the chances of them catching up.</p>
<p>“For the time being we’re more in the innovation part than the regulation part. Creating regulation means it creates barriers to competitors,” Niel said.</p>
<p>Maybe if French AI companies become massively successful, things could change. “I’d love it if one day we could talk about French imperialism in AI,” Niel added later in the conversation.</p>

We extend the work of Moskvichev et al.

Tinker a bit around with it. Then use that instance to authenticate yourself somewhere, i.e. another service where you can set up your own oauth provider. Take a look at  the API requests, take a look the code of some OAuth implementation, for example in projects like Gitea, Nextcloud.</p><p>May not be it for everyone, though I really like learning by doing.

(One nice thing about Azure Active Directory is that it supports OAuth2 integrations so if you understand and can implement OAuth2 then you can also implement AD).<p>I know it’s not a linear learning answer but hope it helps you perhaps later. Good luck!

I read and reference the 2019 edition; don't have the 2023 edition but expect it is just as good: <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8261-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4842-8261-8</a></p><p>* OAuth2 In Action walks you through building an OAuth2 server from scratch (in JavaScript). You'll learn about the fundamentals of tokens, clients, registration, and more. Very accessible. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.manning.com/books/oauth-2-in-action</a></p><p>* The Security Engineering Handbook is great for foundational security knowledge, like 'What does a hash look like, and what makes a good hashing algorithm' as well as a lot of broader security topics: <a href="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/book.html</a></p><p>* FusionAuth's vendor neutral articles: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/articles/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fusionauth.io/articles/</a> . I'd especially call out these two: The Modern Guide to OAuth, which walks through the multiple different ways the OAuth 2 authorization framework can be used: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/oauth/modern-guide-to-oauth" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/oauth/modern-guide...</a> (previous HN discussion: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29752918">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29752918</a> ), and the Math of Password Hashing: <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/security/math-of-password-hashing-algorithms-entropy" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/security/math-of-p...</a></p><p>* The Beer Drinkers Guide to SAML is a great resource for understanding this (still) critical standard, plus just a fun read: <a href="https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml</a></p><p>* The RFCs and BCPs (as mentioned). I've also learned a lot by lurking on the OAuth mailing list, which is freely available: <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/oauth/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/oauth/</a></p><p>* The Identity Unlocked podcast with  Vittorio Bertocci  (RIP). This is not about the basics at all, but is a deeper dive into the dev focused side of authentication, and will give you great pointers for more reading: <a href="https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://identityunlocked.auth0.com/</a></p><p>* The OWASP guides are good but specialized. See for example: <a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa2-broken-authentication/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa2-broken-...</a></p><p>* I have a substack where I talk about aspects of customer identity and access management that I think is pretty good :) : <a href="https://ciamweekly.substack.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://ciamweekly.substack.com/</a></p><p>I think this would be a great linkedin learning, udacity or coursera course, but didn't see anything when I searched there. I've put together courses before and it's a ton of work, but hmmm, maybe it'd be fun to do for this topic.</p><p>Edit: corrected spelling of Vittorio Bertocci's name.

It's all actually pretty simple, and very little complexity. However, there are so many "gotchas" (that can result in zero security) that anyone writing a guide like this would probably have you sign a waiver, then any company you work for sign a waiver, and include your firstborn child.<p>For example, user/pass is pretty simple on the surface:</p><p>1. app sends server user/password.</p><p>2. check if it matches the password in the database.</p><p>3. if so, respond with a token the app can send back that is associated with the user. if not, return with a 401.</p><p>The number of gotchas in this simple 3-step process is insane... here's some off the top of my head (not exhaustive):</p><p>- make sure the login form includes a CSRF token.</p><p>- do not store the password in plaintext in the db. or encrypted, probably. Since an attacker can possibly get the encryption key and then decrypt all your passwords. Use strong, slow hashes.</p><p>- rate limit your logins to prevent brute-forcing (slow hashes work great here)</p><p>- use constant-time comparisons to check if the password matches (e.g., hash_equals() in PHP), RTFM for whatever constant time check you are using or you will open yourself up to timing attacks.</p><p>That's the issue with security stuff, there are so many gotchas that anyone writing a course would open themselves up to getting sued (at least in the US) just for missing a gotcha or someone with Dunning-Kruger thinking they know everything and getting hacked ... it's too risky. You have to just get into the industry and learn it the hard way. At least that's how I learned everything I learned.

But it's a critique of a general tendency among programmers to call anything that requires a bit of knowledge and thought beyond the simplest surface level solution "complex" or "insane to implement on your own". It's not. While I know that you're list of gotchas isn't exhaustive, the real list is not so much longer that it's not perfectly reasonable to expect someone to be able to implement it correctly.<p>I say that as someone who was on the "receiving end" of this kind of advice for years btw. I always thought that the things that are "better left to libraries" are really arcane and impossible to understand, which only lead to confusion and an inability to truly assess options. And it's really just a matter of semantics and framing. It would be perfectly reasonable to say "it's not complex as long as you keep this reasonably long list of gotchas in mind".

I was trying to say why you can't really find a guide like the post is asking for (at least for free!) and it likely has a lot to do with liability and things like that.<p>I was trying to say exactly what you are saying, and that is just get in there and learn. It isn't that complex to implement this stuff yourself if you need to. I've implemented this stuff myself dozens of times over the years... but I try to use a library before implementing it myself. Interestingly, over the years, I've reviewed libraries and found bugs in them. So, do read the code of the library you're using. Once you've reviewed a few of them (and implemented it yourself a few times), you kinda get an idea of what to look for.

They don’t need to argue that something is false. They just need to show that it’s associated with low status. The converse is also true: You don’t need to argue that something is true. You just need to show that it’s associated with high status. And when low status people express the truth, it sometimes becomes high status to lie.</p><p><span>In the 1980s, the psychologists Richard E. Petty and John T. Cacioppo </span><a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461293781?ref=quillette.com" rel="">developed</a><span> the “Elaboration Likelihood Model” to describe how persuasion works. “Elaboration” here means the extent to which a person carefully thinks about the information. When people’s motivation and ability to engage in careful thinking is present, the “elaboration likelihood” is high. This means people are likely to pay attention to the relevant information and draw conclusions based on the merits of the arguments or the message. When elaboration likelihood is high, a person is willing to expend their cognitive resources to update their views.</span></p><p>The idea is that there are two paths, or two “routes,” to persuading others. The first type, termed the “central” route, comes from careful and thoughtful consideration of the messages we hear. When the central route is engaged, we actively evaluate the information presented, and try to discern whether or not it’s true.</p><p>When the “peripheral” route is engaged, we pay more attention to cues apart from the actual information or content or the message. For example, we might evaluate someone’s argument based on how attractive they are or where they were educated, without considering the actual merits of their message.</p><p>When we accept a message through the peripheral route, we tend to be more passive than when we accept a message through the central route. Unfortunately, the peripheral route is more prevalent because we are exposed to an increasingly large amount of information.</p><p><span>The renowned psychologists Susan Fiske and Shelley Taylor have characterized humans as “cognitive misers.” They </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/socialcognition0002fisk" rel="">write</a><span>, “People are limited in their capacity to process information, so they take shortcuts whenever they can.”</span></p><p>We are lazy creatures who try to expend as little mental energy as possible.</p><p>And people are typically less motivated to scrutinize a message if the source is considered to be an expert. We interpret the message through the peripheral route.</p><p><span>This is one reason why media outlets often appoint experts who mirror their political values. These experts lend credibility to the views the outlet espouses. Interestingly, though, expertise appears to influence persuasion only if the individual is identified as an expert </span><em>before</em><span> they communicate their message. </span><a href="https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/the-persuasive-effects-of-delaying-identification-of-high-and-low?ref=quillette.com" rel="">Research</a><span> has found that when a person is told the source is an expert </span><em>after</em><span> listening to the message, this new information does not increase the person’s likelihood of believing the message.</span></p><p><span>It works the other way, too. If a person is told that a source is not an expert </span><em>before</em><span> the message, the person tends to be more skeptical of the message. If told the source is not an expert </span><em>after</em><span> the message, this has no effect on a person’s likelihood of believing the message.</span></p><p>This suggests that knowing a source is an expert reduces our motivation to engage in central processing. We let our guards down.</p><p>As motivation and/or ability to process arguments is decreased, peripheral cues become more important for persuasion. Which might not bode well.</p><p>However, when we update our beliefs by weighing the actual merits of an argument (central route), our updated beliefs tend to endure and are more robust against counterpersuasion, compared to when we update our beliefs through peripheral processing. If we come to believe something through careful and thoughtful consideration, that belief is more resilient to change.</p><p>This means we can be more easily manipulated through the peripheral route. If we are convinced of something via the peripheral route, a manipulator will be more successful at using the peripheral route once again to alter our initial belief.</p><p>But why does this matter? Because by understanding how and why we come to hold our beliefs, we can better understand ourselves and guard against manipulation.</p><p>The founders of the elaboration likelihood model wrote that, “Ultimately, we suspect that attitudes are seen as correct or proper to the extent that they are viewed as beneficial for the physical or psychological well-being of the person.”</p><p><span>In his book </span><em>The Social Leap</em><span>, the evolutionary psychologist William von Hippel writes, “a substantial reason we evolved such large brains is to navigate our social world… A great deal of the value that exists in the social world is created by consensus rather than discovered in an objective sense… our cognitive machinery evolved to be only partially constrained by objective reality.” Our social brains process information not only by examining the facts, but also considering the social consequences of what happens to our reputations if we believe something.</span></p><p>Indeed, in his influential theory of social comparison processes, the eminent psychologist Leon Festinger suggested that people evaluate the “correctness” of their opinions by comparing them to the opinions of others. When we see others hold the same beliefs as us, our own confidence in those beliefs increases. Which is one reason why people are more likely to proselytize beliefs that cannot be verified through empirical means.</p><p>In short, people have a mechanism in their minds. It stops them from saying something that could lower their status, even if it’s true. And it propels them to say something that could increase their status, even if it’s false. Sometimes, local norms can push against this tendency. Certain communities (e.g., scientists) can obtain status among their peers for expressing truths. But if the norm is relaxed, people might default to seeking status over truth if status confers the greater reward.</p><p>Furthermore, knowing that we could lose status if we don’t believe in something causes us to be more likely to believe in it to guard against that loss. Considerations of what happens to our own reputation guides our beliefs, leading us to adopt a popular view to preserve or enhance our social positions. We implicitly ask ourselves, “What are the social consequences of holding (or not holding) this belief?”</p><p><span>But our reputation isn’t the only thing that matters when considering what to believe. Equally important is the reputation of others. Returning to the peripheral route of persuasion, we decide whether to believe something not only if </span><em>lots</em><span> of people believe it, but also if the proponent of the belief is a prestigious person. If lots of people believe something, our likelihood of believing it increases. And if a high-status person believes something, we are more prone to believing it, too.</span></p><p><span>This starts when we are children. In her recent book </span><em>Cognitive Gadgets</em><span>, the Oxford psychologist Cecilia Hayes writes, “children show prestige bias; they are more likely to copy a model that adults regard as being higher social status- for example, their head-teacher rather than an equally familiar person of the same age and gender.” Hayes cites a 2013 </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096513000982?casa_token=ZQfNgYFnvxsAAAAA%3AqgqHTEcD5VbklYgiS-byzHdKJ9MF7FvafyL_kysopRyVRQz85WlcU81A4CbpXf1wqV8Dcjvhkg&amp;ref=quillette.com#!" rel="">study</a><span> by Nicola McGuigan who found that five-year-old children are “selective copiers.” Results showed that kids were more likely to imitate their head-teacher rather than an equally familiar person of the same age and gender. Young children are more likely to imitate a person that adults regard as being higher status.</span></p><p>People in general favor mimicking prestigious people compared to ordinary people. This is why elites have an outsized effect on culture, and why it is important to scrutinize their ideas and opinions. As a descriptive observation, the opinions of my friend who works at McDonald’s have less effect on society than the opinions of my friend who works at McKinsey. If you have any kind of prominence, you unavoidably become a model that others, including children, are more likely to emulate.</p><p><span>Indeed, the Canadian anthropologist Jerome Barkow </span><a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-0867-7_2?ref=quillette.com" rel="">posits</a><span> that people across the world view media figures as more prestigious than respected members of their local communities. People on screen appear to be attractive, wealthy, popular, and powerful. Barkow writes, “All over the world, children are learning not from members of their own community but from media figures whom they perceive as prestigious… local prestige is debased.” As this phenomenon continues to grow, the opinions and actions of the globally-prestigious carry even more influence.</span></p><p>Of course, people don’t copy others with high-status solely because they hope that mimicking them will boost their own status. We tend to believe that prestigious people are more competent; prominence is a heuristic for skill.</p><p><span>In a recent </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-019-0228-7?ref=quillette.com" rel="">paper</a><span> about prestige-based social learning, researchers Ángel V. Jiménez and Alex Mesoudi wrote that assessing competence directly “may be noisy and costly. Instead, social learners can use short-cuts either by making inferences from the appearance, personality, material possessions, etc. of the models.”</span></p><p>For instance, a military friend of mine used to be a tutor for rich high school students. He himself is not as wealthy as them, and disclosed to me that he paid $200 to replace his old earphones for AirPods. This was so that the kids and their families would believe he is in the same social position as them, and therefore qualified to teach.</p><p>Which brings us to a question: Who is most susceptible to manipulation via peripheral persuasion? It might seem intuitive to believe that people with less education are more manipulable. But research suggests this may not be true.</p><p>High-status people are more preoccupied with how others view them. Which means that educated and/or affluent people may be especially prone to peripheral, as opposed to central, methods of persuasion.</p><p><span>Indeed, the psychology professor Keith Stanovich, discussing his research on “myside bias,” has </span><a href="https://quillette.com/2020/09/26/the-bias-that-divides-us/" rel="">written</a><span>, “if you are a person of high intelligence… you will be less likely than the average person to realize you have derived your beliefs from the social groups you belong to and because they fit with your temperament and your innate psychological propensities.”</span></p><p>Students and graduates of top universities are more prone to myside bias. They are more likely to “evaluate evidence, generate evidence, and test hypotheses in a manner biased toward their own prior beliefs, opinions, and attitudes.”</p><p><span>This is not unique to our own time. William Shirer, the American journalist and author of </span><em>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich</em><span>, described his experiences as a war correspondent in Nazi Germany. Shirer wrote, “Often in a German home or office or sometimes in a casual conversation with a stranger in a restaurant, beer hall, or café, I would meet with outlandish assertions from seemingly educated and intelligent persons. It was obvious they were parroting nonsense they heard on the radio or read in the newspapers. Sometimes one was tempted to say as much, but one was met with such incredulity, as if one had blasphemed the Almighty.”</span></p><p><span>Likewise, in a fascinating </span><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40870502?seq=1&amp;ref=quillette.com#metadata_info_tab_contents" rel="">study</a><span> on the collapse of the Soviet Union, researchers have found that university-educated people were two to three times more likely than high school graduates to say they supported the Communist Party. White-collar professional workers were likewise two to three times more supportive of communist ideology, relative to farm laborers and semi-skilled workers.</span></p><p><span>Educational divides within the US today are consistent with these historical patterns. The Democratic political analyst David Shor has </span><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/03/david-shor-2020-democrats-autopsy-hispanic-vote-midterms-trump-gop.html?ref=quillette.com" rel="">observed that</a><span>, “Highly educated people tend to have more ideologically coherent and extreme views than working-class ones. We see this in issue polling and ideological self-identification. College-educated voters are way less likely to identify as moderate.”</span></p><p><span>One possibility for this is that regardless of time or place, affluent members of society are more likely to say the right things to either preserve status or gain more of it. A series of studies by researchers at the University of Queensland </span><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsp.2620?ref=quillette.com" rel="">found</a><span> that, “relative to lower-class individuals, upper-class individuals have a greater desire for wealth and status… it is those who have more to start with (i.e., upper-class individuals) who also strive to acquire more wealth and status.”</span></p><p><span>A more recent set of </span><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220937544?ref=quillette.com" rel="">studies</a><span> led by Cameron Anderson at the University of Berkeley found that social class, measured in terms of education and income, was positively associated with the desire for social status. People who had more education and money were more likely to agree with statements like “I enjoy having influence over other people’s decision making” and “It would please me to have a position of prestige and social standing.”</span></p><p><span>Who feels most in danger of losing their reputations, though? Turns out, those same exact people. A </span><a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2020-07/Crosstabs_Political%20Climate_0.pdf?ref=quillette.com" rel="">survey</a><span> by the Cato Institute in collaboration with YouGov asked a nationally representative sample of 2,000 Americans various questions about self-censorship.</span></p><p>They found that highly educated people are the most concerned about losing their jobs or missing out on job opportunities because of their political views. Twenty-five percent of those with a high school education or less are afraid of getting fired or hurting their employment prospects because of their political views, compared with 34 percent of college graduates and an astounding 44 percent of people with a postgraduate degree.</p><p><span>Results from a recent </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3647099&amp;ref=quillette.com" rel="">paper</a><span> titled ‘Keeping Your Mouth Shut: Spiraling Self-Censorship in the United States’ by the political scientists James L. Gibson and Joseph L. Sutherland is consistent with the findings from Cato/Yougov. They find that self-censorship has skyrocketed. In the 1950s, at the height of McCarthyism, 13.4 percent of Americans reported that “felt less free to speak their mind than they used to.” In 1987, the figure had reached 20 percent. By 2019, 40 percent of Americans reported that they did not feel free to speak their minds. This isn’t a partisan issue, either. Gibson and Sutherland report that, “The percentage of Democrats who are worried about speaking their mind is just about identical to the percentage of Republicans who self-censor: 39 and 40 percent, respectively.”</span></p><p>The increase is especially pronounced among the educated class. The researchers report, “It is also noteworthy and perhaps unexpected that those who engage in self-censorship are not those with limited political resources… self-censorship is most common among those with the highest levels of education… This finding suggests a social learning process, with those with more education being more cognizant of social norms that discourage the expression of one’s views.”</p><p>Highly-educated people appear to be the most likely to express things they don’t necessarily believe for fear of losing their jobs or their reputation. Within the upper class, the true believers set the pace, and those who are loss-averse about their social positions go along with it.</p><p><span>Interestingly, there is suggestive </span><a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0028756&amp;ref=quillette.com" rel="">evidence</a><span> indicating that education is </span><em>negatively </em><span>associated with one’s sense of power. That is, the more education someone has, the more likely they are to agree with statements like, “Even if I voice them, my views have little sway” and “My ideas and opinions are often ignored.” Granted, the correlation is quite small (r = -.15). Still, the finding is significant and in the opposite direction of what most people would expect.</span></p><p><span>Research by Caitlin Drummond and Baruch Fischhoff at Carnegie Mellon University </span><a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/36/9587?ref=quillette.com" rel="">found</a><span> that people with more education, science education, and science literacy are more polarized in their views about scientific issues depending on their political identity. For example, the people who are most concerned about climate change? College-educated Democrats. The people who are least concerned? College-educated Republicans. In contrast, less educated Democrats and Republicans are not so different from one another in their views about climate change.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, in an article titled “Academic and Political Elitism,” the sociologist Musa Al-Gharbi has summarized related research, </span><a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2019/08/27/academe-should-avoid-politicizing-educational-attainment-opinion?ref=quillette.com" rel="">writing</a><span>, “compared to the general public, cognitively sophisticated voters are much more likely to form their positions on issues based on partisan cues of what they are ‘supposed’ to think in virtue of their identity as Democrats, Republicans, etc.”</span></p><p>It’s also useful to understand how highly educated people view others and their social relationships. Consider a paper titled ‘Seeing the Best or Worst in Others: A Measure of Generalized Other-Perceptions’ led by Richard Rau at the University of Münster. Rau and his colleagues were interested in how various factors influence people’s perceptions of others.</p><p>In the study, participants looked at social network profiles of people they did not know. They also viewed short video sequences of unfamiliar people describing a neutral personal experience like traveling to work. Researchers then asked participants to evaluate the people in the social media profiles and videos. Participants were asked how much they agreed with statements like “I like this person,” and “This person is cold-hearted.” Then participants responded to various demographic and personality questions about themselves.</p><p>Some findings weren’t so surprising. The researchers found, for example, that people who scored highly on the personality traits of openness and agreeableness tended to hold more favorable views of others.</p><p><span>More sobering, though, is that higher education was consistently related to </span><em>less positive</em><span> views of other people. In their paper they write, “to understand people’s feelings, behaviors, and social relationships, it is of key importance to know which general view they hold about others… the better people are educated, the less positive their other-perceptions are.”</span></p><p>So affluent people care the most about status, believe they have little power, are afraid of losing their jobs and reputation, and have less favorable views of others.</p><p>In short, opinions can confer status regardless of their truth value. And the individuals most likely to express certain opinions in order to preserve or enhance their status are also those who are already on the upper rungs of the social ladder.</p><p>There may be unpleasant consequences for this misguided use of intellect and time on the part of highly educated and affluent people. If the most fortunate members of society spend more time speaking in hushed tones, or live in fear of expressing themselves, or are more involved in culture wars, that is less time they could spend using their mental and economic resources to solve serious problems.</p><p>Smart people are usually better at finding the truth. But they’re also better at knowing which way the ideological winds are blowing, and thereby producing and accepting absurdities. </p><p><span>A version of this essay was </span><a href="https://quillette.com/2021/04/03/persuasion-and-the-prestige-paradox-are-high-status-people-more-likely-to-lie/" rel="">originally</a><span> published in </span><em>Quillette. </em></p></div></div>]]></description>

One is a bit like a light Likho, and another is like a heavy Raven, but there is a lot more to each. Other planes have tweaks and buffs, such as an area reveal ability for Sparrow, and a heavier Phoenix. Some gunships even got in on the action, with the most notable being a sizeable buff for Krow.</p><p>Other balance changes include a bit more health for light assaults, and better spinning for Disco Rave Party. In terms of features, bombers are well-served here as well, with selection icons for whether a bomber needs ammo, as well as smoother landing paths.</p><p>There are a few extra features for modding, such as scaling and tinting, which were technically in the previous hotfix. The campaign has the new bombers, a few features, and a new Records page which displays and aggregates your best stats for each mission. How fast can the campaign be completed, and with how few units lost?</p><h2><a name="New_Bombers"></a>New Bombers</h2><p><strong>Magpie</strong> is a light nimble bomber armed with a pair of missiles.

                <p><a href="https://zero-k.info/img/news/3348.png"><img src="https://zero-k.info/img/news/3348_thumb.png"></a></p><div><p>Lobsters have been taught to not fire when it would be redundant, making Lobster balls much easier to manage. Overkill prevention in general has a tweak, and some APIs were extended to make modding easier. The Artefact Control game mode which saw some testing about a month ago is now live. In terms of balance, Redback has a bit of a nerf and some of the least used units - Skuttle, Phoenix and Emissary - have small buffs.</p><h2><a name="Balance"></a>Balance</h2><p><strong>Duck </strong>can now be dodged by a Glaive trying as hard as it can to run away.</p><ul>
<li>
Missile fuel time 2s -&gt; 1.5s</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Redback </strong>is worse at taking map control and assaulting defenses.</p><ul>
<li>
Cost 230 -&gt; 240</li>
<li>
Speed 1.85 -&gt; 1.75</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Skuttle </strong>can see enemies before they break its cloak.</p><ul>
<li>
Line of sight 280 -&gt; 330</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Emissary</strong> aims faster and no longer benefits from manually turning.</p><ul>
<li>
Body turn rate reduced 105 -&gt; 84 degrees/second</li>
<li>
Gun aim rate increased 40 -&gt; 70 degrees/second</li>
<li>
Resets its gun between shots (as much as possible) in case it has to move.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phoenix </strong>moves faster and hits its target sooner.</p><ul>
<li>
Speed 8 -&gt; 8.1</li>
<li>
Projectile gravity 0.7 -&gt; 0.72</li>
</ul>
<br><h2><a name="Unit_AI"></a>Unit AI</h2><p>Overkill prevention, the system that prevents ten Scalpels firing at a single Glaive, is now available for Lobster and disabled for units set to hold. It is controlled by a state toggle that is hidden by default because there is very little reason to touch it. The state toggle can be enabled under Settings/Interface/Commands, and per-unit defaults to be set in Settings/Unit Behaviour/Default States, or by holding Space and clicking on a unit, then pressing Edit Behaviour.</p><p><strong>Lobster </strong>is smarter, no longer firing unless there is a visible valid target.</p><ul>
<li>
This prevents it from firing when it would do absolutely nothing, provided there are no invisible enemies nearby.</li>
<li>
As a result, telling a tight clump of Lobsters to fire causes only two to shoot.</li>
<li>
This behaviour can be configured with the hidden Overkill Prevention state.</li>
<li>
Removed the Force Fire command by default. This can be configured via another hidden state toggle.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Overkill prevention</strong> is now suspended by default when units are set to Hold Fire.</p><ul>
<li>
Added the "Enable for Fire at Will" and "Enable for auto targeting" states. Previously it just had enabled/disabled.</li>
<li>
Most units default to "Enable for Fire at Will". The theory being that if you set a unit to hold fire you care more about its target dying than about overkill.</li>
<li>
Nothing defaults to "Enable for auto targeting", but it may be useful to try out.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impaler</strong> now has an even stronger preference for targeting structures over units.</p><h2><a name="Interface"></a>Interface</h2><br> <ul>
<li>
Added a minimum wind icon and number to the left column of the wind generator tooltip during placement (thanks Porkchop)</li>
<li>
Cleaned up some inconsistent unit highlighting and selection. Units under interface panels cannot be clicked on by default, tooltips do not appear, and units are not highlighted.</li>
<li>
Selecting through the panel at the bottom of the screen can be configured under Settings/HUD Panels/Selected Units Panel.</li>
<li>
Drag selection can still terminate over a UI panel.</li>
<li>
Add some translations for the commander selector.</li>
<li>
Updated Global Build AI with some fixes and documentation (thanks esainane).</li>
<li>
Added username team colour in chat and removed white outlines for dark names (thanks Birdulon)</li>
<li>
Local widgets are no longer disabled for spectators on rooms with local widgets disabled.</li>
<li>
Added Italian translations for the main menu (thanks fvasco)</li>
</ul>
<br><h2><a name="Campaign"></a>Campaign</h2><br> <ul>
<li>
Tweaked campaign text and replaced some Artefacts with more suitable structures (thanks Thorneel)</li>
</ul>
<br><h2><a name="Maps"></a>Maps</h2><br> <ul>
<li>
Added boxes for Onyx Cauldron 2.0</li>
<li>
Improved lighting on Skulduggery (thanks Shaman)</li>
<li>
Improved water on Cull, Lost v2 and Lowland Crossing Revised v2.</li>
<li>
Fixed an issue with void water with new shaders on some graphics cards.</li>
</ul>
<br><h2><a name="Artefact_Control"></a>Artefact Control</h2><p>Added a control point game mode called Artefact Control under Experimental.</p><ul>
<li>
Several artefacts are spawned on each side of the map.</li>
<li>
Each team controls half at the start of the game.</li>
<li>
Artefacts have 11k health and heal at 100 hp/second.</li>
<li>
Artefacts respawned with switched allegeance when destroyed.</li>
<li>
If a team controlls all the artefacts, they win.</li>
</ul>
<br><h2><a name="Modding"></a>Modding</h2><p>Changed some keys in unit def files to match the lua UnitDefs table. Mods with the old keys are still supported.</p><ul>
<li>
buildCostMetal -&gt; metalCost</li>
<li>
buildCostEnergy -&gt; energyCost</li>
<li>
energyUse -&gt; energyUpkeep</li>
<li>
metalUse -&gt; metalUpkeep (vanilla ZK doesn't use this)</li>
<li>
maxDamage -&gt; health</li>
<li>
maxVelocity -&gt; speed</li>
</ul>
<p>Other changes.</p><ul>
<li>
Unit defs no longer require unitname since it must match the table key, so it is redundant.</li>
<li>
Unit defs are now also read from subfolders of 'units'.</li>
<li>
Set undefined burst rates to 0 (rather than 0.1) as it can interfere with weapon modding.</li>
<li>
The game exits to menu when unit defs fail to load, rather than crashing.</li>
<li>
Added game-side GG.UnitModelRescale(unitID, scale) from Unit Level Ups.</li>
<li>
Added backwards compatibility for Spring.GetUnitIsBeingBuilt.</li>
<li>
Fixed backwards compatibility for Spring.GetPlayerRulesParams.</li>
<li>
Added customparams.buggeroff_angle for factories, in radians.</li>
<li>
Added customparams.metal_extractor_mult to support the creation of higher tier metal extractors.</li>
<li>
Fixed modding away the Sniper reload move penalty breaking the script.</li>
<li>
Cleaned up the build icon generator gadget.</li>
<li>
Napalm effects now contain an example of sin (replaces taylor series).</li>
<li>
Improved modded energy generator tooltips.</li>
<li>
Mexes suport morphing.</li>
</ul>
<br><h2><a name="Fixes"></a>Fixes</h2><br> <ul>
<li>
Fixed commshare sometimes preventing resign or causing a crash when the game ends.</li>
<li>
War music no longer counts morph as violence.</li>
<li>
Fixed missing vote resign button.</li>
<li>
Marginal turret overshoot can no longer be circumvented with command insert.</li>
<li>
Fixed a few build icons incorrectly implying that a floating structure is built underwater.</li>
<li>
Fixed commander selector button image.</li>
<li>
Fixed backwards 'motion blur' on ejected shells.</li>
<li>
Fixed some large structure wreckages having much too large collision volumes.</li>

            <div><p>This is mostly a small fixes update for the previous patch. It has a few balance chanegs and features though. Most notable are a slight Redback nerf and a sudden death mode.

In any case, it seems like a useful mode to have.</p><h2><a name="Balance"></a>Balance</h2><p><strong>Redback</strong> is worse at dodging projectiles.</p><ul>
<li>
Increased collision shape width by 11% and length by 25%.</li>

<p>In addition to the materials available here, I also wrote and
distribute <a href="https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html">"The Little Book of Deep Learning",</a> a
phone-formatted short introduction to deep learning for readers with a
STEM background.</p>

<h2><a id="lectures"></a>Lecture materials</h2>

<p>The slide pdfs are the ones I use for the lectures. They are in
landscape format with overlays to facilitate the presentation. The
handout pdfs are compiled without these fancy effects in portrait
orientation, with additional notes. The screencasts are available both
as in-browser streaming or downloadable mp4 files.</p>

<p>You can get archives with all the pdf files
(1097 slides):</p>

<h2><a id="prologue"></a>Practical session prologue</h2>

<p>Helper Python prologue for the practical
sessions: <a href="https://fleuret.org/dlc/src/dlc_practical_prologue.py">dlc_practical_prologue.py</a></p>

<h3>Argument parsing</h3>

<p>This prologue parses command-line arguments as follows</p>

<pre>usage: dummy.py [-h] [--full] [--tiny] [--seed SEED]
[--cifar] [--data_dir DATA_DIR]

DLC prologue file for practical sessions.

optional arguments:
-h, --help           show this help message and exit
--full               Use the full set, can take ages (default
False)
--tiny               Use a very small set for quick checks
(default False)
--seed SEED          Random seed (default 0, &lt; 0 is no seeding)
--cifar              Use the CIFAR data-set and not MNIST
(default False)
--data_dir DATA_DIR  Where are the PyTorch data located (default
$PYTORCH_DATA_DIR or './data')
</pre>

<h3>Loading data</h3>

<p>The prologue provides the function</p>

<pre>load_data(cifar = None, one_hot_labels = False, normalize = False, flatten = True)
</pre>

<p>which downloads the data when required, reshapes the images to 1d
vectors if <span>flatten</span>
is <span>True</span>, and narrows to a small subset of
samples if <span>--full</span> is not selected.</p>

<p>It returns a tuple of four tensors: <span>train_data</span>,
<span>train_target</span>, <span>test_data</span>, and <span>test_target</span>.</p>

<p>If <span>cifar</span> is <span>True</span>, the data-base used is CIFAR10, if it
is <span>False</span>, MNIST is used, if it is None, the argument
<span>--cifar</span> is taken into account.</p>

<p>If <span>one_hot_labels</span> is <span>True</span>, the targets are converted to 2d
<span>torch.Tensor</span> with as many columns as there are classes, and
-1 everywhere except the coefficients [n, y_n], equal to 1.</p>

<p>If <span>normalize</span> is <span>True</span>, the data tensors are normalized
according to the mean and variance of the training one.</p>

<p>If <span>flatten</span> is <span>True</span>, the data tensors are flattened
into 2d tensors of dimension N × D, discarding the image structure
of the samples. Otherwise they are 4d tensors of dimension N × C
× H × W.</p>

<h3>Minimal example</h3>

<pre>import dlc_practical_prologue as prologue

train_input, train_target, test_input, test_target = prologue.load_data()

print('train_input', train_input.size(), 'train_target', train_target.size())
print('test_input', test_input.size(), 'test_target', test_target.size())
</pre>

<p>prints</p>

<pre>* Using MNIST
** Reduce the data-set (use --full for the full thing)
** Use 1000 train and 1000 test samples
train_input torch.Size([1000, 784]) train_target torch.Size([1000])
test_input torch.Size([1000, 784]) test_target torch.Size([1000])
</pre>

<h2><a id="vm"></a>Virtual Machine</h2>

<p>A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software that simulates a complete
computer. The one we provide here includes a Linux operating
system and all the tools needed to use PyTorch from a web
browser
(<i>e.g.</i> <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla
Firefox</a> or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google
Chrome</a>).</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<ol>
<li>Download and install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">Oracle's VirtualBox,</a></li>
<li>download the <a href="https://fleuret.org/dlc/files/dlc-vm.ova">virtual machine OVA package</a> (1.68Gb), and</li>
<li>open the latter in VirtualBox with <span>File → Import Appliance</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>You should now see an entry in the list of VMs. The first time
it starts, it provides a menu to choose the keyboard layout you
want to use (you can force the configuration later by running
the command <span>sudo set-kbd</span>).</p>

<p><b>If the VM does not start and VirtualBox complains that the
VT-x is not enabled, you have to activate the virtualization
capabilities of your CPU in the BIOS of your computer.</b></p>

<h3><a id="using-the-vm"></a>Using the VM</h3>

<p>The VM automatically starts
a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">JupyterLab</a> on port 8888 and
exports that port to the host. This means that you can access this
JupyterLab with a web browser on the machine running VirtualBox at
<a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a>
and use Python notebooks, view files, start terminals, and edit source
files. Typing <span>!bye</span> in a notebook
or <span>bye</span> in a terminal will shutdown the
VM.</p>

<p>You can run a terminal and a text editor from inside the Jupyter
notebook for exercises that require more than the notebook
itself. Source files can be executed by running in a terminal the
Python command with the source file name as argument. Both can be done
from the main Jupyter window with:</p>

<ul>
<li><span>New → Text File</span> to create
the source code, or selecting the file and
clicking <span>Edit</span> to edit an existing
one.</li>
<li><span>New → Terminal</span> to start a
shell from which you can run Python.</li>
</ul>

<!-- <p><b>Files saved in the VM are erased when the VM is -->
<!-- re-installed, which happens for each session on the EPFL -->
<!-- machines. So you should download files you want to keep from -->
<!-- the Jupyter notebook to your account and re-upload them later -->
<!-- when you need them.</b></p> -->

<p>This VM also exports an ssh port to the port 2022 on the host,
which allows to log in with standard ssh clients on Linux and
OSX, and with applications such
as <a href="https://www.putty.org/">PuTTY</a> on Windows. The
default login is <span>'dave'</span> and
password <span>'dummy'</span>, same password
for the root account.</p>

<h3>Remarks</h3>

<p>Note that performance for computation will be very poor compared to
<a href="https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/">installing
PyTorch</a> natively on your machine. In particular, the VM does
not take advantage of a GPU if you have one.</p>

<p><b>Finally, please also note that this VM is configured in a
convenient but highly non-secured manner, with easy to guess
passwords, including for the root, and network-accessible
non-protected Jupyter notebooks.</b></p>

<p>This VM is built on
a <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux</a> <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian,</a>
with <a href="https://conda.io/miniconda.html">miniconda,</a>
<a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch,</a> <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">MNIST,</a>
<a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR10,</a> and many Python utility packages installed.</p>

Minutes later, in a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">separate surprise Board meeting</a><span>, Greg Brockman is removed from the Board (and as Board Chairman).</span></p><p>Board Directors:</p><ul><li><p>Adam D’Angelo</p></li><li><p>Helen Toner</p></li><li><p>Tasha McCauley</p></li><li><p>Ilya Sutskever</p></li></ul><p>The first thing that sticks out to me is that there have been, for several quarters, two significant conflicts of interest on the Board:</p><ul><li><p><span>Adam D’Angelo founded and appears to be spending all his time on developing </span><a href="https://twitter.com/poe_platform" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Poe</a><span>, an AI chat platform partially leveraging and partially competing with OpenAI. In my opinion, that’s too close. Reid Hoffman resigned over potential indirect investment conflicts; Adam’s conflicts are more direct. Best practice would’ve been for Adam to resign when he began working on Poe.</span></p></li><li><p><span>Helen Toner and and Tasha McCauley are jointly participating in a highly ideological AI governance organization. As Alex Konrad </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/these-are-the-people-that-fired-openai-ceo-sam-altman/?sh=47da17654ae9" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">noted</a><span>: “McCauley currently sits on the advisory board of British-founded international Center for the Governance of AI (GovAI) alongside fellow OpenAI director Helen Toner.” It turns out that the </span><a href="https://www.governance.ai/people" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">advisory board is six people</a><span>, and beyond Helen and Tasha, the other four include: one who currently works for Open Philanthropy, and another is the founder of GovAI, which was mostly funded by… Open Philanthropy. </span></p><ul><li><p>For OpenAI’s six-person Board, it was inappropriate for two Board Directors to be this strongly associated with an ideological organization and therefore so strongly and predictably aligned in their voting. It calls into question the independence of their votes.</p></li><li><p><span>Due to Open Philanthropy’s link to major OpenAI competitor Anthropic, there’s also a hint of corporate conflict here. If I were on OpenAI’s Board, I would have requested at least for Tasha</span><span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-138968534" href="https://loeber.substack.com/p/a-timeline-of-the-openai-board#footnote-2-138968534" target="_self" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">2</a></span><span> to relinquish her seat for a true independent Director.</span></p></li></ul></li></ul><p>Secondly, what the hell happened in Q1/Q2 2023? </p><ul><li><p>Reid, Shivon, and Will all resigned, and the Board did not line up replacement Directors? By comparison, when Elon resigned in February 2018, Adam joined two months later. </p><ul><li><p>Were these seats just left vacant, with a deadlocked Board unable to agree on new Directors to appoint?</p></li></ul></li><li><p>They all resigned within a few months of one another despite OpenAI looking like the rocketship of the century? Something feels a little odd about that.</p></li></ul><p>It seems less likely that the November firings would have happened if Reid, Shivon, and Will — or even just one of them! — had still been on the Board, or replaced with an appropriate representative. With this view, the outcome was almost predictable given these two facts:</p><ol><li><p>The thinning-out of the Board from 9 to 6 members;</p></li><li><p>Half of those 6 members carrying conflicts in their relationship with OpenAI!</p></li></ol><p>We will find out, in due time, the motivations of the Board in the November firings. Right now they aren’t clear. It isn’t known whether anyone acted inappropriately, and I am not accusing anyone (to be clear, even the Board Directors that I consider conflicted) of having acted subject to conflicts of interest. But the 2023 changes made drama likely, no matter what. A Board is a delicate balance of perspectives and interests. When a Board rapidly changes in size, rarely is the remainder left well-balanced. Potential conflicts only make the balancing act harder.</p><p>Governance can be messy. Time will be the judge of whether this act of governance was wise or not. But you should note that the people involved in this act of corporate governance are roughly the same people trying to position themselves to govern policy on artificial intelligence. </p><p><span>It seems much easier to govern a single-digit number of highly capable people than to “govern” artificial superintelligence. If it turns out that this act of governance was unwise, then it calls into serious question the ability of these people and their organizations (Georgetown’s CSET, Open Philanthropy, etc.) to conduct governance in general, </span><em>especially</em><span> of the most impactful technology of the hundred years to come. Many people are saying we need more governance: maybe it turns out we need less.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>The German government has launched a new Open Source software project called openDesk, which aims to reduce the country’s dependency on proprietary software vendors and support transparency and interoperability.</p>



<p>openDesk is a collection of Open Source software modules that are important for day-to-day work in the public sector, such as text creation, file collaboration, project management, email, calendar and messaging.</p>



<p>While the initial focus is on public administration in Germany, The source code is publicly available on a government-provided GitLab called <a href="https://opencode.de/en">openCoDE</a>, making it available, free of charge, for use by other organizations, industries and geographical location. Discussions are taking place with other European countries; France and Austria in particular have already expressed interest.</p>



<p>Commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Home Affairs (BMI), under the project leadership of a newly created Center for Digital Sovereignty, <a href="https://zendis.de/">ZenDiS</a>.</p>



<h2>How it works</h2>



<p>Here’s how the project might play out on a day-to-day level: </p>



<p>A government employee based in Cologne logs into openDesk where she finds a suite of productivity tools in one integrated solution. To create a document about a new city ordinance, she uses Collabora Online to write and edit the document. This is part of a larger project managed in OpenProject with all its milestones and deliverables. The document is then uploaded and shared with other employees in Nextcloud to get their feedback and directly linked to the respective milestone of the project.</p>



<p>Once the document is final, she uses Open-Xchange to inform other parties via email; important project milestones are also shared in the calendar. For ad-hoc coordination with colleagues, she uses the Element chat or starts a video conference via Jitsi.</p>



<h2>What’s inside openDesk</h2>



<p>openDesk builds on the idea of Dataport’s Phoenix project (dPhonix suite) but only uses Open Source components.</p>



<p>The project has already attracted a number of Open Source software providers, including Collabora Online, Element, Nextcloud, Nordeck IT + Consulting, OpenProject, Open-Xchange and XWiki.</p>

<p>These software providers are contributing a variety of modules to openDesk, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.collaboraoffice.com/">Collabora Online</a>: A secure Open Source online office suite</li>



<li><a href="https://element.io/">Element</a>: An Open Source and end-to-end encrypted messenger</li>



<li><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>: An Open Source platform to securely collaborate and share data</li>



<li><a href="https://nordeck.net/">Nordeck IT + Consulting</a>: Widgets for collaboration, including video conferencing based on Jitsi and messaging based on Matrix Element</li>



<li><a href="https://www.openproject.org/">OpenProject</a>: Waterfall, agile, and hybrid Open Source project management software</li>



<li><a href="https://www.open-xchange.com/">Open-Xchange</a>: Comprehensive email and calendar functions</li>



<li><a href="https://www.univention.com/">Univention</a>: Components for the openDesk web portal and the cross-application management of digital identities and access rights</li>



<li><a href="https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome">XWiki</a>: An Open Source wiki platform</li>
</ul>



<p>The first version of openDesk is expected to be released in a basic version at the end of 2023.  Until then, you can follow the project and software development on the <a href="https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/souveraener_arbeitsplatz">Git Lab page</a>. Here’s a preview of what the openDesk start page looks like:</p>

<p><em>Image: openDesk</em></p>



<p>The openDesk project is a significant step towards digital sovereignty for the German government. By using Open Source software, the government hopes to reduce reliance on proprietary vendors and gain more control over data.</p>



<h2>Why this matters</h2>



<p>The openDesk project is a significant development in the world of Open Source software. It shows that even large governments — where the public administration is one of the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles/germany_en">most important sectors</a> — are beginning to recognize the benefits of Open Source, including security, transparency and flexibility.</p>



<h2>What’s next</h2>



<p>OpenDesk is a work in progress that’s constantly being refined to meet specific needs of the public administration.  You can check out the current version of the source code on <a href="https://gitlab.opencode.de/bmi/souveraener_arbeitsplatz/info">openCoDe</a> (German only, for now) or the <a href="https://opencode.de/en">joint platform</a> of the public administration for the exchange of Open Source software.<br></p>

                  <p><span>Cool! I recently wrote my own user script to do the same thing. It's going to be very hard to patch or detect this, as updating video element props don't trigger DOM updates. They would have to either do lots of JS prototype trickery or check for playback rate when doing adblock detection. One thing to keep in mind here though since you're doing DOM lookups every time anything on the page changes, is that there could be some small overhead in page render time, and also that using fixed CSS classes means any small change to page code could break the checks. In case it's a problem in the future, checking .innerText is a hacky way to workaround it.</span></p></div></td></tr>

I mean I have premium but I still want them to get smacked down for this because Google made one of the endgame moves to drink verification can.<p>Ads are supposed to incidental, you run ads and if too many people block them because they suck then congrats sucks for you. If no one sees them then sucks for you. Most people put up with TV ads when they're not even hard to skip. And for some reason IG ads are well liked. Forcing them harder I think has to make us confront what we're really doing here and what we're gaining by all this. Just pay for premium sounds nice when you don't think about it. If there's no universe where someone might actually prefer the ads if they were the same price then we're kinda admitting they have literally zero value to the viewer.</p><p>And that paints a very different picture of advertising than "the grease of the economic wheel" ya know? And clearly all advertising isn't like this, like I paid to see the Lego movie, Barbie was fantastic. I watched a YT video of a woman showing her design process for a product she's selling and it was fascinating but it was also just an ad. But if YT are there to suck just so you'll pay for it to suck less than that's not mutually beneficial trade that's extortion.

Clearly I just want free shit.<p>I know it's crazy but what I actually want is an ad model where I don't feel the need to make it go away and might actually enjoy. An ad model where it doesn't have to interrupt me and force itself upon my eyes because it's actually content I would watch on my own.</p><p>Like take for example Fly.io's blog. It's is some of the best advertising for the service and is definitely why I use them today. Raymond Hettenger's python YT series is a fantastic ad for his consultancy. Wendy's Twitter was/is  hilarious. But its a weird dynamic because if the content is <i>good</i> you don't have to pay for it which seems silly because it's an ad all the same.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps">https://github.com/erkyrath/infocom-zcode-terps</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38326878">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Infocom Z-code Interpreters</h2>
<p dir="auto">This is a collection of Infocom's original Z-code interpreters for various home computers of the 1980s.</p>
<p dir="auto">Most of the interpreters are provided as assembly source code (for the 6502, Z-80, and so on). Some have compiled binaries as well. As with the Infocom game source code, what's available is what's available.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repo contains a small amount of internal documentation, mostly about how to create working floppy disks for each platform. It contains no personal or private communication, unless you count one footnote about a "straightforward" porting job.</p>
<hr>
<p dir="auto">Below I have documented all the directories and files, as best I understand them. Corrections and further details welcomed.</p>
<p dir="auto">Interesting tidbits:</p>
<p dir="auto">Many directories include a large "assembled printout" file (usually <code>.prn</code> or <code>.lst</code>). This is a text file containing the assembler output for a complete program, both hex bytes and opcodes. ("prn" because it is notionally formatted for a line printer.)</p>
<p dir="auto">The <code>unix</code> directory contains a C implementation of DIP, the virtual machine used to implement Fooblitzky. The <code>atari</code> and <code>ibm</code> directories contain assembly implementations of same. <code>unix/foo.dat</code> is the game file in question; <code>unix/ediptst.sum</code> would be a test suite game.</p>
<p dir="auto">(Wikipedia refers to this as "GZIP - Graphical Zork Interpreter Program". I'm not sure what the origin of that name is. It doesn't appear in the Infocom source as far as I can tell. A couple of files refer to it as "GRIP" or the "G-machine". I'll stick with "DIP".)</p>
<p dir="auto">The architecture of DIP is unexplored territory (for my generation at least!) At a glance, it has version byte 1 and a serial number starting at byte 12 (rather than 18, as in the Z-machine). The game file appears to include graphical sprite data in high VM memory, rather than as external resources. The opcodes in the DIP interpreter are different. And so on.</p>

<p dir="auto">The <code>.pre</code> and <code>.pur</code> files concatenate to the original, except that in ziptest.pre, header byte 1 gets the "story file split" bit set and bytes 4-5 (himem) are $05FF. This is the usual way Z-code files are split for platforms that can't fit the whole game in memory at once.</p>

One would have to do additional work to figure out which blocks to tile together to make complete "icons" or sprites.</p>

In looking at new desktop PCs and motherboards I am struck by the paucity of USB-C ports (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB-C">standardized in 2014</a>).

<p>A day after OpenAI’s board of directors <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/11/17/sam-altman-out-at-openai/?sh=6f3c03c54691" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/11/17/sam-altman-out-at-openai/?sh=6f3c03c54691" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidjeans/2023/11/17/sam-altman-out-at-openai/?sh=6f3c03c54691" aria-label="fired former CEO Sam Altman">fired former CEO Sam Altman</a> in a shock development, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=6aed1f6f3fc9" target="_self" title="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=6aed1f6f3fc9" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=6aed1f6f3fc9" aria-label="investors">investors</a> in the company are plotting how to restore him in what would amount to an even more surprising counter-coup.</p>


<p>Venture capital firms holding positions in OpenAI’s for-profit entity have discussed working with Microsoft and senior employees at the company to bring back Altman, even as he has signaled to some that he intends to launch a new startup, four sources told <em>Forbes</em>.</p>

<p>Whether the companies would be able to exert enough pressure to pull off such a move — and do it fast enough to keep Altman interested — is unclear.</p>

<p>The playbook, a source told <em>Forbes</em> would be straightforward: make OpenAI’s new management, under acting CEO Mira Murati and the remaining board, accept that their situation was untenable through a combination of mass revolt by senior researchers, withheld cloud computing credits from Microsoft, and a potential lawsuit from investors. Facing such a combination, the thinking is that management would have to accept Altman back, likely leading to the subsequent departure of those believed to have pushed for Altman’s removal, including cofounder Ilya Sutskever and board director Adam D’Angelo, the CEO of Quora.</p>

<p>Should such an effort not come together in time, Altman and OpenAI ex-president Greg Brockman were set to raise capital for a new startup, two sources said. “If they don’t figure it out asap, they’d just go ahead with Newco,” one source added.</p>
<p>OpenAI had not responded to a request for comment at publication time. Microsoft declined to comment.</p>
<p>At least one firm, Sequoia, was independently in contact with Microsoft to encourage it to work to restore Altman and Brockman, according to a source close to the firm. The firm would support Altman whichever option he chose, the source added.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, The Information <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-co-founder-altman-plans-new-venture?utm_campaign=OpenAI+Crisis+Update&amp;utm_content=2279&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1650" target="_blank" title="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-co-founder-altman-plans-new-venture?utm_campaign=OpenAI+Crisis+Update&amp;utm_content=2279&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1650" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-co-founder-altman-plans-new-venture?utm_campaign=OpenAI+Crisis+Update&amp;utm_content=2279&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1650" aria-label="reported">reported</a> that Altman was already meeting with investors to raise funds for such a project. One source close to Altman said that both options remained possible. “I think he truly wants the best outcome,” said the person. “He doesn’t want to see lives destroyed.”</p>

<p>A key player in any attempted reinstatement would be Microsoft, OpenAI’s key partner that has poured $10 billion into the company. CEO Satya Nadella was left surprised and “furious” by the ouster, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board?sref=YK080Hgh#xj4y7vzkg" target="_blank" title="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board?sref=YK080Hgh#xj4y7vzkg" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-18/openai-altman-ouster-followed-debates-between-altman-board?sref=YK080Hgh#xj4y7vzkg" aria-label="reported">reported</a>. Microsoft has sent only a fraction of that stated dollar amount to OpenAI, per a Semafor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" target="_blank" title="https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.semafor.com/article/11/18/2023/openai-has-received-just-a-fraction-of-microsofts-10-billion-investment" aria-label="report">report</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The OpenAI board is in discussions with Sam Altman to return to the company as its CEO, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. One of them said Altman, who was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965982/openai-ceo-sam-altman-fired">suddenly fired by the board on Friday</a> with no notice, is “ambivalent” about coming back and would want significant governance changes.</p><p>Altman holding talks with the company just a day after he was ousted indicates that OpenAI is in a state of free-fall without him.

A string of senior researchers <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/three-senior-openai-researchers-resign-as-crisis-deepens?rc=k5vrz1">also resigned</a> on Friday, and people close to OpenAI say more departures are in the works.</p><div><p>Altman is “ambivalent” about coming back</p></div><p>OpenAI’s largest investor, Microsoft, said in a statement shortly after Altman’s firing that the company “remains committed” to its partnership with the AI firm. However, OpenAI’s investors weren’t given advance warning or opportunity to weigh in on the board’s decision to remove Altman. As the face of the company and the most prominent voice in AI, his removal throws the future of OpenAI into uncertainty at a time when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23610427/chatbots-chatgpt-new-bing-google-bard-conversational-ai">rivals are racing to catch up</a> with the unprecedented rise of ChatGPT.</p><p>A spokesperson for OpenAI didn’t respond to a request for comment about Altman discussing a return with the board.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-164299">

<div>
<p>I cannot for the life of me remember when it was or what it was but a fair few years ago I remember positioning a telescope to observe an asteroid as it silently and perhaps slightly eerily drifted between us and the Moon. I say eerily as this asteroid had the ability to cause widespread damage had it hit but of course we knew it posed no threat.&nbsp; I remember at the time thinking it was mind blowing that even today, we still use mathematics with roots (pardon the pun) centuries old to calculate the position of objects in our Solar System. We get to see evidence of this again on 12th December when something rare happens!</p>
<p>I have rather hinted to what I am referring, on 12th December, asteroid 319 Leona will pass directly in front of Betelgeuse, the red giant in the constellation of Orion whose name amusingly translates to armpit of the giant – now there’s a fact to amuse and astound your friends. To be able to calculate that a rock approximately 60 km across is going to pass directly in front of a star that is just over 650 light years away is really quite staggering.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps more excitingly if you live along a corridor from central Asia and southern Europe to Florida and Mexico then at around 01:17 UTC you have a chance – clouds permitting – to see it for yourself and you don’t need any telescope or equipment, just your eyes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Betelgeuse is the second brightest star in the constellation Orion and is a familiar favourite with its piercing red colour. It hit the news back in 2020 when it unexpectedly dimmed in the sky due to the star itself ejecting a cloud of dust. Next month it will fade for a few seconds due to the passage of Leona right in front of it. An event like this is quite rare where the light from a bright star is blocked (or occulted) by an asteroid happening every few decades at most.&nbsp; It will be fascinating to watch but is also scientifically useful giving us a chance to learn more about Betelgeuse and how it’s large convection cells behave, and to learn more about the orbit and shape of the asteroid too.&nbsp;</p>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="451" height="640" src="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Orion.jpeg" alt="Image of Orion showing Betelgeuse upper left.

<p>Anyone out there wishing to observe the event needs to be warned though, the predictions are just that, there are a few uncertainties. The size and shape of the asteroid itself is still subject to debate. Typically we tend to assume asteroids are spherical unless we know otherwise but a previous occultation of Leona in September 2023 determined that it was more of ellipsoidal in shape measuring 80km by 55km. At its distance from Earth that means it will cover an area of sky 46 x 41 milliarcseconds which is a little more than the approximate 40 milliarcseconds for Betelgeuse.&nbsp; Taking this into account suggests Betelgeuse will be completely blocked from view and therefore blink out for a few seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Betelgeuse’s somewhat diffuse outer atmosphere may mean its apparent size is more like 50 milliarcseconds so it just fades instead. &nbsp; Until the event happens we will not know exactly how it will appear in the sky or exactly when. &nbsp; It’s a great opportunity to learn more about these two fascinating objets so head outside on 12th December around 01:00 UTC, wait and watch and hopefully you can witness one of natures rather more rare events.&nbsp;</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://johnwhiles.com/posts/programming-as-theory">https://johnwhiles.com/posts/programming-as-theory</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38324486">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Even though I don't respect podcasts as an information delivery system, I recently listened to a podcast that felt like having an epiphany.</p>
<p>The podcast in question was <a href="https://futureofcoding.org/episodes/061">episode 61 of Future of Coding</a>. It is essentially a read-through/review of two papers with which I was unfamiliar, but which I believe are actually quite famous and influential.</p>
<p>Why did listening to this feel like an epiphany? Well, I suddenly felt like I understood what the deal is with software. Why is it that when you join a company, the engineer who's been there for years seems like an incredible genius? Why do some teams that I've been on struggle while others manage to get everything right? Why is everyone always so keen to rewrite things?</p>
<p>The two ideas that the podcast expresses are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of what a “Theory” is, according to Gilbert Ryle.</li>
<li>That being a programmer is doing “Building theories” in the Ryle sense of the word.</li>
</ul>
<p>Having these two ideas explained together was really helpful. If I had read Ryle by himself, I would have thought, “interesting and useless”. If I had read Programming as Theory Building without knowing the theory concept, I would just not have understood.</p>
<p>I recommend listening to the podcast and reading the paper. But if you don't want to do that, I'm going to try and explain the two points.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/wc253zohgsra/6FneKfEWuMP1Ke9omenPf2/975978d3070f8b4fa87b74882ef15804/jwhiles_httpss.mj.run55zU4CdGTuk_httpss.mj.run5FGx1NzXTpY_htt_466bc4eb-d727-45fd-8545-3bc6eb2951b6_3.png?w=800&amp;fm=webp" alt="strange" figure=""></p>
<hr>
<h2>What is a Theory, According to Gilbert Ryle?</h2>
<p>When Ryle says theory, he doesn't mean anything like what other people mean when they say theory. Annoying. He should have just come up with a new word.
What he means is the thought object that exists in our minds which allows us to do things.</p>
<p>I, for example, know how to cook pasta. When I cook pasta, that's a certain expression of this knowledge. When I try and explain to you how to cook pasta, that's a different expression of it. Neither of those expressions contains everything I know about cooking pasta. And in fact, there are parts of what I know that I can't really express in any way. This knowledge is what Ryle would call a theory. I have a “Theory of how to cook pasta”. This theory is not something that exists in language or action - it’s a <em>something</em> that we can never fully express. The closest we can get to transferring a theory is to demonstrate the expression of the Theory to someone over and over again until they build their own theory. That theory won't be the same as ours.</p>
<h2>What Does it Mean that Programming is Theory Building?</h2>
<p>It means that the code base we create is not the true product of our work. The real product is the mental theory of that code base which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowed us to create it in the first place.</li>
<li>Allows us to diagnose problems with it and fix them.</li>
<li>Allows us to modify it easily.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I think about times when I've worked on a team that works well and gets stuff done, it's been a team where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone has been there for a long time, since the start of whatever code base/feature we work on.</li>
<li>Other team members have joined slowly, and had a chance to work with the people who know more.</li>
<li>The area of focus does not change. We haven't been reassigned to a random existing project, or asked to fix some other team’s work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The paper also talks about what happens when all the people who have a theory of a given program stop working on it. It <em>dies</em>. Yikes. It’s claimed that we can’t rebuild a theory from code and documentation. </p>
<p>This model explains a few curious phenomena:</p>
<ul>
<li>What “legacy code” actually is - it’s a code base which is no longer maintained by people who have a theory of it.</li>
<li>The solo engineer who can make a better product than a team of equally competent professionals. The solo engineer has spent the time to build a complete theory of their program, the professionals move between projects regularly - and only have theories of what they've worked on.</li>
<li>Why getting up to speed with unfamiliar projects is so much harder than just rebuilding the thing. To truly build a theory, you need to mentally rebuild the existing code base anyway.</li>
<li>Why outsourcing, or hiring contractors, always seems to go so badly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What You Can Learn from This</h2>
<p>Retention of software engineers is really important!!!</p>

And so one can only conclude that HawkEye’s surveillance support for Gulf dictatorships is not an anomaly, but rather a corporate extension of official U.S. foreign policy.</span></p><p><span>The full text of Hawkeye 360’s pitch to the Pentagon through the </span><a href="https://jackpoulson.substack.com/p/exclusive-inside-trident-spectre" rel="">Vulcan</a><span> contracting marketplace follows:</span></p><blockquote><p>(U//PROPIN) HawkEye 360 (HE360) operates the first-of-its-kind constellation of commercial satellites that can independently detect, identify, and geolocate radio-frequency (RF) signals to within 500 meters of their point of origin. Launched in December 2018, the first cluster of three spacecraft (known as the Pathfinder Cluster) has been fully operational since February of 2019. The software-defined radio (SDR) payload on all three spacecraft can be tuned to a wide range of different frequencies (144MHz-15GHz) and switched between several different RF front end and antenna paths. The HE360 Signal of Interest (SOI) library is the list of signals that can be geolocated by the company’s spacecraft. Common SOIs include UHF GMRS/FRS Push-to-talk Radios, VHF Radios, Automatic Identification System (AIS) EPIRB Emergency Radio Beacons, Cellular Towers, Satellite Phone, X-band Maritime Navigation Radars, Ku-band VSAT Terminals. Tools developed in-house by HE360 efficiently process this data in an integrated signal-processing and geo-engine to calculate and deliver information about myriad emitter types from around the planet.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) Additionally, HawkEye 360 satellites can detect RF signals in the GPS bands, as well as other GNSS systems, e.g. GLONASS. If detected by all three spacecraft, the RF energy from a GNSS interference can be geolocated to its point of origin using an adaptation of the company’s existing geolocation techniques. Due to the global coverage of the constellation, geolocation of GNSS jamming or spoofing can be conducted over denied areas without exposing airborne or terrestrial sensors or personnel to hostile conditions. Unlike electro optical sensors, RF geolocation provides data day and night in all weather conditions.</p><p>(U//PROPIN) HE360 Spectrum Awareness products can support multiple applications and mission areas; including theater indications and warning, pattern of life analysis; maritime domain awareness; illegal fishing identification; border monitoring, mapping communications nodes; and disaster response.</p><p>(U) HE360 data and products are entirely unclassified, providing theater intelligence officers with an unprecedented ability to share RF geolocations with tactical echelons and partner nations. HE360 data is easily accessible via a web interface, and is interoperable “out of the box” with all GIS, C4ISR, and mobile device systems.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></description>

            </span></p><p><span><span><span><span>DURHAM, N.C. – Nanoplastics interact with a particular protein that is naturally found in the brain, creating changes linked to Parkinson’s disease and some types of dementia.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In a Duke-led study appearing Nov. 17 in Science Advances, the researchers report that the findings create a foundation for a new area of investigation, fueled by the timely impact of environmental factors on human biology. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Parkinson’s disease has been called the fastest growing neurological disorder in the world,” said principal investigator, </span></span><a href="https://scholars.duke.edu/person/andrew.west"><span><span>Andrew West, Ph.D.,</span></span></a><span><span> professor in the </span></span><a href="https://pcb.duke.edu/"><span><span>Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology</span></span></a><span><span> at </span></span><a href="https://medschool.duke.edu/"><span><span>Duke University School of Medicine</span></span></a><span><span>. “Numerous lines of data suggest environmental factors might play a prominent role in Parkinson’s disease, but such factors have for the most part not been identified.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Improperly disposed plastics have been shown to break into very small pieces and accumulate in water and food supplies, and were found in the blood of most adults in a recent study. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“Our study suggests that the emergence of micro and nanoplastics in the environment might represent a new toxin challenge with respect to Parkinson’s disease risk and progression,” West said. “This is especially concerning given the predicted increase in concentrations of these contaminants in our water and food supplies.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>West and colleagues in Duke’s </span></span><a href="https://nicholas.duke.edu/"><span><span>Nicholas School of the Environment</span></span></a><span><span> and the </span></span><a href="https://chem.duke.edu/"><span><span>Department of Chemistry</span></span></a><span><span> at </span></span><a href="https://trinity.duke.edu/"><span><span>Trinity College of Arts and Sciences</span></span></a><span><span> found that nanoparticles of the plastic polystyrene -- typically found in single use items such as disposable drinking cups and cutlery -- attract the accumulation of the protein known as alpha-synuclein. West said the study’s most surprising findings are the tight bonds formed between the plastic and the protein within the area of the neuron where these accumulations are congregating, the </span></span><span><span><span>lysosome.</span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Researchers said the plastic-protein accumulations happened across three different models performed in the study - in test tubes, cultured neurons, and mouse models of Parkinson’s disease. West said questions remain about how such interactions might be happening within humans and whether the type of plastic might play a role.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“While microplastic and nanoplastic contaminants are being closely evaluated for their potential impact in cancer and autoimmune diseases, the striking nature of the interactions we could observe in our models suggest a need for evaluating increasing nanoplastic contaminants on Parkinson’s disease and dementia risk and progression,” West said. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>“The technology needed to monitor nanoplastics is still at the earliest possible stages and not ready yet to answer all the questions we have,” he said. “But hopefully efforts in this area will increase rapidly, as we see what these particles can do in our models. If we know what to look out for, we can take the necessary steps to protect ourselves, without compromising all the benefits we reap every day from plastics.”</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The study was funded by in part by The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research and the Aligning Science Across Parkinson’s initiative (ASAP-020527).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In addition to West, study authors include Zhiyong Liu, Arpine Sokratian, Addison M. Duda, Enquan Xu, Christina Stanhope, Amber Fu, Samuel Strader, Huizhong Li, Yuan Yuan, Benjamin G. Bobay, Joana Sipe, Ketty Bai, Iben Lundgaard, Na Liu, Belinda Hernandez, Catherine Bowes Rickman, and Sara E. Miller.</span></span></span></span></p>

  </header>

  <div id="post_body_1136625"><p>A lot of people ask me what the ideal cofounder looks
like.&nbsp; I now have an answer: Greg Brockman.</p>

<p>Every successful startup I know has at least one person&nbsp;who
provides the force of will to make the startup happen. &nbsp;I’d thought a lot
about this in the abstract while advising YC startups, but until OpenAI I
hadn’t observed up close someone else drive the formation of a startup.</p>

<p>OpenAI wouldn’t have happened without Greg. &nbsp;He commits
quickly and fully to things. &nbsp;I organized a group dinner early on to talk about
what such an organization might look like, and drove him home afterwards.&nbsp;
Greg asked me questions for the first half of the drive back to San Francisco,
then declared he was in, and started planning logistics for the rest of the
drive.</p>

<p>From then on he was fully in, with an average email response
time of about 5 minutes to anything.&nbsp; Elon and I were both busy with day
jobs, but Greg kept everything moving forward with imperfect information and a
very high-latency connection.</p>

<p>He recruited the founding team. &nbsp;Greg is a world-class recruiter
(he plans every detail of interviews, heavily researches candidate’s
backgrounds, sends thoughtful and persistent followups, and so on), and&nbsp;I
now believe even more strongly that someone on the founding team has to be an
amazing recruiter.</p>

<p>He’s incredibly open to feedback.&nbsp; Large or small, he’s
always willing to hear it, never gets offended, and processes it very
quickly.&nbsp; I once suggested to him that he wasn't communicating a bold
enough vision for the organization, and&nbsp;the next time I heard him talk
about it (and every time since) it was&nbsp;a perfectly calibrated explanation
of how we were going to succeed at something that really mattered.&nbsp; Even
on non-traditional ideas, like when I suggested he co-lead the organization with
Ilya, he was always open-minded and thoughtful.</p>

<p>Greg also played the role of ‘non-technical cofounder’, which is
a misnomer because most people who know him will say something like “Greg is
the most productive engineer I know”.&nbsp; But he took on all the
non-technical roles at the beginning, defining the culture, making offers,
organizing offsites, letting everyone work out of his apartment, ordering
supplies, cleaning up after meals, etc.&nbsp; It's important to have someone
great in this role at a small startup—many people gloss over it.</p>

<p>Without someone dedicated to finding a solution to all problems,
no matter how difficult, eventually a large problem will come along and kill you while you’re
still weak.&nbsp; Founding teams need a Chief
Optimist to rally everyone to press on despite the difficulties, and it’s always hard on that
person because they can’t really lean on anyone else in the hardest times.</p>

<p>You for sure need great technical talent on a founding team, but
make sure you also have someone like Greg.&nbsp; If they’re the same person,
then you’ve hit the jackpot.</p></div>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://duttakapil.com/posts/coding-is-hard">https://duttakapil.com/posts/coding-is-hard</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38322573">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><hr>
<p><strong><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38322573">Context for HN</a></strong></p>
<div><p>
It's 2 am here right now. I wrote this post very quickly in about 30 mins on the recommendation of a friend to just take my mind off things before going to sleep. I was not expecting it to get any real attention, and so did not attempt to provide much context in the post.
</p><p>Genuinely appreciate your comments, especially those with encouraging, emphatic words and guidance. Also great to read your own personal journeys as well.</p>
<p>Although I started learning to code 10 years ago, I have not actually been actively coding for all these years. I have worked as a full time dev professionally for maybe just 3 months, and quickly moved into management roles from there.</p>
<p>My primary expertise today is more towards product management, sales, marketing, etc than coding. I currently work in a Enterprise Sales role, and my goal is still being an entrepreneur and building companies.</p>
<p>Zooming out and looking at my entire history, I have spent very little actual time coding. This is the primary reason behind the struggle I express in this post. I feel frustrated with how much little time I have put into it over the years, and how little progress I have made.</p>
<p>Also, perhaps important to note, I have diagnosed ADHD, chronic anxiety disorder and some level of bipolar as well. I don't like to attach these as part of my personality, but it explains a lot of my impulsivity, grandiose thinking and mood swings, which contribute to my frustration significantly as well. Also the reason why I could never learn well in classroom or with tutors. Self-learning has always worked better for me.</p>
<p>The post is intentionally very generic and vague, and doesn't give any specific examples of what I was struggling with and why, simply because it was more of an emotional post to express my frustration from the past week. I also have not written anything in a long time, so this was a good excuse for me to quickly write and publish something.</p>
<p>I recently started working on a new side project, and I have a team of people working with me, but we have been falling short of hands, and so I decided to get more involved in the development, and things were going great until last week when I started trying to refactor our codebase. I hit many walls with things I did not fully deeply understand, and struggling to keep track of a lot of different changes as I was making them - thus ending up breaking things and compounding my frustration even more.</p>
<p>I am currently strongly motivated to get better at coding. That is what prompted me to talk to my friend, who is the best engineer I know, and who encouraged me to write down my thoughts and publish them.</p>
<p>I am certain that with persistence and consistency, I would get through and not struggle as much as I have in the past week.</p>
</div><p>
___
</p><h2>Coding is actually hard</h2>
<p>I was 15 years old, inspired by Zuckerberg and Jobs, brimming with ideas for companies I wanted to build when I grew older. My strategy was simple, find great engineers and work with them to build great companies. I was supposed to be Steve Jobs, just waiting to meet his Steve Wozniak.</p>
<p>I was the "ideas guy", unironically, but one day, when sharing this <em>brilliant</em> strategy of mine casually with a friend, he asked me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friend : "why not do it yourself?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me - "what do you mean?"</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Friend : "why not write the code and build the ideas yourself?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I didn't have any good reason why, and it made me suddenly feel very embarrassed and dumb. It made me pause and rethink about my life -</p>
<p>"why not build it myself? Why not learn to code? Why can I not learn this thing that so many other people have learnt? I am smart enough, right? I should be able to teach myself how to code. All the information is already available online, for free. I can do it. This would be easy for me!"</p>
<p>And so my journey began to learn to code, all by myself, through the internet.</p>
<p>At first, I started with a few simple resources like W3Schools, learing the basics of HTML. I built basic websites and blogs on Google Sites, Weebly, WordPress, Blogger etc. But that was not sufficient.</p>
<p>At 17, after finishing highschool, I took a gap year and started with Codecademy. I went through all the tracks, from basic HTML (again) to JavaScript and even Ruby amd Python. And I was super proud of myself for doing just that. I then started this 2-day python crash course published by a Google Engineer, then stumbled through many more resources, blogs, just watching their courses and learning within their sandbox environments without actually building anything on my system. I then discovered freeCodeCamp by Quincy Larson, and jumped right into it. I also started CS50 at the same time and had challenged myself to finish the 12 week course within 4 weeks.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn everything. I wanted to master everything. I wanted to prove to myself that I was smart, that all the adults in my life who told me I was "dumb and stupid" because I couldn't excell at school were wrong. I was <strong>not dumb</strong>, I was <strong>not an idiot</strong>, I could do it.</p>
<p>And that was when reality slapped me really hard for the first time on my face.</p>
<p>I was done with all the hand-holding exercises, I was done with all the reading material, docs, course videos. I understood a lot, I felt like I was a master already, and then I had to actually sit down and write code, on my system. I had to open the blank editor and write stuff in it and make it run and work. I had to actually solve the weekly pset challenges from CS50, and I just couldn't. Forget about finishing the entire course in 4 weeks, I was stuck on just one single problem for more than 2 weeks.</p>
<p>I couldn't do it. My mind was blank, I had no idea where to begin, what to write, how to actually code. I felt <strong>dumb</strong>. I felt <strong>stupid</strong>. I wanted to give up. I felt that I couldn't do this, that I was a fraud, I couldn't actually learn this stuff. I was fooling myself into thinking I was capable of going through this and making it to the other side. I expected everything to be easy for me, I expected my mind to sail smoothly across, but it did not. It crashed, it hit walls and it broke down.</p>
<p>I decided to take some time for myself, reflected, questioned if I really want to continue doing this. I was ashamed. Embarrassed. I couldn't accept it, I had to get through somehow. I couldn't just give up. How can this be the end of my journey?</p>
<p>And so, I persisted, and persisted, and kept fighting through what seemed like an endless barrage of walls and problems that I kept hitting against, getting stuck, feeling lost, feeling stupid, feeling like I could never figure this shit out. And somehow I made it through to the other side, I finished my first ever website, my first project, I finished the pset, I made it through.</p>
<p>That's when I decided that I didn't need to go to college. I could just teach myself, for free, through all these online resources.</p>
<p>But it never stopped being difficult. I would keep progressing, I would keep learning and growing, but this entire experience of hitting walls and feeling lost, feeling dumb and stupid, feeling like it's too hard for me to even grasp and figure out, just kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>Even after going through that experience multiple times, I still continue to live inside this bubble - I expect it to be easy for me, I expect it to be smooth sailing, just rapidly coding and building things without hitting walls, and every single time, I hit those walls, and fall back down to feeling like shit.</p>
<p>Personally for me, over time, this has psychologically made me want to avoid coding as much as possible. I don't like feeling dumb. It really triggers the insecurities inside me, it makes me think all those adults from my childhood were right about me - that I am stupid. It makes me feel like an imposter, a fraud who pretends to be smart but is actually very dumb. And people are gonna see it, they will catch me, and this whole charade will collapse.</p>
<p>It's been 10 years since I first started learning how to code. And I still struggle with it, a lot. I am not consistent. Honestly, it makes me feel very anxious to even think about coding, just from the anticipation of "what if I can't figure it out? What if I can't make it work? What if everyone around me thinks that I am dumb and stupid?"</p>
<p>I am writing this blog post today because I have been struggling for the past week. I have been working on something, and I was expecting it to be very easy, smooth sailing for me. On the high level, it's all very simple stuff. It's just refactoring the codebase a bit, reorganizing it, making it cleaner and more structured, and it's supposed to be easy.</p>
<p>And yet, every single day, I have felt frustrated, annoyed with myself and the problem I am trying to solve, mentally exhausted, stupid, dumb, feeling as if my brain is just incapable of grasping these simple concepts, keeping these simple details in mind.</p>
<p>I forget how something was setup in some section of some file, and write code in another file and it just breaks the entire logic. I feel frustrated that I cannot upload and maintain the entire logical map of even this very small and simple codebase in my mind.</p>
<p>I think of a solution to a problem, go into it with the assumption that I know everything already on how to do it, and suddenly realize that I <strong>do not, in fact, know anything about it</strong>.</p>
<p>I go back to the basics, again and again and again.</p>
<p>I relearn simple concepts, again and again and again.</p>
<p>I feel dumb and stupid. I feel like giving up.</p>
<p>I make very little progress, make something work, but then discover another thing is not working anymore properly. I have broken what was already working. I feel annoyed and frustrated, and just leave the code as it is, and not even touch it for the entire day.</p>
<p>I come back to it the next day, and suddenly I see things a bit more clearly. I keep working, keep hacking at it, keep chipping away at the problems, the bugs, and I find myself again breaking things, the code not working, simple things that were functional breaking apart, and I get angry and frustrated at myself and give up again for the day.</p>
<p>Going though this every day, makes me wonder - am I really meant for this? Is my brain actually capable for this type of thing? should I just find other people to work on it, people who are much more smarter and patient and disciplined than me? should I give up?</p>
<p>I really want to give up. But then, I ask myself, is this it? Is this really the end of my journey? How can I leave something in the middle of working on it? How can I stop at things not working? I need to finish this, no matter how hard it appears.</p>
<p>And I keep chipping away, keep fighting against this endless barrage of walls and problems, with the childlike hope that I will somehow make it to the other side.</p>
<p>Maybe some day it will get easier, or maybe this is what it's always going to be like.</p>
<p>The only question I ask myself is, what is the alternative? If not this, then what? And honestly, I have no good answers. As frustrating as coding can be, I am still in love with it. I love to see my code work, I love it when people can use it, play with it. I love building things, solving problems. I love making progress through difficult challenges.</p>
<p>Coding is actually hard, but you can make it through. Just keep chipping away at the problem, one bug at a time.</p>
<p>You can do it.</p>

                        <p>Northwestern University researchers have raised the standards again for perovskite solar cells with a new development that helped the emerging technology hit new records for efficiency.</p><p>The findings, <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adk1633">published today (Nov. 17) in the journal Science</a>, describe a dual-molecule solution to overcoming losses in efficiency as sunlight is converted to energy. By incorporating first, a molecule to address something called surface recombination, in which electrons are lost when they are trapped by defects — missing atoms on the surface, and a second molecule to disrupt recombination at the interface between layers, the team achieved a National Renewable Energy Lab (NREL) certified efficiency of 25.1% where earlier approaches reached efficiencies of just 24.09%.</p><p>“Perovskite solar technology is moving fast, and the emphasis of research and development is shifting from the bulk absorber to the interfaces,” said Northwestern professor <a href="https://chemistry.northwestern.edu/people/core-faculty/profiles/ted-sargent.html">Ted Sargent</a>. “This is the critical point to further improve efficiency and stability and bring us closer to this promising route to ever-more-efficient solar harvesting.”</p><p>Sargent is the co-executive director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://trienens-institute.northwestern.edu/">Paula M. Trienens Institute for Sustainability and Energy</a>&nbsp;(formerly ISEN) and a multidisciplinary researcher in materials chemistry and energy systems, with appointments in the department of chemistry in the&nbsp;<a href="https://weinberg.northwestern.edu/">Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences</a>&nbsp;and the department of electrical and computer engineering in the&nbsp;<a href="https://mccormick.northwestern.edu/">McCormick School of Engineering</a>.</p><p>Conventional solar cells are made of high-purity silicon wafers that are energy-intensive to produce and can only absorb a fixed range of the solar spectrum.</p><p>Perovskite materials whose size and composition can be adjusted to “tune” the wavelengths of light they absorb, making them a favorable and potentially lower-cost, high-efficiency emerging tandem technology.</p><p>Historically perovskite solar cells have been plagued by challenges to improve efficiency because of their relative instability. Over the past few years, advances from&nbsp;<a href="https://light.northwestern.edu/">Sargent’s lab</a>&nbsp;and others have brought the efficiency of perovskite solar cells to within the same range as what is achievable with silicon.</p><p>In the present research, rather than trying to help the cell absorb more sunlight, the team focused on the issue of maintaining and retaining generated electrons to increase efficiency. When the perovskite layer contacts the electron transport layer of the cell, electrons move from one to the other. But the electron can move back outward and fill, or “recombine” with holes that exist on the perovskite layer.</p><p>“Recombination at the interface is complex,” said first author Cheng Liu, a postdoctoral student in the Sargent lab, which is co-supervised by the Charles E. and Emma H. Morrison&nbsp;Professor of Chemistry Mercouri Kanatzidis. “It’s very difficult to use one type of molecule to address complex recombination and retain electrons, so we considered what combination of molecules we could use to more comprehensively solve the problem.”</p><p>Past research from Sargent’s team has found evidence that one molecule, PDAI<sub>2</sub>, does a good job at solving interface recombination. Next they needed to find a molecule that would work to repair surface defects and prevent electrons from recombining with them.</p><p>By finding the mechanism that would allow PDAI<sub>2</sub> to work with a secondary molecule, the team narrowed in on sulfur, which could replace carbon groups — typically poor at preventing electrons from moving — to cover missing atoms and suppress recombination.</p><p>"In addressing the core inefficiencies found in inverted perovskite solar cells, which are predominantly due to nonradiative recombination losses, a new standard in solar cell efficiency is being set," said Northwestern professor Mercouri Kanatzidis. "This is a prime illustration of how the field of advanced materials chemistry can significantly enhance the energy conversion efficiency and longevity of emerging perovskite photovoltaic technologies."</p><p>Kanatzidis is a leading authority in the field of materials chemistry and sustainable energy solutions, with dual appointments in Weinberg’s department of chemistry and McCormick’s department of materials science and engineering.</p><p>"We are excited that our bimolecular strategy shows applicability to a range of perovskite compositions, including those that are promising for tandem solar cells," said Bin Chen, research assistant professor of chemistry and a co-author on the paper.</p><p>A recent paper by the same group published in Nature developed a coating for the substrate beneath the perovskite layer to help the cell work at a higher temperature for a longer period. This solution, according to Liu, can work in tandem with the findings within the Science paper.&nbsp;</p><p>While the team hopes their findings will encourage the larger scientific community to continue moving the work forward, they too will be working on follow-ups.</p><p>“We have to use a more flexible strategy to solve the complex interface problem,” Cheng said. “We can’t only use one kind of molecule, as people previously did. We use two molecules to solve two kinds of recombination, but we are sure there’s more kinds of defect-related recombination at the interface. We need to try to use more molecules to come together and make sure all molecules work together without destroying each other’s functions.”</p>

<h3>from the <i>you-both-serve-the-public.-try-that-out-sometime.</i> dept</h3>

<p>There’s nothing new about cop shops letting their tech providers write their press releases for them. Law enforcement officers <em>love</em> power but often think nothing of surrendering their autonomy to the providers of the snooping tools.</p>
<p>For years, Harris Corporation — the maker of Stingray devices — told cops what they could or couldn’t say about their use of the tech, tying them up (often <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/05/18/fbi-says-it-has-no-idea-why-law-enforcement-agencies-are-following-terms-stingray-non-disclosure-agreements/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/05/18/fbi-says-it-has-no-idea-why-law-enforcement-agencies-are-following-terms-stingray-non-disclosure-agreements/">with the help</a> of the FBI) with <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/01/25/harris-stingray-nondisclosure-agreement-forbids-cops-telling-legislators-about-surveillance-tech/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2018/01/25/harris-stingray-nondisclosure-agreement-forbids-cops-telling-legislators-about-surveillance-tech/">non-disclosure agreements</a>. Ring — the biggest name in front-door surveillance — has given cops cameras to hand out in exchange for expanding its customer base and <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/07/30/amazons-free-doorbell-cameras-only-cost-law-enforcement-agencies-their-dignity-autonomy/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2019/07/30/amazons-free-doorbell-cameras-only-cost-law-enforcement-agencies-their-dignity-autonomy/">allowing Ring to man the PR front</a>.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/09/07/police-chief-says-hell-decide-who-is-isnt-real-journalist/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2017/09/07/police-chief-says-hell-decide-who-is-isnt-real-journalist/">there’s nothing new</a> about so-called journalists <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/28/media-critic-calls-journalists-to-be-obedient-stenographers/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2016/11/28/media-critic-calls-journalists-to-be-obedient-stenographers/">acting as stenographers</a> for cops. When something happens that suggests police misconduct, <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/06/11/every-kill-good-kill-how-police-media-cooperate-to-disparage-dead/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2015/06/11/every-kill-good-kill-how-police-media-cooperate-to-disparage-dead/">some journalists do nothing more</a> than publish PD press releases and/or seek comment only from law enforcement PR reps or (vomits in mouth) police union representatives.</p>
<p>Perhaps its these years of underservice that has led to press outlets publishing full-page ads for tech providers, apparently without feeling they might be crossing ethical lines. That’s what’s being called out by the EFF in its post titled “<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/rise-police-advertiser" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/11/rise-police-advertiser">The Rise of the Police-Advertiser.</a>” Who exactly is being served when “journalists” add a couple of sentences to name brand heavy posts that unabashedly celebrate the products and the cops that claim these tech marvels pretty much pay for themselves?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In August, the Tulsa police department held a&nbsp;<a href="https://ktul.com/news/local/tulsa-police-to-hold-press-conference-about-success-of-flock-safety-devices">press conference</a>&nbsp;about how its new Automated License Plate Readers (ALPRs), a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/flock-license-plate-reader-homeowners-association-safe-problems">controversial</a>&nbsp;piece of surveillance technology, was the policing equivalent of “turning the lights on” for the first time. In Ontario, California, the city put out a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontarioca.gov/press_releases/flock-cameras-assist-apprehension-burglary-suspect">press release</a>&nbsp;about how its ALPRs were a “vital resource.” In Madison, South Dakota,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dakotanewsnow.com/2022/09/01/how-states-first-flock-safety-camera-busted-car-thieves-madison/">local news</a>&nbsp;covered how the city’s expenditure of $30,000 for ALPRs “paid off” twice in two days. &nbsp;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s go to the local piece (he said, living in South Dakota). Here’s an eagle-eye view of this so-called reporting, with the name brand of the tech central to piece highlighted:</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Does that look like journalism to you? Flock flock flock flock flock flock flock. Six times, including the headline. This is an advertisement for Flock, published for free by KSFY and distributed by other local news sources who had to do nothing but credit KSFY for its original “reporting.” That’s six mentions of Flock and a couple of statements from a PD official who saw the plate readers hit twice and somehow decided this was newsworthy enough he should call the local station.</p>
<p>Or maybe Madison Police Chief Justin Meyer didn’t even have to place a call. Maybe all he needed to do was insert a few words into Flock’s PR boilerplate and email it to the nearest news agencies. That’s what Flock does: it writes most of the words and instructs cops to fill in the blanks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Flock Safety has distributed a&nbsp;<a href="https://flocksafety.showpad.com/share/v7QdbufyT5cXl2UQzowre">Public Information Officer Toolkit</a>, providing “resources and templates for public information officers.” A Flock draft press release states:</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The ___ Police Department has solved [CRIME] with the help of their Flock Safety camera system. Flock Safety ALPR cameras help law enforcement investigate crime by providing objective evidence. [CRIME DETAILS AND STORY] ____ Police installed Flock cameras on [DATE] to solve and reduce crime in [CITY].</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This Mad Libs of a press release is an advertisement, and one Flock hopes your police departments will distribute so that they can sell more ALPRs.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only hope some news outlet lets one of these hit the front page of their website with half-completed boilerplate. Sooner or later, someone from the cop PR department is going to send out an email blast that trumpets the success of [INSERT TECH PROVIDER] in solving [CRIME DETAILS AND STORY].</p>
<p>Flock isn’t alone. In addition to the previously mentioned Harris and Ring, ShotSpotter has its own PR wing that pretty much composes press releases for cops and pushes them to become unpaid brand ambassadors for a brand <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/08/23/investigation-shotspotters-practices-is-raising-questions-companys-angry-statement-really-doesnt-answer/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2021/08/23/investigation-shotspotters-practices-is-raising-questions-companys-angry-statement-really-doesnt-answer/">so controversial</a> it recently <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/19/shotspotter-attempts-to-memory-hole-itself-rebrands-as-soundthinking/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.techdirt.com/2023/04/19/shotspotter-attempts-to-memory-hole-itself-rebrands-as-soundthinking/">rebranded</a> as “SoundThinking.”</p>
<blockquote>

In the area of public relations, we work closely with many of our customers to help them communicate the success of ShotSpotter to their local media and communities.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ugly stuff. Not only does it damage the trustworthiness of journalistic outlets, it makes cops appear to be nothing more than pushers of tech company propaganda. None of this appears organic. And that’s because none of it is.</p>
<p>In both cases, the public is being screwed by entities they’d rather trust. The sad thing is neither of these entities appear to care they’re harming their relationship with the people they serve. Understaffed news desks are more than happy to simply republish garbage like this because it frees them up to handle stuff they actually care about. And cops are only too happy to do this because it means their tech supplier will be pleased with their obeisance and possibly shower them with freebies or preferential pricing.</p>
