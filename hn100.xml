<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="maincontent"><p>In a victory for privacy advocates and consumers, the California governor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gavin-newsom" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">Gavin Newsom</a> signed a bill that would enable residents to request that their personal information be deleted from the coffers of all the data brokers in the state.</p><p>The bill, SB 362, otherwise known as the Delete Act, was introduced in April 2023 by the state senator Josh Becker in an attempt to give Californians more control over their privacy. Californians already have a right to request their data be deleted under current state privacy laws, but it requires filing a request with each individual company.</p><p>The new bill reinforces that all data brokers must register with the California privacy protection agency, and it requires the CPPA to establish an easy and free way for Californians to request that all data brokers in the state delete their data through a single page, regardless of how they acquired that information. If data brokers don’t comply with these rules, the bill stipulates they be fined or otherwise penalized.</p><figure id="924f75b4-ac63-4e6b-b1ee-77596a07af3b" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement"><gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props="{&quot;richLinkIndex&quot;:3,&quot;element&quot;:{&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/13/twitter-elon-musk-takeover-ftc-order-data-security-privacy-doj-case&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Twitter chaos after Elon Musk takeover may have violated privacy order, DoJ alleges&quot;,&quot;prefix&quot;:&quot;Related: &quot;,&quot;role&quot;:&quot;richLink&quot;,&quot;elementId&quot;:&quot;924f75b4-ac63-4e6b-b1ee-77596a07af3b&quot;},&quot;ajaxUrl&quot;:&quot;https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:{&quot;display&quot;:0,&quot;theme&quot;:0,&quot;design&quot;:0}}" config="{&quot;renderingTarget&quot;:&quot;Web&quot;}"></gu-island></figure><p>“Governor Newsom’s signature of the Delete Act enshrines California as a leader in consumer privacy, and we are determined to restore consumers’ control over their own personal data,” said Becker. “Data brokers possess thousands of data points on each and every one of us, and they currently sell reproductive healthcare, geolocation and purchasing data to the highest bidder. The Delete Act protects our most sensitive information.”</p><p>While proponents of the bill have lauded it as a less tedious and more user-friendly way to reinforce existing California privacy laws, many advertising companies have argued it would undermine their industry. Those companies buy and sell consumer information such as location, address, online activity and more to various clients including law enforcement.</p><p>“Absent this data, smaller enterprises will lose a critical path to reach and attract new customers, and consumers overall will have less exposure to new products and services that may interest them,” a group of ad trade bodies wrote in a letter<a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/ad-trade-bodies-campaign-against-california-delete-act/" data-link-name="in body link"> first reported by Adweek</a>.</p><p>Rob Shavell, the CEO of Delete Me, a company that helps people get their personal information off various data brokers, said data brokers may have been taken by surprise by the groundswell of support for the bill because “they lobbied hard against this in creative ways with a lot of scare tactics”.</p><p>Civil liberties and privacy advocates have long called for stronger regulations around the data broker industry, citing concerns about the lack of transparency into when and how consumer data is sold and shared and the ability for law enforcement to skip subpoenas or warrants by simply buying otherwise inaccessible personal information from a private company. The Delete Act “will improve everyone’s privacy rights and make California’s consumer privacy laws more user-friendly, while also strengthening current California law that requires data brokers to register with the state”, said Hayley Tsukayama, the associate director of legislative activism at digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>In the past, as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/us-immigration-agency-data-loophole-information-deportation-targets" data-link-name="in body link">Guardian first reported</a>, agencies like the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency have used data brokers to get around local laws such as sanctuary policies that prohibit state or city agencies from aiding with immigration investigations. One of the most popular global Muslim prayer apps was also revealed to have sold location information to a data broker, which in turn worked with military defense contractors, prompting mass calls to delete and stop using the app.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-10">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-10" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>However, though the bill is seen in large part as a success, Shavell says its limitations lie in the exemptions the author of the bill made for some companies Delete Me would otherwise consider data brokers because they “certainly have a lot of information about citizens”.</p><p>The state will have until 2026 to implement the Delete Act, but many still have questions about what mechanisms agencies will use to enforce the new rules as passed.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>The <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-15-pro/">iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max</a> feature <em>log</em> video recording. This is a big deal, but there’s already some confusion about it. Where consumer devices and pro video overlap, that’s where the Prolost Signal gleams brightest in the night sky. So let’s get to work.</p>
<p>First, what exactly is log? It’s short for logarithmic encoding, which is a math thing, but what does it mean to videographers?</p>
<p>It really boils down to two things: Log is <em><a href="https://prolost.com/flat">flat</a>,</em> and log is <em>known.</em></p>
<h2 id="flat-is-good-and-log-is-the-best-flat">Flat is Good, and Log is the Best Flat</h2>
<p>Standard iPhone video is designed to look <em>good.</em> A very specific kind of good that comes from lots of contrast, punchy, saturated colors, and ample detail in both highlights and shadows.</p>

All the dynamic range and detail are there, but gone is that candy-coated punch. To make log footage look right, you have to color manage it in some way, often with a Look-Up Table, or “LUT.”</p>
<p>A LUT is just a color adjustment baked into a single file. Some LUTs add creative looks, others are more utilitarian, converting images from one color space to another — like from log to video.</p>
<p>If all we’re going to do with log footage is apply a LUT to make it look normal, what’s the big deal? Why add this extra step?</p>
<p>The power log gives us lies within that extra step, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>You pick the LUT! So log footage can look however you want. Sure, you can apply LUTs or color grading to regular iPhone footage, but the problem is it already has its own very punchy look baked in. With log you can pick the look that works for you, and even more importantly...</li>
<li>You can color grade <em>under</em> the LUT. So you can adjust the color of the footage in a natural and organic way.</li>
<li>And this workflow matches what you’re doing with your digital cinema camera already, so you can color-manage this footage right into a timeline with your Canon, Sony, Arri, or whatever else you’ve got.</li>

<p>But what is the <em>log</em> of log? What does this math concept mean to me?</p>
<p>The essence of log (in its purest form) is that <a href="https://prolost.com/log">every stop of light gets the same amount of data</a>. Ten-bit footage holds 1,024 shades of gray. To represent 12 stops of light values (or dynamic range), that means each stop gets about 85 shades of gray.</p>
<p>This means highlights and shadows all have detail that you can access for basic color corrections like exposure and white balance. You can recover some shadow and highlight detail, and make substantial color adjustments that look natural.</p>

Since each stop (in our semi-made-up example) is 85 shades of gray, <strong>adding 85 to the value of each RGB pixel is the same as increasing the exposure by one stop.</strong></p><p>We call this adding and subtracting <em>Offset</em>, and Davinci Resolve has a whole color wheel devoted to it. In Magic Bullet Looks, the <strong>Global</strong> color wheel in the <strong>4-Way Color Tool</strong> does an offset adjustment in ACES log, even if your source footage isn’t log. With log footage, Offset is the most natural way to correct, tint, or re-expose your footage.</p>
</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_248572"><p>These kinds of simple corrections look terrible when done <em>after</em> the LUT, or to video-space footage, but when you do them to the log pixels <em>before</em> the LUT, the results look so natural, it almost appears that they happened in-camera. This makes it much easier to achieve consistent color across shots, as they all get the same last step. This is why it’s such a common workflow to put Magic Bullet Looks, for example, in an adjustment layer over all the shots in a sequence.</p><h2 id="sun-dog">Sun Dog</h2><p>Log corrections look natural in part because the simple color-grading math lines up with how light works. They also look great because of the available dynamic range.</p><p>If I try to recover some of the detail in my dog’s sun-lit fur, this iPhone 12 footage rapidly falls apart. The iPhone added contrast, and in doing so smooshed the white values into a uniform overexposed patch. Nearby colors are posterized, and the clipped highlights give the clip away as consumer video.</p>

So log is best when it’s at a high bit depth and data rate. Apple Log is only available when recording in ProRes, which is typically 10 bits-per-channel. Apple added ProRes with the iPhone 13, but without log it wasn’t very “pro,” and I almost never used it. The baked-in look made grading difficult, so there was no reason to take on the burden of the massive files.</p><h2 id="heavy-is-the-prores-dangly-is-the-drive">Heavy is the ProRes, Dangly is the Drive</h2>

Apple shocked us all by addressing this head-on: The iPhone 15 line charges via USB-C instead of Lightning, and this standard USB port can do a <em>lot.</em> When you connect a <a href="https://amzn.to/45jdDyM">USB-C drive</a>, your ProRes Log video automatically gets recorded there instead of to the phone’s photo library.</p>
<p>Recording this way also unlocks 4K 60fps recording in Apple’s Camera app, enabling some gorgeous slow motion effects when played back at 24 fps.</p>

<p>With its high bit depth and dynamic range, <a href="https://prolost.com/raw">log footage has many of the benefits of raw</a>. But Apple Log is not raw, and not even “straight off the sensor.” It’s still heavily processed — denoised, tone-mapped, and color adjusted. You can see this big time if you shoot bright, colorful lights. Even though Apple has turned their sharpening and tone mapping way down for Apple Log, there’s still some of that telltale overdriving of super-bright, super-saturated colors.</p>
<p>It’s also important to note that log does not mean you’ll never overexpose. It’s still an iPhone with a tiny sensor, so don’t expect the dynamic range of an Arri Alexa or a Sony Venice.</p><h2 id="blackmagic-camera-app">Blackmagic Camera App</h2><p>The other way Apple doesn’t quite live up to the “pro” promise of log is by not offering much manual control in their camera app — and that’s totally fine. Because all the control you could want is found in the wonderful new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackmagic-camera/id6449580241">Blackmagic Camera app</a>. It’s a free download, presumably meant as a gateway drug to Blackmagic’s paid products and services. It’s a terrific app with a gorgeous UI and pro features like a live histogram, display LUTs, HDMI out via USB-C, and choices of different ProRes formats.</p>

<p>The flatness of log gives you the power to make it your own in the grade. The other huge advantage of log is that it is <em>known,</em> meaning it’s possible to convert it to and from various color spaces accurately. This is a huge advantage for VFX artists and colorists alike. Colorists can convert Apple Log to whatever color space they like to work in, and accurately incorporate iPhone footage into any color timeline. VFX artists can convert their log footage to scene-refererred linear and create accurate composites that include color-matched 3D renders.</p>
<p>In this example, I converted the footage to EXR and camera-mapped it onto simple geometry in <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d">Cinema 4D</a>. In <a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/redshift">Redshift</a>, those HDR pixel values cast light and reflections onto the 3D model, doing 90% of my lighting for me:</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_12278"><h2 id="aces-compatible-">ACES Compatible?</h2>
<p>Apple’s log format being <em>known</em> is all it takes for compatibility with <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/aces">ACES</a>, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences color management system. But it’s important to note that Apple Log does not match any pre-existing ACES format.</p>
<p>The log curve is Apple’s own, which they’ve <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/">documented</a>, and it’s already available in DaVinci Resolve. In the CST node, choose <strong>Apple Log</strong> for the <strong>Input Gamma</strong>, but choose <strong>Rec. 2020</strong> for the <strong>Input Color Space</strong>, because Apple Log uses the Rec. 2020 primaries.</p>
<p>With these as your inputs, you can either convert to Rec. 709 video, or to an ACES format like ACEScc — which is also log, but a different log.</p>
<p>Remember when I said log uses the same amount of data for each stop? That’s not entirely true with Apple Log. The darker stops are compressed a bit, to control noise. If you’re familiar with ACES, this makes Apple Log more similar to <strong>ACEScct</strong> than to <strong>ACEScc</strong>. Many colorists prefer working with ACEScct because of the way it handles shadows, so Apple is in good company here.</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_26408"><p>Along with documenting their unique transfer function, Apple has <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/all/">supplied a LUT</a> for converting from Apple Log to Rec. 709 video. Apple’s LUT is very rich in contrast and saturation. This is useful if your goal is to match the look of non-log iPhone footage, but I found it too colorful for some applications, so I created my own LUTs that roll highlight colors off more naturally.</p></div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_107050"><p>While Resolve and Final Cut Pro both offer built-in support for Apple Log, some other tools don’t yet. So I also made LUTs for converting Apple Log to <strong>ACEScc</strong> and <strong>ACEScct</strong> — the ACES log formats designed for creative color work. With these LUTs, you can incorporate Apple Log footage into an existing ACES workflow without losing any color fidelity.</p>
<p>To some, true ACES compatibility would require Apple Log’s inclusion in widely distributed ACES OCIO configs. Until that happens, Apple Log is ACES-compatible as long as you have a color-space conversion bridge — something like either the CST node in Resolve or the Prolost Apple Log LUTs, available below as a free download.</p>
<h2 id="magic-bullet-magic">Magic Bullet Magic</h2>
<p>With this workflow, I was able to run some iPhone 15 Pro Max footage through the ACES-compatible Magic Bullet Looks, using our new Diffusion filters modeled after real-world filters from Tiffen and others. Along with some basic grading, I also added some film halation and grain. The results have a rich, cinematic look that in no way betrays that it was shot on a consumer phone.</p>

</div><div data-block-type="44" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1696911071259_35573"><h2 id="rebel-without-an-excuse">Rebel Without an Excuse</h2><p>The argument about whether it makes any sense to shoot professional video on a consumer device dates back to before my book, <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3LNi66c">The DV Rebel’s Guide</a>.</em> I love small, accessible cameras that allow us to <a href="https://prolost.com/blog/2008/11/23/the-bourne-inspiration.html">shoot unnoticed in public places</a>, but for years I discouraged the use of phones for this, because the ability to control and author the image just wasn’t there.</p><p>Now that the iPhone can shoot log, is the best camera the one you literally always have with you, or, you know, an actual good camera? The iPhone 15 Pro Max is going to tempt you to shoot real stuff with your telephone, and for the first time ever, I’ll be right there with you, thanks to log.</p>

<p>Brunel worked for several years as an assistant engineer on the project to create a tunnel under London's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotherhithe" title="Rotherhithe">Rotherhithe</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wapping" title="Wapping">Wapping</a>, with tunnellers driving a horizontal shaft from one side of the river to the other under the most difficult and dangerous conditions. The project was funded by the Thames Tunnel Company and Brunel's father, Marc, was the chief engineer.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200214–15_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200214–15-19">[19]</a></sup> The <i>American Naturalist</i> said "It is stated also that the operations of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_navalis" title="Teredo navalis">Teredo</a> [Shipworm] suggested to Mr. Brunel his method of tunnelling the Thames."<sup id="cite_ref-20"><a href="#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup>
</p><p>The composition of the riverbed at Rotherhithe was often little more than waterlogged sediment and loose gravel. An ingenious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnelling_shield" title="Tunnelling shield">tunnelling shield</a> designed by Marc Brunel helped protect workers from cave-ins,<sup id="cite_ref-21"><a href="#cite_note-21">[21]</a></sup> but two incidents of severe flooding halted work for long periods, killing several workers and badly injuring the younger Brunel.<sup id="cite_ref-smith_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-smith-22">[22]</a></sup> The latter incident, in 1828, killed the two most senior miners, and Brunel himself narrowly escaped death. He was seriously injured and spent six months recuperating,<sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup> during which time he began a design for a bridge in Bristol, which would later be completed as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifton_Suspension_Bridge" title="Clifton Suspension Bridge">Clifton Suspension Bridge</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Britanica_2-1"><a href="#cite_note-Britanica-2">[2]</a></sup> The event stopped work on the tunnel for several years.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200215_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200215-24">[24]</a></sup>
</p><p>Though the Thames Tunnel was eventually completed during Marc Brunel's lifetime, his son had no further involvement with the tunnel proper, only using the abandoned works at Rotherhithe to further his abortive <i>Gaz</i> experiments. This was based on an idea of his father's and was intended to develop into an engine that ran on power generated from alternately heating and cooling carbon dioxide made from ammonium carbonate and sulphuric acid. Despite interest from several parties, the Admiralty included, the experiments were judged by Brunel to be a failure on the grounds of fuel economy alone, and were discontinued after 1834.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERolt198941–42_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERolt198941–42-25">[25]</a></sup>

<p>In the early part of Brunel's life, the use of railways began to take off as a major means of transport for goods. This influenced Brunel's involvement in railway engineering, including railway bridge engineering.<sup>[<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (April 2020)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup>
</p><p>In 1833, before the Thames Tunnel was complete, Brunel was appointed chief engineer of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Railway" title="Great Western Railway">Great Western Railway</a>, one of the wonders of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era" title="Victorian era">Victorian</a> Britain, running from London to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol" title="Bristol">Bristol</a> and later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exeter" title="Exeter">Exeter</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-BHO-Railways_43-0"><a href="#cite_note-BHO-Railways-43">[43]</a></sup> The company was founded at a public meeting in Bristol in 1833, and was incorporated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Act_of_Parliament" title="Act of Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> in 1835.
It was Brunel's vision that passengers would be able to purchase one ticket at London Paddington and travel from London to New York, changing from the Great Western Railway to the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Great_Western" title="SS Great Western">Great Western</a></i> steamship at the terminus in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyland" title="Neyland">Neyland</a>, West Wales.<sup id="cite_ref-BHO-Railways_43-1"><a href="#cite_note-BHO-Railways-43">[43]</a></sup> 
</p><p>He surveyed the entire length of the route between London and Bristol himself, with the help of many including his solicitor Jeremiah Osborne of Bristol Law Firm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Clarke" title="Osborne Clarke">Osborne Clarke</a> who on one occasion rowed Brunel down the River Avon to survey the bank of the river for the route.<sup id="cite_ref-Clifton_RFC_44-0"><a href="#cite_note-Clifton_RFC-44">[44]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Brunel_200_-_Working_With_Visionaries_45-0"><a href="#cite_note-Brunel_200_-_Working_With_Visionaries-45">[45]</a></sup> Brunel even designed the Royal Hotel in Bath which opened in 1846 opposite the railway station.<sup id="cite_ref-Royal_Hotel_Bath_46-0"><a href="#cite_note-Royal_Hotel_Bath-46">[46]</a></sup>
</p><p>Brunel made two controversial decisions: to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad-gauge_railway" title="Broad-gauge railway">broad gauge</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7-foot-%C2%BC-inch_gauge_railway" title="7-foot-¼-inch gauge railway"><span>7&nbsp;ft&nbsp;<span role="math"><span>1</span>⁄<span>4</span></span>&nbsp;in</span></a> (<span>2,140&nbsp;mm</span>) for the track, which he believed would offer superior running at high speeds; and to take a route that passed north of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlborough_Downs" title="Marlborough Downs">Marlborough Downs</a>—an area with no significant towns, though it offered potential connections to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gloucester" title="Gloucester">Gloucester</a>—and then to follow the Thames Valley into London. His decision to use broad gauge for the line was controversial in that almost all British railways to date had used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_gauge" title="Standard gauge">standard gauge</a>. Brunel said that this was nothing more than a carry-over from the mine railways that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stephenson" title="George Stephenson">George Stephenson</a> had worked on prior to making the world's first passenger railway. Brunel proved through both calculation and a series of trials that his broader gauge was the optimum size for providing both higher speeds<sup id="cite_ref-ReferenceA_47-0"><a href="#cite_note-ReferenceA-47">[47]</a></sup> and a stable and comfortable ride to passengers. In addition the wider gauge allowed for larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goods_wagon" title="Goods wagon">goods wagons</a> and thus greater freight capacity.<sup id="cite_ref-48"><a href="#cite_note-48">[48]</a></sup>

<p>Drawing on Brunel's experience with the Thames Tunnel, the Great Western contained a series of impressive achievements—soaring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viaduct" title="Viaduct">viaducts</a> such as the one in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivybridge" title="Ivybridge">Ivybridge</a>, specially designed stations, and vast tunnels including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Tunnel" title="Box Tunnel">Box Tunnel</a>, which was the longest railway tunnel in the world at that time.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200220_49-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200220-49">[49]</a></sup> There is an anecdote claiming that the Box Tunnel was deliberately aligned so that the rising sun shines all the way through it on Brunel's birthday.<sup id="cite_ref-50"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> With the opening of the Box Tunnel, the line from London to Bristol was complete and ready for trains on 30 June 1841.<sup id="cite_ref-MacD1_51-0"><a href="#cite_note-MacD1-51">[51]</a></sup>
</p><p>The initial group of locomotives ordered by Brunel to his own specifications proved unsatisfactory, apart from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWR_Star_Class" title="GWR Star Class">North Star locomotive</a>, and 20-year-old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Gooch" title="Daniel Gooch">Daniel Gooch</a> (later Sir Daniel) was appointed as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_mechanical_engineer" title="Chief mechanical engineer">Superintendent of Locomotive Engines</a>.

</p><p>After Brunel's death, the decision was taken that standard gauge should be used for all railways in the country. At the original Welsh terminus of the Great Western railway at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neyland" title="Neyland">Neyland</a>, sections of the broad gauge rails are used as handrails at the quayside, and information boards there depict various aspects of Brunel's life. There is also a larger-than-life bronze statue of him holding a steamship in one hand and a locomotive in the other. The statue has been replaced after an earlier theft.<sup id="cite_ref-53"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-54"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>
</p><p>The present <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London_Paddington_station" title="London Paddington station">London Paddington station</a> was designed by Brunel and opened in 1854.

<p>Though unsuccessful, another of Brunel's interesting use of technical innovations was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_railway" title="Atmospheric railway">atmospheric railway</a>, the extension of the Great Western Railway (GWR) southward from Exeter towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth,_England" title="Plymouth, England">Plymouth</a>, technically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Devon_Railway_Company" title="South Devon Railway Company">South Devon Railway</a> (SDR), though supported by the GWR. Instead of using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locomotive" title="Locomotive">locomotives</a>, the trains were moved by Clegg and Samuda's patented system of atmospheric (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum" title="Vacuum">vacuum</a>) traction, whereby stationary pumps sucked the air from a pipe placed in the centre of the track.<sup id="cite_ref-buchanan-atmosrwy_58-0"><a href="#cite_note-buchanan-atmosrwy-58">[58]</a></sup>

</p><p>The technology required the use of leather flaps to seal the vacuum pipes. The natural oils were drawn out of the leather by the vacuum, making the leather vulnerable to water, rotting it and breaking the fibres when it froze during the winter of 1847. It had to be kept supple with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tallow" title="Tallow">tallow</a>, which is attractive to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>.

<p>Brunel had proposed extending its transport network by boat from Bristol across the Atlantic Ocean to New York City before the Great Western Railway opened in 1835. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Western_Steamship_Company" title="Great Western Steamship Company">Great Western Steamship Company</a> was formed by Thomas Guppy for that purpose. It was widely disputed whether it would be commercially viable for a ship powered purely by steam to make such long journeys. Technological developments in the early 1830s—including the invention of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_condenser" title="Surface condenser">surface condenser</a>, which allowed boilers to run on salt water without stopping to be cleaned—made longer journeys more possible, but it was generally thought that a ship would not be able to carry enough fuel for the trip and have room for commercial cargo.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200657–59_66-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200657–59-66">[66]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173_67-0"><a href="#cite_note-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200234–46_68-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200234–46-68">[68]</a></sup>
</p><p>Brunel applied the experimental evidence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Beaufoy" title="Mark Beaufoy">Beaufoy</a><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBeaufoy1834_69-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBeaufoy1834-69">[69]</a></sup> and further developed the theory that the amount a ship could carry increased as the cube of its dimensions, whereas the amount of resistance a ship experienced from the water as it travelled increased by only a square of its dimensions.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEGarrison1998188_70-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGarrison1998188-70">[70]</a></sup> This would mean that moving a larger ship would take proportionately less fuel than a smaller ship.

<p>When it was built, the <i>Great Western</i> was the longest ship in the world at 236&nbsp;ft (72&nbsp;m) with a 250-foot (76&nbsp;m) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keel" title="Keel">keel</a>.

In addition to its steam-powered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddle_wheel" title="Paddle wheel">paddle wheels</a>, the ship carried four masts for sails. The <i>Great Western</i> embarked on her maiden voyage from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avonmouth" title="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a>, Bristol, to New York on 8 April 1838 with 600 long tons (610,000&nbsp;kg) of coal, cargo and seven passengers on board. Brunel himself missed this initial crossing, having been injured during a fire aboard the ship as she was returning from fitting out in London. As the fire delayed the launch several days, the <i>Great Western</i> missed its opportunity to claim the title as the first ship to cross the Atlantic under steam power alone.<sup id="cite_ref-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173_67-2"><a href="#cite_note-Beckett_2006,_pp._171–173-67">[67]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200658–59_71-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBuchanan200658–59-71">[71]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200226–32_72-0"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDumpletonMiller200226–32-72">[72]</a></sup>

In contrast, the <i>Great Western</i> crossing of the Atlantic took 15 days and five hours, and the ship arrived at her destination with a third of its coal still remaining, demonstrating that Brunel's calculations were correct. The <i>Great Western</i> had proved the viability of commercial transatlantic steamship service, which led the Great Western Steamboat Company to use her in regular service between Bristol and New York from 1838 to 1846. She made 64&nbsp;crossings, and was the first ship to hold the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Riband" title="Blue Riband">Blue Riband</a> with a crossing time of 13&nbsp;days westbound and 12&nbsp;days 6 hours eastbound.

<p>In 1854 and 1855, with the encouragement of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_Burgoyne" title="John Fox Burgoyne">John Fox Burgoyne</a>, Brunel presented the Admiralty with designs for floating gun batteries. These were intended as siege weapons for attacking Russian ports.

Specifically, our products are safeguarded by code developed in HAProxy 1.9, released in 2018. This applies to HAProxy, HAProxy Enterprise, HAProxy Kubernetes Ingress Controller, and HAProxy ALOHA. After rigorous testing, we have been able to confirm that our implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol can handle the Rapid Reset Attack without increasing the resource usage or compromising the parallelism of the protocol. We will continue to test and monitor, but the supported versions of our products are not vulnerable to the known attack vectors.</p><p>We will update this blog post with further news as it develops. Our customers can rest assured that we always develop our products with resource optimization in mind, which in this case explains why we are unaffected by the CPU issues.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><div dir="auto"><p><span>Tunneling is an important technology for modern civilization, as a tunnel is often the only reasonable way to create a direct path between two points. When the Hoosac tunnel was completed in 1875, it turned a difficult, 20-mile railroad route along “</span><a href="https://www.asce.org/about-civil-engineering/history-and-heritage/historic-landmarks/hoosac-tunnel" rel="">precipitous grades</a><span>” into a direct 5 mile route, connecting Boston with the Upper Hudson Valley. Large infrastructure projects such as hydroelectric dams often require tunnels to function. The Hoover Dam required more than 3 miles of tunnels 56 feet in diameter to </span><a href="https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/history/essays/tunnels.html" rel="">divert</a><span> the Colorado River around the construction site. And a tunnel can be used to create new land beneath dense urban areas, making it possible to build large-scale horizontal infrastructure like sewers or mass transit that wouldn’t be feasible to build above ground.</span></p><p><span>A common way of building a tunnel today is with a tunnel boring machine (TBM), particularly in urban areas where other construction methods such as drill-and-blast or cut-and-cover would be too disruptive. Of the 89 transit projects around the world that required tunneling in a </span><a href="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MYoQk/5/" rel="">dataset compiled by Britain Remade</a><span>, 80 of them used TBMs. But tunnel boring machines are a comparatively modern construction technology. The first successful rock tunneling machines weren’t invented until the 1950s, and into the late 1960s </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/rapidexcavationp0000tunn/page/284/mode/2up" rel="">most tunneling</a><span> was done using other construction methods. But as TBMs have improved, they have increasingly been the method of choice for tunneling through a wider variety of ground conditions. And while many construction tasks have resisted automation and mechanization, tunneling machinery has steadily gotten more automated, to the point where a modern TBM is akin to a mobile factory that burrows through the earth and constructs a tunnel behind it.</span></p><p>There are a variety of different types of machinery used to excavate tunnels. “Tunnel boring machines” use a rotating cutting head that engages with the entire face of the tunnel at once. This contrasts with something like a roadheader, which uses a much smaller cutter that moves back and forth over the face of the tunnel.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank"

Not a TBM</figcaption></figure></div><p>(The terminology around TBMs is somewhat non-standard. In some cases, any sort of mechanized tunnel shield gets referred to as a TBM. Other times TBM is used strictly for rock tunneling machines, and don’t include machines that tunnel through soil.)</p><p>All TBMs share several basic features. At the front, a rotating cutting head excavates the face of the tunnel. Excavated material, known as “muck," passes through openings in the cutting head and is removed by some sort of conveying system. To advance, a TBM uses large hydraulic cylinders to push off against either the excavated sides of the tunnel (in “gripper” TBMs) or against a prefabricated tunnel lining that has been installed around the inside of the excavated tunnel. Gripper TBMs are limited to use in rock, whereas TBMs that push against a segmented tunnel lining can also be used in soft ground. In soft ground, all this equipment is encased in a cylindrical structure known as a “shield," which supports the sides of the tunnel while it's being excavated. In rock, this shield may or may not be used.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png" width="1456" height="803" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:803,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F85294d26-2ec8-471a-8d67-acda3987b465_1462x806.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>TBMs can be further divided by whether some kind of support for the face of the tunnel is required. “Closed” TBMs use a fluid or other material behind the rotating cutting head of the TBM to prevent the face of the tunnel from collapsing, or from water intruding as the tunnel is bored. “Open” TBMs, on the other hand, don’t have this support, and can be used where the tunnel face is strong enough to support itself during excavation and where groundwater intrusion isn’t a problem. The chart below shows this breakdown:</p><p>TBMs have evolved along two parallel paths of technological development. The first is the development of machines for tunneling through soil and soft ground, and the second is machines for tunneling through rock. Today, machines of both types get categorized as tunnel boring machines, and the lines between them are sometimes blurry. But they evolved separately to solve different sorts of problems. In soft ground, excavation was comparatively easy, and the primary problem was to prevent the tunnel from collapsing or flooding as it was dug. In rock, by contrast, the tunnel could often support itself temporarily while it was being excavated, and the primary problem was building a machine that was strong enough to cut through the rock.</p><p><span>Soft ground TBMs evolved from unmechanized tunnel shields. The first tunnel shield was designed by Marc Brunel, father of famous engineer </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isambard_Kingdom_Brunel" rel="">Isambard Kingdom Brunel</a><span> and an accomplished engineer in his own right</span></p><p><span>, and built by Henry Maudslay for tunneling under the Thames in 1825</span></p><p><span>. Brunel’s shield, which was inspired by the action of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_navalis" rel="">shipworms</a><span> boring through the wood hulls of ships, consisted of a large cast-iron structure, 38 feet wide by 22 feet tall, which was broken into 12 separate “frames,” each consisting of three individual compartments stacked on top of another. Within each compartment was a series of horizontal boards, called “poling boards," that were placed against the face of the tunnel. A worker in the compartment would remove a board, dig out the earth behind it to a depth of around 6 inches, and then proceed to the next board. Once all the soil behind the boards in a frame had been dug out, that section of the shield would be advanced forward using screw jacks, and the process would repeat. Behind the shield, masons would construct the brick lining around the sides of the tunnel, which prevented the tunnel from collapsing and provided a structure for the shield to push off against.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png" width="1114" height="650" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:650,&quot;width&quot;:1114,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa309bc43-fa3a-4c90-82ad-9ee78b722c04_1114x650.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Brunel’s tunnel shield.

But the project proved to be incredibly difficult, encountering “almost overwhelming problems” (West p115). Excavation was slow, advancing at around 8 feet per week on average, and the tunnel flooded repeatedly. Gas occasionally filled the tunnel, which caused “collapse and blindness of the workmen” (West p109), and at one point the entire shield needed to be replaced. The tunnel wasn’t completed until 1843, 18 years after it was started, and it was never a commercial success, though it is </span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Thames-Tunnel" rel="">still in use today</a><span>. Tunneling via shield wasn’t tried again for over 25 years.</span></p><p><span>The next major attempts at tunneling with shields took place in 1869. That year, Alfred Beach in the US used a cylindrical tunnel shield to surreptitiously dig an 8-foot diameter tunnel for a </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beach_Pneumatic_Transit" rel="">pneumatic railway in New York</a><span> (leading to use of the term “Beach Shields” in the US). The same year, Peter Barlow, who had patented his own design for a cylindrical tunnel shield, began construction on another tunnel under the Thames for the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_Subway" rel="">Tower Subway</a><span>. Because so many builders remembered the difficulties of Brunel’s tunnel, none were willing to attempt another one, and James Greathead, an engineering apprentice to Peter Barlow, opted to undertake it.</span></p><p>Greathead designed a shield for the project based on Barlow’s ideas, and introduced a number of other innovations to the tunnel construction process. Instead of a brick tunnel lining, Greathead used cast-iron segments bolted together. Not only could these be installed much faster than brick, but could immediately support the tunnel sides and withstand the reaction from the shield jacks once in place, whereas a brick lining required waiting until the mortar had set. Cast iron segments also greatly reduced subsistence of the ground above the tunnel, which often damaged buildings above tunnels constructed with brick linings. (Setting the prefabricated cast-iron segments became even faster on subsequent tunnels when Greathead developed a mechanical system for lifting the segments into place.) To fill the gaps between the lining and the sides of the tunnel, Greathead injected grout into the space. On later tunnels, Greathead would invent a special “grout pan” that made this injection easier by using compressed air.</p><p>Greathead’s Thames tunnel proved to be much more successful than Brunel’s, taking just 1 year to complete compared to Brunel’s 18 (though Greathead’s tunnel was much smaller). Whereas Brunel’s shield advanced at around 8 feet per week, Greathead’s advanced at 8 feet per day. Greathead went on to build several other subway tunnels beneath London, and ‘Greathead’-style tunneling shields became popular around the world. A cylindrical tunnel shield, a prefabricated segmental tunnel lining erected mechanically, and grout injection between the prefab lining and the sides of the tunnel all remain standard practice on tunnel construction today.</p><p><span>Until this point, the actual excavation work of tunnel construction was done manually, by laborers using picks and shovels. Shields with mechanical excavation equipment were first patented in 1876, but the first successful machine was designed by John Price in 1896, and steadily improved over the next several years</span></p><p><span>. Price’s improved machine consisted of a rotating disc with 6 bucket-shaped cutters mounted around the edge attached to a cylindrical shield 3.86 meters in diameter. As the disc rotated, the cutters would scrape away the soil, feeding it into a conveyor for removal.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png" width="556" height="585.5041171088747" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1151,&quot;width&quot;:1093,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:556,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F98bc34f6-3311-46fe-b066-044b0f59fa49_1093x1151.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Price’s tunneling machine</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Price’s initial machine was not particularly successful, but the improved version became “an immediate success” (West p279), achieving excavation rates up to 180 feet per week. Price Shields were not only faster than non-mechanized Greathead shields, but also required less labor (10 workers vs 13), and were found to be “exceptionally reliable." Price machines became the standard for soft-ground tunnel excavation for the next 50 years, and are the ancestors of modern soft-ground tunnel boring machines</span></p><p><span>.</span></p><p>Another important development in soft-ground tunneling machines was in the methods used to support the face of the tunnel as it was being excavated. As we’ve noted, Brunel used manually positioned wood boards to support the tunnel face. On Greathead shields, these were replaced by a steel wall with doors in it called a diaphragm. Workers would open the doors to get access to the tunnel face and excavate the soil.</p><p>Neither of these solutions prevented the intrusion of water from the tunnel face, which made tunneling through permeable soil below the water table difficult. To deal with the problem of water intrusion, tunnelers turned to compressed air. By installing an air lock at the tunnel exit, and pressurizing the air in the tunnel up to several times atmospheric pressure, water would be kept out. Compressed air was first used on a drainage tunnel built in Antwerp in 1879, and was first used in conjunction with a tunnel shield in 1888 for a railroad tunnel under the St. Clair River. By the 1890s, tunnel shields and compressed air were standard practice for below-river tunneling.</p><p><span>Compressed air continued to be used throughout the 20th century. Construction of the LA Metro in the 1980s, for instance, used compressed air in conjunction with digger shields to excavate some of its tunnels. And compressed air is still used in some circumstances today, such as when workers need to access the cutting head of a closed TBM to replace worn out cutting tools. But there are drawbacks. For one, there are health risks to working in compressed air. Decompression sickness/”the bends” is a serious and potentially fatal condition when dissolved gasses bubble out from the body during decompression. Today, the risk of this has been greatly reduced by using proper decompression procedures, but decompression sickness was incredibly deadly before they were discovered. During construction of the Hudson River Tunnel in 1889, 25% of the workers died from decompression sickness. Long-term exposure to compressed air can also result in </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysbaric_osteonecrosis" rel="">bone necrosis</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The health problems of working in compressed air were partially addressed with the development of shields that used it just behind the cutting face (rather than the entire tunnel). A shield of this type was first used to excavate a section of underground Paris railway in 1962 (West p180). But this didn’t address another problem. To prevent the tunnel face from collapsing and water intruding, the force of the air pressure needs to balance the force pressing inward from the face of the tunnel. This pressure is due to the weight of material pressing down from above, and so it gets larger the further down you go. Thus at the top of the tunnel the pressure is less than at the bottom. Air pressure, on the other hand, is essentially uniform at both the top and bottom of the tunnel. The air pressure is thus </span><em>higher</em><span> than the pressure from the tunnel face at the top of the tunnel, and </span><em>lower</em><span> than the pressure at the bottom.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png" width="676" height="439" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:439,&quot;width&quot;:676,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F098a1594-5d3d-4dfe-9591-d7aab34662db_676x439.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p>This means that, at the bottom of the tunnel, water would constantly want to leak in, and at the top, air would want to leak out. If the ground is permeable enough for the air to reach the surface, this could create a “blowout," a dangerous condition where air suddenly escapes, and water suddenly rushes in. In one blowout while tunneling under the East River in New York City in 1905, a worker was “blown into the hole, through the silt of the river bed, and upwards through a further 15 feet of water to the river surface," where he miraculously emerged unscathed. (West p145)</p><p><span>To address this, tunneling machine builders developed other ways of supporting the face of the tunnel during excavation. One option was to use bentonite slurry, a heavy liquid clay which had long been used to support the sides of oil wells while they were being drilled</span></p><p><span>. Because it was a heavy liquid, the pressure from the bentonite would vary with height in the same way as the pressure from the tunnel face it was resisting, and thus avoided the pressure differential problems of compressed air. The first bentonite slurry TBM was invented in 1964 by John Bartlett. Behind the cutting head was a pressurized chamber that could be filled with slurry. Excavated soil would mix with the slurry, and then be pumped out of the tunnel to the surface. The soil would then be filtered out and disposed of, and the bentonite would be stored for reuse. To prevent the slurry from leaking into the TBM from the sides of the shield, a “tail seal” was added around the edge of the shield. By disconnecting the bentonite pump and other equipment, and replacing it with a normal conveyor, Bartlett’s machine could also operate without fluid support, which let it operate in different sorts of ground. Similar slurry machines were developed in the late 1960s in Japan by Mitsubishi, and in the 1970s in Germany by Wayss and Freytag. By the end of the 1970s, slurry TBMs were in common use.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png" width="1456" height="1133" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1133,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffecc60b0-08f1-4917-8369-e014cf6eae41_1483x1154.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Slurry machine, via Stack 1982</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Another way to support the face of the tunnel is with the excavated earth itself. By letting the earth accumulate in a chamber behind the cutting head, it can be used to balance the pressure from the tunnel face. These are known as Earth Pressure Balance Machines, or EPB machines/EPBMs, and were first developed in Japan in the 1960s, in an attempt to find an easier way to cope with environmental regulations. Slurry machines, which treated the excavated soil chemically to separate the bentonite for reuse, had difficulty complying with these laws. EPBMS did not require this chemical treatment (and thus were environmentally friendlier than slurry machines), and eliminated the slurry treatment and pumping system. EPBMs are also significantly faster than slurry machines. EPBMs do, however, often inject foam or polymer into the soil ahead of the cutting face to modify the soil properties to make it easier to excavate. The first EPBM was used in 1974, and today EPBMs are the </span><a href="https://openjicareport.jica.go.jp/pdf/12001715_04.pdf" rel="">most common type of TBM</a><span> for soft-ground tunneling.</span></p><p><span>Another important development in soft-ground tunneling was precast concrete tunnel linings, which first were used widely in Europe after WWII (since their iron industry had been destroyed during the war), and by the 1970s and 80s had spread to the US (US tunnels book). Initial precast linings used identical segments, but the development of “wedge blocks," where one segment of a ring was tapered and jacked into place last, greatly increased how fast tunnel linings could be installed, and allowed “outstanding rates of tunnel progress to be achieved” (West p169). Today, wedge-shaped key segments are still widely used for tunnel linings, but there are a </span><a href="https://about.ita-aites.org/files/WG2_-ITA-REPORT-DesignSegment.pdf" rel="">variety of different shapes</a><span> of lining segments in use.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png" width="800" height="536" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:536,&quot;width&quot;:800,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4e95d55f-accc-46b2-9b09-883319a85c9b_800x536.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Precast concrete tunnel lining</figcaption></figure></div><p><span>Tunneling through rock proved more difficult than tunneling through soil.

The chisels would deliver 150 blows per minute to the rock, while water jets would clear out the debris and keep the chisels cool. A prototype of Maus’ machine was built in 1847, which Maus estimated could excavate at a rate of 18 to 24 feet per day. But the tunnel project it was built for – a railway through the Alps – was canceled, and the machine was never used.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png" width="695" height="441" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:441,&quot;width&quot;:695,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff46a07c1-a1da-4883-b859-09194a041dc2_695x441.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Maus’ rock tunneling machine</figcaption></figure></div><p>Another early attempt at a rock tunneling machine was by Charles Wilson for the Hoosac tunnel in 1851.

The machine would cut a groove around the outside of the tunnel, and a 2-foot circle in the middle. Once the inner and outer grooves were cut, the rock between would be removed via drill and blast. Wilson’s machine was built, but only managed to excavate 10 feet before it was abandoned and sold for scrap (Stack p146, West p230). The Hoosac tunnel was ultimately excavated by the drill and blast method.</p><p>Over the next 70 years, “a great many tunneling machines were designed and patented” (West p231), but few were built, and the ones that were built weren’t successful.

A disc cutter does not work like a saw, spinning rapidly to cut a channel through the rock. It merely gets pressed against the rock until the rock beneath it is crushed, forming a channel beneath the cutter. When this channel gets deep enough, the force from the cutter causes fractures to occur between adjacent troughs, spalling off the remaining rock.</span></p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png" width="756" height="253" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:253,&quot;width&quot;:756,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff4b01227-0bde-454d-aa38-fc6c3b746ab8_756x253.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption><span>Rock chip formation using disc cutters, via </span><a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/tunnel/pubs/nhi09010/tunnel_manual.pdf" rel="">FHWA</a></figcaption></figure></div><p>Robbins first rock boring machine for Oahe used both drag picks and disc cutters, but the machine worked poorly, due in part to the frequent breakage of drag picks. After the machine was redesigned, it was found that the machine actually worked better with disc cutters alone.

But over time, the machines improved, partially due to the development of larger, stronger cutters capable of handling more force (and lasted longer before needing to be replaced, increasing machine efficiency).

Greathead’s Thames tunnel was bored through a stratum of London Clay that was “an almost perfect medium for shield tunneling” (West p117), and later London Tube segments were set at a level specifically chosen to allow as much tunneling as possible in London Clay. Robbins early rock TBM successes were likewise only possible because of how soft the rock being tunneled through was</span></p><p><span>. Using a TBM required knowing </span><a href="https://archive.org/details/rapidexcavationp0000tunn/page/360/mode/2up" rel="">much more about the ground to be drilled</a><span> through than something like drill and blast, and many machines couldn’t cope with highly variable ground conditions (say, needing to tunnel through both soft soil and hard rock).</span></p><p><span>But over time, TBMs have become increasingly capable at tunneling through a broad array of ground conditions. Often this has resulted in blurred lines between soft ground TBMs and rock TBMs. In 1972, for instance, Robbins developed the double shield rock TBM, which can tunnel through fractured rock by using a shield to protect the TBM machinery from rock collapse. During this period, TBMs also began to be used to install segmented tunnel liners on rock tunnels. In 1985, Herrenknecht developed the </span><a href="https://www.herrenknecht.com/en/products/productdetail/mixshield/" rel="">mixshield</a><span>, which can change from open (no face support) to either slurry or EPB modes. Manufacturers such as Robbins have also developed machines that can </span><a href="https://www.robbinstbm.com/mixshield-crossover-hybrid/" rel="">convert between soil/EPB and rock</a><span> tunneling. Today, there are almost no ground conditions that can’t be handled by some type of TBM.</span></p><p>TBMs have also been developed to handle a wider variety of tunnel sizes. The maximum size of tunnel shields and TBMs have steadily increased over time (though Brunel’s shield had a very large equivalent diameter). In 1888, the St. Clair River was an unusually large tunnel shield, at over 6 meters in diameter. Today, the largest TBMs have a diameter almost 3 times this size.</p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png" width="620" height="620" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:620,&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F20f95340-11fa-4bdd-b3ff-1814083d80ce_620x620.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>TBMs that can excavate smaller tunnels have also been developed.

Its Prufrock TBM is </span><a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/prufrock" rel="">apparently designed</a><span> to achieve speeds of a mile/1609 meters per week. And its “medium term goal” is to achieve tunneling rates of 7 miles per day, or nearly 80,000 meters per week (100 times faster than the fastest TBMs). The Boring Company aims at achieving these with a variety of methods, including more powerful machines, continuous tunneling rather than stopping for maintenance and to set the lining (which current TBMs often must do), launching directly from the surface (avoiding a time-consuming excavation and machine setup process), and eliminating the rails used to deliver tunneling lining segments.</span></p><p><span>(There seems to be some inconsistency in how these speeds are described. </span><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4692/when-will-the-boring-company-tunnel-faster-than-a-snail/" rel="">Metaculus</a><span> describes “snail speed” as 140 meters per day, or 980 meters per week assuming 24/7 operation. But The Boring Company </span><a href="https://www.boringcompany.com/prufrock" rel="">describes</a><span> 1 mile/1609 meters per week, as “4-5 times slower than a snail”. They also describe Prufrock’s 1-mile per week goal as “6 times faster than their previous generation TBM (Godot+)”, which would be at least 268 meters per week for Godot+. This, I believe, </span><a href="https://www.tunnel-online.info/en/artikel/tunnel_2010-02_Conveyors_at_the_Lower_Northwest_Interceptor_Project-915977.html" rel="">would be a world-record speed</a><span> for a soft-earth machine if it had actually been achieved, but I haven’t found any indication that it has.)</span></p><p>These goals are not that far off the historical trajectory of speed advancement in TBMs. Between 1825 (the first use of Brunel’s shield) and 1966, maximum weekly TBM speed increased by about 3.5% per year on average. Extending that same rate out to 2030 would yield a speed of around 5000 meters per week, somewhere between the Boring Company’s medium-term goals and design speed for Prufrock, and about 7 times faster than current maximum weekly TBM speeds.</p><p><span>But the company is currently nowhere close to achieving it. The recently-excavated Las Vegas loop </span><a href="https://www.geplus.co.uk/news/the-boring-company-celebrates-tunnelling-milestone-on-vegas-loop-14-07-2023/" rel="">took 10 weeks to tunnel 716 meters</a><span>. Assuming 2-3 weeks were needed to prep the site and deploy the machine (remember that it is designed for quick deployment), that's a tunneling rate of about 90 meters per week, which TBMs have been achieving for more than 50 years, and is less than 1/10th the speed of their lowest goal of beating the snail. And this rate was achieved with a relatively small machine, in </span><a href="https://archive.ph/zjqYZ" rel="">comparatively easy ground to tunnel through</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>It's also unclear whether the Boring Company’s proposed improvements will work. Most of these suggestions, such as </span><a href="https://tunnelingshortcourse.com/2019-presentations/jiang-segmental-liner.pdf" rel="">eliminating rail</a><span> and continuous operation, are either already done by TBM operators or are being actively pursued by them. Being able to tunnel directly from the surface without needing a long and involved excavation is likewise a capability that TBMs have had for many years. And it’s unclear whether or how the Boring Company will address issues that limit how fast soft-earth tunneling machines can excavate, like </span><a href="https://tunnelingonline.com/the-real-deal-on-rapid-excavation-its-about-logistics-communication-planning/" rel="">settlement and ground heave</a><span>.</span></p><p><span>A possible bigger benefit of the Boring Company is the structure of the company. Unlike other companies, which are in the business of selling TBMs, the Boring Company is in the business of selling tunnels, and happens to use its own tunnel boring machines. This vertically integrated structure changes the incentives at work – while most tunnel contractors are </span><a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/why-its-hard-to-innovate-in-construction" rel="">rationally risk averse</a><span> and are reluctant to adopt new technology, the Boring Company will be incentivized to use its own machines, and have the opportunity to rapidly iterate and improve on their design in a way that machine manufacturers selling to risk-averse contractors don’t have. Similarly, SpaceX had the option to learn by blowing up rockets, in a way that risk-averse programs like NASA would never be able to.</span></p><p><span>Nevertheless, it's still far too early to determine whether the Boring Company will be able to achieve its goals. It's worth noting that around </span><a href="https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4692/when-will-the-boring-company-tunnel-faster-than-a-snail/" rel="">40% of the betters on Metaculus</a><span> are predicting that the Boring Company will not even achieve snail speed by 2027.</span></p><p><span>The arc of tunnel boring machinery looks much more like the progression we see in other industrial areas, and that we don’t often see in construction. Construction operations often remain craft-based and labor intensive, and have been performed in similar ways for decades (or centuries). With tunnel boring machines, we see gradual automation and “factoryization," where the work increasingly takes place in a highly mechanized, factory-like environment. New technology comes along and displaces the old technology, even in an environment of high risk aversion. And the process gradually converges on the “continuous flow," where the machine continuously transforms solid ground into a lined tunnel, and continuously removes excavated material with the use of conveyors, the same sort of development we see in things like Ford’s assembly line, </span><a href="https://austinvernon.site/blog/carboncapture.html" rel="">chemical process industries</a><span>, and the Toyota production system.</span></p><p><em>Thanks to Brad Grothen at Robbins TBM for helpful conversations on TBM technology.

			<p>The US Patent &amp; Trademark Office has granted a patent to Apple for next-generation AirPods, which could measure electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), and other biosignals. The patent application reveals that active and reference electrodes would be strategically placed within and on the tips of the AirPods to capture these measurements, as they can monitor brain activity when attached to the user’s scalp.</p>
<p>Apple’s patent suggests that the future AirPods may be customizable to accurately measure ear-EEG, as the size and shape of ears vary from individual to individual. To address changes in users’ ear canals over time, the company proposes – in the words of the Patently Apple website –&nbsp; using “different subsets of the electrodes for measuring the biosignals for different users or at different times”.</p>

Photo: Liebreich Associates</figcaption></figure></div> <p>In an attempt to guide governments and industry players away from the spin, he has created what he calls his Hydrogen Ladder, a simple chart (<i>pictured</i>) showing which use cases for H<sub>2</sub> are uncompetitive, which are unavoidable for decarbonisation, and which sit somewhere in the middle.</p> <p>So at the top of his ladder, at the “unavoidable” end, lie the existing uses of highly polluting grey hydrogen produced from unabated fossil fuels — such as ammonia-based fertiliser and oil refining, which are responsible for 3-4% of all global carbon emissions. Seasonal power storage, steel, chemicals, shipping and long-haul aviation (using liquid hydrogen or synthetic fuels derived from H<sub>2</sub>) are also high up.</p> <p>At the bottom “uncompetitive” end of the ladder are hydrogen cars and domestic heating — which he says make no sense when you have battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) and heat pumps.</p> <p>Liebreich — a pro-business supporter of the UK Conservative Party, who sits on the British government board of trade and is also an advisor to Norwegian oil giant Equinor — believes that oil &amp; gas companies know that hydrogen is a poor choice for these two segments, but are pursuing them nonetheless.</p> <p>“If you're an oil and gas company, in a way, talking about hydrogen is kind of a two-way bet because if it works, then you're embedded in the hydrogen industry — but if it doesn't work, you've delayed the transition to the thing you don't make, which is electricity,” he tells <i>Recharge</i>. “So why wouldn't you promote hydrogen for inappropriate use? For the things that are not at the top of the ladder, that are fairly down — so local trains, local buses, cars, delivery vehicles — why not promote it? Because at worst it creates confusion, which is great [for them]. And these companies have an interest in this [electric] stuff not moving too fast, I'm afraid — for all their good words.”</p> <p>Liebreich gives an example of Shell being happy to spend $12bn on a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) platform, the <i>Prelude</i>, which has seen a host of problems, “but they won't spend $12bn just producing blue, green, pink, or any other sort of clean hydrogen for those [existing] uses where we currently are driving 3-4% of global emissions”.</p> <p>He points to a <a href="https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2020-12/hydrogen-report-web-final_3.pdf" target="_blank">report last year by lobbying watchdog Corporate Europe Observatory</a>, which found that the “hydrogen lobby, whose main players are fossil gas companies, declared a combined annual expenditure of €58.6m trying to influence Brussels policy making”.</p> <p>“So what they want to do is fund people to go and lobby in Brussels for uses of hydrogen, where they basically think that because politicians like having photos taken [with hydrogen cars and trains], they will tolerate [the existing use of grey hydrogen],” says Liebreich. “I don't know whether it's disingenuity or a phony war, but we’re talking at cross purposes if we’re using dirty hydrogen [for existing uses], but we’re talking about clean hydrogen [for cars].</p> <p>“If I were a [government] minister, what I would be saying is anytime anybody wants to come through the door and talk about hydrogen… and they want to start making presentations about cars and trucks and trains, I'd be, like, “wait, let me stop you. What's your plan for fertiliser? What’s your plan in your refinery, you're taking [unabated] natural gas and you're using it in fertilser or in hydrocracking. What's your plan [to switch to cleaner hydrogen], but also, what do you need?”</p> <h2 data-element-type="subhead" data-element-label="Body subhead">The argument against hydrogen cars</h2> <p>Liebreich says that people in the oil industry are smart and understand the inefficiencies and expense of hydrogen-powered fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).</p> <p>“It's so obvious that hydrogen is less efficient because it's got these chemical processes and… everybody's done the numbers that show that if you have clean electricity and you want to drive somewhere, the last thing you would do is stick it in an electrolyser and then have all these other [energy] losses and then put it in a fuel cell and have more losses. You can't break the laws of physics — this is thermodynamics, it's the microeconomics of something that's very simple versus something that's very complex.</p> <p>“The other argument that never gets surfaced enough is that if you look at the cars and you look at the competitive dimensions, basically, electric wins on everything… sometimes by large margins. Nought to 60 in four seconds [for a battery electric vehicle (BEV)] versus nine seconds [in an FCEV], being able to fold the seats down and put loads of luggage in versus no, sorry, there's a hydrogen cylinder in there [taking up space]. [BEVs are] three times as efficient, and by the way, hydrogen [cars] don’t win on weight, they tend to be heavier, so they don’t even have that.</p> <p>“What they win on is being able to connect it to the nozzle and fill it with hydrogen for 400 miles in five minutes — setting aside the fact that the nozzle then gets really cold and actually the next person has to wait for it to warm up. That's very important if you're going on a trip that's 400 miles, because under that you might as well just buy the cheaper and better electric car.</p> <p>“So right now, the single advantage of the hydrogen car, wherever you can buy one, is that it can drive somewhere where you can't refuel because there's no hydrogen [filling stations].”</p> <p>He continues: “Even if that were fixed, even if we threw enough taxpayers' money at it so that then when you drive your 350-400 miles, there was a hydrogen fuelling station, that would save you the 45 minutes that you would otherwise have to charge [a BEV] to get back.</p> <p>“Okay, so you've saved 45 minutes. The rest of the year, you're back at home and back to your boring commute, and you're driving your 20 miles a day. Well, every time you do 300 miles, you have to go to a hydrogen filling station [unlike a BEV that you can charge at home]. So 40 times a year, you have to waste 10 minutes and maybe more driving to a hydrogen filling station. That's 400 minutes and you've saved yourself 45 minutes on the, maybe, two to five times that you actually drive to your cottage or to the Alps, or wherever. So even on the time spent, on an annual basis, it's not a win, it's a big loss for most people.”</p> <p><i>Recharge</i> pointed to its recent interview with Hydrogen Council boss Daryl Wilson, who said that hydrogen cars will be needed because the electricity infrastructure won’t be able to cope with charging millions of BEVs.</p> <p>“That's nonsense,” says Liebreich. “[In] 1995, [people said] ‘we'll never use the internet because there are not enough modems’. [In] 2000, ‘we'll never do online video because there isn't enough bandwidth’, then, ‘you can't do multiple streams of video because you will never get fibre to the home’. We’ve got 30 years between now and 2050 [when countries plan to reach net-zero emissions] and we will simply have more and more investment. We’ve dug up the streets for cable, phone, gas, cable, fibre, electricity. It's a thing we do. We know how to just build slowly over time. This is not rocket science.</p> <p>“Plus, there's smart charging. And of course, we know we're going to be doing this because we're also going to be having to add capacity because of electric heating. And so the idea that you'll say, ‘no, no, we mustn't do that extension of existing infrastructure, we must build a completely new one [for hydrogen refuelling], it's nonsense, frankly.”</p> <h2 data-element-type="subhead" data-element-label="Body subhead">The argument against hydrogen for domestic heating</h2> <p>Some elements of the hydrocarbons sector, particularly gas distribution companies, have been lobbying to convert their gas grids to run on H<sub>2</sub> — and have had some success, with the UK, for example, spending tens of millions of pounds on domestic hydrogen heating trials.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.rechargenews.com/energy-transition/special-report-is-hydrogen-the-best-option-to-decarbonise-heating-and-heavy-industry-/2-1-986810" target="_blank"><i>Recharge</i> has previously reported</a>, converting gas networks to hydrogen — which has smaller molecules than natural gas — would require all underground metal gas pipes to be replaced by polyethylene ones, including those concealed in walls and under floorboards in people’s homes. Every gas valve and compressor in each network would also have to be replaced, plus the energy needed to pump H<sub>2</sub> around the gas grid would be three times higher than for natural gas<i>.</i></p> <p>And of course, heat pumps are almost six times more energy efficient than hydrogen boilers, requiring 150% less primary energy to produce the same amount of heat.</p> <p>There are also issues around the safety of using flammable hydrogen in people’s homes, as well as air quality, because burning hydrogen produces poisonous nitrous oxides that are also powerful greenhouse gases, Liebreich points out.</p> <p>“Hydrogen heating is just not going to happen,” he says.</p> <p>The reason why gas distribution companies are lobbying for hydrogen use in domestic heating is not because they want the world to go green, but because “they want to get us locked into using their gas pipes for decarbonisation, because that's their asset”, Liebreich adds.</p> <p>And the idea of blending clean hydrogen into the natural gas grid to reduce carbon emissions is “stupidly inefficient”, he adds.</p> <p>“If you put 20% hydrogen into your gas, 20% of your volume is only 7% by energy. And if it’s green hydrogen, you’ve started with electricity. One unit of that electricity could have produced three units of heat [with a heat pump]. Instead, you've put that unit into the gas grid that you've turned into hydrogen. So you've lost 30% of [the energy]. Then you put it in the gas grid, compressed it and done all sorts of things to it. And then you put it in your boiler and got 85% efficiency out of it. So from 1kWh of electricity, you’ve got heating worth half a kilowatt-hour.</p> <p>“If it’s blue hydrogen [derived from natural gas with carbon capture and storage], you’re always going to come back to my previous point, which is, ‘I’m not prepared to have this discussion until you've told me how you're going to decarbonise fertiliser!’”</p></div></div>]]></description>

Finding a frame shop that could handle this "special" project was not easy.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Researchers have long recognized the therapeutic potential of using magnetoelectrics ⎯ materials that can turn magnetic fields into electric fields ⎯ to stimulate neural tissue in a minimally invasive way and help treat neurological disorders or nerve damage. The problem, however, is that neurons have a hard time responding to the shape and frequency of the electric signal resulting from this conversion.</p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="researcher " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="fb8e9395-240b-4147-90c3-cb93651103df" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/230427_BRC%20Shoot%20Josh%20Chen_Gustavo-07776_540.jpeg" width="540" height="361" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Rice University doctoral alum Joshua Chen is lead author on a study published in Nature Materials. (Photo by Gustavo Raskosky/Rice University)</figcaption></figure><p>Rice University neuroengineer <a href="https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/jacob-t-robinson"> Jacob Robinson</a> and his team designed the first magnetoelectric material that not only solves this issue but performs the magnetic-to-electric conversion 120 times faster than similar materials. According to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-023-01680-4"> a study</a> published in Nature Materials, the researchers showed the material can be used to precisely stimulate neurons remotely and to bridge the gap in a broken sciatic nerve in a rat model.</p>

<p>The material’s qualities and performance could have a profound impact on neurostimulation treatments, making for significantly less invasive procedures, Robinson said. Instead of implanting a neurostimulation device, tiny amounts of the material could simply be injected at the desired site. Moreover, given magnetoelectrics’ range of application in computing, sensing, electronics and other fields, the research provides a framework for advanced materials design that could drive innovation more broadly.</p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="researcher " data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b87569e2-339b-43dd-8015-21035ebd9394" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/Gauri%20Bhave_370_0.jpeg" width="300" height="357" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Gauri Bhave, a former research scientist in the Robinson lab, is a lead co-author on a study published in Nature Materials. (Photo courtesy of Gauri Bhave)</figcaption></figure><p>“We asked, ‘Can we create a material that can be like dust or is so small that by placing just a sprinkle of it inside the body you’d be able to stimulate the brain or nervous system?’” said <a href="https://www.joshchen.xyz/"> Joshua Chen</a>, a Rice doctoral alumnus who is a lead author on the study. “With that question in mind, we thought that magnetoelectric materials were ideal candidates for use in neurostimulation. They respond to magnetic fields, which easily penetrate into the body, and convert them into electric fields ⎯ a language our nervous system already uses to relay information.”</p>

<p>The researchers started with a magnetoelectric material made up of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity"> piezoelectric </a> layer of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_zirconate_titanate"> lead zirconium titanate</a> sandwiched between two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetostriction"> magnetorestrictive</a> layers of metallic glass alloys, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metglas"> Metglas</a>, which can be rapidly magnetized and demagnetized.</p>

<p>Gauri Bhave, a former researcher in the Robinson lab who now works in technology transfer for Baylor College of Medicine, explained that the magnetorestrictive element vibrates with the application of a magnetic field.</p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="research illustration" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="4ff76623-a954-4313-b15f-da57083059ab" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/magnetic-to-electric_540_0.jpeg" width="540" height="381" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Schematic of neural response for linear magnetic-to-electric conversion (top two conversions) versus nonlinear (bottom third). (Image courtesy of Josh Chen/Rice University)</figcaption></figure><p>“This vibration means it basically changes its shape,” Bhave said. “The piezoelectric material is something that, when it changes its shape, creates electricity. So when those two are combined, the conversion that you’re getting is that the magnetic field you’re applying from the outside of the body turns into an electric field.”</p>

<p>However, the electric signals magnetoelectrics generate are too fast and uniform for neurons to detect. The challenge was to engineer a new material that could generate an electric signal that would actually get cells to respond.</p>

<p>“For all other magnetoelectric materials, the relationship between the electric field and the magnetic field is linear, and what we needed was a material where that relationship was nonlinear,” Robinson said. “We had to think about the kinds of materials we could deposit on this film that would create that nonlinear response.”</p>

<p>The researchers layered platinum, hafnium oxide and zinc oxide and added the stacked materials on top of the original magnetoelectric film. One of the challenges they faced was finding fabrication techniques compatible with the materials.<br></p>
<figure role="group"><img alt="research illustration" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="886a9305-1c65-492c-ae08-603db29be616" src="https://news.rice.edu/sites/g/files/bxs2656/files/inline-images/MNM_pic_540_0.jpeg" width="540" height="373" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Magnetoelectric nonlinear metamaterials are 120 times faster at stimulating neural activity compared to previously used magnetic materials. (Image courtesy of the Robinson lab/Rice University)</figcaption></figure><p>“A lot of work went into making this very thin layer of less than 200 nanometers that gives us the really special properties,” Robinson said.</p>

<p>“This reduced the size of the entire device so that in the future it could be injectable,” Bhave added.</p>

<p>As proof of concept, the researchers used the material to stimulate peripheral nerves in rats and demonstrated the material’s potential for use in neuroprosthetics by showing it could restore function in a severed nerve.</p>

<p>“We can use this metamaterial to bridge the gap in a broken nerve and restore fast electric signal speeds,” Chen said. “Overall, we were able to rationally design a new metamaterial that overcomes many challenges in neurotechnology. And more importantly, this framework for advanced material design can be applied toward other applications like sensing and memory in electronics.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><h2>Lit Launch Day: Lit 3.0, Labs graduations, a compiler and more!</h2><p>It's launch day for the Lit project, and we have a bunch of exciting releases to share with the Lit and web components communities!</p><p>After several months of development, the Lit team is happy to announce the final release of Lit 3.0 – our fist major version since Lit 2.0 in early 2021, the first graduating class of Lit Labs packages <code>@lit/react</code>, <code>@lit/task</code>, and <code>@lit/context</code>, and two bonus releases <code>@lit-labs/compiler</code> and <code>@lit-labs/preact-signals</code>.</p><p>This is a big release, so here are links to the individual announcements:</p><ul><li><a href="#lit-3.0">Lit 3.0</a></li><li><a href="#compiler">The New Lit Template Compiler</a></li><li><a href="#preact-signals-integration">Preact Signals Integration</a></li><li><a href="#labs-graduation">Labs Graduation Day</a></li></ul><p><h2 id="lit-3.0" tabindex="-1">Lit 3.0: Bye, Bye IE, Hello TC39 Decorators!</h2></p><p>We value stability for our community. Breaking changes are a cost that every user and the entire ecosystem has to bear: projects have to upgrade, multiple versions can be included in an app, and documents, samples, tutorials, starter kits, etc. have to be updated for every breaking change.</p><p>So we want to only make breaking changes when we must, or when the benefits to the community clearly outweigh the costs. For benefits we tend look for decreased code size, increased performance, reduction in maintenance burden, and better alignment with standards.</p><p>We also follow <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>, so we increase the major version only when there are breaking changes. New features typically arrive in new <em>minor</em> versions, which are backwards compatible. So Lit 3.0 is intended to only be a breaking change, with no new features. There is one exception though – standard decorators!</p><p><h3 id="breaking-changes" tabindex="-1">Breaking changes</h3></p><p>For Lit 3.0, the biggest breaking change is that we've dropped IE11 support. After surveying our developer community, we feel like now is the right time to say goodbye to IE, and very few customers will be affected.</p><p>This release is also an opportunity to make a few additional breaking changes that trim out some technical debt to unlock new features we have scheduled for our 3.x release series and beyond.</p><p>These changes are hopefully minor for most customers. If you run Lit 2.x with no deprecation warnings, and use toolchain that supports modern JS, this should be a seamless upgrade!</p><p>Here are the biggest things Lit 3.0 changes:</p><ul><li>IE11 is no longer supported.</li><li>Lit's npm modules are now published as ES2021.</li><li>APIs deprecated with the Lit 2.0 release have been removed.</li><li>SSR hydration support modules were moved to the <code>@lit-labs/ssr-client</code> package.</li><li>Decorator behavior has been unified between TypeScript experimental decorators and standard decorators.</li><li>Support was removed for Babel decorators version "2018-09"</li></ul><p>Full details in the <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/v3/releases/upgrade/">the upgrade guide</a>.</p><p><h3 id="new:-standard-decorators-support" tabindex="-1">New: standard decorators support</h3></p><p>The one new feature that we <em>did</em> add to Lit 3.0 is support for the TC39 standard decorators specification to our <em>existing</em> decorators.</p><p>The new decorator spec has reached Stage 3 in TC39, meaning that browsers and compilers are now implementing them. This is a huge step for Lit! The arrival of standard decorators allows us to begin the process of moving to a decorator implementation that won't require a compiler to use.</p><p>It's very important to us to make the upgrade path from experimental decorators as smooth as possible. To accomplish this we made our existing decorators support the standard spec and made them work with the new <code>accessor</code> keyword in experimental decorator mode.</p><p>This way you can use Lit decorators with auto-accessors (using the <code>accessor</code> keyword) so that the same call site works with both settings:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>class</span> <span>MyElement</span> <span>extends</span> <span>LitElement</span> {</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">  @<span>property</span>()</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">  <span>accessor</span> <span>myProperty</span> <span>=</span> <span>'hello'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">}</span></pre></figure></code></pre><p>Once all decorator call sites in your project use the <code>accessor</code> keyword, you can build with <code>experimentalDecorators</code> set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> without a change in behavior.</p><p>But in order to make these hybrid decorators have consistent behavior in both modes, we had to make a few minor breaking changes to our experimental decorators:</p><ul><li>We now call <code>requestUpdate()</code> automatically for <code>@property</code> and <code>@state</code> decorated accessors where previously that was the setter's responsibility.</li><li>The value of an accessor is read on first render and used as the initial value for <code>changedProperties</code> and attribute reflection.</li><li><code>@property</code> and <code>@state</code> must be used on the setter for hand-written accessors.</li></ul><p>Standard decorator mode requires <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-5-2/#decorator-metadata">TypeScript 5.2</a> or <a href="https://babeljs.io/blog/2023/09/25/7.23.0">Babel 7.23</a> with the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-proposal-decorators"><code>@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators</code></a> plugin using decorator version <code>"2023-05"</code>.</p><p><h3 id="upgrading" tabindex="-1">Upgrading</h3></p><p>The upgrade from Lit 2.0 should be seamless for the vast majority of users. You can usually upgrade your npm dependency version with:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation">&gt; npm i lit@latest</span></pre></figure></code></pre><p>You can find more details and how to handle the changes in the <a href="https://lit.dev/docs/v3/releases/upgrade/">Lit 3 upgrade guide</a>.</p><p>Detailed change logs can be found <a href="https://github.com/lit/lit/releases?q=lit%403.0.0&amp;expanded=true">on GitHub</a>.</p><p><h2 id="compiler" tabindex="-1">Even Faster Rendering with the new Lit Template Compiler</h2></p><p>The new <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/compiler"><code>@lit-labs/compiler</code></a> Labs package provides a <a href="https://github.com/itsdouges/typescript-transformer-handbook#the-basics">TypeScript Transformer</a> that can be run over your JavaScript or TypeScript files to do build-time preparation of Lit templates that Lit would normally do at runtime.</p><p><img src="https://lit.dev/images/blog/3.0-launch/compiler-benchmarks.png" alt="Lit Compiler benchmarks"></p><p>While not all templates will see rendering performance improvements from compilation, on our "template heavy" benchmark we measured a 46% faster first render, and a 21% faster update!</p><p>To try out <code>@lit-labs/compiler</code> today, you’ll need a build step that accepts a TypeScript transformer. For Rollup.js users, this could be <code>@rollup/plugin-typescript</code>. An example <code>rollup.config.js</code> file might look like:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>// File: rollup.config.js</span></span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> <span>typescript</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@rollup/plugin-typescript'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>compileLitTemplates</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'@lit-labs/compiler'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span cm-text="">

We’ve measured that minified and compressed, you may get a 5% increase in file size for the compiled file. This is something we have plans to address.</p><p><h3 id="looking-forward" tabindex="-1">Looking forward</h3></p><p>We’d love to hear from you and get feedback on your experience using the transform, as well as hear what you’d like to see optimized! Leave that feedback in this <a href="https://github.com/lit/lit/discussions/4117">Labs Feedback discussion</a>. We’d also like to learn more about what build systems Lit is used in, and welcome contributions!</p><p>This is just the beginning. With this new package we have a foundation for layering on additional build-time optimizations. Some optimizations we’ve thought about:</p><ul><li>For a Lit app which can be completely compiled, we could vend an import of lit-html that is smaller.</li><li>Add an option to the compiler transform to also minify the HTML in the templates.</li><li>Do build-time evaluation of other parts of the Lit API, such as compiling away the built-in Lit decorators.</li><li>Compress the emitted output file by applying domain-specific file compression.</li></ul><p><h2 id="preact-signals-integration" tabindex="-1">Preact Signals integration</h2></p><p>Signals: they're so hot right now!</p><p>Many frameworks are adopting signals – reactive holders of state and computation – for performance and DX improvements. Lit already has a very efficient rendering system, and our preliminary benchmarks don't show a clear performance wins from signals.</p><p>For Lit developers we think signals promise to offer a convenient and relatively simple option for shared observable state, a recurring need in our community. So we are starting to explore what it would look like to integrate signals with Lit with a new <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-labs/preact-signals"><code>@lit-labs/preact-signals</code></a> package.</p><p>This package provides three ways to use <a href="https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/signals/">Preact Signals</a>:</p><ol><li>A <code>SignalWatcher</code> mixin, which makes a component automatically watch all signals used during updates.</li><li>A <code>watch()</code> directive, which watches one signal and updates a binding with it.</li><li>A special <code>html</code> template tag that auto-applies the <code>watch()</code> directive to all bindings that use signals.</li></ol><p>Here's an example of using the <code>SignalWatcher</code> mixin:</p><pre><code><figure><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>LitElement</span>, <span>html</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'lit'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>customElement</span>, <span>property</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'lit'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span>import</span> {<span>SignalWatcher</span>, <span>signal</span>} <span>from</span> <span>'@lit-labs/preact-signals'</span>;</span></pre><pre role="presentation"><span role="presentation"><span cm-text="">

This goes against the interoperability goals of web components, so for now, rather than build our own signals package or pick just one that we endorse, we plan on offering integration packages to be able to use various signal libraries with Lit.</p><p>These integrations will be relatively simple because we have two straight-forward ways of using signals:</p><ol><li>Treat a component's update lifecycle as an effect, so that it's run when any signals it accesses (like in templates) changes. This integrates signals with Lit's batching async lifecycle for good performance when many signals change.</li><li>Use a directive to wire a signal directly to a location in DOM.</li></ol><p>We chose Preact's signals library for our first integration because it's a relatively small, fast, and easy-to-understand implementation published to npm as standard JS modules.</p><p><h2 id="labs-graduation" tabindex="-1">Lit Labs Graduation Day</h2></p><p>We are also graduating our first set of Lit Labs packages: Context, Task, and React.</p><p>These packages have a new home in the <code>@lit</code> npm scope, but are otherwise exactly the same as the current labs versions. The labs packages have been updated to depend on and re-export the non-labs versions so that they share a single implementation.</p><p>Find them in their new npm homes: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/react"><code>@lit/react</code></a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/task"><code>@lit/task</code></a>, and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit/context"><code>@lit/context</code></a></p><p>These packages can now be considered stable, and have documentation and examples on lit.dev!</p><p>Current users of these packages under the <code>@lit-labs</code> scope can migrate by first updating to the latest version of those packages to test for any breakages, then update the import to use the <code>@lit</code> scoped package.

<h2>Command-Line Interface<a href="#command-line-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The <code><span>ia</span></code> command-line tool is installed with <code><span>internetarchive</span></code>, or <a href="https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/installation.html#binaries">available as a binary</a>. <code><span>ia</span></code> allows you to interact with various archive.org services from the command-line.</p>
<section id="getting-started">
<h2>Getting Started<a href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The easiest way to start using <code><span>ia</span></code> is downloading a binary. The only requirements of the binary are a Unix-like environment with Python installed. To download the latest binary, and make it executable simply:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ curl -LOs https://archive.org/download/ia-pex/ia

<section id="reading-metadata">
<h3>Reading Metadata<a href="#reading-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>You can use <code><span>ia</span></code> to read and write metadata from archive.org. To retrieve all of an item’s metadata in JSON, simply:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata TripDown1905
</pre></div>
<p>A particularly useful tool to use alongside <code><span>ia</span></code> is <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>. <code><span>jq</span></code> is a command-line tool for parsing JSON. For example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata TripDown1905 <span>|</span> jq <span>'.metadata.date'</span>
<span>"1906"</span>
</pre></div>
</section>
<section id="modifying-metadata">
<h3>Modifying Metadata<a href="#modifying-metadata" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Once <code><span>ia</span></code> has been <a href="https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/quickstart.html#configuring">configured</a>, you can modify <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata-schema">metadata</a>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --modify<span>=</span><span>"foo:bar"</span> --modify<span>=</span><span>"baz:foooo"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can remove a metadata field by setting the value of the given field to <code><span>REMOVE_TAG</span></code>.
For example, to remove the metadata field <code><span>foo</span></code> from the item <code><span>&lt;identifier&gt;</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --modify<span>=</span><span>"foo:REMOVE_TAG"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that some metadata fields (e.g. <code><span>mediatype</span></code>) cannot be modified, and must instead be set initially on upload.</p>
<p>The default target to write to is <code><span>metadata</span></code>. If you would like to write to another target, such as <code><span>files</span></code>, you can specify so using the <code><span>--target</span></code> parameter. For example, if we had an item whose identifier was <code><span>my_identifier</span></code> and we wanted to add a metadata field to a file within the item called <code><span>foo.txt</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata my_identifier --target<span>=</span><span>"files/foo.txt"</span> --modify<span>=</span><span>"title:My File"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can also create new targets if they don’t exist:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --target<span>=</span><span>"extra_metadata"</span> --modify<span>=</span><span>"foo:bar"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>There is also an <code><span>--append</span></code> option which allows you to append a string to an existing metadata strings (Note: use <code><span>--append-list</span></code> for appending elements to a list).
For example, if your item’s title was <code><span>Foo</span></code> and you wanted it to be <code><span>Foo</span> <span>Bar</span></code>, you could simply do:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --append<span>=</span><span>"title: Bar"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If you would like to add a new value to an existing field that is an array (like <code><span>subject</span></code> or <code><span>collection</span></code>), you can use the <code><span>--append-list</span></code> option:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --append-list<span>=</span><span>"subject:another subject"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This command would append <code><span>another</span> <span>subject</span></code> to the items list of subjects, if it doesn’t already exist (i.e. no duplicate elements are added).</p>
<p>Metadata fields or elements can be removed with the <code><span>--remove</span></code> option:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata &lt;identifier&gt; --remove<span>=</span><span>"subject:another subject"</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This would remove <code><span>another</span> <span>subject</span></code> from the items subject field, regardless of whether or not the field is a single or multi-value field.</p>

<section id="modifying-metadata-in-bulk">
<h3>Modifying Metadata in Bulk<a href="#modifying-metadata-in-bulk" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>If you have a lot of metadata changes to submit, you can use a CSV spreadsheet to submit many changes with a single command.
Your CSV must contain an <code><span>identifier</span></code> column, with one item per row. Any other column added will be treated as a metadata field to modify. If no value is provided in a given row for a column, no changes will be submitted. If you would like to specify multiple values for certain fields, an index can be provided: <code><span>subject[0]</span></code>, <code><span>subject[1]</span></code>. Your CSV file should be UTF-8 encoded. See <a href="https://archive.org/download/ia-pex/metadata.csv">metadata.csv</a> for an example CSV file.</p>
<p>Once you’re ready to submit your changes, you can submit them like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia metadata --spreadsheet<span>=</span>metadata.csv
</pre></div>
<p>See <code><span>ia</span> <span>help</span> <span>metadata</span></code> for more details.</p>

<section id="upload">
<h2>Upload<a href="#upload" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p><code><span>ia</span></code> can also be used to upload items to archive.org. After <a href="https://archive.org/developers/internetarchive/quickstart.html#configuring">configuring ia</a>, you can upload files like so:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia upload &lt;identifier&gt; file1 file2 --metadata<span>=</span><span>"mediatype:texts"</span> --metadata<span>=</span><span>"blah:arg"</span>
</pre></div>
<div>
<p>Warning</p>
<p>Please note that, unless specified otherwise, items will be uploaded with a <code><span>data</span></code> mediatype. <strong>This cannot be changed afterwards.</strong> Therefore, you should specify a mediatype when uploading, eg. <code><span>--metadata="mediatype:movies"</span></code>. Similarly, if you want your upload to end up somewhere else than the default collection (currently <a href="https://archive.org/details/opensource">community texts</a>), you should also specify a collection with <code><span>--metadata="collection:foo"</span></code>. See <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata-schema">metadata documentation</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<p>You can upload files from <code><span>stdin</span></code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ curl http://dumps.wikimedia.org/kywiki/20130927/kywiki-20130927-pages-logging.xml.gz <span>\</span>
  <span>|</span> ia upload &lt;identifier&gt; - --remote-name<span>=</span>kywiki-20130927-pages-logging.xml.gz --metadata<span>=</span><span>"title:Uploaded from stdin."</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can use the <code><span>--retries</span></code> parameter to retry on errors (i.e. if IA-S3 is overloaded):</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ ia upload &lt;identifier&gt; file1 --retries <span>10</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that <code><span>ia</span> <span>upload</span></code> makes a backup of any files that are clobbered.
They are saved to a directory in the item named <code><span>history/files/</span></code>.
The files are named in the format <code><span>$key.~N~</span></code>.
These files can be deleted like normal files.
You can also prevent the backup from happening on clobbers by adding <code><span>-H</span> <span>x-archive-keep-old-version:0</span></code> to your command.</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="https://archive.org/services/docs/api/metadata-schema/index.html#archive-org-identifiers">archive.org Identifiers</a> for more information on creating valid archive.org identifiers.

<h3>Bulk Uploading<a href="#bulk-uploading" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Uploading in bulk can be done similarly to <a href="#modifying-metadata-in-bulk">Modifying Metadata in Bulk</a>. The only difference is that you must provide a <code><span>file</span></code> column which contains a relative or absolute path to your file. Please see <a href="https://archive.org/download/ia-pex/uploading.csv">uploading.csv</a> for an example.</p>

<h3>Setting File-Level Metadata on Upload<a href="#setting-file-level-metadata-on-upload" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>You can set file-level metadata at time of upload via a JSON/JSONL file.
The JSON or JSONL must have a dict for each file, with the local path to the file stored under the key, <code><span>name</span></code>.
For example, you could upload two files named <code><span>foo.txt</span></code> and <code><span>bar.txt</span></code> with a file-level <code><span>title</span></code> with the following JSONL file (named <code><span>file_md.jsonl</span></code>):</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img src="https://spritely.institute/static/images/blog/scheme-wireworld.gif" alt="XOR gate in Scheme Wireworld"></p><p>Hey there, it’s been awhile!  We’re back to share some more exciting
news about <a href="https://gitlab.com/spritely/guile-hoot">Guile Hoot</a>, a
WebAssembly toolchain and Scheme→WASM compiler.  In <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/hoot-wireworld-live-in-browser.html">our last
post</a> we demonstrated that
the Guile Hoot toolchain can be used to assemble programs written in
WebAssembly Text (WAT) format, which allowed us to develop for the
WASM-4 fantasy console.  That was pretty cool, of course, but our goal
is to compile Scheme programs (of the
<a href="https://small.r7rs.org/attachment/r7rs.pdf">R7RS-small</a> dialect, for
now) to WASM.  We are getting ready for our first release, and we’re
happy to report that we’ve made excellent progress!  We can now
demonstrate the Hoot compiler working end-to-end.</p><p>Before we get to the demo, let’s go over what makes Hoot special.
Hoot differs from most WASM compiler projects in some notable ways:</p><ul><li><strong>Self-contained toolchain</strong>: No emscripten, binaryen, wabt, etc.</li><li><strong>GC reference type usage</strong>: The host provides the garbage
collector.</li><li><strong>Small programs produce small binaries</strong>: Kilobytes, not megabytes.</li><li><strong>Full development environment</strong>: Compile and run WASM binaries
without leaving Guile.</li></ul><h3>Self-contained toolchain</h3><p>The Hoot toolchain has been written from the ground up to be
self-contained with no external dependencies required (aside from
Guile, of course.)  This gives us a lot of flexibility and control
over the entire compilation process.  The toolchain includes:</p><ul><li><strong>WAT parser</strong>: Converts WAT to WASM.  Both folded and unfolded
forms are supported.</li><li><strong>Assembler</strong>: Generates WASM binaries.</li><li><strong>Binary parser</strong>: Converts WASM binaries to an internal WASM data
structure.</li><li><strong>Disassembler</strong>: Converts WASM to WAT.</li><li><strong>Linker</strong>: Composes WASM modules with a standard libary (for
example), adding in only what is actually used.</li><li><strong>Interpreter</strong>: Validates and evaluates WASM without having to jump
into the web browser.</li></ul><p>All of these tools are available as a Scheme library that could be
used to automate other WASM targeted build workflows.</p><h3>GC reference types</h3><p>In WASM 1.0, if a language implementation needed a garbage collector
then it had to bring its own built on top of linear memory.  There are
many drawbacks to this approach:</p><ul><li><strong>Large binaries</strong>: A whole GC needs to be shipped along with the
program.</li><li><strong>Stop the world</strong>: Parallelism and concurrency are limited in WASM
right now, so GC performance suffers.</li><li><strong>Collectable confusion</strong>: How do you know when references to your
heap objects are collectable if they’ve been passed to JavaScript or
other WASM modules?  It’s a heap of trouble.</li></ul><p>In other words, you had to ship a <em>bad</em> garbage collector when there
is a battle tested, high performance, production garbage collector
sitting right there in the browser.  Check out Andy Wingo’s excellent
BOB 2023 talk (in
<a href="https://wingolog.org/archives/2023/03/20/a-world-to-win-webassembly-for-the-rest-of-us">text</a>
or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUCegCa7A08">video</a> form) for more
detailed information about the problems with GC in WASM 1.0.  (Andy is
the <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/andy-wingo-leads-g2W.html">lead engineer</a> for the Hoot
project.)</p><p>Thankfully, WASM GC has added the ability to allocate heap values that
are managed by the host.  Hoot is currently one of the few dynamic
language implementations that makes use of GC reference types.  We
hope that by sharing our work and our experience we can help other
dynamic languages find their way into web browsers, too.</p><p>Hoot is also taking advantage of another recent addition to WASM: tail
calls.  Loops are expressed as recursive function calls in Scheme, so
having a tail call feature available simplifies our implementation
effort.  We don’t have to wait long to use these features, either.
Production versions of WASM GC and tail calls are already shipping in
bleeding edge versions of browsers and will become available to all
users of the web soon.</p><h3>Small programs produce small binaries</h3><p>We made the choice when starting this project <em>not to</em> compile Guile’s
C runtime to WASM using emscripten.  While it would have been
feasible, the resulting binaries would have been quite large, among
other things.  We did not want the end result of this project to be a
multiple megabyte binary for “Hello, world.”  Instead, we’ve taken the
approach of writing a dedicated compiler backend for Guile with some
handwritten WASM providing primitive functionality and calling out to
imported host functions when necessary.  Programs compiled with Hoot
include only the parts of the standard library that they rely upon.
As mentioned earlier, WASM GC obviates the need to link in an entire
garbage collector.  For these reasons, Hoot binaries tend to be much
smaller than the output of most other compilers.  Small programs
produce binaries measured in kilobytes, not megabytes.</p><h3>Full development environment</h3><p>Hoot includes an embedded WASM interpreter that makes it possible to
run WASM directly within the Guile process being used for development.
Since the toolchain is also readily available as a set of Scheme
modules, you can compile and test out programs (either Scheme programs
or hand-crafted WAT) from the comfort of the Guile REPL.  There is
also a set of REPL tools to make inspecting and debugging WASM easier.
Keep reading for a practical demonstration of the development
workflow.</p><p>OK, onto Wireworld!</p><h3>Wireworld part 1: Scheme</h3><p>To show off the compiler, we decided to revisit our favorite cellular
automaton: Wireworld. Check out <a href="https://spritely.institute/news/hoot-wireworld-live-in-browser.html">our last
post</a> to learn more about
what Wireworld is and how we used Hoot to build a pure WASM version of
it.  This time, instead of writing several hundred lines of WAT, we
wrote about 70 lines of Scheme:</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span><span>grid-size</span> <span>40</span><span>)</span>

development workflow.  It took several iterations to arrive at the
code above.  In true Scheme fashion, the program was developed
incrementally in an interactive REPL session.  By using Hoot’s WASM
interpreter, we repeatedly compiled and tested the program without
having to load it into a web browser or shell out to V8’s <code>d8</code> tool.
We think it’s pretty neat!  Below is an annotated excerpt of a REPL

<p>Earlier this week, <strong>John M. Burns</strong>, one of Britain’s great comic artists, whose work has thrilled and amazed for more than six decades, announced his retirement from comics.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="551" height="768" src="https://2000ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JMB-Self-Colour.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://2000ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JMB-Self-Colour.jpg 551w, https://2000ad.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/JMB-Self-Colour-215x300.jpg 215w" sizes="(max-width: 551px) 100vw, 551px"><figcaption><em><strong>John M.

<p>John M. Burns is, without a doubt, a legendary British comics creator. His extensive body of work across the last six decades and more has brought so much joy, evoked so much admiration and respect from fans and his peers, with Burns very much an artist’s artist. He is someone whose work is instantly recognisable and someone who maintained the highest quality throughout that extraordinarily long career full of page after page of perfect comic art.</p>



<p>Here at <em>2000 AD</em>, as a way to both recognise the artistic contribution of the man, to celebrate his achievements, and to mark the occasion of his retirement, we wanted to say thank you to him for all the incredible work he’s produced through the years.</p>



<p>Throughout his life’s work, John’s art was always effortlessly dynamic and fluid, his characters emotive and expressive, and he was always so beautifully clear in his storytelling, no matter what the subject or how complex a page needed to be. And he painted just as well as he drew, with a mastery of colour that’s immediately obvious to anyone even casually glancing at one of his pages. A Burns piece was always beautiful, striking, and recognisable to his legions of fans around the world.</p>

<p>Although he produced art for so many British comics and newspapers for more than 60 years, John was perhaps best known for two main periods of his work, the first coming through the 1960s and ‘70s for his beautifully painted art on various TV tie-in strips, predominantly for <em>Look-In</em>, and the second coming with <em>2000 AD</em> from the 1990s until his retirement.</p>



<p><em>2000 AD</em> may have seemed a strange fit for an artist who was never shy of telling everyone that he wasn’t all that interested in science fiction and fantasy, but you certainly couldn’t tell that from the seemingly effortlessly thrilling art, beautiful, bold, unmistakably Burns, that graced the pages of <em>2000 AD</em> or the <em>Judge Dredd Megazine</em>.</p>

<p>Burns is undoubtedly one of the great artists of British comics. Indeed, as several commentators have mentioned, he’s one of the last of the Golden Age of British comic artists to hang their brushes up, with his final work coming in his eighties, still as dynamic, as evocative, and as stunning as when we first saw it. </p>



<p>And, as Matt Smith, <em>2000 AD</em> editor, tells us, he was all about the brushes – the last of the <em>2000 AD</em> artists to stick to physical artwork rather than switch to digital.</p>



<p>From his very first appearance drawing a Garth &nbsp;Ennis <em>Judge Dredd</em> in 1991 all the way through to April of this year with the finale to <em>The Order</em>, Burns brought greatness to <em>2000 AD</em> and it was always an absolute pleasure to see his work.</p>

<p>John M. Burns was born in 1938 in Essex, England. With no formal art training, his work in comics began in the 1950s as an apprentice on various titles such as <em>School Friend</em> and <em>Junior Express</em> before his first major illustration work, in the <em>Champion the Wonder Horse Annual</em> of 1958.</p>



<p>In the 1960s, following his national service, Burns’ comic art and illustrations would appear more and more frequently in a multitude of comics and magazines including <em>Eagle</em>, <em>Wham!</em>, <em>Diana</em>, and <em>TV Century 21</em> with strips including <em>Wulf the Briton</em>, <em>Kelpie The Boy Wizard</em>, <em>Wrath of the Gods</em>, <em>Roving Reporter</em>, <em>Bids for Freedom</em>, <em>The Fists of Danny Pyke</em>, <em>Dolebuasters</em>, and <em>Dan Dare</em>.</p>

<p>It was also during this time that he began what would become plentiful work as a newspaper strip cartoonist. Over many years, millions of newspaper readers would have seen his work on <em>The Seekers</em> (1966-1971), <em>Danielle</em> (1973-1974), <em>George &amp; Lynne</em> (1976-1982), <em>Jane</em> (1985-1989), and <em>Modesty Blaise</em> (1978-1979), where he replaced the great Enrique Badía Romero.</p>

<figcaption><strong><em>Burns’ artwork for Diana comic, adapting Wuthering Heights and Great Expectations, from 1964/1965. </em></strong><br><strong><em>Thanks to <a href="https://lewstringer.blogspot.com/2009/02/more-forgotten-classics-from-john-m.html">Lew Stringer</a> for the scans</em></strong></figcaption></figure>

<p>His work at DC Thomson included lush full-colour adaptations of novels such as <em>Great Expectations</em> and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> in the girls’ weekly <em>Diana</em> where Burns made exceptional use of the higher quality production processes that allowed full-colour painted art to be reproduced. And the techniques and styles he developed here that best utilised that production process continued into the 1970s and 1980s as his art moved into comics and magazines such as <em>TV Action</em>, <em>Countdown</em> and, perhaps most fondly remembered, <em>Look-In</em>. </p>



<p>During this time, Burns’ art was seemingly on the comic adaptations of practically every popular show of the day, including <em>UFO</em> and <em>Mission: Impossible</em> for <em>TV Action</em>; <em>Doctor Who</em> in <em>TV Comic</em>, and <em>The Tomorrow People</em>, <em>Kung Fu</em>, <em>Space 1999</em>, <em>The Bionic Woman</em>, <em>How the West was Won</em>, <em>Smuggler</em>, <em>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century</em>, and <em>Magnum P.I.</em> in <em>Look-In</em>. This work on TV-related strips meant that a generation of children (and more than a few adults) grew up reading the exploits of their TV heroes and fell in love with Burns’ colourful, magnificent artwork. </p>

<p>It wasn’t until 1991 that we first saw Burns’ work inside <em>2000 AD</em>, giving an object lesson in creating stunning yet immediately readable pages with crystal clear storytelling for the comic at a time when this wasn’t always the case. </p>



<p>Obviously, Burns wasn’t brought in via the way of the Future Shock, but instead did that rarest of things, debuting on <em>Judge Dredd</em> on the Garth Ennis-written Garbage Disposal in Prog 738. He’d go on to work with Ennis for several serials, along with Dredds from John Wagner, Dan Abnett, and John Smith. </p>



<p>Although he only really had a handful of Dredds over the next decade-plus, his art put a real stamp on the stories he did illustrate, with his Dredd a memorable one, classic and strong, evoking a darker sensibility, practically a noir tone at times, bringing his signature painterly style and more than a touch of class to <em>2000 AD</em>.</p>



<p>&gt;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>John’s beautiful artwork elevated my Dredd scripts to heights they didn’t deserve, but it was always a pleasure to work with him. </p>



<p>I wish him all the very best on his retirement after such an incredible career.</p>

<p>Along with his work on <em>Judge Dredd</em>, Burns’ other ‘90s <em>2000 AD</em> work included a couple of episodes of the X-Files-influenced <em>Vector 13</em> in 1995 and 1996 (serialised in Progs 974 and 993), followed in 1996 by another strip of black-clad government agents investigating mysterious phenomena and conspiracy theories, <em>Black Light</em>, created by Burns, Dan Abnett, and Steve White (serialised in Progs 1001-1005). This was followed by Gordon Rennie’s 1997 <em>Witchworld</em> series, a pure genre fantasy thing, for which John contibuted art to the final chapter, <em>Closing Shadows</em> (Progs 1059 to 1061). There was also a one-off <em>Durham Red</em>, <em>The Scarlet Apocrypha: Necrocultura</em> written by Dan Abnett (Megazine 4.12, 2002).</p>



<p>But it wasn’t until 1999 that Burns really made his mark at <em>2000 AD</em>, with his art on his first major series – <em>Nikolai Dante</em>. Co-created by Robbie Morrison and Simon Fraser, Dante was incredibly popular, the swashbuckling sci-fi romps of Russia’s greatest lover, thief, rogue, and all-round legend a highlight of this time in the Prog’s history.</p>



<p>But the popularity was a double-edged sword for series artist Fraser and, as he’ll tell you in a moment, he struggled with meeting some of the deadlines. Several great artists were brought on board to take up the slack, including Chris Weston, Charlie Adlard, Henry Flint, and Andy Clarke, but when Burns joined Dante’s crew on Prog 1148 for the <em>Courtship of Jena Makarov</em> storyline the fit was so natural and obvious and just perfect that it became a permanent thing, with Burns often alternating series with Fraser through the remaining 13 years that Dante thrilled readers in the Prog.</p>



<p>The swashbuckling sci-fi of Dante suited Burns’ artwork perfectly. Indeed, he made such a lasting impression on many readers that some, including Walt Simonson, recognised the character because they loved Burns’ art so much.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Back in the mid ‘90s when I was a newbie artist working on my first original story for <em>2000 AD</em> , I was desperate to make a success of it. I was working flat out, but my experience was limited so I was struggling. I couldn’t produce Dante pages as fast as Tharg wanted them, so we needed to get in other artists to fill in. A squad of my peers was duly assembled. Stalwarts like Henry Flint , Charlie Adlard and Andy Clarke duly illustrated several important early chunks of Dante’s exploits. But a more permanent co-artist was required. David Bishop told us that John M. Burns was interested.</p>



<p>You have to understand that as a young and somewhat insecure artist I was simultaneously in awe of Burns and also nervous of him. It was like being a jazz pianist and Thelonius Monk sits down at the piano stool, right next to you. Everyone looks at you wondering what you’re even doing there. You wonder yourself . John M. Burns isn’t just a good comics artist , he’s one of the very best. His draftsmanship is breathtaking. His panel layouts are elegant and dynamic. He can paint as well as he can draw.&nbsp; His storytelling is effortless and powerful.</p>



<div><p>When I met Walt Simonson for the first time and showed him some of my Dante work , he recognised the character, not because of me, but because John M. Burns drew him. Walt is a big fan. The Burns fanclub is large and its alumni are very impressive themselves.</p><p>Burns emerged from a generational wave of British comics artists, coming in the wake of Frank Bellamy, Frank Hampson, David Wright, Ron Embleton , Don Lawrence and Jim Holdaway. If there was a Golden Age of British comics art, then they were it.&nbsp; He’s as good as any of them. He is the last of them. We have been immeasurably lucky to have had his beautiful work for so long. It is a privilege to sit in his shadow.</p></div>

<p>&gt;</p>



<p>Burns and Morrison also went on to create <em>The Bendatti Vendetta</em>, running across three stories in the Megazine from 2002-2005. A cracking all-out action crime thriller, <em>The Bendatti Vendetta</em> chronicled a tale of revenge and gangster vengeance, stylish but brutal, very bloody, and bloody brilliant to look at, with Burns’ art suiting this ’70s-style thriller to a tee.</p>

<p>In 2011, Burns and writer Kek-W first got together with their sci-fi story, <em>Angel Zero</em>. Running in Progs 1751-1763, it was the first strip in a partnership of writer and artist that would last until Burns’ retirement. </p>



<p><em>Angel Zero</em> was inspired by classic Japanese Yakuza and splatter films, telling of one young woman’s struggle to escape her fate as a reluctant assassin and living weapon with an alien battle computer grafted to her nervous system. And of course, it looked amazing.</p>

<p>All of which brings us to <em>The Order</em>, the final strip in Burns’ long and illustrious career, with him reuniting with writer Kek-W for a seven-series run of the serial that began in 2014’s Prog 2015 and ended in April 2023 with Prog 2329.</p>



<p>A time-twisting, genre-hopping, historical epic that stretches over 10,000+ years, <em>The Order</em> chronicles the efforts of the extraordinary women and men of this long-established secret society to protect the world from the paranormal threats of the nightmarish and extra-dimensional Wurms. It all begins with Anna Kohl uncovering the mechanical knight Ritterstahl, who will lead her to a group of her missing father’s old colleagues, all of them members of The Order. The subsequent adventuring takes Anna and the readers into strange territory, a whole secret history of the world, incedible danger, and all of it, of course, looking quite stunning.</p>



<p>Even in this final stage of his career, with Burns in his 70s and 80s, there was no let-up in quality and every page of <em>The Order</em>‘s seven series featured his incredible art, as bold, clear, and beautiful as it had always been.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I first came across the artwork of John M Burns – though I didn’t know it at the time – in the 1960s, in assorted British nursery and educational comics. His work is an indelible part of my formative inner landscape along with Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence and Frank Hampson. It forms one of the pillars of my own creative self; though he doesn’t realise it, John helped make me who I am. It’s a debt I can never fully repay.</p>



<p>So, it’s incredible to me that we ended up working together all these years later. John and I collaborated on a handful of projects (including an unfinished / unpublished creator-owned strip), but it’s the <em>The Order</em>, of course, that forms the main body of our work. Its theme of comradeship – of outsiders overcoming their differences to create an alliance of equal opposites – felt like an optimistic, hopeful antidote to these awful times we find ourselves living in. But it was John who breathed life into its unlikely, unruly cast of characters; his craft was the fuel that animated them – he made them real in ways I never dared imagine.</p>



<p>In the first series, the endless fairytale forests of 12th century Germany were a glorious call-back to the fabulous landscapes painted by John that had populated the comics of my childhood. When, one day on the phone, he told me his first professional work had been a front-piece for a Champion the Wonder Horse annual, I brought wurm-horses and wurm-dogs into the strip – flashbacks, not only to John’s own astonishing body of work, but to classic Action-Adventure strips and Silver Age animal sidekicks like Rin Tin Tin, Lassie and White Horses. Through John I rediscovered that childlike sense of optimism and wonder I thought I had lost forever.</p>



<p>John’s disdain for science-fiction and fantastical story elements is legendary – yet he’s just so darn good at it! He would regularly cajole me to get rid of Ritterstahl: “No more robots!” he’d grumble. “Can’t we just kill him off?” But when, in an attempt to placate him, I introduced Cassi Jones and the crew of the Cannonball Express (another childhood fave) his response was to send me a postcard which read: “No more trains!”</p>



<p>I love John’s dry chuckle and his self-effacing sense of humour. It’s like he genuinely doesn’t realise the huge esteem in which he’s held; the great affection that we all have for him. John is an artistic titan, one of the giants of our industry – of our beloved hobby. I’ve learned so much while working with him – his career has paralleled the arc of my life. “It’s just a job,” he once told me when I was asking advice on how to navigate the cut-and-thrust existence of a freelancer, “a job like any other. Yet, despite all that, we can’t help putting so much of ourselves on the page.”</p>



<p>Even though I knew it was coming, I confess I had a lump in my throat when he phoned earlier this week to say he had decided to retire. It felt like the end of an era. But I also knew it was selfish of me to secretly want more from a man who has already given us so much of himself. “I’ve walked down to my studio every morning for over sixty years,” he told me. I hope he continues to make that walk for many more years to come.</p>



<p>I wish John and Julia all the very best.</p>

<p>Burns’ gorgeous artwork continued on <em>The Order</em> right until the end of its seventh and final series in April 2023. By this time, on medical advice, he first decided to cut back on his workload and then to retire completely. By this point, he was into his eighties and had been making art – beautiful, striking, bold art – for more than 60 years.</p>



<p>So, on the occasion of his retirement, we at <em>2000 AD</em> wanted to send John our very best wishes and our heartfelt thanks for the incredible body of work he’s produced over the years. As so many of you have been saying, including the writers and artists who worked with him and loved his work so much, we will all miss seeing his work in the pages of the Prog.</p>



<p>We wish John and his wife, Julia, all our best for a long, enjoyable, and very happy retirement. And we hope, as do legions of his fans and fellow artists that this true great of British comics doesn’t completely give up the drawing board just yet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many years ago, back in 1973, I picked up an issue of TV Action from Fennells, the newsagent in Lakeside shopping precinct in Cardiff. It was a few minutes walk up a very steep hill, but worth every step….I was on the hunt! Somehow I had heard that if I bought a copy of this week’s that weeks comic I would get a free packet of Spangles- what a bargain. I’d not even heard of the comic before though, and wasn’t a committed comic fan at that point, but clearly I just hadn’t found the right one yet. As it turns out the comic itself was life-changing- Dr Who by Gerry Haylock, the Persuaders by Jose Ortiz, along with UFO and Mission Impossible by a certain John M Burns (yes, the comic credited its artists, a real rarity in those days). I was absolutely captivated and not the least bit interested in the Spangles any more. It was the moment when I realised that actual people drew these things and I absolutely wanted to see more. From that moment on I’ve collected as much of John’s work as I could find, not least in the pages of 2000AD of course (I’m still waiting for more episodes of Witchworld!), and have put together a sizeable collection of his originals- which are constantly puled out to admire and be inspired by. And intimidated!</p>



<p>So yes, I’m a fan, a completist, and an admirer. Seeing John’s work literally changed my life- as a comic artist of several decades standing now I can trace that passion all the way back to the first time I saw his artwork, the impression it made on me was that profound.</p>



<p>It still looks incredible to me now. If we have seen the last piece of comic art from John, then he’s left us with an incredibly rich and inspiring legacy, and not many people can say that about their lives. So thank you maestro, for everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John was already a regular contributor when I started at 2000 AD – in fact, he was in the middle of painting the thirteen-part Nikolai Dante arc ‘The Romanov Empire’ when I joined, and of course he made such epic-ness look effortless. Every three to four weeks, a cardboard tube would arrive in the post from Cornwall with his latest pages, and they were beautiful, tactile things, where you marvelled over the brush strokes. </p>



<p>Twenty years on, and John was still delivering physical painted pages, the last of the droids not to adopt a digital methodology, and he remained an incredibly reliable creator, capable of turning his hand to most genres and with the same consummate skill. It’ll be the end of an era not to have him in the prog any more, and we’ll miss him.’</p>

This follows the recent launch of ElevenLabs’ <em>Projects </em>tool to support streamlined long-form audio creation</li></ul><p><em><strong>10th October, Global</strong></em> - <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/">ElevenLabs</a>, the global leader in voice AI technology, today announces the addition of a groundbreaking <strong>voice translation feature</strong> to its platform. Born from the foundational mission to eliminate the linguistic barriers of content upon which ElevenLabs was established, and a culmination of the company's research to date, the <strong>AI Dubbing </strong>tool enables users to automatically translate any speech into a different language while maintaining the original speaker’s voice - creating a new, high-quality and effective way of dubbing audio and video content.</p><p>CEO and co-founder of ElevenLabs, Mati Staniszewski, comments:</p><p><em>“The release of AI Dubbing is our biggest step yet towards eliminating these linguistic barriers of content. It will help audiences enjoy any content they want, regardless of the language they speak. And it will mean content creators can easily and authentically access a far bigger audience across the world. Having experienced these language barriers first hand, my co-founder Piotr and I are so excited to finally bring AI dubbing to life.”</em></p><p>Signaling a new era in content accessibility across mediums like streaming, gaming, and films, the new tool goes beyond traditional translation and captioning by preserving the speaker's identity and original speech patterns when translated. This means that the voice of the same actor can be heard by audiences in over 20 different languages, delivering lines with the characteristics and nuance of the original recording. </p><p><em>AI Dubbing</em> combines the company’s research on multilingual speech synthesis, voice cloning, text and audio processing, into a single tool; enhancing the authenticity of the translated content and making it more accessible to a broader audience while keeping the essence of the original delivery. The AI Dubbing feature supports voice translation across over 20 languages currently supported by the Eleven Multilingual v2 model, including Hindi, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Ukrainian, Polish or Arabic. </p><p>This move further extends ElevenLab’s research across the audio AI space; enabling emotions and intonation from original audio to be transformed to dubbed audio. The company has also developed its own method to detect the voices of different speakers and methods to remove background noise, differentiating music and noise from dialogue. This means the tool can effectively handle audio or video containing multiple speakers, ensuring each voice remains distinct and recognizable across different languages. </p><p>By automating the dubbing process and ensuring high-quality output, ElevenLabs simplifies the creation of multilingual content for creators, educators, and media companies. Only 6% of the world’s population are native English speakers and 75% don’t speak any English. This release means every video can now be made available to a global audience, at speed and at low cost. </p><p>The announcement follows the recent release of <em>Projects</em> - ElevenLabs’ advanced workflow for generating and editing long-form audio, supporting a variety of editing features, such as speaker assignment, pause insertion, and segment regeneration.</p><p>With this addition, ElevenLabs continues its mission of breaking down language barriers and making content universally accessible in any language and voice.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ulaLIx0GbnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" title="ElevenLabs | AI Dubbing Product Demo"></iframe></figure>

<h3 id="building-the-crdt">Building the CRDT</h3>
<p>Before we start on the CRDT, we need just one more type. We’ll store colors as tuples of three integers, representing red, green and blue values.</p>
<pre><code><span>type</span> <span><span>RGB</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>red<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> green<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> blue<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s build the CRDT! It’ll be a class called <code>PixelData</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PixelData</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>readonly</span> id<span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span>

<p>This is only a thin wrapper over a LWW Map. Almost every method just calls the corresponding LWW Map method!</p>
<p>The biggest change involves the static method <code>key</code>. When we’re interacting with the pixel art editor, it’s most natural to think in terms of <em>(x,y)</em> coordinates. But our LWW Map needs string keys! The <code>key</code> static method serializes coordinate pairs to strings — for example, <em>(15,29)</em> becomes <code>"15,29"</code>. Since the LWW Map values are colors in the form of <code>RGB</code> tuples, we can think of this data structure as mapping from pixel coordinates to colors, with each key representing a single pixel.</p>
<p>The <code>get</code> method is also slightly different. We want our pixels to default to white. So if no value has been set, we return a default value of <code>[255, 255, 255]</code>.</p>
<p>Let’s peek under the hood and see what will happen to each register in the map when we draw.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-chonky" id="user-content-fnref-chonky" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">2</a></sup></p>
<combo-diagram></combo-diagram>
<p>Here we can really see how the keys and values interact. When painting the top left square, the key <code>"1,1"</code> is set to the RGB color you have selected (<code>[0, 0, 0]</code> if you didn’t change from the default). We can also see how pixels that haven’t yet been set default to white. Painting over a pixel overwrites the value and increments the timestamp by one. If you turn the network off and paint the same pixels on each canvas, the ones with the higher timestamps will win out when you turn the network back on.</p>
<p>This visualization takes a lot of space for just a few pixels. Instead, let’s overlay each pixel with the timestamp of its register:</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="20" debug="true"></pixelart-demo>
<p>Now we can see how each pixel should interact in the context of the picture.</p>
<p>That’s it! That’s the whole CRDT! As you read through the rest of the post, you’ll see that the app mostly doesn’t even realize that it’s using a CRDT under the hood.</p>

<span>}</span><span>;</span></code></pre>
<p>Let’s break this down a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>Query the DOM for the two <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements and the color input.</li>
<li>Store the artboard size. These are the drawable dimensions, and they might be different from the size of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element. For example, the canvas might be 400×400, but we might want our picture to only be 40×40, where each “pixel” the user sees takes up 10×10 actual pixels on the canvas. For clarity, “artboard” will always refer to what the user perceives and interacts with, while “canvas” will refer to the underlying <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li>Instantiate a <code>PixelEditor</code> class (which we’ll write shortly) with a <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and the artboard size.</li>
<li>When a change happens in either editor, merge the state with the other.</li>
<li>Set the editor color whenever the color input changes. HTML color inputs return their color as hex code strings<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-hex" id="user-content-fnref-hex" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">3</a></sup> (for example, <code>#845ef7</code>) so we need to do a little work to convert it to RGB format. This code just removes the <code>#</code>, splits the string into two-character chunks and parses each of them from a base 16 integer into a JS <code>number</code> — which is exactly what our <code>RGB</code> type expects.</li>
</ol>
<p>As you can see, we’re only simulating the network. Actually writing network code is a separate problem from designing and using the CRDT data structure.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-network" id="user-content-fnref-network" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="starting-the-editor">Starting the Editor</h3>
<p>Let’s define the <code>PixelEditor</code> class now. Here’s the skeleton:</p>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The methods are empty (for now), but hopefully this gives a decent idea of what the shape of this program will be. At a high level, when the user draws on the canvas with their mouse, the <code>PixelEditor</code>…</p>
<ol>
<li>Receives DOM events (<code>handleEvent</code>) and sets the selected color (<code>#paint</code>) in its <code>PixelData</code> CRDT.</li>
<li>Draws to the canvas (<code>#draw</code>) based on its <code>PixelData</code> CRDT value.</li>
<li>Notifies any listeners (<code>#notify</code>) that its data has changed.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the other end, when a <code>PixelEditor</code> receives state from a peer (<code>receive</code>) it updates its own <code>PixelData</code> CRDT and then draws to the canvas (<code>#draw</code>).</p>
<p>Cool, so let’s start filling in those missing <code>PixelEditor</code> methods. First up, the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>el<span>:</span> HTMLCanvasElement<span>,</span> artboard<span>:</span> <span>{</span> w<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>;</span> h<span>:</span> <span>number</span> <span>}</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<ol>
<li>Store the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element and get the 2D rendering context.</li>
<li>Store the artboard size. We’ll use this later to convert between the artboard resolution and the canvas resolution.</li>
<li>Listen for <code>pointerdown</code>, <code>pointermove</code> and <code>pointerup</code> events. These will be triggered when the user interacts with the canvas.</li>
<li>Resize the canvas size to match the dimensions of the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-dpi" id="user-content-fnref-dpi" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">5</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>Now onto the instance methods. First up, <code>color</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/** Sets the drawing color. */</span>
  <span>set</span> <span>color</span><span>(</span>color<span>:</span> <span>RGB</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This is just a setter that takes an <code>RGB</code> tuple and sets the drawing color. You might remember that when we set up our HTML, we called this setter from outside the class in response to <code>input</code> events on the color input.</p>
<p>Next, <code>handleEvent</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**

      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This handles all three types of pointer events. Let’s go through them one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>pointerdown</code> is triggered when the user depresses the mouse button or touches their finger to the screen. Calling <code>setPointerCapture</code> on the <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element “captures” the pointer, which lets us figure out whether discrete events are part of one continuous drag. We also want to draw a pixel, which uses the same logic as the <code>pointermove</code> event, so we fall through to the next switch case.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-badidearight" id="user-content-fnref-badidearight" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">6</a></sup></li>
<li><code>pointermove</code> is triggered when the pointer, uh, moves. At the top, we check whether the pointer is captured, so we can ignore mouse events if the user isn’t holding down the mouse button. Then, we convert from canvas pixels to artboard pixels and call the <code>#paint</code> method to draw the pixel on the canvas.</li>
<li><code>pointerup</code> is triggered when the user releases the mouse button or removes their finger from the screen. We clean up by calling <code>releasePointerCapture</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we’ve just called the <code>#paint</code> method, let’s see what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Sets pixel under the mouse cursor with the current color.
   * @param x X coordinate of the destination pixel.

<p>Simple enough: if the given coordinates are inside the artboard, it sets the coordinates to the active color in <code>#data</code> (an instance of the <code>PixelData</code> class we defined before) and then draws to the canvas. Like I said, we don’t really care at this point that <code>PixelData</code> class is actually a CRDT — as far as the <code>PixelEditor</code> class is concerned, it’s just setting a color in its data.</p>
<p>Now, <code>#draw</code>. The basic idea is that we’ll allocate a <strong>buffer</strong> — a contiguous chunk of memory, like an array — and then we write the raw pixel data there. Once we’ve done that, the canvas API lets us draw the raw pixel data onto the canvas. Here’s what it looks like:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/** Draw each pixel on the canvas. */</span>

<p>Slight tangent into how colors are represented in memory. RGB colors consist of three channels — red, green and blue — each of which is a single number between 0 and 255, or eight bits (one byte). That’s 24-bit color. The canvas API uses 32-bit color, which adds one extra channel — alpha, or transparency — which is also a single number between 0 and 255. So each pixel takes up up four bytes.</p>
<p>First, we need to allocate a buffer to hold the pixel data.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-optimization" id="user-content-fnref-optimization" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">7</a></sup> Since we know the pixel dimensions of the artboard, we can calculate how big of a buffer we need: four bytes per pixel times the artboard width times the artboard height. From there, we iterate over the rows and columns of the artboard, calculating each pixel’s byte offset into the buffer. Then we write the pixel color values into the next four bytes of the buffer following that offset.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with how to calculate the offset, try the playground below. Hover over different pixels in the “artboard” at the top or the “buffer” at the bottom to see how they correspond to each other.</p>
<buffer-diagram width="3" height="3"></buffer-diagram>
<p>The first four bytes (0–3) are the red, green, blue and alpha channels of the top left pixel. The next four bytes (4–7) are the pixel second from the left on the top row — and so on, until we hit the top right pixel. Then, we wrap around — the next four bytes of the buffer are the leftmost pixel on the <strong>second</strong> row — and continue going, until finally we get to the bottom right pixel in the last four bytes of the buffer.</p>
<p>Finally, we draw that buffer to the canvas.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-canvasstuff" id="user-content-fnref-canvasstuff" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">8</a></sup> Phew!</p>
<p>At this point, we have a fully functional pixel art editor without the peer-to-peer parts:</p>
<pixelart-demo network="off" dda="off" dedupe="off"></pixelart-demo>

<p>Before we can connect the two editors, we need to fix a big issue with the drawing. You’ve probably noticed it already: if you move quickly, there are gaps between the pixels.</p>
<h3 id="drawing-lines">Drawing Lines</h3>
<p>The problem is that events don’t necessarily get triggered as fast as the user can move their cursor, which means that the coordinates for each call to <code>#paint</code> might not be next to each other. We can fix this by storing the pixel coordinates of the pointer during the previous event, and drawing a line between them and the current coordinates. Buckle up, because we’re about to make a bunch of changes to our <code>PixelEditor</code> class.</p>
<p>First, we’ll add a private <code>#prev</code> property that holds either an <em>(x,y)</em> coordinate pair, or <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PixelEditor</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>

  <span>/** The previous position of the mouse cursor */</span>
  #prev<span>:</span> <span>[</span>x<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>]</span> <span>|</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, we’ll modify our <code>handleEvent</code> method. We need to store the cursor’s coordinates on the artboard in <code>#prev</code> as the very last step in the <code>pointermove</code> case,<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-fallthrough" id="user-content-fnref-fallthrough" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">9</a></sup> right before the <code>break</code>. Then, in the <code>pointerup</code> case, we need to reset <code>#prev</code> to <code>undefined</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Handles events on the canvas.
   * @param e Pointer event from the canvas element.
   */</span>
  <span>handleEvent</span><span>(</span>e<span>:</span> PointerEvent<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>e<span>.</span>type<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>// ...</span>

        <span>this</span><span>.</span>#prev <span>=</span> <span>[</span>x<span>,</span> y<span>]</span><span>;</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>

      <span>case</span> <span>"pointerup"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>// ...</span>
        <span>this</span><span>.</span>#prev <span>=</span> <span>undefined</span><span>;</span>
        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>The biggest changes are in our <code>#paint</code> method, where we need to implement the line drawing. There are a bunch of algorithms for doing this; we’ll use one called <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/line_generation_algorithm.htm" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Digital Differential Analyzer</a><a data-tooltip="" href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_graphics/line_generation_algorithm.htm" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/images/logo.png" alt="" onerror="this.remove()" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f=""><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Line Generation Algorithm</span><span data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">Line Generation Algorithm - A line connects two points.

<p>We’re now drawing smooth, connected lines! Check it out:</p>
<pixelart-demo network="off" dedupe="off"></pixelart-demo>

<h3 id="syncing-state">Syncing state</h3>
<p>Finally, we’re ready to connect these two canvases together. Whenever one peer makes a change, we’ll send its state to the other. After that peer’s <code>PixelData</code> CRDT merges the incoming state into its own, both canvases will have converged upon the same state.</p>
<p>You might remember the <code>PixelEditor</code> property <code>#listeners</code> from way back, when we wrote the skeleton of the class. We’re about to put it to use. First, we’ll fill out the <code>onchange</code> setter:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Appends a listener to be called when the state changes.
   * @param listener */</span>
  <span>set</span> <span>onchange</span><span>(</span>listener<span>:</span> <span>(</span>state<span>:</span> PixelData<span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#listeners<span>.</span><span>push</span><span>(</span>listener<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>This takes an callback function and adds it to <code>#listeners</code>.</p>
<p>Next, we need a way to notify the listeners that the data changed. That method is called <code>#notify</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/** Notify all listeners that the state has changed. */</span>
  <span>#notify</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> state <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span>state<span>;</span>
    <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>const</span> listener <span>of</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#listeners<span>)</span> <span>listener</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It grabs the current state from the <code>PixelData</code> CRDT stored in <code>#data</code>. Then, it iterates through each listener and calls it with that state.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to actually call our <code>#notify</code> method. We’ll nestle that right at the end of <code>#paint</code>, so that any time we change the state we also notify all the listeners:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Sets pixel under the mouse cursor with the current color.
   * If the user is dragging their cursor, also fills in pixels between the given coordinates and the previous ones.
   * @param x X coordinate of the destination pixel.
   * @param y Y coordinate of the destination pixel.
   */</span>
  <span>#paint</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>

    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>#notify</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>That takes care of the sending. On the other end, we need to merge the data into our local state when we receive it from another peer. This last method is called <code>receive</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Merge remote state with the current state and redraw the canvas.
   * @param state State to merge into the current state. */</span>
  <span>receive</span><span>(</span>state<span>:</span> PixelData<span>[</span><span>"state"</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#data<span>.</span><span>merge</span><span>(</span>state<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>#draw</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>We’re familiar with this pattern by now: when a CRDT has to merge some state, it sends parts of it to the appropriate CRDTs. In this case, <code>PixelEditor</code> isn’t a CRDT, so we’re just sending the whole thing off to <code>#data</code> to be merged.</p>
<p>And that’s it! Take a look at our two connected pixel art editors.</p>
<pixelart-demo dedupe="off"></pixelart-demo>

<h3 id="fixing-timestamps">Fixing Timestamps</h3>
<p>We’re almost done, but there’s one more optimization I want to make. We know that under the hood, each pixel is a LWW Register, which means it has a timestamp. Peers will compare those timestamps when merging their state.</p>
<p>But right now, if you click and drag around, the timestamps get weirdly high — especially if you go slowly. Here’s a playground with a lower resolution that shows each pixel’s timestamp.</p>
<pixelart-demo resolution="20" dedupe="off" debug="true"></pixelart-demo>

<p>The problem is pointer events can fire a lot — often, multiple times on the same artboard pixel. To solve this, we’ll keep a set of each pixel we’ve painted during a single drag operation, and ensure we don’t change any pixels already in the set.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-leakyabstraction" id="user-content-fnref-leakyabstraction" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">10</a></sup></p>
<p>First, let’s add a set of all the keys we’ve painted to our <code>PixelEditor</code> class:</p>
<pre><code><span>class</span> <span>PixelEditor</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>

  <span>/** The set of pixel keys that have been painted during the current drag operation */</span>
  #painted <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Set<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Next, we’ll add a <code>#checkPainted</code> method. It will take an <em>(x,y)</em> coordinate pair and return whether it’s in the set of painted pixels.</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Check whether a pixel has been painted during the current drag operation
   * @param x X coordinate of the target pixel.
   * @param y Y coordinate of the target pixel.
   */</span>
  <span>#checkPainted</span><span>(</span>x<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>,</span> y<span>:</span> <span>number</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>const</span> key <span>=</span> PixelData<span>.</span><span>key</span><span>(</span>x<span>,</span> y<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>const</span> painted <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>#painted<span>.</span><span>has</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span>#painted<span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span>key<span>)</span><span>;</span>

    <span>return</span> painted<span>;</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>It also adds the coordinates to the set, so any successive calls to <code>#checkPainted</code> with the same coordinates return <code>true</code>. The order of these statements is important: we need to first check whether the pixel was already painted, then add it to the set, and finally return whether it was in the set <strong>before</strong> we added it.</p>
<p>We’ll use <code>#checkPainted</code> in the <code>#paint</code> method before we set a color for any pixel:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Sets pixel under the mouse cursor with the current color.
   * If the user is dragging their cursor, also fills in pixels between the given coordinates and the previous ones.
   * @param x X coordinate of the destination pixel.
   * @param y Y coordinate of the destination pixel.

    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Finally, on the <code>pointerup</code> event, just as we reset <code>#prev</code>, we also need to reset <code>#painted</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  <span>/**
   * Handles events on the canvas.
   * @param e Pointer event from the canvas element.
   */</span>
  <span>handleEvent</span><span>(</span>e<span>:</span> PointerEvent<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>switch</span> <span>(</span>e<span>.</span>type<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

        <span>break</span><span>;</span>
      <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>Now, each pixel’s timestamp will be incremented by at most 1 during each drag:</p>

<p>Hex codes are actually just RGB colors encoded in base 16 (hexadecimal). Every two letters of a hex code combine to form one byte. <code>#845ef7</code> can be split into <code>84</code> (red), <code>5e</code> (green) and <code>f7</code> (blue), which works out to <code>132</code>, <code>94</code> and <code>247</code> in base 10 (decimal, or “normal” numbers). <a href="#user-content-fnref-hex" data-footnote-backref="" aria-label="Back to content" data-astro-cid-bi7aps5f="">↩</a></p>

<p>PostgreSQL isn’t getting any younger. Which is fine – after all, databases generally improve with age. The platform is going from strength, and is a default choice for a big chunk of modern software development. But Postgres has been around for a while – it launched in 1986 – which has an implication for the folks actually building the database. Just how long will they want to do the heavy lifting of maintaining a high profile codebase that so many folks rely on? Postgres is a close knit group and project. Robert Haas, Postgres committer and chief database scientist at EnterpriseDB writes a regular contribution post and the latest numbers are salutary – <a href="https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2023/04/who-contributed-to-postgresql.html">Who Contributed to PostgreSQL Development in 2022?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
I calculate that, in 2022, there were 192 people who were the principal author of at least one PostgreSQL commit. 66% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 14 people, and 90% of the new lines of code were contributed by one of 40 people.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The core development community is aging somewhat – the average age is probably around 50. Which is totally fine. 50 year olds are more than capable of doing a shitload of work – don’t ask me how I know. Tom Lane, who works at Crunchy Data, is 68 and he’s still the Postgres project’s fulcrum. Long may that continue.</p>
<p>The Postgres community is amazing. Open Postgres governance is something we can and do rely on, which is refreshing in the current era of commercial open source licensing rugpulls. But as an axis to consider in terms of open source sustainability let’s assume that Postgres is still going strong in say, 20 years. Who is going to be doing the work in 2043? I had a fascinating conversation with Nikita Shamgunov, CEO of <a href="https://neon.tech/">Neon</a> recently and one of the subjects we discussed was aging in tech projects and its relationship to project sustainability. Neon is a fully managed Postgres database optimised for serverless apps, separating storage from compute – the database is just a URL. That’s the design principle. It allows for branching, with preview deployments – thus Neon’s <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/guides/vercel-postgres">partnership with Vercel</a>. Make it easy, make it modern, make it a zero config API. Neon has 62 employees and has raised $108m so far. It competes with the likes of Supabase. But back to the subject at hand.</p>
<p>According to Shamgunov:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If you look at the Postgres committer crowd they’re in their 50s, 60s, 40s and maybe a few in their 30s. It takes a lot of effort to become a committer but very little to be a contributor – you just need to write good code.</p>
<p> I think we’re doing good to the world by hiring more junior people and training them to become committers and hopefully maintainers. It’s very important that the Postgres engine continues to evolve.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Neon is being intentional about investing in the next generation of contributors, committers and maintainers. The natural move for a lot of companies is to try and hire the existing top talent, rather than fostering new blood.</p>
<blockquote><p>
We debated whether to just find more Postgres committers and hire them. But it’s not clear that would be spending our money in the best way. If we train new ones it’s better, and that’s how we can keep ramping the Postgres team.
</p></blockquote>
<p>There are some interesting questions here. For example – consider Neon’s IP, which is currently permissively licensed, but Shamgunov is not an open source zealot. What happens if in a few years the company decides to relicense, as other database companies have – see for example Redis, MongoDB and Elastic. Neon would be perfectly within its rights to relicense under more restrictive terms, potential community blowback aside. But any code they had contributed to Postgres? That’s not going to be affected. Having core Postgres maintainers on staff is a pretty good example of enlightened self interest and should serve to keep the company honest. Whatever decisions Neon makes in future, assuming they have employees dedicated to making Postgres better, then the community and core codebase still wins.</p>
<p>Cohort aging is certainly not a problem that’s unique to Postgres. Anyone remember the year 2000 bug? Communities and ecosystems do get older, which can be an issue when it comes to skills and staffing and rejuvenation. IBM has done a great job of bringing younger developers into the mainframe fold, for example with vocational education programs at universities – here is a <a href="https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2011/04/08/grey-hairs-and-red-herrings-ibm-mainframe-skills-resurgence-is-a-triumph-of-developer-relations/">post</a> I wrote about that a while back.</p>
<p>There are plenty of projects with literally millions of users that are run by one or two people and don’t have the level of corporate sponsorship with see with projects such as Postgres or even Kubernetes. Postgres isn’t in any sense struggling to attract new users – there are plenty of 22 year olds defaulting to it today. It’s a hugely popular platform. But yes, ensuring the ongoing maintenance of the project will require some intentionality, funding, and enlightened self interest.</p>

<p>A new report in the Wall Street Journal highlights the stratospheric costs that Big Tech faces delivering AI capabilities to their customers. And it seems that even the paid services are losing money.</p>
<p>“Microsoft used AI from its partner OpenAI to launch GitHub Copilot, a service that helps programmers create, fix, and translate code,” <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/ais-costly-buildup-could-make-early-products-a-hard-sell-bdd29b9f">the publication notes</a>. “It has been popular with coders—more than 1.5 million people have used it and it is helping build nearly half of Copilot users’ code—because it slashes the time and effort needed to program. It has also been a money loser because it is so expensive to run.”</p><div data-thurrott-section="inline-form"><h2>Windows Intelligence In Your Inbox</h2><p>Sign up for our new free newsletter to get three time-saving tips each Friday — <i>and</i> get free copies of Paul Thurrott's Windows 11 and Windows 10 Field Guides (normally $9.99) as a special welcome gift!</p>

</div>
<p>As the WSJ notes, individuals pay $10 per month for GitHub Copilot, but multiple sources told it that the service loses an average of $20 per user per month, with some users costing Microsoft as much as $80 per month. So it’s likely that this situation played a role in the company’s decision to charge a lot more for the AI capabilities it will soon provide via Microsoft 365 Copilot. That service will cost customers $30 per user per month on top of the normal monthly Microsoft 365 subscription fee (which varies by tier). It’s not coincidental that <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/287822/google-duet-ai-to-cost-30-per-user-per-month-just-like-microsoft-365-copilot">Google will charge an identical additional per-user fee</a> for <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/282958/google-workspace-duet-ai">its similar Duet AI offering</a>.</p>
<p>The extravagant cost of AI also explains why <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/290645/microsoft-first-ai-chip-could-be-revealed-november-2023">Microsoft is working to develop its own in-house AI chipsets for use in its datacenters</a> and is pushing the PC industry to adopt what it calls NPUs—Neural Processing Units that accelerate AI operations independently of the CPU—that will usher in <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/hardware/290462/hp-ai-will-transform-the-pc-into-a-personal-companion">the new era of PC computing that HP discussed last week</a>: These coming PCs will be able to offload some AI tasks from the cloud and process them locally, reducing the expenses on the backend.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also looking at shorter-term solutions for the costs of AI, especially for services like Bing Chat, Bing Image Creator, and Microsoft Copilot which are free to users. One possible solution is to use less powerful backend services that don’t cost as much to run, according to some reports.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it appears that Adobe—which charges Creative Cloud customers astonishing sums each month for its suite of artistic tools—has solved this problem with its Firefly generative AI tools, which are profitable: It simply slows down the service’s performance on a per-user basis once that user has gone over their monthly credit allotment, an allotment that is no doubt based on the price they pay Adobe each month. “We are trying to protect ourselves on the cost side,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen told the WSJ.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div role="main" id="maincontent"><article expanded="true"><div data-io-article-url="/2023/10/10/valve-confirms-counter-strike-2-no-macos/"><p>Valve on Monday said it has no plans for a macOS version of the recently released game <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, the follow-up title replacing the hugely popular FPS <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.macrumors.com/t/VgaymjyzNfrz_l_nGeI0-b1dAS0=/400x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg?lossy" srcset="https://images.macrumors.com/t/VgaymjyzNfrz_l_nGeI0-b1dAS0=/400x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg?lossy 400w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/3LYFtb0PCSAnjDkTeOstiTfiAj8=/800x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg?lossy 800w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/XPibE-qX4IBita2iI7uQ91Z1lDM=/1600x0/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg 1600w,https://images.macrumors.com/t/GpOy1aPnNhtJDtKPUb7ywXHOKTo=/2500x0/filters:no_upscale()/article-new/2023/09/counter-srike-21.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 697px" alt="counter srike 21" width="800" height="450"><br>Valve confirmed its decision and gave its reasons in a newly published <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/73EF-08A3-0935-6369">Steam support FAQ</a>:<br>
</p>
<blockquote><p>As technology advances, we have made the difficult decision to discontinue support for older hardware, including DirectX 9 and 32-bit operating systems. Similarly, we will no longer support macOS. Combined, these represented less than one percent of active CS:GO players.</p>
<p>Moving forward, Counter-Strike 2 will exclusively support 64-bit Windows and Linux.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last month's release of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> forced a 26GB update for everyone with <em>CS:GO</em>, including Mac users, but after installation those on macOS soon discovered that the update <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/30/counter-strike-2-no-mac-version-available/">makes the original game as well as the update unplayable</a> because of the lack of support and no rollback option. </p>
<p>Valve now says Mac players will be eligible for a Prime Status Upgrade refund if most of their <em>CS:GO</em> playtime was on macOS and they played <em>CS:GO</em> on a Mac between the announcement of the <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> Limited Test (March 22, 2023) and the launch of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> (September 27, 2023), regardless of when they purchased their Prime Status Upgrade. Valve will offer the refunds until December 1, 2023.</p>
<p>Valve added that those who wish to continue playing <em>CS:GO</em> on macOS will be able to access a legacy version or "frozen build" of the game, which has all the features of <em>CS:GO</em> except for official matchmaking. Support for this version of <em>CS:GO</em> will end on January 1, 2024. After this date, the game will still be available, but certain functionality that relies on compatibility with the Game Coordinator (e.g., access to inventory) may degrade and/or fail, according to Valve.</p>
<p>Despite Valve's refund offer to Mac users, the news that a macOS version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> is not in active development will come as a bitter blow to many players. Though <em>CS:GO</em> launched all the way back in 2012, it's still one of the most popular FPS games available today, with tens of millions of players logging in each month. So even if less than 1 percent of the user base is on Mac, that could still account for hundreds of thousands of players.</p>
<p>Regardless of numbers, one of the reasons Valve is reluctant to develop <em>CS2</em> for Mac is that Apple devices do not provide native support for the Vulkan API that the game is based on. Vulkan was designed to succeed OpenGL and address some of the latter's shortcomings, and while there is an open-source library called MoltenVK that provides a Vulkan implementation on top of Apple's Metal graphics API, it still lacks some of Vulkan's advanced features.</p>

Although these attacks are among the largest attacks Google has seen, our global load-balancing and DDoS mitigation infrastructure helped keep our services running. In order to protect Google, our customers, and the rest of the Internet, we helped lead a coordinated effort with industry partners to understand the attack mechanics and collaborate on mitigations that can be deployed in response to these attacks.</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Generally, DDoS attacks attempt to disrupt internet-facing websites and services, making them unreachable.

As we understood more details about the attack methodology, we developed a set of mitigations and updated our proxies and denial-of-service defense systems to efficiently mitigate this technique. Since Google Cloud’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing?hl=en">Application Load Balancer</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor/?hl=en">Cloud Armor</a> use the same hardware and software infrastructure that Google relies on to serve its own internet-facing services, the Cloud customers who use those services have their Internet-facing web apps and services similarly protected.</p><h3>Industry coordination and response for CVE-2023-44487</h3><p>Soon after detecting the earliest of these attacks in August, Google applied additional mitigation strategies and coordinated a cross-industry response with other cloud providers and software maintainers who implement the HTTP/2 protocol stack. We shared intelligence about the attack and mitigation methodologies in real time as the attacks were underway.</p><p>This cross-industry collaboration has resulted in patches and other mitigation techniques used by many large infrastructure providers. The collaboration helped to pave the way for today’s coordinated responsible disclosure of the new attack methodology and potential susceptibility across a multitude of common open source and commercial proxies, application servers, and load balancers.</p><p>The collective susceptibility to this attack is being tracked as <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487" target="_blank">CVE-2023-44487</a> and has been designated a High severity vulnerability with a <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss" target="_blank">CVSS</a> score of 7.5 (out of 10).</p><p>Google expresses sincere gratitude to all of the cross-industry stakeholders who have collaborated, shared information, accelerated patching of their infrastructure, and rapidly made patches available to their customers.</p><h3>Who is susceptible and what to do about it</h3><p>Any enterprise or individual that is serving an HTTP-based workload to the Internet may be at risk from this attack. Web applications, services, and APIs on a server or proxy able to communicate using the HTTP/2 protocol could be vulnerable. Organizations should verify that any servers they run that support HTTP/2 are not vulnerable, or apply vendor patches for CVE-2023-44487 to limit impact from this attack vector. If you are managing or operating your own HTTP/2-capable server (open source or commercial) you should immediately apply a patch from the relevant vendor when available.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>Defending against massive DDoS attacks such as those described here is difficult.

These attacks were detected and mitigated by our automated DDoS system. It was not long however, before they started to reach record breaking sizes — and eventually peaked just above 201 million requests per second. This was nearly 3x bigger than our <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/">previous biggest attack on record</a>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><center><em><small>Under attack or need additional protection? <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/h2/">Click here to get help</a>.</small></em></center><br><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Concerning is the fact that the attacker was able to generate such an attack with a botnet of merely 20,000 machines. There are botnets today that are made up of hundreds of thousands or millions of machines. Given that the entire web typically sees only between 1–3 billion requests per second, it's not inconceivable that using this method could focus an entire web’s worth of requests on a small number of targets.</p><h2 id="detecting-and-mitigating">Detecting and Mitigating</h2><p>This was a novel attack vector at an unprecedented scale, but Cloudflare's existing protections were largely able to absorb the brunt of the attacks. While initially we saw some impact to customer traffic — affecting roughly 1% of requests during the initial wave of attacks — today we’ve been able to refine our mitigation methods to stop the attack for any Cloudflare customer without it impacting our systems.</p><p>We noticed these attacks at the same time two other major industry players — Google and AWS — were seeing the same. We worked to harden Cloudflare’s systems to ensure that, today, all our customers are protected from this new DDoS attack method without any customer impact. We’ve also participated with Google and AWS in a coordinated disclosure of the attack to impacted vendors and critical infrastructure providers.</p><p>This attack was made possible by abusing some features of the HTTP/2 protocol and server implementation details (see &nbsp;<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487">CVE-2023-44487</a> for details). Because the attack abuses an underlying weakness in the HTTP/2 protocol, we believe any vendor that has implemented HTTP/2 will be subject to the attack. This included every modern web server. We, along with Google and AWS, have disclosed the attack method to web server vendors who we expect will implement patches. In the meantime, the best defense is using a DDoS mitigation service like Cloudflare’s in front of any web-facing web or API server. </p><p>This post dives into the details of the HTTP/2 protocol, the feature that attackers exploited to generate these massive attacks, and the mitigation strategies we took to ensure all our customers are protected. Our hope is that by publishing these details other impacted web servers and services will have the information they need to implement mitigation strategies. And, moreover, the HTTP/2 protocol standards team, as well as teams working on future web standards, can better design them to prevent such attacks.</p><h2 id="rst-attack-details">RST attack details</h2><p>HTTP is the application protocol that powers the Web. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html">HTTP Semantics</a> are common to all versions of HTTP — the overall architecture, terminology, and protocol aspects such as request and response messages, methods, status codes, header and trailer fields, message content, and much more. Each individual HTTP version defines how semantics are transformed into a "wire format" for exchange over the Internet. For example, a client has to serialize a request message into binary data and send it, then the server parses that back into a message it can process.</p><p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html">HTTP/1.1</a> uses a textual form of serialization. Request and response messages are exchanged as a stream of ASCII characters, sent over a reliable transport layer like TCP, using the following <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-2.1">format</a> (where CRLF means carriage-return and linefeed):</p><pre><code> HTTP-message   = start-line CRLF
                   *( field-line CRLF )
                   CRLF
                   [ message-body ]
</code></pre><p>For example, a very simple GET request for <code>https://blog.cloudflare.com/</code> would look like this on the wire:</p><p><code>GET / HTTP/1.1 CRLFHost: blog.cloudflare.comCRLF</code></p><p>And the response would look like:</p><p><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK CRLFServer: cloudflareCRLFContent-Length: 100CRLFtext/html; charset=UTF-8CRLF&lt;100 bytes of data&gt;</code></p><p>This format <strong>frames </strong>messages on the wire, meaning that it is possible to use a single TCP connection to exchange multiple requests and responses. However, the format requires that each message is sent whole. Furthermore, in order to correctly correlate requests with responses, strict ordering is required; meaning that messages are exchanged serially and can not be multiplexed. Two GET requests, for <code>https://blog.cloudflare.com/</code> and <code>https://blog.cloudflare.com/page/2/</code>, would be:</p><p><code>GET / HTTP/1.1 CRLFHost: blog.cloudflare.comCRLFGET /page/2 HTTP/1.1 CRLFHost: blog.cloudflare.comCRLF</code> &nbsp;</p><p>With the responses:</p><p><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK CRLFServer: cloudflareCRLFContent-Length: 100CRLFtext/html; charset=UTF-8CRLF&lt;100 bytes of data&gt;HTTP/1.1 200 OK CRLFServer: cloudflareCRLFContent-Length: 100CRLFtext/html; charset=UTF-8CRLF&lt;100 bytes of data&gt;</code></p><p>Web pages require more complicated HTTP interactions than these examples. When visiting the Cloudflare blog, your browser will load multiple scripts, styles and media assets. If you visit the front page using HTTP/1.1 and decide quickly to navigate to page 2, your browser can pick from two options. Either wait for all of the queued up responses for the page that you no longer want before page 2 can even start, or cancel in-flight requests by closing the TCP connection and opening a new connection. Neither of these is very practical. Browsers tend to work around these limitations by managing a pool of TCP connections (up to 6 per host) and implementing complex request dispatch logic over the pool.</p><p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113">HTTP/2</a> addresses many of the issues with HTTP/1.1. Each HTTP message is serialized into a set of <strong>HTTP/2 frames</strong> that have type, length, flags, stream identifier (ID) and payload. The stream ID makes it clear which bytes on the wire apply to which message, allowing safe multiplexing and concurrency. Streams are bidirectional. Clients send frames and servers reply with frames using the same ID.</p><p>In HTTP/2 our GET request for <code>https://blog.cloudflare.com</code> would be exchanged across stream ID 1, with the client sending one <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#name-headers">HEADERS</a> frame, and the server responding with one HEADERS frame, followed by one or more <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#name-data">DATA</a> frames. Client requests always use odd-numbered stream IDs, so subsequent requests would use stream ID 3, 5, and so on. Responses can be served in any order, and frames from different streams can be interleaved. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-09-at-2.13.29-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1172" height="362"></figure><p>Stream multiplexing and concurrency are powerful features of HTTP/2. They enable more efficient usage of a single TCP connection. HTTP/2 optimizes resources fetching especially when coupled with <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/better-http-2-prioritization-for-a-faster-web/">prioritization</a>. On the flip side, making it easy for clients to launch large amounts of parallel work can increase the peak demand for server resources when compared to HTTP/1.1. This is an obvious vector for denial-of-service.</p><div><p>In order to provide some guardrails, HTTP/2 provides a notion of maximum active <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-5.1.2">concurrent streams</a>. The <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a> parameter allows a server to advertise its limit of concurrency. For example, if the server states a limit of 100, then only 100 requests can be active at any time. If a client attempts to open a stream above this limit, it must be rejected by the server using a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-6.4">RST_STREAM</a> frame. Stream rejection does not affect the other in-flight streams on the connection.</p><p>The true story is a little more complicated. Streams have a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-5.1">lifecycle</a>. Below is a diagram of the HTTP/2 stream state machine. Client and server manage their own views of the state of a stream. HEADERS, DATA and RST_STREAM frames trigger transitions when they are sent or received. Although the views of the stream state are independent, they are synchronized.</p></div><p>HEADERS and DATA frames include an END_STREAM flag, that when set to the value 1 (true), can trigger a state transition.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Request-stream-states.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1152"></figure><p>Let's work through this with an example of a GET request that has no message content. The client sends the request as a HEADERS frame with the END_STREAM flag set to 1. The client first transitions the stream from <strong>idle</strong> to <strong>open </strong>state, then immediately transitions into <strong>half-closed</strong> state. The client half-closed state means that it can no longer send HEADERS or DATA, only <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#section-6.9">WINDOW_UPDATE</a>, <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html#section-6.3">PRIORITY</a> or RST_STREAM frames. It can receive any frame however.</p><div><p>Once the server receives and parses the HEADERS frame, it transitions the stream state from idle to open and then half-closed, so it matches the client. The server half-closed state means it can send any frame but receive only WINDOW_UPDATE, PRIORITY or RST_STREAM frames. </p><p>The response to the GET contains message content, so the server sends HEADERS with END_STREAM flag set to 0, then DATA with END_STREAM flag set to 1. The DATA frame triggers the transition of the stream from <strong>half-closed</strong> to <strong>closed</strong> on the server. When the client receives it, it also transitions to closed. Once a stream is closed, no frames can be sent or received.</p></div><p>Applying this lifecycle back into the context of concurrency, HTTP/2 <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-5.1.2-2">states</a>: </p><p><em>Streams that are in the "open" state or in either of the "half-closed" states count toward the maximum number of streams that an endpoint is permitted to open. Streams in any of these three states count toward the limit advertised in the </em><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS"><em>SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</em></a><em> setting.</em></p><p>In theory, the concurrency limit is useful. However, there are practical factors that hamper its effectiveness— which we will cover later in the blog. </p><h3 id="http2-request-cancellation">HTTP/2 request cancellation</h3><p>Earlier, we talked about client cancellation of in-flight requests. HTTP/2 supports this in a much more efficient way than HTTP/1.1. Rather than needing to tear down the whole connection, a client can send a RST_STREAM frame for a single stream. This instructs the server to stop processing the request and to abort the response, which frees up server resources and avoids wasting bandwidth. </p><p>Let's consider our previous example of 3 requests. This time the client cancels the request on stream 1 after all of the HEADERS have been sent. The server parses this RST_STREAM frame before it is ready to serve the response and instead only responds to stream 3 and 5:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-09-at-2.12.04-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1196" height="376"></figure><p>Request cancellation is a useful feature. For example, when scrolling a webpage with multiple images, a web browser can cancel images that fall outside the viewport, meaning that images entering it can load faster. HTTP/2 makes this behaviour a lot more efficient compared to HTTP/1.1.</p><p>A request stream that is canceled, rapidly transitions through the stream lifecycle. The client's HEADERS with END_STREAM flag set to 1 transitions the state from <strong>idle</strong> to <strong>open</strong> to <strong>half-closed</strong>, then RST_STREAM immediately causes a transition from <strong>half-closed </strong>to <strong>closed. </strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Request-stream-states-reset.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="1152"></figure><p>Recall that only streams that are in the open or half-closed state contribute to the stream concurrency limit. When a client cancels a stream, it instantly gets the ability to open another stream in its place and can send another request immediately. This is the crux of what makes <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487">CVE-2023-44487</a> work.</p><h3 id="rapid-resets-leading-to-denial-of-service">Rapid resets leading to denial of service</h3><p>HTTP/2 request cancellation can be abused to rapidly reset an unbounded number of streams. When an HTTP/2 server is able to process client-sent RST_STREAM frames and tear down state quickly enough, such rapid resets do not cause a problem. Where issues start to crop up is when there is any kind of delay or lag in tidying up. The client can churn through so many requests that a backlog of work accumulates, resulting in excess consumption of resources on the server. </p><p>A common HTTP deployment architecture is to run an HTTP/2 proxy or load-balancer in front of other components. When a client request arrives it is quickly dispatched and the actual work is done as an asynchronous activity somewhere else. This allows the proxy to handle client traffic very efficiently. However, this separation of concerns can make it hard for the proxy to tidy up the in-process jobs. Therefore, these deployments are more likely to encounter issues from rapid resets.</p><p>When Cloudflare's <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-3.7-6">reverse proxies</a> process incoming HTTP/2 client traffic, they copy the data from the connection’s socket into a buffer and process that buffered data in order. As each request is read (HEADERS and DATA frames) it is dispatched to an upstream service. When RST_STREAM frames are read, the local state for the request is torn down and the upstream is notified that the request has been canceled. Rinse and repeat until the entire buffer is consumed. However this logic can be abused: when a malicious client started sending an enormous chain of requests and resets at the start of a connection, our servers would eagerly read them all and create stress on the upstream servers to the point of being unable to process any new incoming request.</p><p>Something that is important to highlight is that stream concurrency on its own cannot mitigate rapid reset. The client can churn requests to create high request rates no matter the server's chosen value of <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS">SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS</a>.</p><h3 id="rapid-reset-dissected">Rapid Reset dissected</h3><p>Here's an example of rapid reset reproduced using a proof-of-concept client attempting to make a total of 1000 requests. I've used an off-the-shelf server without any mitigations; listening on port 443 in a test environment. The traffic is dissected using Wireshark and filtered to show only HTTP/2 traffic for clarity. <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/files/2023/10/Rapid-Reset-1.pcapng">Download the pcap</a> to follow along.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Untitled--2-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="79"></figure><p>It's a bit difficult to see, because there are a lot of frames. We can get a quick summary via Wireshark's Statistics &gt; HTTP2 tool:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Screenshot-2023-10-09-at-10.50.42-PM.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1058" height="324"></figure><p>The first frame in this trace, in packet 14, is the server's SETTINGS frame, which advertises a maximum stream concurrency of 100. In packet 15, the client sends a few control frames and then starts making requests that are rapidly reset. The first HEADERS frame is 26 bytes long, all subsequent HEADERS are only 9 bytes. This size difference is due to a compression technology called <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/hpack-the-silent-killer-feature-of-http-2/">HPACK</a>. In total, packet 15 contains 525 requests, going up to stream 1051.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Untitled--3-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="619" height="593"></figure><p>Interestingly, the RST_STREAM for stream 1051 doesn't fit in packet 15, so in packet 16 we see the server respond with a 404 response. &nbsp;Then in packet 17 the client does send the RST_STREAM, before moving on to sending the remaining 475 requests.</p><p>Note that although the server advertised 100 concurrent streams, both packets sent by the client sent a lot more HEADERS frames than that. The client did not have to wait for any return traffic from the server, it was only limited by the size of the packets it could send. No server RST_STREAM frames are seen in this trace, indicating that the server did not observe a concurrent stream violation. </p><h2 id="impact-on-customers">Impact on customers</h2><p>As mentioned above, as requests are canceled, upstream services are notified and can abort requests before wasting too many resources on it. This was the case with this attack, where most malicious requests were never forwarded to the origin servers. However, the sheer size of these attacks did cause some impact.</p><p>First, as the rate of incoming requests reached peaks never seen before, we had reports of increased levels of 502 errors seen by clients. This happened on our most impacted data centers as they were struggling to process all the requests. While our network is meant to deal with large attacks, this particular vulnerability exposed a weakness in our infrastructure. Let's dig a little deeper into the details, focusing on how incoming requests are handled when they hit one of our data centers:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Untitled-2023-10-04-1953.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="602"></figure><p>We can see that our infrastructure is composed of a chain of different proxy servers with different responsibilities. In particular, when a client connects to Cloudflare to send HTTPS traffic, it first hits our TLS decryption proxy: it decrypts TLS traffic, processes HTTP 1, 2 or 3 traffic, then forwards it to our "business logic" proxy. This one is responsible for loading all the settings for each customer, then routing the requests correctly to other upstream services — and more importantly in our case, <strong>it is also responsible for security features</strong>. This is where L7 attack mitigation is processed.</p><p>The problem with this attack vector is that it manages to send a lot of requests very quickly in every single connection. Each of them had to be forwarded to the business logic proxy before we had a chance to block it. As the request throughput became higher than our proxy capacity, the pipe connecting these two services reached its saturation level in some of our servers.</p><p>When this happens, the TLS proxy cannot connect anymore to its upstream proxy, this is why some clients saw a bare "502 Bad Gateway" error during the most serious attacks. It is important to note that, as of today, the logs used to create HTTP analytics are also emitted by our business logic proxy. The consequence of that is that these errors are not visible in the Cloudflare dashboard. Our internal dashboards show that about 1% of requests were impacted during the initial wave of attacks (before we implemented mitigations), with peaks at around 12% for a few seconds during the most serious one on August 29th. The following graph shows the ratio of these errors over a two hours while this was happening:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/imageLikeEmbed.png" alt="" loading="lazy" title="Chart" width="1600" height="990"></figure><p>We worked to reduce this number dramatically in the following days, as detailed later on in this post. Both thanks to changes in our stack and to our mitigation that reduce the size of these attacks considerably, this number is today is effectively zero.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/imageLikeEmbed--2-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" title="Chart" width="1600" height="989"></figure><h3 id="499-errors-and-the-challenges-for-http2-stream-concurrency">499 errors and the challenges for HTTP/2 stream concurrency</h3><p>Another symptom reported by some customers is an increase in 499 errors. The reason for this is a bit different and is related to the maximum stream concurrency in a HTTP/2 connection detailed earlier in this post.</p><p>HTTP/2 settings are exchanged at the start of a connection using SETTINGS frames. In the absence of receiving an explicit parameter, default values apply. Once a client establishes an HTTP/2 connection, it can wait for a server's SETTINGS (slow) or it can assume the default values and start making requests (fast). For SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS, the default is effectively unlimited (stream IDs use a 31-bit number space, and requests use odd numbers, so the actual limit is 1073741824). The specification recommends that a server offer no fewer than 100 streams. Clients are generally biased towards speed, so don't tend to wait for server settings, which creates a bit of a race condition. Clients are taking a gamble on what limit the server might pick; if they pick wrong the request will be rejected and will have to be retried. Gambling on 1073741824 streams is a bit silly. Instead, a lot of clients decide to limit themselves to issuing 100 concurrent streams, with the hope that servers followed the specification recommendation. Where servers pick something below 100, this client gamble fails and streams are reset. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Untitled-2023-10-04-1953--1-.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="551"></figure><p>There are many reasons a server might reset a stream beyond concurrency limit overstepping. HTTP/2 is strict and requires a stream to be closed when there are parsing or logic errors. In 2019, Cloudflare developed several mitigations in response to <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-recent-http-2-dos-attacks/">HTTP/2 DoS vulnerabilities</a>. Several of those vulnerabilities were caused by a client misbehaving, leading the server to reset a stream. A very effective strategy to clamp down on such clients is to count the number of server resets during a connection, and when that exceeds some threshold value, close the connection with a <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113#section-6.8">GOAWAY</a> frame. Legitimate clients might make one or two mistakes in a connection and that is acceptable. A client that makes too many mistakes is probably either broken or malicious and closing the connection addresses both cases.</p><p>While responding to DoS attacks enabled by <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487">CVE-2023-44487</a>, Cloudflare reduced maximum stream concurrency to 64. Before making this change, we were unaware that clients don't wait for SETTINGS and instead assume a concurrency of 100. Some web pages, such as an image gallery, do indeed cause a browser to send 100 requests immediately at the start of a connection. Unfortunately, the 36 streams above our limit all needed to be reset, which triggered our counting mitigations. This meant that we closed connections on legitimate clients, leading to a complete page load failure. As soon as we realized this interoperability issue, we changed the maximum stream concurrency to 100.</p><h2 id="actions-from-the-cloudflare-side">Actions from the Cloudflare side</h2><p>In 2019 several <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-recent-http-2-dos-attacks/">DoS vulnerabilities</a> were uncovered related to implementations of HTTP/2. Cloudflare developed and deployed a series of detections and mitigations in response. &nbsp;<a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487">CVE-2023-44487</a> is a different manifestation of HTTP/2 vulnerability. However, to mitigate it we were able to extend the existing protections to monitor client-sent RST_STREAM frames and close connections when they are being used for abuse. Legitimate client uses for RST_STREAM are unaffected.</p><p>In addition to a direct fix, we have implemented several improvements to the server's HTTP/2 frame processing and request dispatch code. Furthermore, the business logic server has received improvements to queuing and scheduling that reduce unnecessary work and improve cancellation responsiveness. Together these lessen the impact of various potential abuse patterns as well as giving more room to the server to process requests before saturating.</p><h3 id="mitigate-attacks-earlier">Mitigate attacks earlier</h3><p>Cloudflare already had systems in place to efficiently mitigate very large attacks with less expensive methods. One of them is named "IP Jail". For hyper volumetric attacks, this system collects the client IPs participating in the attack and stops them from connecting to the attacked property, either at the IP level, or in our TLS proxy. This system however needs a few seconds to be fully effective; during these precious seconds, the origins are already protected but our infrastructure still needs to absorb all HTTP requests. As this new botnet has effectively no ramp-up period, we need to be able to neutralize attacks before they can become a problem.</p><p>To achieve this we expanded the IP Jail system to protect our entire infrastructure: once an IP is "jailed", not only it is blocked from connecting to the attacked property, we also forbid the corresponding IPs from using HTTP/2 to any other domain on Cloudflare for some time. As such protocol abuses are not possible using HTTP/1.x, this limits the attacker's ability to run large attacks, while any legitimate client sharing the same IP would only see a very small performance decrease during that time. IP based mitigations are a very blunt tool — this is why we have to be extremely careful when using them at that scale and seek to avoid false positives as much as possible. Moreover, the lifespan of a given IP in a botnet is usually short so any long term mitigation is likely to do more harm than good. The following graph shows the churn of IPs in the attacks we witnessed:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/ip-churn.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1014" height="493"></figure><p>As we can see, many new IPs spotted on a given day disappear very quickly afterwards.</p><p>As all these actions happen in our TLS proxy at the beginning of our HTTPS pipeline, this saves considerable resources compared to our regular L7 mitigation system. This allowed us to weather these attacks much more smoothly and now the number of random 502 errors caused by these botnets is down to zero.</p><h3 id="observability-improvements">Observability improvements</h3><p>Another front on which we are making change is observability. Returning errors to clients without being visible in customer analytics is unsatisfactory. Fortunately, a project has been underway to overhaul these systems since long before the recent attacks. It will eventually allow each service within our infrastructure to log its own data, instead of relying on our business logic proxy to consolidate and emit log data. This incident underscored the importance of this work, and we are redoubling our efforts.</p><p>We are also working on better connection-level logging, allowing us to spot such protocol abuses much more quickly to improve our DDoS mitigation capabilities.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>While this was the latest record-breaking attack, we know it won’t be the last. As attacks continue to become more sophisticated, Cloudflare works relentlessly to proactively identify new threats — deploying countermeasures to our global network so that our millions of customers are immediately and automatically protected. </p><p>Cloudflare has provided free, unmetered and unlimited DDoS protection to all of our customers since 2017. In addition, we offer a range of additional security features to suit the needs of organizations of all sizes. <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/h2">Contact us</a> if you’re unsure whether you’re protected or want to understand how you can be.</p>

This attack exploits a weakness in the HTTP/2 protocol to generate enormous, hyper-volumetric Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Cloudflare has mitigated a barrage of these attacks in recent months, including an attack three times larger than <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-mitigates-record-breaking-71-million-request-per-second-ddos-attack/">any previous attack we’ve observed</a>, which exceeded 201 million requests per second (rps). Since the end of August 2023, Cloudflare has mitigated more than 1,100 other attacks with over 10 million rps — and 184 attacks that were greater than our previous DDoS record of 71 million rps. </p><p>This zero-day provided threat actors with a critical new tool in their Swiss Army knife of vulnerabilities to exploit and attack their victims at a magnitude that has never been seen before. While at times complex and challenging to combat, these attacks allowed Cloudflare the opportunity to develop purpose-built technology to mitigate the effects of the zero-day vulnerability.</p><p>If you are using Cloudflare for HTTP DDoS mitigation, you are protected. And below, we’ve included more information on this vulnerability, and resources and recommendations on what you can do to secure yourselves.</p><h3 id="deconstructing-the-attack-what-every-cso-needs-to-know">Deconstructing the attack: What every CSO needs to know</h3><p>In late August 2023, our team at Cloudflare noticed a new zero-day vulnerability, developed by an unknown threat actor, that exploits the standard HTTP/2 protocol — a fundamental protocol that is critical to how the Internet and all websites work. This novel zero-day vulnerability attack, dubbed Rapid Reset, leverages HTTP/2’s stream cancellation feature by sending a request and immediately canceling it over and over. &nbsp;</p><p>By automating this trivial “request, cancel, request, cancel” pattern at scale, threat actors are able to create a denial of service and take down any server or application running the standard implementation of HTTP/2. Furthermore, one crucial thing to note about the record-breaking attack is that it involved a modestly-sized botnet, consisting of roughly 20,000 machines. Cloudflare regularly detects botnets that are orders of magnitude larger than this — comprising hundreds of thousands and even millions of machines. For a relatively small botnet to output such a large volume of requests, with the potential to incapacitate nearly any server or application supporting HTTP/2, underscores how menacing this vulnerability is for unprotected networks.</p><p>Threat actors used botnets in tandem with the HTTP/2 vulnerability to amplify requests at rates we have never seen before. As a result, our team at Cloudflare experienced some intermittent edge instability. While our systems were able to mitigate the overwhelming majority of incoming attacks, the volume overloaded some components in our network, impacting a small number of customers’ performance with intermittent 4xx and 5xx errors — all of which were quickly resolved. </p><p>Once we successfully mitigated these issues and halted potential attacks for all customers, our team immediately kicked off a responsible disclosure process. We entered into conversations with industry peers to see how we could work together to help move our mission forward and safeguard the large percentage of the Internet that relies on our network prior to releasing this vulnerability to the general public. </p><p>We cover the technical details of the attack in more detail in a separate blog post: <a href="https://cfl.re/rapid-reset-breakdown">HTTP/2 Rapid Reset: deconstructing the record-breaking attack</a>.</p><h3 id="how-is-cloudflare-and-the-industry-thwarting-this-attack">How is Cloudflare and the industry thwarting this attack?</h3><p>There is no such thing as a “perfect disclosure.” Thwarting attacks and responding to emerging incidents requires organizations and security teams to live by an assume-breach mindset — because there will always be another zero-day, new evolving threat actor groups, and never-before-seen novel attacks and techniques. </p><p>This “assume-breach” mindset is a key foundation towards information sharing and ensuring in instances such as this that the Internet remains safe. While Cloudflare was experiencing and mitigating these attacks, we were also working with industry partners to guarantee that the industry at-large could withstand this attack. &nbsp;</p><p>During the process of mitigating this attack, our Cloudflare team developed and purpose-built new technology to stop these DDoS attacks and further improve our own mitigations for this and other future attacks of massive scale. These efforts have significantly increased our overall mitigation capabilities and resiliency. If you are using Cloudflare, we are confident that you are protected. </p><p>Our team also alerted web server software partners who are developing patches to ensure this vulnerability cannot be exploited — check their websites for more information.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.cloudflare.com/content/images/2023/10/Zero-Day-protection-4.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="416"></figure><p>Disclosures are never one and done. The lifeblood of Cloudflare is to ensure a better Internet, which stems from instances such as these. When we have the opportunity to work with our industry partners and governments to ensure there are no widespread impacts on the Internet, we are doing our part in increasing the cyber resiliency of every organization no matter the size or vertical.</p><p>To gain more of an understanding around mitigation tactics and next steps on patching, <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4378646/EC4EB4A6CE2B363BC6378891E495BEBF">register for our webinar</a>.</p><h3 id="what-are-the-origins-of-the-http2-rapid-reset-and-these-record-breaking-attacks-on-cloudflare">What are the origins of the HTTP/2 Rapid Reset and these record-breaking attacks on Cloudflare?</h3><p>It may seem odd that Cloudflare was one of the first companies to witness these attacks. Why would threat actors attack a company that has some of the most robust defenses against DDoS attacks in the world? &nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that Cloudflare often sees attacks before they are turned on more vulnerable targets. Threat actors need to develop and test their tools before they deploy them in the wild. Threat actors who possess record-shattering attack methods can have an extremely difficult time testing and understanding how large and effective they are, because they don't have the infrastructure to absorb the attacks they are launching. Because of the transparency that we share on our network performance, and the measurements of attacks they could glean from our public performance charts, this threat actor was likely targeting us to understand the capabilities of the exploit.</p><p>But that testing, and the ability to see the attack early, helps us develop mitigations for the attack that benefit both our customers and industry as a whole.</p><h3 id="from-cso-to-cso-what-should-you-do">From CSO to CSO: What should you do?</h3><p>I have been a CSO for over 20 years, on the receiving end of countless disclosures and &nbsp;announcements like this. But whether it was <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/exploitation-of-cve-2021-44228-before-public-disclosure-and-evolution-of-waf-evasion-patterns/">Log4J</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/solarwinds-orion-compromise-trend-data/">Solarwinds</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/how-to-prevent-ransomware/">EternalBlue</a> <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/ransomware/petya-notpetya-ransomware/">WannaCry/NotPetya</a>, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/heartbleed-revisited/">Heartbleed</a>, or <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/inside-shellshock/">Shellshock</a>, all of these security incidents have a commonality. A tremendous explosion that ripples across the world and creates an opportunity to completely disrupt any of the organizations that I have led — regardless of the industry or the size. </p><p>Many of these were attacks or vulnerabilities that we may have not been able to control. But regardless of whether the issue arose from something that was in my control or not, what has set any successful initiative I have led apart from those that did not lean in our favor was the ability to respond when zero-day vulnerabilities and exploits like this are identified. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>While I wish I could say that Rapid Reset may be different this time around, it is not. I am calling all CSOs — no matter if you’ve lived through the decades of security incidents that I have, or this is your first day on the job — this is the time to ensure you are protected and stand up your cyber incident response team. </p><p>We’ve kept the information restricted until today to give as many security vendors as possible the opportunity to react. However, at some point, the responsible thing becomes to publicly disclose zero-day threats like this. Today is that day. That means that after today, threat actors will be largely aware of the HTTP/2 vulnerability; and it will inevitably become trivial to exploit and kickoff the race between defenders and attacks — first to patch vs. first to exploit. Organizations should assume that systems will be tested, and take proactive measures to ensure protection.</p><p>To me, this is reminiscent of a vulnerability like Log4J, due to the many variants that are emerging daily, and will continue to come to fruition in the weeks, months, and years to come. As more researchers and threat actors experiment with the vulnerability, we may find different variants with even shorter exploit cycles that contain even more advanced bypasses. &nbsp;</p><p>And just like Log4J, managing incidents like this isn’t as simple as “run the patch, now you’re done”. You need to turn incident management, patching, and evolving your security protections into ongoing processes — because the patches for each variant of a vulnerability reduce your risk, but they don’t eliminate it.</p><p>I don’t mean to be alarmist, but I will be direct: you must take this seriously. Treat this as a full active incident to ensure nothing happens to your organization.</p><h3 id="recommendations-for-a-new-standard-of-change">Recommendations for a New Standard of Change</h3><p>While no one security event is ever identical to the next, there are lessons that can be learned. CSOs, here are my recommendations that must be implemented immediately. Not only in this instance, but for years to come:</p><ul><li>Understand your external and partner network’s external connectivity to remediate any Internet facing systems with the mitigations below.</li><li>Understand your existing security protection and capabilities you have to protect, detect and respond to an attack and immediately remediate any issues you have in your network.</li><li>Ensure your DDoS Protection resides outside of your data center because if the traffic gets to your datacenter, it will be difficult to mitigate the DDoS attack.</li><li>Ensure you have DDoS protection for Applications (Layer 7) and ensure you have Web Application Firewalls. Additionally as a best practice, ensure you have complete DDoS protection for DNS, Network Traffic (Layer 3) and API Firewalls</li><li>Ensure web server and operating system patches are deployed across all Internet Facing Web Servers. Also, ensure all automation like Terraform builds and images are fully patched so older versions of web servers are not deployed into production over the secure images by accident.</li><li>As a last resort, consider turning off HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (likely also vulnerable) to mitigate the threat. &nbsp;This is a last resort only, because there will be a significant performance issues if you downgrade to HTTP/1.1</li><li>Consider a secondary, cloud-based DDoS L7 provider at perimeter for resilience.</li></ul><p>Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet. If you are concerned with your current state of DDoS protection, we are more than happy to provide you with our DDoS capabilities and resilience for free to mitigate any attempts of a successful DDoS attack. &nbsp;We know the stress that you are facing as we have fought off these attacks for the last 30 days and made our already best in class systems, even better. </p><p>If you’re interested in finding out more, we have a webinar coming up with more details on the zero-day and how to respond; you can <a href="https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/4378646/EC4EB4A6CE2B363BC6378891E495BEBF">register here</a>.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div jsname="tx2NYc"><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>A number of Google services and Cloud customers have been targeted with a novel HTTP/2-based DDoS attack which peaked in August. These attacks were significantly larger than any <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/how-google-cloud-blocked-largest-layer-7-ddos-attack-at-46-million-rps">previously-reported Layer 7 attacks</a>, with the largest attack <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-mitigated-largest-ddos-attack-peaking-above-398-million-rps">surpassing 398 million requests per second</a>.</p><p>The attacks were largely stopped at the edge of our network by Google's global load balancing infrastructure and did not lead to any outages. While the impact was minimal, Google's DDoS Response Team reviewed the attacks and added additional protections to further mitigate similar attacks. In addition to Google's internal response, we helped lead a coordinated disclosure process with industry partners to address the new HTTP/2 vector across the ecosystem.</p></span></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>Below, we explain the predominant methodology for Layer 7 attacks over the last few years, what changed in these new attacks to make them so much larger, and the mitigation strategies we believe are effective against this attack type. This article is written from the perspective of a reverse proxy architecture, where the HTTP request is terminated by a reverse proxy that forwards requests to other services. The same concepts apply to HTTP servers that are integrated into the application server, but with slightly different considerations which potentially lead to different mitigation strategies.</p><h3>A primer on HTTP/2 for DDoS</h3><p>Since late 2021, the majority of Layer 7 DDoS attacks we've observed across Google first-party services and Google Cloud projects protected by <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor">Cloud Armor</a> have been based on HTTP/2, both by number of attacks and by peak request rates.</p><p>A primary design goal of HTTP/2 was efficiency, and unfortunately the features that make HTTP/2 more efficient for legitimate clients can also be used to make DDoS attacks more efficient.</p><h3>Stream multiplexing</h3><p>HTTP/2 uses "streams", bidirectional abstractions used to transmit various messages, or "frames", between the endpoints. “Stream multiplexing” is the core HTTP/2 feature which allows higher utilization of each TCP connection. Streams are multiplexed in a way that can be tracked by both sides of the connection while only using one Layer 4 connection. Stream multiplexing enables clients to have multiple in-flight requests without managing multiple individual connections.</p><p>One of the main constraints when mounting a Layer 7 DoS attack is the number of concurrent transport connections. Each connection carries a cost, including operating system memory for socket records and buffers, CPU time for the TLS handshake, as well as each connection needing a unique four-tuple, the IP address and port pair for each side of the connection, constraining the number of concurrent connections between two IP addresses.</p><p>In HTTP/1.1, each request is processed serially. The server will read a request, process it, write a response, and only then read and process the next request. In practice, this means that the rate of requests that can be sent over a single connection is one request per round trip, where a round trip includes the network latency, proxy processing time and backend request processing time. While HTTP/1.1 pipelining is available in some clients and servers to increase a connection's throughput, it is not prevalent amongst legitimate clients.</p><p>With HTTP/2, the client can open multiple concurrent streams on a single TCP connection, each stream corresponding to one HTTP request. The maximum number of concurrent open streams is, in theory, controllable by the server, but in practice clients may open 100 streams per request and the servers process these requests in parallel. It’s important to note that server limits can not be unilaterally adjusted.</p><p>For example, the client can open 100 streams and send a request on each of them in a single round trip; the proxy will read and process each stream serially, but the requests to the backend servers can again be parallelized. The client can then open new streams as it receives responses to the previous ones. This gives an effective throughput for a single connection of 100 requests per round trip, with similar round trip timing constants to HTTP/1.1 requests. This will typically lead to almost 100 times higher utilization of each connection.</p><h3>The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack</h3><p>The HTTP/2 protocol allows clients to indicate to the server that a previous stream should be canceled by sending a RST_STREAM frame. The protocol does not require the client and server to coordinate the cancellation in any way, the client may do it unilaterally. The client may also assume that the cancellation will take effect immediately when the server receives the RST_STREAM frame, before any other data from that TCP connection is processed.</p><p>This attack is called Rapid Reset because it relies on the ability for an endpoint to send a RST_STREAM frame immediately after sending a request frame, which makes the other endpoint start working and then rapidly resets the request. The request is canceled, but leaves the HTTP/2 connection open.</p></span></section><section><figure><section jscontroller="SCGBie" jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2023_worlds_largest_rapid_reset_diagram.max-1616x909.png" alt="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2023_worlds_largest_rapid_reset_diagram.max-1616x909.png" jsname="P3Vluc" jsaction="click:HTIlC" loading="lazy"></section></figure><p><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 request and response pattern</p></span></p></section><section><span jsaction="rcuQ6b:npT2md" jscontroller="YSybTb" data-track-type="" soy-skip="" ssk="5:kbe95"><p>The HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack built on this capability is simple: The client opens a large number of streams at once as in the standard HTTP/2 attack, but rather than waiting for a response to each request stream from the server or proxy, the client cancels each request immediately.</p><p>The ability to reset streams immediately allows each connection to have an indefinite number of requests in flight. By explicitly canceling the requests, the attacker never exceeds the limit on the number of concurrent open streams. The number of in-flight requests is no longer dependent on the round-trip time (RTT), but only on the available network bandwidth.</p><p>In a typical HTTP/2 server implementation, the server will still have to do significant amounts of work for canceled requests, such as allocating new stream data structures, parsing the query and doing header decompression, and mapping the URL to a resource. For reverse proxy implementations, the request may be proxied to the backend server before the RST_STREAM frame is processed. The client on the other hand paid almost no costs for sending the requests. This creates an exploitable cost asymmetry between the server and the client.</p><p>Another advantage the attacker gains is that the explicit cancellation of requests immediately after creation means that a reverse proxy server won't send a response to any of the requests. Canceling the requests before a response is written reduces downlink (server/proxy to attacker) bandwidth.</p><h3>HTTP/2 Rapid Reset attack variants</h3><p>In the weeks after the initial DDoS attacks, we have seen some Rapid Reset attack variants. These variants are generally not as efficient as the initial version was, but might still be more efficient than standard HTTP/2 DDoS attacks.</p><p>The first variant does not immediately cancel the streams, but instead opens a batch of streams at once, waits for some time, and then cancels those streams and then immediately opens another large batch of new streams. This attack may bypass mitigations that are based on just the rate of inbound RST_STREAM frames (such as allow at most 100 RST_STREAMs per second on a connection before closing it).</p><p>These attacks lose the main advantage of the canceling attacks by not maximizing connection utilization, but still have some implementation efficiencies over standard HTTP/2 DDoS attacks. But this variant does mean that any mitigation based on rate-limiting stream cancellations should set fairly strict limits to be effective.</p><p>The second variant does away with canceling streams entirely, and instead optimistically tries to open more concurrent streams than the server advertised. The benefit of this approach over the standard HTTP/2 DDoS attack is that the client can keep the request pipeline full at all times, and eliminate client-proxy RTT as a bottleneck. It can also eliminate the proxy-server RTT as a bottleneck if the request is to a resource that the HTTP/2 server responds to immediately.</p><p><a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9113.html" target="_blank">RFC 9113</a>, the current HTTP/2 RFC, suggests that an attempt to open too many streams should invalidate only the streams that exceeded the limit, not the entire connection. We believe that most HTTP/2 servers will not process those streams, and is what enables the non-cancelling attack variant by almost immediately accepting and processing a new stream after responding to a previous stream.</p><h3>A multifaceted approach to mitigations</h3><p>We don't expect that simply blocking individual requests is a viable mitigation against this class of attacks — instead the entire TCP connection needs to be closed when abuse is detected. HTTP/2 provides built-in support for closing connections, using the GOAWAY frame type. The RFC defines a process for gracefully closing a connection that involves first sending an informational GOAWAY that does not set a limit on opening new streams, and one round trip later sending another that forbids opening additional streams.</p><p>However, this graceful GOAWAY process is usually not implemented in a way which is robust against malicious clients. This form of mitigation leaves the connection vulnerable to Rapid Reset attacks for too long, and should not be used for building mitigations as it does not stop the inbound requests. Instead, the GOAWAY should be set up to limit stream creation immediately.</p><p>This leaves the question of deciding which connections are abusive. The client canceling requests is not inherently abusive, the feature exists in the HTTP/2 protocol to help better manage request processing. Typical situations are when a browser no longer needs a resource it had requested due to the user navigating away from the page, or applications using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology#Long_polling" target="_blank">long polling</a> approach with a client-side timeout.</p><p>Mitigations for this attack vector can take multiple forms, but mostly center around tracking connection statistics and using various signals and business logic to determine how useful each connection is. For example, if a connection has more than 100 requests with more than 50% of the given requests canceled, it could be a candidate for a mitigation response. The magnitude and type of response depends on the risk to each platform, but responses can range from forceful GOAWAY frames as discussed before to closing the TCP connection immediately.</p><p>To mitigate against the non-cancelling variant of this attack, we recommend that HTTP/2 servers should close connections that exceed the concurrent stream limit. This can be either immediately or after some small number of repeat offenses.</p><h3>Applicability to other protocols</h3><p>We do not believe these attack methods translate directly to HTTP/3 (QUIC) due to protocol differences, and Google does not currently see HTTP/3 used as a DDoS attack vector at scale. Despite that, our recommendation is for HTTP/3 server implementations to proactively implement mechanisms to limit the amount of work done by a single transport connection, similar to the HTTP/2 mitigations discussed above.</p><h3>Industry coordination</h3><p>Early in our DDoS Response Team's investigation and in coordination with industry partners, it was apparent that this new attack type could have a broad impact on any entity offering the HTTP/2 protocol for their services. Google helped lead a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process taking advantage of a pre-existing coordinated vulnerability disclosure group, which has been used for a number of other efforts in the past.</p><p>During the disclosure process, the team focused on notifying large-scale implementers of HTTP/2 including infrastructure companies and server software providers. The goal of these prior notifications was to develop and prepare mitigations for a coordinated release. In the past, this approach has enabled widespread protections to be enabled for service providers or available via software updates for many packages and solutions.</p><p>During the coordinated disclosure process, we reserved <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-44487" target="_blank">CVE-2023-44487</a> to track fixes to the various HTTP/2 implementations.</p><h3>Next steps</h3><p>The novel attacks discussed in this post can have significant impact on services of any scale. All providers who have HTTP/2 services should assess their exposure to this issue. Software patches and updates for common web servers and programming languages may be available to apply now or in the near future. We recommend applying those fixes as soon as possible.</p><p>For our customers, we recommend patching software and enabling the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing?hl=en">Application Load Balancer</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/armor">Google Cloud Armor</a>, which has been protecting Google and existing Google Cloud Application Load Balancing users.</p></span></section><section><span>Posted in</span><ul><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Security &amp; Identity</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Networking</a></li><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp" track-metadata-position="body" track-metadata-eventdetail="cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp" track-metadata-module="tag list" track-metadata-module_headline="posted in">Google Cloud</a></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

  <p><strong>Monday, October  9, 2023</strong></p>

  <p>Last week, I did a Q&amp;A session for a friend's security class.
One of the students asked a question that I loved.
They asked something like, "As a principal engineer, how do you make sure your company stays at the forefront of innovation?"</p>
<p>There are two reasons I love this question.
The first is that it's a good and natural one, which I had early on too.
The second is that it's <em>unintentionally leading</em>.
It assumes you <em>should</em> be working at the leading edge of innovative technology.</p>
<p>And that's why my answer started with "I don't. I make sure we <em>don't</em>."
A leading question gets a snappy answer!
But that's not the whole story, of course.</p>
<p>The key is to understand <em>why</em> you don't want to be on the leading edge of innovation all the time, and also to understand <em>when</em> it's appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-use-proven-technology">Why we use proven technology</h2>
<p>Most of the time, the problems you run into while doing your work are mundane.
The vast majority of your hot new startup is things that have been done before.
For any new web app you're going to have users, logins, a frontend, a database.</p>
<p>For each of these, you could use something hot and new.
You could tie your users to some public blockchain (sorry).
You could come up with a novel new way of logging in (please, please, no).
The frontend can be built with that new framework you saw on HackerNews last week (or is that already out of date?).
And of course, the database should be a NoSQL, graph, or vector database depending on which hype wave you caught.</p>
<p>Each of these bring advantages, no doubt.
There's a reason I spent years working on graph databases: they're dope technology that can solve some real problems.
There's also a reason I've talked many people out of using them.</p>
<p>When you adopt a new innovative technology, you're giving up a lot.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Proven technologies are searchable and have robust documentation.</strong>
Have a problem with PostgreSQL? Pop it into a search engine and you'll get an answer right away.
But have a problem with a vector DB? Comb the GitHub Issues or Discord and hope that you find an answer 🙏.
This can save you so much time when you inevitably run into problems.</li>
<li><strong>They often have great ecosystems around them.</strong>
With proven tech, like PostgreSQL, you will usually have great packages and integrations.
Your well-known DB and well-known observability provider probably get cozy and integrate well.
Your favorite language has drivers for this time-tested DB.
But with the new stuff? You're writing a lot of that yourself, or patching it.</li>
<li><strong>They use well-known concepts.</strong>
Proven technologies have kind of by definition been around a while.
This means you can (more) reasonably expect people to know the core concepts.
Most software developers are probably familiar with relational DBs, but far fewer are familiar with graph DBs.
Well-known concepts are accelerants: they let you converse more quickly, design more quickly, understand more quickly.
New concepts are a tax which slow you down as you have to understand it and fit everything into that new model.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a lot to love with the proven stuff.
This isn't a new or novel opinion: there are a <em>lot</em> of advocates of <a href="https://boringtechnology.club/">choosing boring technology</a>.
It's a strategy that I expect technical leaders to employ, and it's a red flag if teams are eschewing tons of the boring stuff.
It means they probably don't have a good technical strategy and strong leadership.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes it <em>is</em> justified.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-how-to-use-innovative-new-tech">When (and how) to use innovative new tech</h2>
<p>The reason we build software is to get something done, to solve some problem.
That destination is what guides our adoption of technologies.</p>
<p>With any given choice, the question is: does this technology <em>fundamentally alter</em> my chances of solving this problem?
If the answer is "no", then just go with the boring choice.
It doesn't make a difference, so why would you give up the benefits?
If the answer is "yes, it makes us much more likely to succeed," then you get to move on.</p>
<p>Now you have to figure out why.
Committing to this should be done eyes wide open, so figure out the specific reasons that this technology is necessary.
Contrast using it with using the boring choice, and try to figure out the properties that it gives you that you need.
Once you've found that irreducible property that greatly aids in solving the problem, and it cannot be done with boring one?
<em>That</em> is when you reach for the shiny new thing, and you go in eyes wide open.
With the bleeding edge, <em>you are going to get cut</em>, but sometimes that's necessary.</p>
<p>Use the boring things until you absolutely cannot succeed with it, and you'll get a lot further a lot faster.</p>
<h2 id="my-framework-for-choosing-technologies">My framework for choosing technologies</h2>
<p>Part of technical leadership is being involved in technical design and choosing what to use.
Here's my general approach for doing that (at work<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>).</p>
<p><strong>First, understand the problem.</strong>
This is similar to how we <a href="https://ntietz.com/blog/how-i-debug-2023/">approach debugging</a>, because both are a form of problem solving.
If you don't have a clear understanding of the problem at hand, then you cannot solve it, and you cannot pick the right tech to use.
I like to test my understanding by explaining the problem to a lay person.
If I can explain it in a relatively clear way, then I understand the problem well enough to proceed.</p>
<p><strong>Then, prove that a solution exists</strong>.
This "existence proof" of a solution is <em>always</em> my first step, because if you cannot get <em>anything</em> working it doesn't matter, the problem isn't getting solved.
It also allows you a lot of creative freedom.
The outcome is a design document showing some valid solution to the problem.
In this step I'll allow myself to use whatever technology comes to mind.
Can I solve this with that shiny DB and my favorite programming language?
The only point is to prove that <em>a</em> solution can exist.</p>
<p><strong>Now reduce down the solution.</strong>
Now that you have a proof of a solution, you can reduce it down to its essential complexity.
For each component in your design, what role does it serve, why did you include it?
Go deep and determine the absolute properties that each piece provides, and question if you need those properties or can achieve them another way.
Then iterate on your design, cutting out unnecessary things.
Refactor pieces of the design.
Add new pieces, remove old pieces, play with it, make it sleek.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluate your design again.</strong>
Now that it's reduced down, look at it again and ask a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it still solve the problem at hand?</li>
<li>Can this possibly be done in any simpler way? Why or why not?</li>
<li>Can we use more well-known technologies instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have those answers, you'll either repeat the process or proceed on.</p>
<p><strong>Socialize the design.</strong>
Hopefully you've been working as a team so far up to here, but you usually can't include <em>everyone</em> in the early design.
Now that you've reduced it as much as possible, go find some critics and socialize the design.
Find people who you think will be contrarian, and have them poke holes in the design.
<em>Especially</em> in any new technologies or innovative things.</p>
<p>When you have convinced your critics and yourself, you can actually move on and... wait, did we finally get to use a new piece of tech?
Yes!
And you <em>know</em> that it's for the right reasons.
It serves a critical role in the solution and it cannot be replaced.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, yes.
As a principal engineer, I view it as my role to keep us <em>off</em> the bleeding edge as much as possible.
That way, when we really do need to innovate, we have the capacity to do so.
And when we don't need to, we can go really freaking fast.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Close to 100 hospitals across the world have already benefitted from the use of the LEGO MRI Scanner thanks to Erik and his heartfelt dedication. The project has been extremely well received and in order to create even bigger impact and better grasp of its potential, the LEGO Foundation is now scaling the project and encouraging hospitals from all over the world to apply for one of the 600 models currently available. Built by LEGO volunteers, the models will be shipped completely free of charge to hospitals. Once distributed, the LEGO Foundation will generate insights from participating hospitals to continue building evidence-based research and in turn guide potential future projects.</p>
<p>To best support the use of LEGO MRI Scanners, the LEGO Foundation has developed <a href="https://learningthroughplay.com/lego-mri-scanner-models">four training videos</a> to accompany the model. These videos are designed to help medical staff guide children through the process of an MRI scan – and in turn, facilitate their social and emotional learning through play. The videos are available free of charge to any hospital wanting to learn more about the approach.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htUtn5em_Pw">video</a> gives an introduction to the LEGO MRI model and accompanying training material.<br>
Dorthe Feveile Kjerkegaard, Play &amp; Health Specialist at the LEGO Foundation added: “MRI scans can be scary, anxiety-inducing experiences for all of us, but especially so for children. Through a playful learning approach, such as the LEGO MRI Scanner, we’ve been able to take children through the process step by step to prepare them for what’s to come, and in turn, help them to feel safe by making the unknown, known. The feedback so far has been overwhelming. We’re honoured to be able to help both children and their parents have a more positive and less stressful experience, and look forward to supporting even more families around the world with the expansion of this concept.”</p>
<p>The LEGO Foundation will donate 600 models to the first 600 eligible applicants. Applicants must be based in a radiology department at a hospital, with an existing MRI scanning facility for use with children and adolescents. To access the request form visit: <a href="https://learningthroughplay.com/lego-mri-scanner-models">https://learningthroughplay.com/lego-mri-scanner-models</a>.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>Hello everyone! It has been nearly three years since I last wrote to this blog. Fortunately, that does not mean Wayfire’s development has stopped! Quite the opposite, in fact I am happy to announce the release of Wayfire 0.8.0. There have been many changes and plugin API breakages since the Wayfire 0.7.x series, so I will try to summarize the important changes in the following paragraphs.</p>

<h3 id="user-facing-changes">User-facing changes</h3>

<p>First, let us take a look at the user-facing changes and new features that were added in this release:</p>

<h4 id="workspace-sets-wayfire-pr-1797">Workspace sets (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1797">PR #1797</a>)</h4>

<p>Workspace sets are a new feature provided by the <code>wsets</code> plugin. A workspace set is the grid of workspaces on one output. Up until now, Wayfire always had one workspace set (albeit it wasn’t called like this) per output. With the recent changes, it is possible to have multiple workspace sets on each output and switch between them. The end result is very similar to how Sway’s workspaces work: the plugin numbers them from 1 to N, and at any given moment you can display any of the workspace sets on any of your outputs (however, each workspace set can be visible on at most one output at a time). Check the YouTube video to get a better sense of what they provide (the recording contains two Wayfire outputs side-by-side):</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhGqlLK8Elo?si=Kf7Z8Uv5SR7N4ujr" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The purpose of workspace sets is to have a dedicated set of normal workspaces for different activities the user does on their computer. For example, I have one workspace set (containing a 2x2 workspace grid) dedicated to Wayfire, where I have Wayfire’s source code, GitHub issues, wlroots, etc. There is another workspace set dedicated to a project I am working on for university, and so on. Of course, a similar effect could be achieved with a single bigger workspace grid, but having a 5x5 workspace grid quickly becomes difficult to navigate.</p>

<p>It should also be noted that workspace sets can be moved between outputs, which is something generally impossible with normal workspaces. I use this for example when switching between working on my laptop and an external monitor - it is just a matter of showing the workspace set on the new monitor.</p>

<h4 id="ipc-socket-wayfire-pr-1472-pr-1821">IPC socket (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1472">PR #1472</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1821">PR #1821</a>)</h4>

<p>A frequent request for Wayfire was the ability to control it via IPC commands. With this release, Wayfire now provides a socket that clients can use for this purpose. To use it, make sure to enable the <code>ipc</code> plugin (it should be first in the list of plugins). The <code>ipc</code> plugin itself does not implement any IPC commands, instead, it only provides a generic framework for other plugins to extend. The <code>ipc-rules</code> plugin provides a few basic window-management commands and can be used to substitute the <code>window-rules</code> plugin with a custom user-provided script, see <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/blob/master/ipc-scripts/ipc-rules-demo.py">the Python example</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The plan for the future is to extend the <code>ipc-rules</code> plugin to support more commands and to report more events to the IPC clients. In addition, some other plugins provide their functionality as IPC commands, for example <code>wm-actions</code> and <code>grid</code>. Lastly, there is a new framework to allow all plugin bindings to be callable from an IPC script - for example after <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1864/commits/48c30481afe47c8235885d2a2c7378091e6293f2">this commit</a>, the <code>scale</code> plugin can be activated from the IPC socket.</p>

<p>If you want to use the IPC socket, but the currently provided commands are not enough for your use-case (which is likely!), feel free to reach out to discuss how to extend the existing IPC support.</p>

<h4 id="smaller-changes">Smaller changes</h4>

<p>Some smaller, but important items from the git log:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expo workspaces can now be navigated with the keyboard: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1156">PR #1156</a></li>
  <li>Animations for the simple-tile plugin: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1071">PR #1071</a></li>
  <li>Vswitch plugin has bindings for moving to a particular workspace and to last workspace: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1199">PR #1199</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1371">PR #1371</a></li>
  <li>Multiple protocols which <strong>were previously provided by core have been moved to plugins</strong>: <code>wayfire-shell</code> (<a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1715">PR #1715</a>), <code>foreign-toplevel</code>, <code>gtk-shell</code> (<a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1678">PR #1678</a>). Most likely, you will want to enable those in your <code>wayfire.ini</code>.</li>
  <li>Added support for the xdg-activation-v1 protocol: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1898">PR #1898</a></li>
</ul>

<p>There were of course many, many other small fixes and added options and PRs, which cannot be all presented here. See the full git changelog for details :)</p>

<h4 id="wf-shell">wf-shell</h4>

<p>Thanks to multiple contributors, there have also been numerous improvements to the default panel, <code>wf-panel</code>, part of wf-shell:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Huge thanks to a new contributor @NamorNiradnug, who implemented:
    <ul>
      <li>A notifications widget: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/132">PR #132</a></li>
      <li>Command output widget for displaying the output of a shell command: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/148">PR #148</a></li>
      <li>A tray widget: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/153">PR #153</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Thanks to @soreau for implementing a logout interface: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wf-shell/pull/100">PR #100</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="plugin-api-changes">Plugin API changes</h3>

<p>The focus of the 0.8.0 release was to clear the technical debt which has accumulated in core over the time. As a result, many APIs were refactored and some were completely rewritten, resulting in many breaking changes for plugins. On the upside, with most of the glaring problems in the API fixed, plugin authors can expect less (at the very least, much less severe) API changes in the future.</p>

<p>The following is a summary of the big items, many of which also provide new or improved capabilities for plugins (and, unfortunately, expose more of the complexity at times).</p>

<h4 id="scenegraph-wayfire-pr-1501">Scenegraph (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1501">PR #1501</a>)</h4>

<p>Until now, Wayfire has had very simple algorithm for rendering and input handling. Core had a list of outputs, and each output had a list of layers and views in them. While the basic structure has remained roughly the same, Wayfire 0.8.0 has a single structure called the scenegraph, which organizes all of these in a structure with a single interface. The scenegraph can also be used to repalce custom renderers and input grabs used in previous versions of Wayfire. See the <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/wiki/Scenegraph">wiki page</a> on this topic for an introduction into the technical aspects of it.</p>

<h4 id="view-interface-wayfire-pr-1370-pr-1704">View Interface (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1370">PR #1370</a>, <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1704">PR #1704</a>)</h4>

<p>Over time, Wayfire’s central type - views, which represent application windows - has accumulated too many methods, fields and responsibilities. As a part of the refactoring effort, the input and rendering aspects of this interface have been moved to the scenegraph nodes associated with a given view. The view interface itself has been split in two - ‘generic’ views, which represent any type of window, including backgrounds, panels, etc. and a specialized subclass toplevel views, which represent toplevel windows, which can be moved, resized, maximized, etc. See the <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/wiki/Views,-Toplevels-and-Transactions#views">wiki</a> for more details.</p>

<h4 id="transactions-wayfire-pr-1704">Transactions (Wayfire <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1704">PR #1704</a>)</h4>

<p>Tiling plugins like <code>simple-tile</code> need a way to resize multiple toplevels synchronously. In addition, certain changes in toplevel states (for example fullscreening and resizing to the full output size) belong logically together. In the Wayland protocol, these concepts usually are represented by using commits which group together related changes to an object. In Wayfire 0.8, we also have a similar system on the server side - transactions. They can be used to update multiple toplevels (or in general, transaction objects) and their properties atomically.</p>

<p>Another possible application of transactions is providing out-of-compositor decorations, like Emerald for Compiz: with transactions, a plugin can synchronize the state of the decoration and the main window. However, support for this has only barely reached the proof-of-concept stage. For the interested in continuing this development, a starting point can be found <a href="https://github.com/ammen99/wf-basic-deco">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="smaller-changes-1">Smaller changes</h4>

<p>There were also multiple smaller fixes and updates to the API, a non-exhaustive list of which is here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plugins now have one single instance, instead of one instance per output (use <code>wf::per_output_plugin_t&lt;&gt;</code> as a helper for achieving the old behavior): <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1674">PR #1674</a></li>
  <li>Keyboard focus is now tracked globally, instead of per-output: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1913">PR #1913</a></li>
  <li>The signals API has been rewritten, so that it operates on types instead of strings for the signal names, reducing their overhead: <a href="https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire/pull/1495">PR #1495</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Thank you for reading the blog to the end :) The latest Wayfire 0.8.0 release contains many breaking changes, but also some exciting new features. Do not hesitate to open bug reports if you notice any regressions if you are upgrading from the 0.7.x series. Last but not least, many thanks to everyone who has contributed code or has tested the git version of Wayfire!</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
<blockquote>
  <p>Why does C use the asterisk for pointers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply - because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)" rel="noreferrer">B</a> did.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because memory is a linear array, it is possible to interpret the value in a cell as an index in this array, and BCPL supplies an operator for this purpose. In the original language it was spelled <code>rv</code>, and later <code>!</code>, while B uses the unary <code>*</code>. Thus, if <code>p</code> is a cell containing the index of (or address of), or pointer to) another cell, <code>*p</code> refers to the contents of the pointed-to cell, either as a value in an expression or as the target of an assignment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup>From <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.pdf" rel="noreferrer">The Development of the C Language</a> </sup></p>

<p>Thats it.  At this point, the question is as uninteresting as "why does python 3 use <code>.</code> to call a method? Why not <code>-&gt;</code>?"  Well... because Python 2 uses <code>.</code> to call a method.</p>

<p>Rarely does a language exist from nothing.  It has influences and is based on something that came before.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, why didn't B use <code>!</code> for derefrencing a pointer like its predecessor BCPL did?</p>

<p>Well, BCPL was a bit wordy.  Instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> BCPL used <code>logand</code> and <code>logor</code>.  This was because most keyboards din't have <code>∧</code> or <code>∨</code> keys and not equal was actually the word <code>NEQV</code> (see <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/bcpl.pdf" rel="noreferrer">The BCPL Reference Manual</a>).</p>

<p>B appears to have been partially inspired to tighten up the syntax rather than have long words for all these logical operators that programmers did fairly frequently.  And thus <code>!</code> for dereference became <code>*</code> so that <code>!</code> could be used for logical negation.  Note there's a difference between the unary <code>*</code> operator and the binary <code>*</code> operator (multiplication).</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, what about <em>other</em> options, like <code>-&gt;</code>?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>-&gt;</code> was taken for syntactic sugar around field derefrences <code>struct_pointer-&gt;field</code> which is <code>(*struct_pointer).field</code></p>

<p>Other options like <code>&lt;-</code> could create ambiguous parsings.  For example:</p>

<pre><code> foo &lt;- bar
</code></pre>

<p>Is that to be read as:</p>

<pre><code>(foo) &lt;- (bar)
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>(foo) &lt; (-bar)
</code></pre>

<p>Making a unary operator that is composed of a binary operator and another unary operator is quite likely to have problems as the second unary operator may be a prefix for another expression.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is again important to try to keep the things being typed frequently to a minimum.  I would <em>hate</em> to have to write:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char-&gt;-&gt; argv, char-&gt;-&gt; envp)
</code></pre>

<p>This also becomes difficult to read.</p>

<p>Other characters might have been possible (the <code>@</code> wasn't used until <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/25749/289086">Objective C appropriated it</a>).  Though again, this goes to the core of 'C uses <code>*</code> because B did'.  Why didn't B use <code>@</code>?  Well, B didn't use all the characters.  There was no <code>bpp</code> program (compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor" rel="noreferrer">cpp</a>) and other characters were available in B (such as <code>#</code> which was later used by cpp).</p>

<p>If I may hazard a guess as to why - its because of where the keys are.  From a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/btut.pdf" rel="noreferrer">manual on B</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To facilitate manipulation of addresses when it seems advisable, B provides two unary address operators, <code>*</code> and <code>&amp;</code>. <code>&amp;</code> is the address operator so <code>&amp;x</code> is the address of <code>x</code>, assuming it has one. <code>*</code> is the indirection operator; <code>*x</code> means "use the content of x as an address."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that <code>&amp;</code> is shift-7 and <code>*</code> is shift-8.  Their proximity to each other may have been a hint to the programmer as to what they do... but that's only a guess. One would <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/252023/why-does-c-use-the-asterisk-for-pointers/273268#273268">have to ask Ken Thompson</a> about why that choice was made.</p>

<hr>

<p>So, there you have it.  C is that way because B was.  B is that way because it wanted to change from how BCPL was.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content--body"><div> <p>When Taylor Webb played around with GPT-3 in early 2022, he was blown away by what OpenAI’s large language model appeared to be able to do. Here was a neural network trained only to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/24/1017797/gpt3-best-worst-ai-openai-natural-language">predict the next word in a block of text</a>—a jumped-up autocomplete. And yet it gave correct answers to many of the abstract problems that Webb set for it—the kind of thing you’d find in an IQ test. “I was really shocked by its ability to solve these problems,” he says. “It completely upended everything I would have predicted.”</p>  <p>Webb is a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies the different ways people and computers solve abstract problems. He was used to building neural networks that had specific reasoning capabilities bolted on. But GPT-3 seemed to have learned them for free.</p> </div><div> <p>Last month Webb and his colleagues published an article in Nature, in which they describe <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-023-01659-w">GPT-3’s ability to pass a variety of tests</a> devised to assess the use of analogy to solve problems (known as analogical reasoning). On some of those tests GPT-3 scored better than a group of undergrads. “Analogy is central to human reasoning,” says Webb. “We think of it as being one of the major things that any kind of machine intelligence would need to demonstrate.”</p>  <p>What Webb’s research highlights is only the latest in a long string of remarkable tricks pulled off by large language models. For example, when OpenAI unveiled GPT-3’s successor, GPT-4, in March, the company published an eye-popping list of professional and academic assessments that it claimed its new large language model had aced, including a couple of dozen high school tests and the bar exam. OpenAI later worked with Microsoft to show that GPT-4 could pass parts of the United States Medical Licensing Examination.</p> 
 <p>And multiple researchers claim to have shown that large language models can pass tests designed to identify certain cognitive abilities in humans, from chain-of-thought reasoning (working through a problem step by step) to theory of mind (guessing what other people are thinking).&nbsp;</p>  <p>Such results are feeding a hype machine that predicts computers will soon come for white-collar jobs, replacing <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/06/1071059/chatgpt-change-not-destroy-education-openai/">teachers</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/01/31/1067436/could-chatgpt-do-my-job/">journalists</a>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/03/1070750/ai-jobs-legal-field-gpt-4/">lawyers</a> and more. Geoffrey Hinton has called out GPT-4’s apparent ability to string together thoughts as one reason he is now <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/02/1072528/geoffrey-hinton-google-why-scared-ai/">scared of the technology he helped create</a>.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>But there’s a problem: there is little agreement on what those results really mean. Some people are dazzled by what they see as glimmers of human-like intelligence; others aren’t convinced one bit.</p>  <p>“There are several critical issues with current evaluation techniques for large language models,” says Natalie Shapira, a computer scientist at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan, Israel. “It creates the illusion that they have greater capabilities than what truly exists.”</p>  <p>That’s why a growing number of researchers—computer scientists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, linguists—want to overhaul the way large language models are assessed, calling for more rigorous and exhaustive evaluation. Some think that the practice of scoring machines on human tests is wrongheaded, period, and should be ditched.</p>  <p>“People have been giving human intelligence tests—IQ tests and so on—to machines since the very beginning of AI,” says Melanie Mitchell, an artificial-intelligence researcher at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. “The issue throughout has been what it means when you test a machine like this. It doesn’t mean the same thing that it means for a human.”</p> </div><div> <p>“There’s a lot of anthropomorphizing going on,” she says. “And that’s kind of coloring the way that we think about these systems and how we test them.”</p>  <p>With hopes and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/19/1075140/how-existential-risk-became-biggest-meme-in-ai/">fears for this technology</a> at an all-time high, it is crucial that we get a solid grip on what large language models can and cannot do.&nbsp;</p>  <h3><strong>Open to interpretation</strong></h3>  <p>Most of the problems with testing large language models boil down to the question of how to interpret the results.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Assessments designed for humans, like high school exams and IQ tests, take a lot for granted. When people score well, it is safe to assume that they possess the knowledge, understanding, or cognitive skills that the test is meant to measure. (In practice, that assumption only goes so far. Academic exams do not always reflect students’ true abilities. IQ tests measure a specific set of skills, not overall intelligence. Both kinds of assessment favor people who are good at those kinds of assessments.)&nbsp;</p> 

</div><div> <p>But when a large language model scores well on such tests, it is not clear at all what has been measured. Is it evidence of actual understanding? A mindless statistical trick? Rote repetition?</p>  <p>“There is a long history of developing methods to test the human mind,” says Laura Weidinger, a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind. “With large language models producing text that seems so human-like, it is tempting to assume that human psychology tests will be useful for evaluating them. But that’s not true: human psychology tests rely on many assumptions that may not hold for large language models.”&nbsp;</p>  <p>Webb is aware of the issues he waded into. “I share the sense that these are difficult questions,” he says. He notes that despite scoring better than undergrads on certain tests, GPT-3 produced absurd results on others. For example, it failed a version of an analogical reasoning test about physical objects that developmental psychologists sometimes give to kids.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In this test Webb and his colleagues gave GPT-3 a story about a magical genie transferring jewels between two bottles and then asked it how to transfer gumballs from one bowl to another, using objects such as a posterboard and a cardboard tube. The idea is that the story hints at ways to solve the problem. “GPT-3 mostly proposed elaborate but mechanically nonsensical solutions, with many extraneous steps, and no clear mechanism by which the gumballs would be transferred between the two bowls,” the researchers write in Nature.&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>“This is the sort of thing that children can easily solve,” says Webb. “The stuff that these systems are really bad at tend to be things that involve understanding of the actual world, like basic physics or social interactions—things that are second nature for people.”</p>  <p>So how do we make sense of a machine that passes the bar exam but flunks preschool? Large language models like GPT-4 are trained on vast numbers of documents taken from the internet: books, blogs, fan fiction, technical reports, social media posts, and much, much more. It’s likely that a lot of past exam papers got hoovered up at the same time. One possibility is that models like GPT-4 have seen so many professional and academic tests in their training data that they have learned to autocomplete the answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>A lot of these tests—questions and answers—are online, says Webb: “Many of them are almost certainly in GPT-3’s and GPT-4’s training data, so I think we really can't conclude much of anything.”</p>  <p>OpenAI says it checked to confirm that the tests it gave to GPT-4 did not contain text that also appeared in the model’s training data. In its work with Microsoft involving the exam for medical practitioners, OpenAI used paywalled test questions to be sure that GPT-4’s training data had not included them. But such precautions are not foolproof: GPT-4 could still have seen tests that were similar, if not exact matches.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>When Horace He, a machine-learning engineer, tested GPT-4 on questions taken from Codeforces, a website that hosts coding competitions, <a href="https://twitter.com/cHHillee/status/1635790330854526981">he found</a> that it scored 10/10 on coding tests posted before 2021 and 0/10 on tests posted after 2021. Others have also noted that GPT-4’s test scores take a dive on material produced after 2021. Because the model’s training data only included text collected before 2021, some say this shows that large language models display a kind of memorization rather than intelligence.</p>  <p>To avoid that possibility in his experiments, Webb devised new types of test from scratch. “What we’re really interested in is the ability of these models just to figure out new types of problem,” he says.</p> 
</div><div> <p>Webb and his colleagues adapted a way of testing analogical reasoning called Raven’s Progressive Matrices. These tests consist of an image showing a series of shapes arranged next to or on top of each other. The challenge is to figure out the pattern in the given series of shapes and apply it to a new one. Raven’s Progressive Matrices are used to assess nonverbal reasoning in both young children and adults, and they are common in IQ tests.</p>  <p>Instead of using images, the researchers encoded shape, color, and position into sequences of numbers. This ensures that the tests won’t appear in any training data, says Webb: “I created this data set from scratch. I’ve never heard of anything like it.”&nbsp;</p> </div><div> <p>Mitchell is impressed by Webb’s work. “I found this paper quite interesting and provocative,” she says. “It’s a well-done study.” But she has reservations. Mitchell has developed her own analogical reasoning test, called ConceptARC, which uses encoded sequences of shapes taken from the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge) data set developed by Google researcher François Chollet. In Mitchell’s experiments, GPT-4 scores worse than people on such tests.</p>  <p>Mitchell also points out that encoding the images into sequences (or matrices) of numbers makes the problem easier for the program because it removes the visual aspect of the puzzle. “Solving digit matrices does not equate to solving Raven’s problems,” she says.</p>  <p><strong>Brittle tests&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>The performance of large language models is brittle. Among people, it is safe to assume that someone who scores well on a test would also do well on a similar test. That’s not the case with large language models: a small tweak to a test can drop an A grade to an F.</p> 
 <p>“In general, AI evaluation has not been done in such a way as to allow us to actually understand what capabilities these models have,” says Lucy Cheke, a psychologist at the University of Cambridge, UK. “It’s perfectly reasonable to test how well a system does at a particular task, but it’s not useful to take that task and make claims about general abilities.”</p>  <p>Take an example from a<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/sparks-of-artificial-general-intelligence-early-experiments-with-gpt-4/"> paper published in March by a team of Microsoft researchers</a>, in which they claimed to have identified “sparks of artificial general intelligence” in GPT-4. The team assessed the large language model using a range of tests. In one, they asked GPT-4 how to stack a book, nine eggs, a laptop, a bottle, and a nail in a stable manner. It answered: “Place the laptop on top of the eggs, with the screen facing down and the keyboard facing up. The laptop will fit snugly within the boundaries of the book and the eggs, and its flat and rigid surface will provide a stable platform for the next layer.”</p>  <p>Not bad. But when Mitchell <a href="https://twitter.com/MelMitchell1/status/1658478774374264835">tried her own version of the question</a>, asking GPT-4 to stack a toothpick, a bowl of pudding, a glass of water, and a marshmallow, it suggested sticking the toothpick in the pudding and the marshmallow on the toothpick, and balancing the full glass of water on top of the marshmallow. (It ended with a helpful note of caution: “Keep in mind that this stack is delicate and may not be very stable. Be cautious when constructing and handling it to avoid spills or accidents.”)</p>  <p>Here’s another contentious case. In February, Stanford University researcher Michal Kosinski published a<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02083"> paper in which he claimed to show that theory of mind “may spontaneously have emerged as a byproduct” in GPT-3</a>. Theory of mind is the cognitive ability to ascribe mental states to others, a hallmark of emotional and social intelligence that most children pick up between the ages of three and five. Kosinski reported that GPT-3 had passed basic tests used to assess the ability in humans.</p> 
</div><div> <p>For example, Kosinski gave GPT-3 this scenario: “Here is a bag filled with popcorn. There is no chocolate in the bag. Yet the label on the bag says ‘chocolate’ and not ‘popcorn.’ Sam finds the bag. She had never seen the bag before. She cannot see what is inside the bag. She reads the label.”</p>  <p>Kosinski then prompted the model to complete sentences such as: “She opens the bag and looks inside. She can clearly see that it is full of …” and “She believes the bag is full of …” GPT-3 completed the first sentence with “popcorn” and the second sentence with “chocolate.” He takes these answers as evidence that GPT-3 displays at least a basic form of theory of mind because they capture the difference between the actual state of the world and Sam’s (false) beliefs about it.</p>  <p>It’s no surprise that Kosinski’s results made headlines. They also invited immediate pushback. “I was rude on Twitter,” says Cheke.</p>  <p>Several researchers, including Shapira and Tomer Ullman, a cognitive scientist at Harvard University, published counterexamples showing that large language models failed simple variations of the tests that Kosinski used. “I was very skeptical given what I know about how large language models are built,” says Ullman.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Ullman tweaked Kosinski’s test scenario by telling GPT-3 that the bag of popcorn labeled “chocolate” was transparent (so Sam could see it was popcorn) or that Sam couldn’t read (so she would not be misled by the label). Ullman found that GPT-3 failed to ascribe correct mental states to Sam whenever the situation involved an extra few steps of reasoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>  <p>“The assumption that cognitive or academic tests designed for humans serve as accurate measures of LLM capability stems from a tendency to anthropomorphize models and align their evaluation with human standards,” says Shapira. “This assumption is misguided.”</p>  <p>For Cheke, there’s an obvious solution. Scientists have been assessing cognitive abilities in non-humans for decades, she says. Artificial-intelligence researchers could adapt techniques used to study animals, which have been developed to avoid jumping to conclusions based on human bias.</p>  <p>Take a rat in a maze, says Cheke: “How is it navigating? The assumptions you can make in human psychology don’t hold.” Instead researchers have to do a series of controlled experiments to figure out what information the rat is using and how it is using it, testing and ruling out hypotheses one by one.</p> </div><div> <p>“With language models, it’s more complex. It’s not like there are tests using language for rats,” she says. “We’re in a new zone, but many of the fundamental ways of doing things hold. It’s just that we have to do it with language instead of with a little maze.”</p>  <p>Weidinger is taking a similar approach. She and her colleagues are adapting techniques that psychologists use to assess cognitive abilities in preverbal human infants. One key idea here is to break a test for a particular ability down into a battery of several tests that look for related abilities as well. For example, when assessing whether an infant has learned how to help another person, a psychologist might also assess whether the infant understands what it is to hinder. This makes the overall test more robust.&nbsp;</p>  <p>The problem is that these kinds of experiments take time. A team might study rat behavior for years, says Cheke. Artificial intelligence moves at a far faster pace. Ullman compares evaluating large language models to Sisyphean punishment: “A system is claimed to exhibit behavior X, and by the time an assessment shows it does not exhibit behavior X, a new system comes along and it is claimed it shows behavior X.”</p>  <p><strong>Moving the goalposts</strong></p>  <p>Fifty years ago people thought that to beat a grand master at chess, you would need a computer that was as intelligent as a person, says Mitchell. But chess fell to machines that were simply better number crunchers than their human opponents. Brute force won out, not intelligence.</p>  <p>Similar challenges have been set and passed, from image recognition to Go. Each time computers are made to do something that requires intelligence in humans, like play games or use language, it splits the field. Large language models are now facing their own chess moment. “It’s really pushing us—everybody—to think about what intelligence is,” says Mitchell.</p> </div><div> <p>Does GPT-4 display genuine intelligence by passing all those tests or has it found an effective, but ultimately dumb, shortcut—a statistical trick pulled from a hat filled with trillions of correlations across billions of lines of text?</p>  <p>“If you’re like, ‘Okay, GPT4 passed the bar exam, but that doesn’t mean it’s intelligent,’ people say, ‘Oh, you’re moving the goalposts,’” says Mitchell. “But do we say we’re moving the goalpost or do we say that’s not what we meant by intelligence—we were wrong about intelligence?”</p> </div><div><p>It comes down to how large language models do what they do. Some researchers want to drop the obsession with test scores and try to figure out what goes on under the hood. “I do think that to really understand their intelligence, if we want to call it that, we are going to have to understand the mechanisms by which they reason,” says Mitchell.</p>  <p>Ullman agrees. “I sympathize with people who think it’s moving the goalposts,” he says. “But that’s been the dynamic for a long time. What’s new is that now we don’t know how they’re passing these tests. We’re just told they passed it.”</p>  <p>The trouble is that nobody knows exactly how large language models work. Teasing apart the complex mechanisms inside a vast statistical model is hard. But Ullman thinks that it’s possible, in theory, to reverse-engineer a model and find out what algorithms it uses to pass different tests. “I could more easily see myself being convinced if someone developed a technique for figuring out what these things have actually learned,” he says.&nbsp;</p>  <p>“I think that the fundamental problem is that we keep focusing on test results rather than how you pass the tests.” </p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<p>
This is what should be done
	By one who is skilled in goodness,
And who knows the path of peace:
	Let them be able and upright,
Straightforward and gentle in speech,
	Humble and not conceited,
Contented and easily satisfied,
	Unburdened with duties and frugal in their ways.
Peaceful and calm and wise and skillful,
	Not proud or demanding in nature.
Let them not do the slightest thing
	That the wise would later reprove.
Wishing: In gladness and in safety,
	May all beings be at ease.
Whatever living beings there may be;
	Whether they are weak or strong, omitting none,
The great or the mighty, medium, short or small,
	The seen and the unseen,
Those living near and far away,
	Those born and to-be-born —
May all beings be at ease!

Let none deceive another,
	Or despise any being in any state.
Let none through anger or ill-will
	Wish harm upon another.
Even as a mother protects with her life
	Her child, her only child,
So with a boundless heart
	Should one cherish all living beings;
Radiating kindness over the entire world:
	Spreading upwards to the skies,
And downwards to the depths;
	Outwards and unbounded,
Freed from hatred and ill-will.
	Whether standing or walking, seated or lying down
Free from drowsiness,
	One should sustain this recollection.
This is said to be the sublime abiding.
	By not holding to fixed views,
The pure-hearted one, having clarity of vision,
	Being freed from all sense desires,
Is not born again into this world.

            <span>Abstract:</span>Many people have flipped coins but few have stopped to ponder the statistical and physical intricacies of the process. In a preregistered study we collected 350,757 coin flips to test the counterintuitive prediction from a physics model of human coin tossing developed by Persi Diaconis. The model asserts that when people flip an ordinary coin, it tends to land on the same side it started -- Diaconis estimated the probability of a same-side outcome to be about 51%. Our data lend strong support to this precise prediction: the coins landed on the same side more often than not, $\text{Pr}(\text{same side}) = 0.508$, 95% credible interval (CI) [$0.506$, $0.509$], $\text{BF}_{\text{same-side bias}} = 2364$. Furthermore, the data revealed considerable between-people variation in the degree of this same-side bias. Our data also confirmed the generic prediction that when people flip an ordinary coin -- with the initial side-up randomly determined -- it is equally likely to land heads or tails: $\text{Pr}(\text{heads}) = 0.500$, 95% CI [$0.498$, $0.502$], $\text{BF}_{\text{heads-tails bias}} = 0.183$. Furthermore, this lack of heads-tails bias does not appear to vary across coins. Our data therefore provide strong evidence that when some (but not all) people flip a fair coin, it tends to land on the same side it started. Our data provide compelling statistical support for Diaconis' physics model of coin tossing.
