<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>News organizations including The New York Times, The Associated Press and the conservative Newsmax television network said Monday they will not sign a Defense Department document about its new press rules, making it likely the Trump administration will evict their reporters from the Pentagon.</p><p>Those outlets say the policy threatens to punish them for routine news gathering protected by the First Amendment. The Washington Post, The Atlantic and Reuters on Monday also publicly joined the group that says it will not be signing. AP confirmed Monday afternoon that it would not sign. </p><p>“Reuters is bound by its commitment to accurate, impartial and independent news,” the agency said in a statement. “We also steadfastly believe in the press protections afforded by the U.S. Constitution, the unrestricted flow of information and journalism that serves the public interest without fear or favor. The Pentagon’s new restrictions erode these fundamental values.”</p>
    
<p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1977808951338307907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reacted</a></span> by posting the Times’ statement on X and adding a hand-waving emoji. His team has said that reporters who don’t acknowledge the policy in writing by Tuesday must turn in badges admitting them to the Pentagon and clear out their workspaces the next day.</p>



<p>The <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-journalists-new-restrictions-hegseth-b9e70801f7d7930251a0740e7168f775">new rules</a></span> bar journalist access to large swaths of the Pentagon without an escort and say Hegseth can revoke press access to reporters who ask anyone in the Defense Department for information — classified or otherwise — that he has not approved for release.</p>
    
    
    
<p>Newsmax, whose on-air journalists are generally supportive of President Donald Trump’s administration, said that “we believe the requirements are unnecessary and onerous and hope that the Pentagon will review the matter further.”</p><p>Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said the rules establish “common sense media procedures.”</p><p>“The policy does not ask for them to agree, just to acknowledge that they understand what our policy is,” Parnell said. “This has caused reporters to have a full blown meltdown, crying victim online. We stand by our policy because it’s what’s best for our troops and the national security of this country.”</p>
    
<p>Hegseth also reposted a question from a follower who asked, “Is this because they can’t roam the Pentagon freely? Do they believe they deserve unrestricted access to a highly classified military installation under the First Amendment?”</p><p>Hegseth answered, “yes.” Reporters say neither of those assertions is true.</p><p>Pentagon reporters say signing the statement amounts to admitting that reporting any information that hasn’t been government-approved is harming national security. “That’s simply not true,” said David Schulz, director of Yale University’s Media Freedom &amp; Information Access Clinic.</p><p>Journalists have said they’ve long worn badges and don’t access classified areas, nor do they report information that risks putting any Americans in harm’s way.</p><p>“The Pentagon certainly has the right to make its own policies, within the constraints of the law,” the Pentagon Press Association said in a statement on Monday. “There is no need or justification, however, for it to require reporters to affirm their understanding of vague, likely unconstitutional policies as a precondition to reporting from Pentagon facilities.”</p>
    
<p>Noting that taxpayers pay nearly $1 trillion annually to the U.S. military, Times Washington bureau chief Richard Stevenson said “the public has a right to know how the government and military are operating.”</p><p>Trump has applied pressure on news organizations in several ways, with <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68">ABC News</a></span> and <span><a data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-media-harris-minutes-paramount-6415042fe910ae60b432dd8c73ef61b2">CBS News</a></span> settling lawsuits related to their coverage.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>The world’s largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like <strong>AT&amp;T</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet’s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.</p>
<p>Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.</p>
<p>The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru’s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.</p>
<p>As Aisuru’s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,</a> which was then the largest assault that Google’s DDoS protection service <strong>Project Shield</strong> had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.</p>
<p>By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru’s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.</p>

<p>Aisuru’s overlords aren’t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like <strong>Minecraft</strong>, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.</p>
<p>For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet’s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Ferguson</strong> is principal security engineer at <strong>Global Secure Layer</strong> (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts <strong>TCPShield</strong>, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.</p>
<p>Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider <strong>OVH</strong> that they were no longer welcome as a customer.</p>
<p>“This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,” he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.</p>
<p>Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacks on gaming servers</a> can be still seen at the website <a href="https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;viewPanel=3&amp;from=1759040061640&amp;to=1759161701743" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blockgametracker.gg</a>, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.</p>
<div id="attachment_72328"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72328" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png" alt="" width="750" height="457" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png 1436w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru-768x468.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru-782x476.png 782w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72328">An Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28&nbsp; can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic.

<p>Paging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider <strong>Cosmic</strong> (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.</p>

<h2>BOTNETS R US</h2>
<p>Ferguson said he’s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet’s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.</p>
<p><strong>AT&amp;T</strong> customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on <strong>Charter Communications</strong>, <strong>Comcast</strong>, <strong>T-Mobile</strong> and <strong>Verizon</strong>, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.</p>
<p>“The impact extends beyond victim networks,” Ferguson said. “For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast’s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.”</p>
<p><strong>Roland Dobbins</strong> is principal engineer at <strong>Netscout</strong>. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.</p>
<p><span>“The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,” Dobbin said.</span> “We’re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.”</p>
<p>“The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,” Dobbins continued. “A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there’s going to be a period ahead where there’s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.”</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson’s report. Charter Communications pointed to <a href="https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent blog post on protecting its network</a>, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.</p>
<p>“In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,” Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. “With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Comcast responded, “Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.”<span id="more-72321"></span></p>
<h2>9 YEARS OF MIRAI</h2>
<p>Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaked in 2016</a>&nbsp;by <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the original creators of the <strong>Mirai</strong> IoT botnet</a>. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016</a>.</p>
<p>The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.</p>
<div id="attachment_36755"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-36755" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png" alt="" width="733" height="417" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png 580w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-768x437.png 768w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage.png 778w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></p><p id="caption-attachment-36755">A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.</p></div>
<p>Dobbins said Aisuru’s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.</p>
<p>“The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,” he said. “And that’s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.”</p>
<p>The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle “<strong>9gigsofram</strong>,” which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called <strong>Proxypipe</strong> that was <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Coelho</strong> co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner <strong>Erik “9gigsofram” Buckingham</strong>, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru’s botmasters chose Buckingham’s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.</p>
<p>“The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,” Coelho said.</p>
<p>Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn’t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,” he said.</p>
<h2>RAPID SPREAD</h2>
<p>Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. <strong>XLab</strong>, the Chinese security company that was the <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first to profile Aisuru’s rise in 2024</a>, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for <strong>Totolink</strong>, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.</p>
<p>“Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,” XLab <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on September 15. “The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.”</p>

Image: XLab.</p></div>
<p>Aisuru’s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the <strong>U.S. Department Justice</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/oregon-man-charged-in-rapper-bot-ddos-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">charged the alleged proprietor of <strong>Rapper Bot</strong></a>, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.</p>
<p>Once Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru’s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government’s takedown, Dobbins said.</p>
<p>“Folks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that’s great, but unfortunately the botnet’s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,” he said. “The problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.”</p>
<div id="attachment_72344"><p><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72344" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlabs-aisuru.png" alt="" width="738" height="810"></p><p id="caption-attachment-72344">A screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS.

<h2>BOTMASTERS AT LARGE</h2>
<p>XLab’s <a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September blog post</a> cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: “Snow,” who’s responsible for botnet development; “Tom,” tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and “<strong>Forky</strong>,” responsible for botnet sales.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2025 story</a> about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky’s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png" alt="" width="750" height="500" srcset="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png 779w, https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky-768x512.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"></p>
<p>Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called <strong>Botshield</strong>. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP’s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.</p>
<p>In our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.</p>
<p>Reached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).</p>
<p>But after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.</p>
<p>At this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.</p>
<p>“I’m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,” Forky replied. “They’re blaming me for those new attacks. Pretty much the whole world (is) due to your blog.”</p>

            <span>Abstract:</span>The XNU kernel is the basis of Apple's operating systems. Although labeled as a hybrid kernel, it is found to generally operate in a monolithic manner by defining a single privileged trust zone in which all system functionality resides. This has security implications, as a kernel compromise has immediate and significant effects on the entire system. Over the past few years, Apple has taken steps towards a more compartmentalized kernel architecture and a more microkernel-like design. To date, there has been no scientific discussion of SPTM and related security mechanisms. Therefore, the understanding of the system and the underlying security mechanisms is minimal. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of new security mechanisms and their interplay, and create the first conclusive writeup considering all current mitigations. SPTM acts as the sole authority regarding memory retyping. Our analysis reveals that, through SPTM domains based on frame retyping and memory mapping rule sets, SPTM introduces domains of trust into the system, effectively gapping different functionalities from one another. Gapped functionality includes the TXM, responsible for code signing and entitlement verification. We further demonstrate how this introduction lays the groundwork for the most recent security feature of Exclaves, and conduct an in-depth analysis of its communication mechanisms. We discover multifold ways of communication, most notably xnuproxy as a secure world request handler, and the Tightbeam IPC framework. The architecture changes are found to increase system security, with key and sensitive components being moved out of XNU's direct reach. This also provides additional security guarantees in the event of a kernel compromise, which is no longer an immediate threat at the highest trust level.

The stakes could hardly be higher. </p><p><span>A lot of bubbles are purely financial beasts, driven by irrationality or coordination problems in the markets for stocks, bonds, and derivatives. For example, you can have a </span><em><a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~markus/research/papers/bubbles_crashes.pdf" rel="">speculative bubble</a></em><span>, in which a bunch of people know an asset is overpriced, but think they can sell out before the crash, and so they keep buying and buying and pushing the price up and up. You can also have an </span><em><a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/extrapolation_bubbles_published_version.pdf" rel="">extrapolative bubble</a></em><span>, when people see the price of something going up and up, and mistakenly decide that it must be due to some underlying positive trend.</span></p><p><span>But a much simpler possibility is that investors could </span><em>make a big mistake</em><span> about how valuable some technology is. They could honestly believe that AI is going to create immense amounts of value, and </span><em>they could just end up being wrong</em><span>. Then when they realize that the technology isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, they could temper their expectations, which would cause a price crash in AI stocks.</span><a data-component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" id="footnote-anchor-2-175930142" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/americas-future-could-hinge-on-whether#footnote-2-175930142" target="_self" rel="">2</a><span> But the stock crash wouldn’t be the real problem; far more painful would be the wave of loan defaults and financial distress that would result from AI’s actual shortcomings. </span></p><p><span>If there’s an AI crash, it’ll probably be this latter type. Jeff Bezos calls it </span><a href="https://x.com/unusual_whales/status/1977132350598201639?t=qesLmbVZNo3GhdJXt_RaWw&amp;s=19" rel="">an “industrial bubble”</a><span>, and I think that’s as good a name as any. This kind of bubble is still a financial phenomenon, since the banking system gets hurt. But the cause is a mistake about real technology, rather than asset markets going haywire. </span></p><p><span>Everyone who’s talking about an AI bubble is basically warning that the technology itself might disappoint. For example, here are some excerpts from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-04/why-ai-bubble-concerns-loom-as-openai-microsoft-meta-ramp-up-spending?sref=R8NfLgwS" rel="">a big Bloomberg feature</a><span> about the possibility of an AI bubble:</span></p><blockquote><p> Even some of AI’s biggest cheerleaders acknowledge the market is frothy, while still professing their belief in the technology’s long-term potential. AI, they say, is poised to reshape multiple industries, cure diseases and generally accelerate human progress…Yet never before has so much money been spent so rapidly on a technology that, for all its potential, remains somewhat unproven as a profit-making business model…</p><p><span>The data center spending spree is overshadowed by persistent skepticism about the payoff from AI technology. In August, investors were rattled after researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that </span><a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/08/21/ai-wall-street-big-tech" rel="">95% of organizations</a><span> saw zero return on their investment in AI initiatives.</span></p><p><span>More recently, researchers at Harvard and Stanford offered a possible explanation for why. Employees are using AI to create “</span><a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity" rel="">workslop</a><span>,” which the researchers define as “AI generated work content that masquerades as good work, but lacks the substance to meaningfully advance a given task.”…</span></p><p><span>AI developers have also been confronting a different challenge. OpenAI…Anthropic and others have for years bet on the so-called scaling laws…Over the past year, however, these developers have experienced </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/openai-google-and-anthropic-are-struggling-to-build-more-advanced-ai" rel="">diminishing returns</a><span>…Some have also struggled to match their own hype. After months of touting GPT-5 as a significant leap, OpenAI’s release of its latest AI model in August was met with mixed reviews…</span></p><p><span>There’s also the risk that the AI industry’s vast data center buildout, entailing a huge increase in </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-10-02/altman-s-ai-power-grab-is-tone-deaf-and-infeasible" rel="">electricity consumption</a><span>, will be held back by the realities of strained national power networks.</span></p></blockquote><p>When you bring up concerns like this to an AI engineer, executive, or founder, they tend to just smile at you indulgently, secure in the knowledge that their invention is everything it’s cracked up to be, and that much better things are already in the pipeline. </p><p>But this doesn’t reassure me. Because when we look at the history of industrial bubbles, and of new technologies in general, it becomes clear that in order to cause a crash, AI doesn’t have to fail. It just has to mildly disappoint the most ardent optimists.</p><p>This is why I think an AI crash is more likely than a lot of people in the tech world — or the Trump administration — realize.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<p>Programming languages have rapidly evolved in recent years. But in software
development, the new often meets the old, and the scaffolding that OS gives for
running new processes hasn’t changed much since Unix.</p>
<p>If you need to parametrize your application at runtime by passing a few ad-hoc
variables (without special files or a custom solution involving IPC or
networking), you’re doomed to a pretty awkward, outdated interface:</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment variables.</h2>
<p><code>export SECRET_API_KEY=2u845102348u234</code></p>
<p>There are no namespaces for them, no types. Just a flat, embarrassingly global
dictionary of strings.</p>
<p>But what exactly are these envvars? Is it some kind of special dictionary
inside the OS? If not, who owns them and how do they propagate?</p>
<h2 id="where-do-they-come-from">Where do they come from?</h2>
<p>In a nutshell: they’re passed from parent to child.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>    841 ?        00:00:00 sshd
   1520 ?        00:00:00  \_ sshd-session

</code></pre><p>On Linux, a program must use the <code>execve</code> syscall to execute another program.
Whether you type <code>ls</code> in Bash, call <code>subprocess.run</code> in Python, or launch a
code editor, it ultimately comes down to <code>execve</code>, preceded by a
<code>clone</code>/<code>fork</code>. The <code>exec*</code> family of C functions also relies on <code>execve</code>.</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="c"><span><span><span>SYSCALL_DEFINE3</span><span>(</span><span>execve</span><span>,</span>
</span></span><span><span>		<span>const</span> <span>char</span> <span>__user</span> <span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>filename</span><span>,</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This system call takes three arguments: <code>filename</code>, <code>argv</code>, <code>envp</code>.
For example, for an <code>ls -lah</code> invocation:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>/usr/bin/ls</code> is the <code>filename</code> (the executable path),</li>
<li><code>['ls', '-lah']</code> is the <code>argv</code> array of command line arguments – the
implicit first (“zero”) argument is usually the executable name,</li>
<li><code>['PATH=/bin:/usr/bin', 'USER=allvpv']</code> is the <code>envp</code> array of envvars
(typically much longer).</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, all envvars are passed from the parent to the child. However,
nothing prevents a parent process from passing a completely different or even
empty environment when calling <code>execve</code>! In practice, most tooling passes the
environment down: Bash, Python’s <code>subprocess.run</code>, the C library <code>execl</code>, and
so on.</p>
<p>And this is what you expect – variables are inherited by child processes.
That’s the point – to track the environment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Which tools do <em>not</em> pass the parent’s environment?
For example, the <code>login</code> executable, used when signing into a
system, sets up a fresh environment for its children.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="where-do-they-go">Where do they go?</h2>
<p>After launching the new program, the kernel dumps the variables on the stack as
a sequence of null-terminated strings which contain the envvar definitions.
Here is a hex view:</p>

</code></pre><p>This static layout can’t easily be modified or extended; the program must copy
those variables into its own data structure. Let’s look at how Bash, C, and
Python store envvars internally. I analyzed their source code and here is a
summary.</p>
<h3 id="bash">Bash</h3>
<p>It stores the variables in a <em><strong>hashmap</strong></em>. Or, more precisely, in a <em><strong>stack
of hashmaps</strong></em>.</p>
<p>When you spawn a new process using Bash, it traverses the stack of hashmaps to
find variables marked as exported and copies them into the environment array
passed to the child.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Side note:</em> Why is traversing the stack needed?</p>
<p>Each function invocation in Bash creates a new local scope – a new entry
on the stack. If you declare your variable with <code>local</code>, it ends up in this
locally-scoped hashmap.</p>
<p>What’s interesting is that you can export a <code>local</code> variable too!</p>
<div><pre tabindex="0"><code data-lang="bash"><span><span><span>function</span> locallyScoped<span>()</span> <span>{</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>local</span> <span>PATH</span><span>=</span><span>"</span><span>$PATH</span><span>:/opt/secret/bin"</span>
</span></span><span><span>    <span>export</span> PATH
</span></span><span><span>    env           <span># &lt;- sees the PATH with /opt/scecret/bin</span>
</span></span><span><span><span>}</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span>locallyScoped
</span></span><span><span>env               <span># &lt;- sees the PATH without modification</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I wouldn’t have learned this without diving into Bash source. My intuitive
(wrong) assumption was that <code>export</code> <em>automatically makes the variable
global</em> – like <code>declare -g</code>! Super interesting stuff.</p></blockquote>
<h3 id="the-default-c-library-on-linux-glibc">The default C library on Linux: <code>glibc</code></h3>
<p><code>glibc</code> exposes a dynamic <code>environ</code> array, managed via <code>putenv</code> and <code>getenv</code>
library functions. It uses an array, so the time complexity of <code>getenv</code> and
<code>putenv</code> is <em>linear</em> in the number of envvars. Remember – envvars are not a
high-performance dictionary and you should not abuse them.</p>
<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>Python couples its environment to the C library, which can cause surprising
inconsistencies.</p>
<p>If you’ve programmed some Python, you’ve probably used the <code>os.environ</code>
dictionary. On startup, <code>os.environ</code> is built from the C library’s <code>environ</code>
array.</p>
<p>But those dictionary values are <strong>NOT</strong> the “ground truth” for child processes.
Rather, each change to <code>os.environ</code> invokes the native <code>os.putenv</code> function,
which in turn calls the C library’s <code>putenv</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the propagation is one-directional: modifying <code>os.environ</code> will call
<code>os.putenv</code>, but not the other way around. Call <code>os.putenv</code>, and <code>os.environ</code>
won’t be updated.</p></blockquote>
<h2 id="liberal-format">Liberal format</h2>
<p>The Linux kernel is very liberal about the format of environment variables, and
so is <code>glibc</code>.</p>
<p>For example, your C program can manipulate the environment – the global
<code>environ</code> array – such that several variables share the same name but have
different values. And when you execute a child process, it will inherit this
“broken” setup.</p>
<p>You don’t even need an equals sign separating name from value! The usual entry
is <code>NAME=VALUE</code>, but nothing prevents you from adding <code>NONSENSE_WITH_EMOJI 😀</code>
to the array.</p>
<p>The kernel happily accepts any null-terminated string as an “environment
variable” definition. It just imposes a <em>size</em> limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single variable</strong>: 128 KiB on a typical x64 Intel CPU. This is for the
whole definition – name + equal sign + value. It’s computed as <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v2.6.24/source/include/linux/binfmts.h#L14"><code>PAGE_SIZE * 32</code></a>.
No modern hardware uses pages smaller than 4 KiB, so you can treat it as a
lower bound, unless you need to deal with some legacy embedded systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Total</strong>: 2 MiB on a typical machine. This limit is shared by envvars and
the command line arguments. The calculation is a bit more complicated (see
the <code>execve(2)</code> man page):</p>
<pre><code>  max(32 * PAGE_SIZE,  min(MAX_STACK_SIZE / 4,  6 MB))
</code></pre>
<p>On a typical system, the limiting factor is the <code>MAX_STACK_SIZE</code>. Remember,
initially the envvars are dumped on the stack! To prevent unpredictable
crashes, the system allows only 1/4 of the stack for the envvars.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quirks">Quirks</h2>
<p>But the fact that you can do something does not mean that you should. For
example, if you start Bash with the “broken” environment – duplicated names and
entries without <code>=</code> – it deduplicates the variables and drops the nonsense.</p>
<p>One interesting edge case is a space inside the variable <em>name</em>. My beloved
shell – <a href="https://www.nushell.sh/">Nushell</a> – has no problem with the following
assignment:</p>
<pre><code>$env."Deployment Environment" = "prod"
</code></pre>
<p>Python is fine with it, too. Bash, on the other hand, can’t reference it
because whitespace isn’t allowed in variable names. Fortunately, the variable
isn’t lost – <a href="https://github.com/bminor/bash/blob/a8a1c2fac029404d3f42cd39f5a20f24b6e4fe4b/variables.c#L126">Bash keeps such entries in a special hashmap
called</a>
<code>invalid_env</code> and still passes them to child processes.</p>
<h2 id="the-standard-format">The standard format</h2>
<p>So what name and value can you <em>safely</em> use for your envvar? A popular
misconception, repeated on StackOverflow and by ChatGPT, is that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> permits only <strong>uppercase</strong>
envvars, and everything else is undefined behavior.</p>
<p>But this is seriously <strong>NOT</strong>
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">what the standard says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These strings have the form name=value; names shall not contain the character
‘=’. For values to be portable across systems conforming to POSIX.1-2017, the
value shall be composed of characters from the portable character set (except
NUL and as indicated below). There is no meaning associated with the order of
strings in the environment. If more than one string in an environment of a
process has the same name, the consequences are undefined.</em></p>
<p><em>Environment variable names used by the utilities in the Shell and Utilities
volume of POSIX.1-2017 consist solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the
&lt;underscore&gt; ( ‘_’ ) from the characters defined in Portable Character Set
and do not begin with a digit. Other characters may be permitted by an
implementation; applications shall tolerate the presence of such names.
Uppercase and lowercase letters shall retain their unique identities and
shall not be folded together. The name space of environment variable names
containing lowercase letters is reserved for applications. Applications can
define any environment variables with names from this name space without
modifying the behavior of the standard utilities.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, POSIX-specified utilities use uppercase envvars, but that’s not
<em>prescriptive</em> for your programs. Quite the contrary: you’re <em>encouraged</em> to
use lowercase for your envvars so they don’t collide with the standard tools.</p>
<p>The only strict rule is that a variable name cannot contain an equals sign.
POSIX requires compliant applications to preserve all variables that conform to
this rule.</p>
<p>But in reality, not many applications use lowercase. The <em>proper etiquette</em> in
software development is to use <code>ALL_UPPERCASE</code>.</p>
<h2 id="my-pragmatic-recommendation-is">My pragmatic recommendation is…</h2>
<p>…to use <code>^[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*$</code> for names, and UTF-8 for values. You shouldn’t
hit problems on Linux. If you want to be super safe: instead of UTF-8, use the
POSIX-mandated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_character_set">Portable Character Set
(PCS)</a> – essentially
ASCII without control characters.</p>

<p>Google's talk around "verified developers" sounds harmless and, in some ways, helpful. As reported on the <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Android Developer Blog</a>, it is like "an ID check at the airport which confirms a traveler's identity but is separate from the security screening of their bags." Google's analogy, however, may be oversimplified. When this is enforced, the only way a developer’s app will be installable on devices that include Google Mobile Services (GMS) — which typically provide access to the Play Store — is by completing ID verification using government-issued documents or contact information. This will be rolled out globally in 2027.</p>    <p>Apps will be blocked from installing on most mainstream phones if their developer can't complete this verification. However, there are certain devices that will remain unaffected, even though they are just a tiny fraction of the total devices. These categories include all devices that do not pass Google's certification test, primarily custom ROMs or de-Googled phones.</p>    <p>Strictly speaking, Google is not removing sideloading, but it is redefining and limiting participation in the Android ecosystem by creating a mandatory Google-controlled choke point. While this may be a subtle shift, it clearly takes an open source project from anyone being able to participate (including anonymous or pseudonymous distribution) to only those whom Google allows to participate (via centralized developer identity verification).</p>    <h2 id="security-theater-or-real-gain">

<p> There is a rational justification for tightening rules around sideloaded apps. It could be framed as user protection against malicious apps or against bad actors who cloak themselves with fake identities. While this is reasonable, the real question is whether it adds significant security for everyday users.</p>    <p>This is a valid question because security checks already exist. <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-play-protect-android-secure/" target="_blank">Google Play Protect makes Android secure</a> by scanning sideloaded apps. Android flags unsafe installs, and it’s always given us the choice of blocking apps from unknown sources. Even if these are imperfect, they’re defenses that already exist.</p>    <p>Google’s new move almost feels like it’s based on the assumption that identity equals integrity. Does a verified government-issued identification equate to user safety? This logic is flawed: historically, we've seen malware slip through the Play Store—signed and “verified”—several times. However, what the new rule does is shift the basis of trust away from existing on-device security warnings and your best judgment.</p>    <p>Critics may even contend that this new rule erodes your right to make informed decisions about your own devices, and that feels more like selective control. Ultimately, many people may view this as Google’s way of shielding itself from criticism over sideloaded malware and protecting the integrity of its ecosystem.</p>    <h2 id="there-will-be-collateral-damage">
                        There will be collateral damage
               </h2><h3 id="the-ecosystems-that-depend-on-openness">
            The ecosystems that depend on openness
    </h3>


            
    
<p>This may be the most significant anti-consumer move, simply due to its profound impact. It could hit big developers or commercial apps, as well as entire ecosystems built around freely distributed APKs without verification. F-Droid hosts an incredible number of apps not available on the Play Store. Many of these tools exist because they see a need to operate outside the long, controlling arm of Google. This sideloading rule may make them unavailable on mainstream devices even though they’re safe.</p>    <p>This is a risk that also affects indie developers and hobbyists. Certain apps can no longer justify the time, effort, or privacy trade-offs required for identity verification. Many one-off projects and apps for niche communities may fall under this category. Ultimately, what we may end up with is a shrunken ecosystem, and if this happens, it will hurt all of us.</p>    <p>However, innovation may be the biggest casualty in all of this. Android is great because of its flexibility. It is an ecosystem for everyone. The imposition of a single, centralized gatekeeper will stifle grassroots innovation, as not everyone will be willing or able to contribute, and this will invariably impact the pace and extent of innovation we see on Android.</p>    <h2 id="the-new-reality-for-android-users">
                        The new reality for Android users
               </h2><p>Although Google would argue that the intentions behind the new rules for sideloading apps are to protect and secure users, it will likely feel limiting to many Android users, let alone removing the sense of autonomy on our devices. Of course, sideloading will still be possible, but it creates friction for people who use or make apps that aren’t officially available on the Play Store. The fear is that it may be the beginning of the end for independent developers, hobbyists, and niche app communities.</p>    <p>Of course, there are workarounds: using non-certified devices, backing up APKs, or exploring alternative app stores. Sadly, the trade-offs for each workaround may range from technical complexity to potential security risks. You should <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/sideloading-android-apps-drain-bank-account/" target="_blank">be careful when sideloading apps on Android</a>. However, one thing is clear: Android's openness is closing. What we don’t know is if it will become a completely closed ecosystem someday.</p>    </div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-hpc="true"><article itemprop="text"><p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">nanochat</h2><a id="user-content-nanochat" aria-label="Permalink: nanochat" href="#nanochat"></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p dir="auto">The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="auto">This repo is a full-stack implementation of an LLM like ChatGPT in a single, clean, minimal, hackable, dependency-lite codebase. nanochat is designed to run on a single 8XH100 node via scripts like <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/blob/master/speedrun.sh">speedrun.sh</a>, that run the entire pipeline start to end. This includes tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and web serving over a simple UI so that you can talk to your own LLM just like ChatGPT. nanochat will become the capstone project of the course LLM101n being developed by Eureka Labs.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Quick start</h2><a id="user-content-quick-start" aria-label="Permalink: Quick start" href="#quick-start"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">The fastest way to feel the magic is to run the speedrun script <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/blob/master/speedrun.sh">speedrun.sh</a>, which trains and inferences the $100 tier of nanochat. On an 8XH100 node at $24/hr, this gives a total run time of about 4 hours. Boot up a new 8XH100 GPU box from your favorite provider (e.g. I use and like <a href="https://lambda.ai/service/gpu-cloud" rel="nofollow">Lambda</a>), and kick off the training script:</p>

<p dir="auto">Alternatively, since the script runs for 4 hours, I like to launch it like this inside a new screen session <code>speedrun</code> (and also log output to <code>speedrun.log</code>):</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="screen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh"><pre>screen -L -Logfile speedrun.log -S speedrun bash speedrun.sh</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">See the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jctosta/af918e1618682638aa82">screen cheatsheet</a> if you are less familiar. You can watch it go inside the screen session, or detach with <code>Ctrl-a d</code> and <code>tail speedrun.log</code> to view progress. Now wait 4 hours. Once it's done, you can talk to your LLM via the ChatGPT-like web UI. Make sure again that your local uv virtual environment is active (run <code>source .venv/bin/activate</code>), and serve it:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m scripts.chat_web"><pre>python -m scripts.chat_web</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">And then visit the URL shown. Make sure to access it correctly, e.g. on Lambda use the public IP of the node you're on, followed by the port, so for example <a href="http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/" rel="nofollow">http://209.20.xxx.xxx:8000/</a>, etc. Then talk to your LLM as you'd normally talk to ChatGPT! Get it to write stories or poems. Ask it to tell you who you are to see a hallucination. Ask it why the sky is blue. Or why it's green. The speedrun is a 4e19 FLOPs capability model so it's a bit like talking to a kindergartener :).</p>

<p dir="auto">(Your table might be missing the RL number by default). For a lot more information around the speedrun script and what to look for and expect, please refer to the walkthrough that I posted in Discussions of the repo: <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1" data-hovercard-type="discussion" data-hovercard-url="/karpathy/nanochat/discussions/1/hovercard">"Introducing nanochat: The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy"</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Bigger models</h2><a id="user-content-bigger-models" aria-label="Permalink: Bigger models" href="#bigger-models"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Unsurprisingly, $100 is not enough to train a highly performant ChatGPT clone. In fact, LLMs are famous for their multi-million dollar capex. For our purposes, I think there are two more scales of interest. First is the ~$300 tier d26 model (i.e. depth=26) that trains in ~12 hours, which slightly outperforms GPT-2 CORE score. Second is the $1000 tier (~41.6 hours), just because it's a nice round number. But both of these are not yet fully supported and therefore not attached here in the master branch yet.</p>
<p dir="auto">That said, to give a sense, the example changes needed for the <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat/blob/master/speedrun.sh">speedrun.sh</a> file to train a GPT-2 grade model d26 only involve three changes:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="...
# you'll need to download more data shards for pretraining
# get the number of parameters, multiply 20 to get tokens, multiply by 4.8 to get chars,
# divide by 250 million to get number of shards. todo need to improve this...
python -m nanochat.dataset -n 450 &amp;
...
# use --depth to increase model size. to not oom, halve device batch size 32 -> 16:
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- --depth=26 --device_batch_size=16
...
# make sure to use the same later during midtraining:
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.mid_train -- --device_batch_size=16"><pre>...
<span><span>#</span> you'll need to download more data shards for pretraining</span>
<span><span>#</span> get the number of parameters, multiply 20 to get tokens, multiply by 4.8 to get chars,</span>
<span><span>#</span> divide by 250 million to get number of shards. todo need to improve this...</span>
python -m nanochat.dataset -n 450 <span>&amp;</span>
...
<span><span>#</span> use --depth to increase model size. to not oom, halve device batch size 32 -&gt; 16:</span>
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.base_train -- --depth=26 --device_batch_size=16
...
<span><span>#</span> make sure to use the same later during midtraining:</span>
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.mid_train -- --device_batch_size=16</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">That's it! The biggest thing to pay attention to is making sure you have enough data shards to train on (the code will loop and do more epochs over the same training set otherwise, decreasing learning speed a bit), and managing your memory/VRAM, primarily by decreasing the <code>device_batch_size</code> until things fit (the scripts automatically compensates by increasing the number of gradient accumulation loops, simply turning parallel compute to sequential compute).</p>
<p dir="auto">And a bit more about computing environments that will run nanochat:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>The code will run just fine on the Ampere 8XA100 GPU node as well, but a bit slower.</li>
<li>All code will run just fine on even a single GPU by omitting <code>torchrun</code>, and will produce ~identical results (code will automatically switch to gradient accumulation), but you'll have to wait 8 times longer.</li>
<li>If your GPU(s) have less than 80GB, you'll have to tune some of the hyperparameters or you will OOM / run out of VRAM. Look for <code>--device_batch_size</code> in the scripts and reduce it until things fit. E.g. from 32 (default) to 16, 8, 4, 2, or even 1. Less than that you'll have to know a bit more what you're doing and get more creative.</li>
<li>Most of the code is fairly vanilla PyTorch so it should run on anything that supports that - xpu, mps, or etc, but I haven't implemented this out of the box so it might take a bit of tinkering.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Questions</h2><a id="user-content-questions" aria-label="Permalink: Questions" href="#questions"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">nanochat is designed to be short and sweet. One big advantage of this is that we can package up all of the files together and copy paste them to your favorite LLM to ask arbitrary questions. As an example, I like to package up the repo using the <a href="https://github.com/simonw/files-to-prompt">files-to-prompt</a> utility like so:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="files-to-prompt . -e py -e md -e rs -e html -e toml -e sh --ignore &quot;*target*&quot; --cxml > packaged.txt"><pre>files-to-prompt <span>.</span> -e py -e md -e rs -e html -e toml -e sh --ignore <span><span>"</span>*target*<span>"</span></span> --cxml <span>&gt;</span> packaged.txt</pre></div>
<p dir="auto">This includes all py, rs, html, toml, sh files, excludes the <code>rustbpe/target</code> folder, and chooses the cxml output format. Everything is written to the <code>packaged.txt</code> file, which atm measures ~330KB (i.e. well below ~100K tokens for a state of the art LLM), and ~8K lines of code in 45 files.</p>
<p dir="auto">Alternatively, I recommend using <a href="https://deepwiki.com/" rel="nofollow">DeepWiki</a> from Devin/Cognition to ask questions of this repo. In the URL of this repo, simply change github.com to deepwiki.com, and you're off.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Tests</h2><a id="user-content-tests" aria-label="Permalink: Tests" href="#tests"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">I haven't invested too much here but some tests exist, especially for the tokenizer. Run e.g. as:</p>
<div dir="auto" data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="python -m pytest tests/test_rustbpe.py -v -s"><pre>python -m pytest tests/test_rustbpe.py -v -s</pre></div>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Contributing</h2><a id="user-content-contributing" aria-label="Permalink: Contributing" href="#contributing"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">nanochat is nowhere finished. The goal is to improve the state of the art in micro models that are accessible to work with end to end on budgets of &lt; $1000 dollars. Accessibility is about overall cost but also about cognitive complexity - nanochat is not an exhaustively configurable LLM "framework"; there will be no giant configuration objects, model factories, or if-then-else monsters in the code base. It is a single, cohesive, minimal, readable, hackable, maximally-forkable "strong baseline" codebase designed to run start to end and produce a concrete ChatGPT clone and its report card.</p>

		<p>Two years ago, Americans anxious about the forthcoming 2024 presidential election were considering the malevolent force of an election influencer: artificial intelligence. Over the past several years, we have seen <a href="https://www.cigionline.org/articles/then-and-now-how-does-ai-electoral-interference-compare-in-2025/">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/artificial-intelligence/articles/10.3389/frai.2025.1569115/full">of</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/26/technology/ai-elections-democracy.html">warning</a> <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/643ecb10be528d2c1da863cb/682f5ae442fffdff819ef830_TP%202025.2.pdf">signs</a> from elections worldwide demonstrating how AI can be used to propagate misinformation and alter the political landscape, whether by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/13/us/politics/trump-meme-trolls-2024.html">trolls</a> on social media, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/17/nx-s1-5079397/openai-chatgpt-iranian-group-us-election">foreign</a> <a href="https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2025/02/07/algorithmic-invasions-how-information-warfare-threatens-nato-s-eastern-flank/index.html">influencers</a>, or even a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-operative-admits-commissioning-fake-biden-robocall-used-ai-rcna140402">street magician</a><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democratic-operative-admits-commissioning-fake-biden-robocall-used-ai-rcna140402">.</a> AI is poised to play a more volatile role than ever before in America’s next federal election in 2026. We can already see how different groups of political actors are approaching AI. Professional campaigners are using AI to accelerate the traditional tactics of electioneering; organizers are using it to reinvent how movements are built; and citizens are using it both to express themselves and amplify their side’s messaging. Because there are so few rules, and so little prospect of regulatory action, around AI’s role in politics, there is no oversight of these activities, and no safeguards against the dramatic potential impacts for our democracy.</p>
<h3>The Campaigners</h3>
<p>Campaigners—messengers, ad buyers, fundraisers, and strategists—are focused on efficiency and optimization. To them, AI is a way to augment or even replace expensive humans who traditionally perform tasks like personalizing emails, texting donation solicitations, and deciding what platforms and audiences to target.</p>
<p>This is an incremental evolution of the computerization of campaigning that has been underway for decades. For example, the progressive campaign infrastructure group Tech for Campaigns <a href="https://www.techforcampaigns.org/results/2024-results">claims</a> it used AI in the 2024 cycle to reduce the time spent drafting fundraising solicitations by one-third. If AI is working well here, you won’t notice the difference between an annoying campaign solicitation written by a human staffer and an annoying one written by AI.</p>
<p>But AI is scaling these capabilities, which is likely to make them even more ubiquitous. This will make the biggest difference for challengers to incumbents in safe seats, who see AI as both a tacitly useful tool and an attention-grabbing way to get their race into the headlines. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/underdog-who-beat-biden-in-american-samoa-used-ai-in-election-campaign-b0ce62d6">Jason Palmer</a>, the little-known Democratic primary challenger to Joe Biden, successfully won the American Samoa primary while extensively leveraging AI avatars for campaigning.</p>
<p>Such tactics were sometimes deployed as publicity stunts in the 2024 cycle; they were firsts that got attention. Pennsylvania Democratic Congressional candidate <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/12/democratic-campaign-ai-caller-00131180">Shamaine Daniels</a> became the first to use a conversational AI robocaller in 2023. Two long-shot challengers to Rep. Don Beyer used an <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/virginia-congressional-candidate-creates-ai-chatbot-debate-stand-in-incumbent-2024-10-08/">AI avatar</a> to represent the incumbent in a live debate last October after he declined to participate. In 2026, voters who have seen years of the official White House X account posting deepfaked <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrg8zkz8d0o">memes</a> of Donald Trump will be desensitized to the use of AI in political communications.</p>
<p>Strategists are also turning to AI to interpret public opinion data and provide more <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-024-02150-4">fine-grained insight</a> into the perspective of different voters. This might sound like AIs replacing people in opinion polls, but it is really a <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/articles/using-ai-for-political-polling/">continuation</a> of the evolution of political polling into a data-driven science over the last several decades.</p>
<p>A recent <a href="https://theaapc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AAPC-Foundation-AI-Presentation-Public-Release-v4.pptx.pdf">survey</a> by the American Association of Political Consultants found that a majority of their members’ firms already use AI regularly in their work, and more than 40 percent believe it will “fundamentally transform” the future of their profession. If these emerging AI tools become popular in the midterms, it won’t just be a few candidates from the tightest national races texting you three times a day. It may also be the member of Congress in the safe district next to you, and your state representative, and your school board members.</p>
<p>The development and use of AI in campaigning is different depending on what side of the aisle you look at. On the Republican side, Push Digital Group is going “<a href="https://campaignsandelections.com/industry-news/gop-firm-bets-big-on-artificial-intelligenc/">all in</a>” on a new AI <a href="https://pushdigitalgroup.com/blog/push-digital-group-launches-push-ai/">initiative</a>, using the technology to create hundreds of ad variants for their clients automatically, as well as assisting with strategy, targeting, and data analysis. On the other side, the National Democratic Training Committee recently released a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/democrats-midterm-elections-ai/">playbook</a> for using AI. <a href="https://shortyawards.com/16th/quillerai">Quiller</a> is building an AI-powered fundraising platform aimed at drastically reducing the time campaigns spend producing emails and texts. Progressive-aligned startups <a href="https://www.chorusai.co/">Chorus AI</a> and <a href="https://campaignsandelections.com/industry-news/startup-bets-on-ai-ads-for-politics/">BattlegroundAI</a> are offering AI tools for automatically generating ads for use on social media and other digital platforms. <a href="https://www.donoratlas.com/">DonorAtlas</a> automates data collection on potential donors, and <a href="https://www.hillandstate.com/rivalmindai">RivalMind AI</a> focuses on political research and strategy, automating the production of candidate dossiers.</p>
<p>For now, there seems to be an investment gap between Democratic- and Republican-aligned technology innovators. Progressive venture fund <a href="https://highergroundlabs.com/">Higher Ground Labs</a> boasts $50 million in deployed investments since 2017 and a significant <a href="https://highergroundlabs.com/ai/">focus on AI</a>. Republican-aligned counterparts operate on a much smaller scale. Startup Caucus has announced one investment—of $50,000—since 2022. The <a href="https://www.campaigninnovation.org/">Center for Campaign Innovation</a> funds research projects and events, not companies. This echoes a longstanding gap in campaign technology between Democratic- and Republican-aligned <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/whos-funding-the-2024-election/">fundraising platforms</a> ActBlue and WinRed, which has landed the former in Republicans’ political <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/09/actblue-letter-republican-congressional-investigation-00394531">crosshairs</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, not all campaign technology innovations will be visible. In 2016, the Trump campaign vocally eschewed using <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-scorning-of-data-may-not-hurt-him-but-itll-hurt-the-gop/">data</a> to drive campaign strategy and appeared to be falling way <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news">behind</a> on ad spending, but was—we learned in retrospect—<a href="https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/the-45th-how-the-trump-campaigns-digital-strategy-made-history/">actually</a> leaning heavily into digital advertising and making use of new controversial mechanisms for accessing and exploiting voters’ social media data with vendor <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/cambridge-analytica-controversy/">Cambridge Analytica</a>. The most impactful uses of AI in the 2026 midterms may not be known until 2027 or beyond.</p>
<h3>The Organizers</h3>
<p>Beyond the realm of political consultants driving ad buys and fundraising appeals, organizers are using AI in ways that feel more radically new.</p>
<p>The hypothetical potential of AI to drive political movements was illustrated in 2022 when a Danish artist collective used an AI model to found a political party, the <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/this-danish-political-party-is-led-by-an-ai/">Synthetic Party</a>, and generate its policy goals. This was more of an art project than a popular movement, but it demonstrated that AIs—synthesizing the expressions and policy interests of humans—can formulate a political platform. In 2025, Denmark hosted a “<a href="https://kunsthalaarhus.dk/en/Exhibitions/Synthetic-Summit">summit</a>” of eight such AI political agents where attendees could witness “continuously orchestrate[d] algorithmic micro-assemblies, spontaneous deliberations, and impromptu policy-making” by the participating AIs.</p>
<p>The more viable version of this concept lies in the use of AIs to facilitate deliberation. AIs are being used to help <a href="https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf">legislators</a> collect input from constituents and to hold large-scale <a href="https://delibdemjournal.org/article/id/1556/">citizen assemblies</a>. This kind of AI-driven “<a href="https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/DGO2025/article/view/953">sensemaking</a>” may play a powerful role in the future of public policy. Some <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq2852">research</a> has suggested that AI can be as or more effective than humans in helping people find common ground on controversial policy issues.</p>
<p>Another movement for “<a href="https://publicai.network/">Public AI</a>” is focused on wresting AI from the hands of corporations to put people, through their governments, in control. Civic technologists in national governments from <a href="https://sea-lion.ai/">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://abci.ai/en/">Japan</a>, <a href="https://www.ai.se/en/project/eurolingua-gpt">Sweden</a>, and <a href="https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2025/07/a-language-model-built-for-the-public-good.html">Switzerland</a> are building their own alternatives to Big Tech AI models, for use in public administration and distribution as a <a href="https://economicsecurityproject.org/resource/the-global-rise-of-public-ai/">public good</a>.</p>
<p>Labor organizers have a particularly interesting relationship to AI. At the same time that they are <a href="https://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/a-first-look-at-labors-ai-values/">galvanizing</a> mass resistance against the replacement or endangerment of human workers by AI, many are racing to leverage the technology in their own work to build power.</p>
<p>Some entrepreneurial organizers have used AI in the past few years as <a href="https://unitedworkers.org.au/archive/unions-mobilise-ai-to-turn-the-tables-on-wage-theft-in-hospitality/">tools</a> for activating, connecting, answering questions for, and providing guidance to their members. In the UK, the <a href="https://www.agileunions.ai/">Centre for Responsible Union AI</a> studies and promotes the use of AI by unions; they’ve published several <a href="https://www.agileunions.ai/t/Case%20studies%20and%20use%20cases">case studies</a>. The <a href="https://www.agileunions.ai/p/case-study-repcoach-pcs-union-reps-practice-recruitment-conversations">UK Public and Commercial Services Union</a> has used AI to help their reps simulate recruitment conversations before going into the field. The Belgian union <a href="https://www.agileunions.ai/p/acv-cvs-trial-shared-inboxes">ACV-CVS</a> has used AI to sort hundreds of emails per day from members to help them respond more efficiently. Software companies such as <a href="https://www.quorum.us/solutions/grassroots-advocacy/">Quorum</a> are increasingly offering AI-driven products to cater to the needs of organizers and grassroots campaigns.</p>
<p>But unions have also leveraged AI for its symbolic power. In the U.S., the Screen Actors Guild held up the specter of AI displacement of creative labor to attract public attention and sympathy, and the ETUC (the European confederation of trade unions) developed a <a href="https://etuc.org/en/document/artificial-intelligence-workers-not-just-profit-ensuring-quality-jobs-digital-age">policy platform</a> for responding to AI.</p>
<p>Finally, some union organizers have leveraged AI in more provocative ways. Some have applied it to hacking the “bossware” AI to <a href="https://www.etui.org/sites/default/files/2023-10/Exercising%20workers%20rights%20in%20algorithmic%20management%20systems_Lessons%20learned%20from%20the%20Glovo-Foodinho%20digital%20labour%20platform%20case_2023.pdf">subvert</a> the exploitative intent or <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-army-union-busters-amazon/">disrupt</a> the anti-union practices of their managers.</p>
<h3>The Citizens</h3>
<p>Many of the tasks we’ve talked about so far are familiar use cases to anyone working in office and management settings: writing emails, providing user (or voter, or member) support, doing research.</p>
<p>But even mundane tasks, when automated at scale and targeted at specific ends, can be pernicious. AI is not neutral. It can be applied by many actors for many purposes. In the hands of the most numerous and diverse actors in a democracy—the citizens—that has profound implications.</p>
<p>Conservative activists in Georgia and Florida have used a tool named <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/conservative-activists-errors-software-voter-fraud-rcna161028">EagleAI</a> to automate challenging voter registration en masse (although the tool’s creator later <a href="https://apnews.com/article/georgia-voter-removal-software-eagleai-266ead9198da7d54421798e8a1577d26">denied</a> that it uses AI). In a nonpartisan electoral management context with access to accurate data sources, such automated review of electoral registrations might be useful and effective. In this hyperpartisan context, AI merely serves to amplify the proclivities of activists at the extreme of their movements. This trend will continue unabated in 2026.</p>
<p>Of course, citizens can use AI to safeguard the integrity of elections. In Ghana’s 2024 presidential election, civic organizations used an AI tool to automatically detect and mitigate electoral <a href="https://penplusbytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ahead-Africa-DDP-Final-Report-2025.pdf">disinformation</a><a href="https://penplusbytes.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ahead-Africa-DDP-Final-Report-2025.pdf"> spread on social media</a>. The same year, <a href="https://www.techpolicy.press/redefining-ai-for-africa-the-role-of-artificial-intelligence-in-kenyas-grassroots-movement/">Kenyan protesters</a> developed specialized chatbots to distribute information about a controversial finance bill in Parliament and instances of government corruption.</p>
<p>So far, the biggest way Americans have leveraged AI in politics is in self-expression. About <a href="https://resist.bot/news/2023/03/08/resistbot-at-six-building-a-community">ten million Americans</a> have used the chatbot Resistbot to help draft and send messages to their elected leaders. It’s hard to find statistics on how widely adopted tools like this are, but researchers have <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09747">estimated</a> that, as of 2024, about one in five consumer complaints to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was written with the assistance of AI.</p>
<p>OpenAI operates security programs to <a href="https://cdn.openai.com/threat-intelligence-reports/5f73af09-a3a3-4a55-992e-069237681620/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-june-2025.pdf">disrupt</a> foreign influence operations and maintains <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/16/openai-safety-framework-manipulation-deception-critical-risk/">restrictions</a> on political use in its terms of service, but this is <a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/self-regulation-won-t-prevent-problematic-political-uses-of-generative-ai">hardly sufficient</a> to deter use of AI technologies for whatever purpose. And widely available free models give anyone the ability to attempt this on their own.</p>
<p>But this could change. The most ominous sign of AI’s potential to disrupt elections is not the deepfakes and misinformation. Rather, it may be the use of AI by the Trump administration to <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/trumps-immigration-crackdown-built-ai-surveillance-and-disregard-due-process">surveil and punish</a> political speech on social media and other online platforms. The scalability and sophistication of AI tools give governments with authoritarian intent unprecedented power to police and selectively limit political speech.</p>
<h3>What About the Midterms?</h3>
<p>These examples illustrate AI’s pluripotent role as a force multiplier. The same technology used by different actors—campaigners, organizers, citizens, and governments—leads to wildly different impacts. We can’t know for sure what the net result will be. In the end, it will be the interactions and intersections of these uses that matters, and their unstable dynamics will make future elections even more unpredictable than in the past.</p>
<p>For now, the decisions of how and when to use AI lie largely with individuals and the political entities they lead. Whether or not you personally trust AI to write an email for you or make a decision about you hardly matters. If a campaign, an interest group, or a fellow citizen trusts it for that purpose, they are free to use it.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that Congress or the Trump administration will put guardrails around the use of AI in politics. AI companies have rapidly emerged as among the biggest <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/sep/02/ai-industry-pours-millions-into-politics">lobbyists</a> in Washington, reportedly dumping <a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/silicon-valley-launches-pro-ai-pacs-to-defend-industry-in-midterm-elections-287905b3?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAjaxxFIzEaiCnLuxtt5FYul1NMFgXzDPGeVaH0VKZedvoSLexjk_j2Gr_Q0ZKQ%3D&amp;gaa_ts=68b063e0&amp;gaa_sig=V93Si4VVkqKsN1H-aEXHbbUoyVrGdS9GECVqYESgBE7WTq_dVBNLHw5VIyH41lRNW0pQQRB3N7d0mV9v_EaR4Q%3D%3D">$100 million</a> toward preventing regulation, with a focus on influencing candidate behavior before the midterm elections. The Trump administration seems <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/25/trump-ai-action-plan">open and responsive</a> to their appeals.</p>
<p>The ultimate effect of AI on the midterms will largely depend on the experimentation happening now. Candidates and organizations across the political spectrum have ample opportunity—but a ticking clock—to find effective ways to use the technology. Those that do will have little to stop them from exploiting it.</p>

            <pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 14:34:40 GMT</pubDate>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/13/4chan_ofcom_fine/">https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/13/4chan_ofcom_fine/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45568767">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<p>Ofcom, the UK's Online Safety Act regulator, has fined online message board 4chan £20,000 ($26,680) for failing to protect children from harmful content.</p>
<p>The fine could rise by a further £6,000 – £100 per day for a maximum 60 days – if it continues to ignore its duties to comply with the regulator's request for information regarding two separate matters.</p>
<p>4chan can stop the additional fines by providing copies of its illegal content risk assessments and information about its qualifying worldwide revenue to Ofcom.</p>

    

<p>The enforcement action announced today is months in the making after Ofcom first opened an investigation into the notorious image board on June 10.</p>

        


        

<p>It requested the aforementioned risk assessments on April 14, and to this day 4chan still has not complied, the regulator said.</p>
<p>When opening the investigation, Ofcom said it was looking to understand whether 4chan has failed, or is failing, to abide by its duties under the Online Safety Act.</p>

        

<p>The watchdog also highlighted that the maximum penalties for these failures, as specified in the legislation, are £18 million ($24 million) or 10 percent of an organization's qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater.</p>
<p><em>The Register</em> contacted <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/28/4chan_back_onlin/">4chan</a> for its side of the story.</p>
<p>Ofcom's fine is the first made under the Online Safety Act since in-scope organizations' illegal content duties came into force on March 17. It also announced two provisional decisions to take action against file-sharing service Im.ge and pornography service provider AVS Group Ltd for similar failures to respond to information requests.</p>

        

<p>In Im.ge's case, this relates to its duty to implement measures to prevent the circulation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and AVS Group was rapped over its duty to implement <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/09/discord_photo_ids_leaked/">age-check mechanisms</a>.</p>
<p>Both organizations have the chance to appeal Ofcom's findings before it makes a final decision on how to reprimand them.</p>
<p>Another porn provider, Youngtek Solutions Ltd, is also under an expanded investigation over its failure to respond to information requests regarding age-checking requirements.</p>
<p>Tech secretary Liz Kendall said: "The Online Safety Act is not just law, it's a lifeline. Today we've seen it in action, holding platforms to account so we can protect people across the UK.</p>
<p>"Services can no longer ignore illegal content, like encouraging self-harm or suicide, circulating online which can devastate young lives and leave families shattered.</p>
<p>"This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material. We fully back the regulator in taking action against all platforms that do not protect users from the darkest corners of the internet."</p>
<p>In total, since March 2025, Ofcom has opened 21 investigations into the providers of in-scope apps and websites, and launched five enforcement programs.</p>
<h3>Playing by the rules</h3>
<p>In brighter news, others under Ofcom investigation have shown improvements, and several of these cases are now closed.</p>
<p>Four file-sharing services under investigation for their child safety measures avoided further action by geo-blocking UK users, much to Ofcom's delight. Krakenfiles, Nippydrive, Nippyshare, and Nippyspace have all blocked British IP addresses instead of following other measures set out in the regulator's codes of practice.</p>
<p>Ofcom said it has closed the cases into these sites, and that the measures have "significantly reduced the likelihood that people in the UK will be exposed to any illegal or harmful content."</p>
<p>"We will continue to monitor their availability in the UK and reserve the right to reopen our investigations if we have reason to do so. We are pursuing further lines of inquiry against file-sharing services Nippybox and Yolobit, and these investigations remain ongoing."</p>
<p>A suicide forum is also now geo-blocking UK IPs after Ofcom began enforcement proceedings.</p>
<p>Satisfied for now, the regulator said it will keep tabs on the unnamed provider to see whether that block remains in place over the long term, and ensure it does not provide information on how to bypass it.</p>

</ul>
<p>Bypassing these measures has been a hot point of discussion since the Online Safety Act's most noticeable rules came into force in July, triggering a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/28/uk_vpn_demand_soars/">surge in VPN subscriptions</a> within days of Brits having to submit their ID cards for age verification purposes.</p>
<p>While platforms are forbidden from guiding users toward these types of workarounds, this alone is unlikely to prevent VPNs being used to bypass geo-blocks and similar measures.</p>
<p>They do not appear to be going anywhere either. The UK government has previously stated that it <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/19/uk_commissioner_suggests_govt_stop/">does not wish to ban them</a>, since they have many legitimate purposes. But if platforms promote VPNs and other workarounds to children as a means to access their services, then Ofcom will pursue action against them.</p>
<h3>First look at beefed-up requirements</h3>
<p>Among Ofcom's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/15/uk_lords_take_aim_at/">proposed amendments</a> to its obligations to platforms was the requirement for in-scope apps and websites to make use of hash-matching technology, which is seen as a more accurate, automated way of preventing the dissemination of illegal content such as CSAM.</p>
<p>Hash matching involves a system fingerprinting an image and comparing the hash it generates to a database of known harmful images, which are also hashed. If an image's hash matches or shows signs of similarity with one in the database, then it can be removed entirely autonomously and reported to local authorities for follow-up investigations.</p>
<p>Ofcom previously identified "serious compliance concerns" with its CSAM enforcement program at 1Fichier.com and Gofile.io, leading to investigations being opened into them both.</p>
<p>After constructive engagement with the regulator, both now deploy hash-matching tech and escaped further action.</p>
<p>Suzanne Cater, director of enforcement at Ofcom, said: "Today sends a clear message that any service which flagrantly fails to engage with Ofcom and their duties under the Online Safety Act can expect to face robust enforcement action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're also seeing some services take steps to introduce improved safety measures as a direct result of our enforcement action. Services who choose to restrict access rather than protect UK users remain on our watchlist as we continue to monitor their availability to UK users." ®</p>

			<p>We spoke with the man behind the Psygnosis logo – and so much more!</p>

<p>English artist Roger Dean is a living legend, and his work in the video game industry represent just a small chapter in his extraordinary career. Dean was born in 1944 in Kent, but spent much of his childhood in Greece and Hong Kong. His father was an engineer in the British Army, so the family had to move wherever his work took him. In particular, the years he lived in Hong Kong would later become an important source of inspiration for him.</p>
<p>After returning to England, he studied art, architecture, and furniture design, and it was actually in the latter field that he had his first breakthrough. He designed what he called the <a href="https://tradingboundariesfineart.com/exhibitions/28-design-centre-sea-urchin-chair-1967-council-of-industrial-design-london-uk/overview/">Sea Urchin Chair</a>, a predecessor to the famous bean bag chair.</p>

<p>But it was as a visual artist that he truly made his mark. In 1968, he created his first album cover, for the British rock band The Gun, and later became heavily involved with the prog rock bands Yes and Asia. His cover for Asia’s debut album was voted the second-best album cover of all time by readers of Rolling Stone Magazine in 1982, and it was also Dean who designed the very first logo for Richard Branson’s newly established Virgin Records.</p>
<p>It was in the 1980s that Roger Dean first became involved in the video game industry, where he was not only responsible for a number of iconic game covers, but also some of gaming’s most recognizable logos.</p>
<p>When we reached out to Dean to ask if he would like to do an interview with us, we honestly didn’t expect him to respond. And if he did, we assumed it would be just a small handful of questions answered by e-mail. But not only was he interested in talking with us, we ended up having a long and pleasant video call, during which he happily showed us his work and chatted about a variety of topics.</p>
<p>Note that our main focus was on Dean’s work with games, so if you’d like to read more about everything else he’s done, you could, for example, check out <a href="https://longlivevinyl.net/2017/03/21/roger-dean-interview/">this profile interview at We Love Vinyl</a>. You should also <a href="https://www.rogerdean.com/">visit his website</a>.</p>
<p>In this article, we present an edited version of that conversation, supplemented with a bit of extra information about the topics we discuss.</p>
<h2>The Black Onyx and Psygnosis</h2>
<p>We start in the mid eighties, which is when Dean first gets involved in the games industry. His first cover artwork was created for The Black Onyx, a game you’ve probably never heard of unless you’re very interested in the history of gaming. Because even though the producer and designer of that game was an American – Henk Rogers, who we’ll talk more about later – the game was only released in Japan. While it isn’t a famous game, it is an early example of a role-playing game developed in Japan, and it would help influence how Japanese developers approached the genre.</p>

<p>For European gamers, it’s probably Dean’s other contract that proved the most memorable. When the British publisher Psygnosis was formed in 1984, they reached out to Roger Dean to create their logo. This would mark the start of a long lasting relationship which would shape much of the visual identity of the well remembered publisher.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: How did you get involved with the games industry? I know that your first work was on The Black Onyx …</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: That’s right! Well, Henk Rogers, who now publishes Tetris, sought me out – though this was before he got the rights to Tetris. He was aware of my work in music. So he knew my music and my books, and of course my album covers. He contacted me through my publishing company, and came to visit.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: But that game only came out in Japan?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: That’s correct, yes.</p>
<p>But about the same time I met Henk, I also met Jonathan Ellis of Psygnosis. I had met with Imagine Software before – two of the people from Imagine formed Psygnosis with Jonathan Ellis – and I did a whole bunch of Psygnosis stuff.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: They contacted you? They’d seen your artwork already?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Yes, they contacted me. They’d certainly seen the books. We sold enormous amounts of posters and books back then. During the seventies, my posters, books, calendars etcetera sold about 65 million copies, and by the mid eighties we’d passed a hundred million sales. So it was out there, you know. Much more than today.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: The owl logo, was that your idea?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Yeah, sure. That was my job. They gave me an idea about the kind of name that they wanted, so even the name was partly mine. Both the name and the owl… they were very clear about what they wanted, but they didn’t know visually or even how to put the words together. So the word came to me in the end, and the visuals.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Do you remember how you came up with the idea of putting an owl in there?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: What can I say? *laughs*</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: Did you see or play the games before you did the covers?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: That’s not how it worked. It was the same with the music. Very often I had to finish the covers long before the games were done, and the content of the games was as much influenced by the cover as the cover was by the content.</p>
<p>In fact, I would say that the cover was influenced by them describing what they wanted to do for the game, and then me visualizing it. And then they would reproduce that to some degree themselves in the games.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: So they just said: This is what we are thinking, and then you started working?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: They described the game, usually in much more extravagant terms than what the reality was. They would say they were making an interective movie, and I’d say «wow!». And when I saw it, there would be these little matchstick figures…</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: What was the process like?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, it was very different from the work I was used to doing, so from that point of view it was good fun for me. Like going in another direction, I enjoyed that a lot. Especially the designs I did for The Shadow of the Beast, they were very different from any album covers I’d made.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: Did you ever work on actual game [design] for them?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: No, I remember when we did a game called Barbarian. The developers got very excited and asked me what I thought of their dragon. And I said, «what dragon?» Because I’d put a dragon on the box, and they’d then put my dragon in the game. And I said, «oh, you have to show me.» And they said, «it’s at the end of the first level, you haven’t gotten beyond the first level?» And I said «noo… I haven’t even <em>started</em> the first level!»</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Did they ever come back to you and ask you to redo something?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Not really. Maybe on one occation only. I can’t even remember what it was, but I did the lettering for it, and I found them another artist. In the end, that was a turning point for me, because they were already producing more games than I could possibly manage. So I would end up doing logos, but getting other artists to do the art.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Yeah, I see some of your covers are listed as a collaboration with you and Tim White.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Tim White, yes. There was a number of artists in it. Chris Voss, I think. Peter Jones, maybe. Yeah. There was a few other artists who did covers.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: So you did the logos, and they did the paintings?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: They did the painting, yes.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Was there a community of artists who did covers?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, I knew the artist because I had published the books, and that was in very recent history. You know, within ten years of when we had the publishing company.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: I love all the covers you did for Psygnosis. Unfortunately, I don’t own so many, only Terrorpods I think. You did the logo there, I think?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Terrorpods is interesting because I did the drawings for that. The painting was done by Tim White, but it was my drawing. I drew the machine.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: It’s one of my favorite covers.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Yeah, it’s pretty good, I like it.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: There was also some re-use of older album covers. Did you help facilitate that?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: No, it’s the other way around. There were game ideas that became album covers. So game covers that became albums. Barbarian without the barbarian became a cover for a solo album by Steve Howe [from Yes], for instance.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Ah, I see.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: The rule that I have is that there can be no confusion. So I never use a painting for one album cover on another. That would not be good. But if it was a totally different thing the rules and the licensing arrangements allowed me to do that.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: So you made sure of that going into the projects?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: From the very beginning, yes. I kept all the rights.</p>

<h2>The evolution of game covers</h2>
<p>We asked Roger Dean whether he ever received the finished game boxes he had worked on, and not only did get the boxes – he still has them! He then suggested showing us a few, and returned shortly afterward with the boxes for Shadow of the Beast I and II. Two large cardboard boxes with cover art that is both stunning and unique.</p>
<p>This led to a conversation about how game boxes have evolved over the years, and Dean’s thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Where did that [SotB] style come from?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: I was very interested in mechanical things. So when I was a student, a lot of my work was about ideas for machinery. So Shadow of the Beast was natural, a very easy connection, and it was good fun.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Those boxes are really unusual.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, of course. There are no boxes at all today, are there.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: No… I was thinking about that because those big old boxes, they were almost like the the old records, compared to what came later…</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Yeah, and these are floppy disks inside. One also besides the floppy disks, I think it had a cassette, and a t-shirt. So it, so it had a book of instructions, floppy disk, cassette and t-shirt.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: Yeah. You don’t get that today.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: No. And the t-shirt was kind of weird because you couldn’t choose the size, right?</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Oh, well, it could be a gift for someone, if it didn’t fit…</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: It would have had to be. Yeah. *laughs*</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: But what I was getting at … I assume you’ve seen how game boxes just shrunk and became smaller and smaller, and now we don’t even have them. How do you feel about that?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, I don’t know. It’s the same problem, of course, with music. And what happened was that for a very short period of time, music made the perfect gift. You know, a 12 inch vinyl, it looked like and felt like something you would both like to give and receive. And that concept of the gift was really strong.</p>

<p>You know, back when the vinyl was normal, getting a record for your birthday or Christmas was a big deal. And a big deal to give because they were relatively expensive. They weren’t even affordable by young people until quite a few years after they were invented. But it was a big deal, that gift idea. When it first went to CD, the record companies destroyed the idea of a gift because they stripped out a lot of what made it special.</p>
<p>I mean, one of Yes’s biggest albums in terms of its impact and iconography was Close to the Edge. And when it came out in vinyl, the cover had the new logo, but the painting was inside. When it came out on CD, there was no painting, it was just a folded sheet of paper inside. It was black and white, no image. And I thought, you know, this is treating the customers with so little respect. It was just amazing.</p>
<p>And as the industry went into decline, shortly after that, you could see, there was no respect. No respect for the music, for the bands and for the fans. It was their own fault that they were in trouble. The only country where the quality was persistent was Japan. Their CDs were always beautiful. In the West? They were rubbish.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Would you say the same was true for games?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: It wasn’t really the size, it was the complete lack of care that really troubled me enormously. I quite like the small versions [of records] that came out in Japan because they were like a kind of bonsai, but everything was there. All the art was there. In fact, Japan had the bonus of having the translation, so you got more than the basic thing. It was good.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: Do you follow modern video game art?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: No, I don’t really. People show me stuff and I go, «wow, that’s pretty cool.» But I don’t go out of my way to follow it.</p>

<h2>Tetris, and The Black Onyx part two</h2>
<p>Few games – if any – are more famous than Tetris. We won’t go into the history of this addictive puzzle game; you’ve probably heard it before. But it was the aforementioned Henk Rogers who ended up securing the rights to the game, and he also founded The Tetris Company together with the original Tetris creator Alexey Pajitnov. When the time came to create an official Tetris logo in 1997, Roger Dean was the one they contacted.</p>
<p>This, however, was not the only collaboration between Dean and Rogers. The other was an ambitious sequel to The Black Onyx that was sadly cancelled before completion. Based on what Dean tells us below, it sounds like a really ambitious project.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: You also worked on Tetris.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: I did the Tetris logo. That was just a word, so much less interesting than the Psygnosis logo. But Tetris is a very interesting game…</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: You knew Henk Rogers, did he always want you to do the logo?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: That was more than 25 years ago. Yeah, he he wanted me to do it because there were hundreds of versions out there. Not done by him, but by the various companies that’d license it. And people did pirate versions. Everyone had their own version of Tetris. So he wanted only one version of the logo. If someone had a license, they had to use the authorized logo. It was an attempt to put discipline into it, really.</p>
<p>And then two or three years ago he handed over the management of Tetris to his daughter, Maya, and she changed the logo again. But it’s the same rules, one logo. Although it’s slightly different to mine.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: And The Black Onyx?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: A much, much, more lavish version of The Black Onyx was due to come out in the States, and I worked on that. It was my job to put together the team that did the content and the packaging, and that included the story, music, landscapes, costumes, everything. I didn’t do it alone, but I put together the team.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: This was actual game development?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Yes, this was a full-on role-playing game. A lot of the artwork appears in my book, <a href="https://store.rogerdean.com/products/dragons-dream-book">Dragon’s Dream</a>. But the very big, lavish production never happened, sadly. That was very disappointing. We worked on it for some years, it was good fun.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Do you know why it didn’t happen?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: I’m not a hundred percent sure. It was a huge amount of work. It was a real shame that it never happened, because while the technology has moved on, the design would still be valid today. The music is incredible.</p>

<p><em><strong>HAJ: So is there a chance it could see the light of day?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Heh, yeah, I think Henk Rogers would like to see it published. He owns the game, and I own the artwork. The big game was supposed to be called Onyx.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: This was much more advanced than the original?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Way more advanced. Too advanced for it’s time, really. It would have needed 24 CDs for each episode. DVDs arrived in the middle of it, but that would have only divided the number of CDs by three.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Do you remember any game projects that were particularly exciting to work with?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, you know what? Onyx, in the end, was the most exciting. Because that was the first time I got really hands on with the content.</p>
<p>And as I said, it’s still never seen the light of day. It is very interesting, because two weeks ago I had a visit from Henk Rogers. He’s doing a book called The Perfect Game about Tetris, and he’s doing an audio book. And in that he talks about different projects, including Black Onyx. For Black Onyx, he used some of the music that we created for the project, and it was really good by any standards. It was a great piece of music, not a great piece of game music, but a great piece of music. Even the music should be published. It hasn’t been, but it should be.</p>

<p><em><strong>HAJ: Who did that music?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, we did it in collaboration with two people called Youth and Jaz. Jaz Coleman was orchestral minded, but he was also a singer for a band called Killing Joke. So he had his rock and roll credentials. But he worked with Prague Symphony Orchestra and things like that. Youth (Martin Glover) was very much into electronic music. He had a band called The Orb, and he worked with people like Paul McCartney. Oh, he did all kinds of stuff. But his big interest was electronic music at the time.</p>
<p>Between them, one producing, one arranging, they made a lovely soundtrack. And it had people like Steve Howe from Yes performing on it.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: Is there a chance that we will hear this music in the future?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, I think yes, because we were all listening to it at least two weeks ago, and that’s exactly what everyone was saying. This music has got to be available. It’s got to be out there.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: I really want to play this game now … but but the artwork for this game will be out in your next book or calendar?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Some of it will, but it’s in my book, Dragon’s Dream, which was published in 2008.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: Was it ever possible to actually play the game – did it get that far into development?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: No. Henk would probably tell me I’m wrong, but I’m not even sure gameplay was ever fully developed. The overall concept had to be because we couldn’t structure what we did without that, but we were filling in a lot of gaps. Too many gaps.</p>
<p>I mean, we did a lot of things which were done for the first time. At the time, I studied kendo, which is Japanese martial art with the sword. And my sensei had studied medieval European sword and pole arm spear techniques. For the sword fighting, it was broken up into kata, which is attack, defend, counterattack – sequences that were from real techniques. In a fight you could put it together and it looks so amazingly convincing, and you could watch it from any angle. And we we recorded it in motion capture. So it was very realistic. And it was not just&nbsp; because the motion capture is realistic, but because these were genuine sword techniques.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: I know The Tetris Company worked with another company [Digital Eclipse] for an «interactive museum» about Tetris, so I was wondering if something could maybe be saved and published in a similar way?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Well, there is something which is possible. We developed a process that Henk called Track and Field. Track was when the characters followed a specific route, and Field was when they could wander wherever you liked. They couldn’t wander over the whole world because they’d get lost and it would be boring. You had to have a mechanism to bring them back, but you needed them to follow a path.</p>

<p>So you could do it like a movie where there was a sequence that was completely constructed. You could watch it from different angles, but you it was a complete construction, but then you could break off into a game. If for instance it was like Lord of the Rings, they could be climbing the mountain path, but when they’re in the dragon’s lair, then they’d come into the field – the game aspect, where they can wander wherever they want. But once they’re out again, they’re back on the track.</p>
<p>So there’s bits when you can just watch it, it looks great, and then there’s bits when you’re frantically interactive.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: Did you work on any other interesting projects like this?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Before I met either Henk or Jonathan Ellis, we worked on an idea for doing a project called <a href="https://arcadeblogger.com/2024/01/27/the-bizarre-taito-taitan-arcade-cabinet/">Taitan</a>, which was an arcade game [cabinet]. We said we were going to manufacture the machines ourselves, and talked to Taito Electronics about licensing the motherboards from them. But instead, they decided to buy out our business, so that’s how that went.</p>
<p>Henk Rogers also got involved with a virtual reality project with us. He was the first who saw this, and he invested in it. We built maybe a dozen prototypes. But again, we were too far ahead of the technology. Mitsubishi supplied the monitors … they were the size of a small car. We had to cut great chunks out of the pods we were making. They were very elegant, but we had to cut massive amounts out of them just to fit in the monitors. They were bigger behind than the screen.</p>

<p><em><strong>JF: How do you view your game art compared to the rest of the work that you’ve done?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: In many ways, it was like returning to roots for me because I never did do fine art at college. I did Canterbury College of Art for four years, Royal College for three. My <a href="https://www.rogerdean.com/architectural-designs">focus was on architecture</a>. You know, the I studied basically what kind of spaces made us feel good, what kind of spaces made us feel uncomfortable. And my view is very strongly that modern architecture is not good for us. There should have been a better way.</p>
<p>This is what I’m very interested in and focused on now. We’re looking to build a visitor center and museum.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: Where?</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: We’re looking at two sites. They’ll be different. One is in England, near here, near where I live, and one is in California.</p>
<p><em><strong>JF: Thanks a lot for your time. It’s an honor for us.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: No, it’s an honor for me. And fun.</p>
<p><em><strong>HAJ: Thank you for doing this.</strong></em></p>
<p>RD: Thank you.</p>

          <p>Owners of some Jeep Wrangler 4xe hybrids have been left stranded after installing an over-the-air software update this weekend. The automaker pushed out a telematics update for the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/hands-on-with-stellantis-new-android-based-uconnect-5-infotainment/">Uconnect</a> infotainment system that evidently wasn't ready, resulting in cars losing power while driving and then becoming stranded.</p>
<p>Stranded Jeep owners have been detailing their experiences in forum and Reddit posts, as well as on YouTube. The buggy update doesn't appear to brick the car immediately. Instead, the failure appears to occur while driving—a far more serious problem. For some, this happened close to home and at low speed, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jeep/comments/1o47064/jeep_4xe_shut_off_mid_highway/">others claim</a> to have experienced a powertrain failure at highway speeds.</p>
<p>Jeep pulled the update after reports of problems, but the software had already downloaded to many owners' cars by then. A member of Stellantis' social engagement team told 4xe owners&nbsp;<a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/threads/wrangler-4xe-ota-update-10-10-2025.8078/?nested_view=1&amp;post_id=103140&amp;ref=thestack.technology#post-103140" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at a Jeep forum</a> to ignore the update pop-up if they haven't installed it yet.</p>
<p>Owners were also advised to avoid using either hybrid or electric modes if they had updated their 4xe and not already suffered a powertrain failure. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.4xeforums.com/posts/103207/">Jeep pushed out a fix</a>.</p>
<p>As Crowdstrike <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/07/major-outages-at-crowdstrike-microsoft-leave-the-world-with-bsods-and-confusion/">showed last year</a>, Friday afternoons are a bad time to push out a software update. Now Stellantis has learned that lesson, too. Ars has reached out to Stellantis, and we'll update this post if we get a reply.</p>

        </p>
    

    <p>I read an article yesterday, stating that on average, people spend 4 hours and 37 minutes on their phones per day<sup><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-usage-stats/#time-spent-using-smartphones-annually" target="_blank">1</a></sup>, with South Africans coming in fourth highest in the world at a whopping 5 hours and 11 minutes<sup><a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/smartphone-usage-stats/#time-spent-using-smartphones-by-region" target="_blank">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>This figure seems really high to me. If we assume people sleep roughly 8 hours per day, that means that one third of their day is spent on their phones. If we also assume people work 8 hours per day (ignoring the fact that they may be using their phones during work hours), that suggests that people spend over half of their free time (and up to 65% of it) glued to their screens.</p>
<p>I never wanted to carry the internet around in my pocket. It's too distracting and pulls me out of the present moment, fracturing my attention. I've tried switching to old-school black and white phones before, but always begrudgingly returned to using a smartphone due to the utility of it. The problem, however, is that it comes with too many attention sinks tucked in alongside the useful tools.</p>
<p>I care about living an intentional and meaningful life, nurturing relationships, having nuanced conversations, and enjoying the world around me. I don't want to spend this limited time I have on earth watching short form video and getting into arguments on Twitter.</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/img_1438.webp" alt="Scarborough">
<small>This is what I enjoy. Picture taken yesterday in Scarborough, South Africa.</small></p>
<p>I've written at length about how I manage my digital consumption, from <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/notifications/">turning off notifications</a> to <a href="https://herman.bearblog.dev/slow-social-media/">forgoing social media entirely</a>. The underlying premise here is that if you're trying to lose weight, you shouldn't carry cookies around in your pockets. And my phone is the bag of cookies in this metaphor.</p>
<p>We're wired to seek out distraction, novel information, and entertainment, and avoid boredom at all costs. But boredom is where creativity and self-reflection do their best work. It's why "all the best ideas come when you're in the shower"—we don't usually take our phones with us into the shower (yet).</p>
<p>According to Screen Time on my iPhone, on average I spend 30 minutes per day on it, which I think is reasonable, especially considering the most-used apps are by-and-large utility apps like banking and messages. This isn't because I have more self-control than other people. I don't think I do. It's because I know myself, and have set up my digital life to be a positive force, and not an uninspired time-sink.</p>
<p>There are many apps and systems to incentivise better relationships with our phones, mostly based around time limits. But these are flawed in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>I'm an adult, I know how to circumvent these limits, and I will if motivation is low.</li>
<li>Time limits don't affect the underlying addiction. You don't quit smoking by only smoking certain hours of the day.</li>
<li>The companies that build these apps have tens of thousands of really smart people (and billions of dollars) trying to get me hooked and keep me engaged. The only way to win this game isn't by trying to beat them (I certainly can't), but by not playing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The only way I've found to have a good relationship with my phone is to make it as uninteresting as possible. The first way is to not have recommendation media (think Instagram, TikTok, and all the rest). I'm pro deleting these accounts completely, because it's really easy to re-download the apps on a whim, or visit them in-browser. However some people have found that having them on a dedicated device works by isolating those activities. Something like a tablet at home that is "the only place you're allowed to use Instagram". I can't comment too much on this route, but it seems reasonable.</p>
<p>My biggest time sink over the past few years has been YouTube. The algorithm knew me too well and would recommend video after engaging, but ultimately useless video. I could easily burn an entire evening watching absolute junk—leaving me feeling like I'd just wasted what could have otherwise been a beautiful sunset or a tasty home-cooked lasagne. However, at the beginning of this year I learnt that you can turn off your YouTube watch history entirely, which means no recommendations. Here's what my YouTube home screen now looks like:</p>
<p><img src="https://bear-images.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/herman/45-1.webp" alt="Screenshot 2025-10-11 at 08"></p>
<p>Without the recommendations I very quickly run out of things to watch from the channels I'm subscribed to. It's completely changed my relationship with YouTube since I only watch the videos I actually want to watch, and none of the attention traps. You can turn off your YouTube watch history <a href="https://www.youtube.com/feed/history">here</a>, and auto delete your other Google history (like historic searches and navigation) <a href="https://myactivity.google.com/activitycontrols/">here</a>, which I think is just good practice.</p>
<p>I also used my adblocker, AdGuard on Safari which has a useful "block element" feature, to block the recommended videos on the right of YouTube videos. I use this feature to hide shorts as well, since I have no interest in watching them either, and YouTube intentionally makes them impossible to remove. If you're interested in a similar setup, here are the selectors I use to block those elements:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>youtube.com###items &gt; ytd-item-section-renderer.style-scope.ytd-watch-next-secondary-results-renderer:last-child
youtube.com###sections
youtube.com##[is-shorts]
youtube.com###secondary
</pre></div>
<p>The only media that I do sometimes consume on my phone are my RSS feeds, but it's something I'm completely comfortable with since it's explicitly opt-in by design and low volume.</p>
<p>While I still have the twitch to check my phone when I'm waiting for a coffee, or in-between activities—because my brain's reward system has been trained to do this—I'm now rewarded with nothing. Over time, I find myself checking my phone less and less. Sometimes I notice the urge, and just let it go, instead focusing on the here and now.</p>
<p>I think that while the attention-span-degrading effects of recommendation media are getting most of the headlines, what isn't spoken about as much is the sheer number of hours lost globally to our phones (3.8 million years per day, according to my back-of-the-napkin-math). And while people may argue that this could involve productive work or enjoyable leisure, I suspect that the vast (vast!) majority of that time is short-form entertainment.</p>
<p>My solution may sound overkill to many people, but I can say with absolute certainty that it has turned me into a more present, less distracted, and more optimistic person. I have much more time to spend in nature, with friends, or on my hobbies and projects. I can't imagine trading it in for a tiny screen, ever.</p>
<p>Give it a try.</p>

					<p>Tons of words have been written about the Trump Administrations <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/5419855-trump-administration-cuts-science-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">war on Science</a> in Universities. But few people have asked what, exactly, is science? How does it work? Who are the scientists? What do they do? And more importantly, why should anyone (outside of universities) care?</p>
<p>(Unfortunately, you won’t see answers to these questions in the general press – it’s not clickbait enough. Nor will you read about it in the science journals– it’s not technical enough. You won’t hear a succinct description from any of the universities under fire, either – they’ve long lost the ability to connect the value of their work to the day-to-day life of the general public.)</p>
<p>In this post I’m going to describe how science works, how science and engineering have worked together to build innovative startups and companies in the U.S.—and why <u>you</u> should care.</p>
<p>(In <a href="https://steveblank.com/2025/04/15/how-the-u-s-became-a-science-superpower/">a previous post I described how the U.S. built a science and technology ecosystem</a> and why investment in science is directly correlated with a country’s national power. I suggest you read it first.)</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>How Science Works<br>
</strong>I was older than I care to admit when I finally understood the difference between a <em>scientist</em>, an <em>engineer</em>, an <em>entrepreneur</em> and a <em>venture capitalist</em>; and the role that each played in the creation of advancements that made our economy thrive, our defense strong and America great.</p>
<p><strong>Scientists<br>
</strong><em>Scientists </em>(sometimes called researchers) are the people who ask lots of questions about <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> things work. They don’t know the answers. <em>Scientists</em> <em>are driven by curiosity</em>, willing to make educated guesses (the fancy word is hypotheses) and run experiments to test their guesses. Most of the time their hypotheses are wrong. But every time they’re right they move the human race forward. We get new medicines, cures for diseases, new consumer goods, better and cheaper foods, etc.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to specialize in one area – biology, medical research, physics, agriculture, computer science, materials, math, etc. — although a few move between areas. The U.S. government has supported scientific research at scale (read billions of $s) since 1940.</p>
<p>Scientists tend to fall into two categories: <em>Theorists</em> and <em>Experimentalists</em>.</p>

</strong><em>Theorists</em> develop mathematical models, abstract frameworks, and hypotheses for how the universe works. They don’t run experiments themselves—instead, they propose new ideas or principles, explain existing experimental results, predict phenomena that haven’t been observed yet. Theorists help define what reality might be.</p>
<p>Theorists can be found in different fields of science. For example:</p>
<p><em>Physics</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>Quantum field theory, string theory, quantum mechanics<br>
<em>Biology</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</em>Neuroscience and cognition, Systems Biology, gene regulation<br>
<em>Chemistry</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Molecular dynamics, Quantum chemistry<br>
<em>Computer Science</em>&nbsp; &nbsp;Design algorithms, prove limits of computation<br>
<em>Economics</em><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em>Build models of markets or decision-making<br>
<em>Mathematics</em><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </em>Causal inference, Bayesian networks, Deep Learning</p>
<p>The best-known 20th-century theorist was Albert Einstein. His tools were a chalkboard and his brain. in 1905 he wrote an equation E=MC<sup>2 </sup>which told the world that a small amount of mass can be converted into a tremendous amount of energy. <img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33115" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/einstein-at-the-blackboard/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=2294%2C1782&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="2294,1782" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Einstein at the blackboard" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?fit=468%2C363&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=162%2C126&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="162" height="126" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=300%2C233&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=1024%2C795&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=150%2C117&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=768%2C597&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1193&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1591&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Einstein-at-the-blackboard.jpeg?w=1404&amp;ssl=1 1404w" sizes="(max-width: 162px) 100vw, 162px">When he wrote it down, it was just theory. Other theorists in the 1930s and ’40s took Einstein’s theory and provided the impetus for building the atomic bomb. (Leo Szilard conceived neutron chain reaction idea, Hans Bethe led the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos, Edward Teller developed hydrogen bomb theory.) Einstein’s theory was demonstrably proved correct over Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
<p><strong>Experimentalists<br>
</strong>In addition to theorists, other scientists – called <em>experimentalists</em> – design and run experiments in a lab. The pictures you see of scientists in lab coats in front of microscopes, test tubes, particle accelerators or NASA spacecraft are likely experimentalists. They test hypotheses by developing and performing experiments. An example of this would be <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/mission/webb/">NASA’s James Webb telescope</a> or the LIGO <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/">Gravitational-Wave Observatory</a> experiment. (As we’ll see later, often it’s engineers who build the devices the experimentalists use.)<img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33116" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/experimentalist/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=375%2C314&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="375,314" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Experimentalist" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?fit=375%2C314&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=184%2C154&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="184" height="154" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=300%2C251&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?resize=150%2C126&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Experimentalist.jpg?w=375&amp;ssl=1 375w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"></p>
<p>Some of these experimentalists focus on <em>Basic Science,</em> working to get knowledge for its own sake and understand fundamental principles of nature <em>with n</em><em>o immediate practical use</em> in mind.</p>
<p>Other experimentalists work in <em>Applied Science, </em>which uses the findings and theories derived from Basic Science to design, innovate, and improve products and processes.</p>
<p>Applied scientists<em> s</em>olve practical problems oriented toward real-world applications. (Scientists at <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/000/manhattan-project-science-at-los-alamos.htm">Los Alamos</a> weretrying to understand the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass">critical mass of U-235</a> (the minimum amount that would explode.) Basic science lays the groundwork for breakthroughs in <em>applied</em> science. For instance: Quantum mechanics (basic science) led to semiconductors which led to computers (applied science). Germ theory (basic science) led to antibiotics and vaccines (applied science). In the 20th century Applied scientists <u>did not</u> start the companies that make end products. Engineers and entrepreneurs did this. (In the 21st century more Applied Scientists, particularly in life sciences, have also spun out companies from their labs.)</p>

Where is Science in the U.S. Done?<br>
</strong>America’s unique insight that has allowed it to dominate Science and invention, is that after WWII we gave Research and Development money to universities, rather than only funding government laboratories. <em><u>No other country did this at scale</u></em>.</p>
<p><em>Corporate Research Centers</em><br>
In the 20th century, U.S. companies put their excess profits into corporate research labs. <em>Basic</em> research in the U.S. was done in at Dupont, Bell Labs, IBM, AT&amp;T, Xerox, Kodak, GE, et al.</p>
<p>This changed in 1982, when the Securities and Exchange Commission ruled that it was legal for companies to buy their own stock (reducing the number of shares available to the public and inflating their stock price.) Very quickly <em>Basic</em> Science in corporate research all but disappeared. Companies focused on <em>Applied</em> Research to maximize shareholder value. In its place, Theory and Basic research is now done in <em>research </em>universities.</p>
<p><em>Research Universities<br>
</em>From the outside (or if you’re an undergraduate) universities look like a place where students take classes and get a degree. However, in a <em>research</em> university there is something equally important going on. <em>Science</em> faculty in these schools not only teach, but they are <em>expected to</em> <em>produce</em> new knowledge—through experiments, publications, patents, or creative work. Professors get grants and contracts from federal agencies (e.g., NSF, NIH, DoD), foundations, and industry. And the university builds Labs, centers, libraries, and advanced computing facilities that support these activities.</p>
<p>In the U.S. there are <strong>542</strong> research universities, ranked by the <a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/carnegie-classification/classification-methodology/2025-research-activity-designations/">Carnegie Classification</a> into three categories.</p>
<p><strong>R1: </strong><a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=1"><strong>187 Universities – Very High Research Activity</strong></a><br>
Conduct extensive research and award many doctoral degrees.<br>
Examples: Stanford, UC Berkeley, Harvard, MIT, Michigan, Texas A&amp;M …</p>
<p><strong>R2: </strong><strong><a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=2">139 Universities – High Research Activity</a><br>
</strong>Substantial but smaller research scale.<br>
Examples: Baylor, Wake Forest, UC Santa Cruz, …</p>
<p><strong>R3: </strong><a href="https://carnegieclassifications.acenet.edu/institutions/?inst=&amp;research2025%5B%5D=3"><strong>216 Research Colleges/Universities</strong></a><br>
Limited research focus; more teaching-oriented doctoral programs.<br>
Smaller state universities</p>
<p><strong>Why Universities Matter to Science</strong><br>
U.S. <a href="https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20243">universities perform about 50% of all basic science research</a> (physics, chemistry, biology, social sciences, etc.) because they are training grounds for graduate students and postdocs. Universities spend ~$109 billion a year on research. ~$60 billion of that $109 billion comes from the National Institutes for Health (NIH) for biomedical research, National Science Foundation (NSF) for basic science, Department of War (DoW), Department of Energy (DOE), for energy/physics/nuclear, DARPA, NASA. (Companies tend to invest in <em>applied</em> research and development, that leads directly to saleable products.)</p>

They ask research questions, then hire grad students, postdocs, and staff and write grant proposals to fund their work, often spending 30–50% of their time writing and managing grants. When they get a grant the lead researcher (typically a faculty member/head of the lab) is called the Principal Investigator (PI).</p>
<p>The Labs are both workplaces and classrooms. Graduate students and Postdocs do the day-to-day science work as part of their training (often for a Ph.D.). Postdocs are full-time researchers gaining further specialization. Undergraduates may also assist in research, especially at top-tier schools.</p>
<p>(Up until 2025, U.S. science was deeply international with ~40–50% of U.S. basic research done by foreign-born researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and faculty). Immigration and student visas were a critical part of American research capacity.)</p>
<p>The results of this research are shared with the agencies that funded it, published in journals, presented at conferences and often patented or spun off into startups via technology transfer offices. A lot of commercial tech—from Google search to CRISPR—started in university labs.</p>
<p>Universities support their science researchers with basic administrative staff (for compliance, purchasing, and safety) but uniquely in the U.S., by providing the best research facilities (labs, cleanrooms, telescopes), and core scientific services: DNA sequencing centers, electron microscopes, access to cloud, data analysis hubs, etc. These were the best in the world – until the sweeping cuts in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Engineers Build on the Work of Scientists<br>
</strong>Engineers design and build things <em>on top of the discoveries of scientists</em>. For example, seven years after scientists split the atom, it took 10s of thousands of <em>engineers</em> to build an atomic bomb. From the outset, the engineers knew what they wanted to build because of the basic and applied scientific research that came before them.</p>

And the massive data centers OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, et al that use Nvidia chips are being built by mechanical and other types of engineers. <img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="33128" data-permalink="https://steveblank.com/2025/10/13/no-science-no-startups-the-unseen-engine-were-switching-off/types-of-scientists-3/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=581%2C288&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="581,288" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="Types of Scientists" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?fit=468%2C232&amp;ssl=1" src="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=307%2C152&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="307" height="152" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?w=581&amp;ssl=1 581w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=300%2C149&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/steveblank.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Types-of-Scientists-1-e1760138797607.jpg?resize=150%2C74&amp;ssl=1 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px"></p>
<p>My favorite example is that the reusable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOzVgPdBqM4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SpaceX rocket landings</a> are made possible by the <em>Applied</em> Science research on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization">Convex Optimization</a> frameworks and algorithms by Steven Boyd of Stanford. And Boyd’s work was based on the <em>Basic</em> science mathematical field of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">convex analysis</a> (SpaceX, NASA, JPL, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab all use variations of Convex Optimization for guidance, control, and landing.)</p>
<p><strong>Startup Entrepreneurs Build Iteratively and Incrementally<br>
</strong>Entrepreneurs build companies to bring new products to market. <em>They hire engineers</em> to build, test and refine products.</p>
<p>Engineers and entrepreneurs operate with very different mindsets, goals, and tolerances for risk and failure. (Many great entrepreneurs start as engineers e.g., Musk, Gates, Page/Brin). An engineer’s goal is to design and deliver a solution to a <em>known</em> problem with a given set of specifications.</p>
<p>In contrast, entrepreneurs start with a series of <em>unknowns</em> about who are the customers, what are the wanted product features, pricing, etc. They retire each of these risks by building an iterative series of minimum viable products to find product/market fit and customer adoption. They pivot their solution as needed when they discover their initial assumptions are incorrect. (Treating each business unknown as a hypothesis is the entrepreneurs’ version of the Scientific Method.)</p>
<p><strong>Venture Capitalists Fund Entrepreneurs<br>
</strong>Venture capitalists (VCs) are the people who <em>fund entrepreneurs</em> who work with engineers who build things that applied scientists have proven from basic researchers.</p>
<p>Unlike banks which will give out loans for projects that have known specifications and outcomes, VCs invest <em>in a portfolio</em> of much riskier investments. While banks make money on the interest they charge on each loan, VCs take part ownership (equity) in the companies they invest in. While most VC investments fail, the ones that succeed make up for that.</p>
<p>Most VCs are not scientists. Few are engineers, some have been entrepreneurs. The best VCs understand technical trends and their investments help shape the future. <em>VCs do not invest in science/researchers</em>. VCs want to minimize the risk of their investment, so they mostly want to take engineering and manufacturing risk, but less so on applied science risk and rarely on basic research risk.&nbsp;Hence the role of government and Universities.</p>
<p>VCs invest in projects that can take advantage of science and deliver products within the time horizon of their funds (3–7 years). Science often needs decades before a killer app is visible.</p>
<p>As the flow of science-based technologies dries up, the opportunities for U.S. venture capital based on deep tech will decline, with its future in countries that are investing in science – China or Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Why Have Scientists? Why Not Just a Country of Engineers, Entrepreneurs and VCs (or AI)?<br>
</strong>If you’ve read so far, you might be scratching your head and asking, “Why do we have scientists at all? Why pay for people to sit around and think? Why spend money on people who run experiments when most of those experiments fail? Can’t we replace them with AI?”</p>
<p>The output of this university-industry-government science partnership became the foundation of Silicon Valley, the aerospace sector, the biotechnology industry, Quantum and AI. These investments gave us rockets, cures for cancer, medical devices, the Internet, Chat GPT, AI and more.</p>
<p>Investment in science is directly correlated with national power. Weaken science, you weaken the long-term growth of the economy, and national defense.</p>
<p>Tech firms’&nbsp;investments of $100s of billions in AI data centers is greater than the federal government’s R&amp;D expenditures. <em>But these investments are in <u>engineering</u> not in science</em>. The goal of making scientists redundant using artificial general intelligence misses the point that AI will (and is) making scientists more <em>productive – not replacing them.</em></p>
<p>Countries that neglect science become dependent on those that don’t. U.S. post-WWII dominance came from <em>basic science investments</em> (OSRD, NSF, NIH, DOE labs). After WWII ended, the UK slashed science investment which allowed the U.S. to commercialize the British inventions made during the war.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union’s collapse partly reflected failure to convert science into sustained innovation, during the same time that U.S. universities, startups and venture capital created Silicon Valley. Long-term military and economic advantage (nuclear weapons, GPS, AI) trace back to scientific research ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Scientists</em> come in two categories
<ul>
<li>Theorists and experimentalists</li>
<li>Two types of experimentalists; Basic science (learn new things) or applied science (practical applications of the science)</li>
<li>Scientists train talent, create patentable inventions and solutions for national defense</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Engineers</em> design and <em>build things on top of the discoveries of scientists</em></li>
<li><em>Entrepreneurs</em> test and push the boundaries of what products could be built</li>
<li><em>Venture Capital</em> provides the money to startups</li>
<li>Scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs – these roles are complementary
<ul>
<li>Remove one and the system degrades</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Science won’t stop
<ul>
<li>Cut U.S. funding, then science will happen in other countries that understand its relationship to making a nation great – like China.</li>
<li>National power is derived from investments in Science</li>
<li>Reducing investment in basic and applied science makes America weak</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Appendix – How Does Science Work? – The Scientific Method</strong><br>
Whether you were a theorist or experimentalist, for the last 500 years the way to test science was by using <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/intro-to-biology/science-of-biology/a/the-science-of-biology">the scientific method.</a> This method starts by a scientist wondering and asking, “Here’s how I think this should work, let’s test the idea.”</p>
<p>The goal of the scientific method is to turn a guess (in science called a hypothesis) into actual evidence. Scientists do this by first designing an experiment to test their guess/hypothesis. They then run the experiment and collect and analyze the result and ask, “Did the result validate, invalidate the hypothesis? Or did it give us completely new ideas?” Scientists build instruments and run experiments not because of what they know, but because of what they don’t know.</p>

<p>These experiments can be simple ones costing thousands of dollars that can be run in a university biology lab while others may require billions of dollars to build a satellite, particle accelerator or telescope. (The U.S. took the lead in Science after WWII when the government realized that funding scientists was good for the American economy and defense.)</p>
<p>Good science is reproducible. Scientists just don’t publish their results, but they also publish the details of how they ran their experiment. That allows other scientists to run the same experiment and see if they get the same result for themselves. That makes the scientific method self-correcting (you or others can see mistakes).</p>
<p>One other benefit of the scientific method is that scientists (and the people who fund them) expect most of the experiments to fail, but the failures are part of learning and discovery. They teach us what works and what doesn’t. Failure in science testing unknowns means learning and discovery.</p>

<i>
One of the most consequential moments in California's drive to beat back climate change will take place next month. The state will stop receiving electricity from the Intermountain Power Plant in Central Utah, meaning our reliance on coal as a source of power will essentially be over...<p> 

[T]he U.S. got nearly half its electricity from coal-fired plants <a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2025-10-02/boiling-point-california-quitting-coal">as recently as 2007</a>. By 2023, that figure had dropped to just 16.2%. California drove an even more dramatic shift, getting just 2.2% of its electricity from coal in 2024 — nearly all of it from the Intermountain plant.  Operators plan to cut off that final burst of ions next month. </p></i> <br>
"And with improved technology to store power, the change has been made without the power shortages that dogged the state up until 2020..."5<br>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">


<center>By Steve Baker</center>
What stops most novice graphics programmers from getting friendly with matrices
is that they look like 16 utterly random numbers. However,
a little mental picture that I have seems to help most people
to make sense of what's going on. Most programmers are visual
thinkers and don't take kindly to piles of abstract math.
<p>
Take an OpenGL matrix:
</p><pre>
  float m [ 16 ] ;

</pre>
Consider this as a 4x4 array with it's elements laid out into
four columns like this:
<pre>
   m[0]  m[4]  m[ 8]  m[12]
   m[1]  m[5]  m[ 9]  m[13]
   m[2]  m[6]  m[10]  m[14]
   m[3]  m[7]  m[11]  m[15]

</pre>
<b>
WARNING: Mathematicians like to see their matrices laid out on paper
this way (with the array indices increasing down the columns instead
of across the rows as a programmer would usually write them).
Look CAREFULLY at the order of the matrix elements in the layout above!
</b>
<p>
...but we are OpenGL programmers - not mathematicians - right?! The
reason OpenGL arrays are laid out in what some people would consider
to be the opposite direction to mathematical convention is somewhat
lost in the mists of time. However, it turns out to be a happy accident
as we will see later.
</p><p>
If you are dealing with a matrix which only deals with rigid
bodies (ie no scale, shear, squash, etc) then the last row
(array elements 3,7,11 and 15) are always 0,0,0 and 1 respectively
and so long as they always maintain those values, we can safely forget
about them for now.
</p><p>
The first three elements of the rightmost column of the matrix is
just the overall translation. If you imagine some kind of neat
little compact object (like a teapot), then array elements 12,13 and 14
tell you where it is in the world. It doesn't matter what combinations
of rotations and translations it took to produce the matrix, the
rightmost column tells you where the object basically is.  It is
often fortunate that the OpenGL matrix array is laid out the way it
is because it results in those three elements being consecutive in
memory.
</p><p>
OK, so now we are down to only nine random-looking numbers. These
are the top three elements of each of the first three columns - and
collectively they represent the rotation of the object.
</p><p>
The easy way to decode those numbers is to imagine what happens
to four points near to the origin after they are transformed by the
matrix:
</p><pre>
   (0,1,0)
        |  /(0,0,1)
        | /
        |/___(1,0,0)
   (0,0,0)

</pre>
These are four vertices on a 1x1x1 cube that has one corner
at the origin.
<p>
After the matrix has transformed this cube, where does it end up?
</p><p>
Well, if we neglect the translation part (the bottom row),
then the pure rotation part simply describes the new location
of the points on the cube:
</p><pre>
    (1,0,0)  ---&gt;  ( m[0], m[1], m[2] )
    (0,1,0)  ---&gt;  ( m[4], m[5], m[6] )
    (0,0,1)  ---&gt;  ( m[8], m[9], m[10])
    (0,0,0)  ---&gt;  ( 0, 0, 0 )

</pre>
<strong>After</strong> that, you just add the translation onto each point
so that:
<pre>
    (1,0,0)  ---&gt;  ( m[0], m[1], m[2] ) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] )
    (0,1,0)  ---&gt;  ( m[4], m[5], m[6] ) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] )
    (0,0,1)  ---&gt;  ( m[8], m[9], m[10]) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] )
    (0,0,0)  ---&gt;  ( 0, 0, 0 ) + ( m[12], m[13], m[14] )

</pre>
Once you know this, it becomes quite easy to use matrices
to position objects exactly where you need them without
messing around with multiple calls to glRotate.
<p>
Just imagine a little cube at the origin - pretend it's
firmly attached to your model. Think about where the
cube ends up as the model moves - write down where
it's vertices would end up and there is your matrix.
</p><p>
So, if I gave you this matrix:
</p><pre>
   0.707, -0.707, 0, 10
   0.707,  0.707, 0, 10
   0    ,  0    , 1,  0
   0    ,  0    , 0,  1

</pre>
...you could <strong>easily</strong> see that the X axis of that little
cube is now pointing somewhere between the X and Y axes,
the Y axis is pointing somewhere between Y and negative X
and the Z axis is unchanged. The entire cube has been moved
10 units off in X and Y. This is a
45 degree rotation about Z and a 10,10,0 translation!
You didn't need any hard math - just a mental picture
of what the little cube did - and no concerns about the
order of operations or anything hard like that. What
would have happened to something out at 100,100,0? Well,
just imagine it was glued to the cube (on the end of a
long stick)...as the cube rotated, the thing at 100,100
would have moved quite a bit too - in fact, you can see
that the rotation would put it onto the Y axis and the
translation would have moved it 10 units up and to the
right.
<p>
With practice, you can figure out what that last row of
numbers does to the little cube too.
</p><p>
So, would you like to know how to use a matrix to squash,
stretch, shear, etc? Just think about where
the axes of that little cube end up - write them down and
you are done. What does a cube of jello look like when
there is a strong wind blowing from X=-infinity?
</p><pre>
  1, 0.3, 0, 0
  0, 0.9, 0, 0
  0, 0  , 1, 0
  0, 0  , 0, 1

</pre>
Look - the Y axis is leaning a third of a unit to the
right and the cube got a bit shorter.
<p>
Suppose your cartoon character is going to jump vertically,
and you want to do a bit of pre-squash before the jump...
and post-stretch during the jump. Just gradually vary the
matrix from:
</p><pre>
  1  , 0  , 0, 0         1  , 0  , 0, 0
  0  , 0.8, 0, 0         0  , 1.2, 0, 0
  0  , 0  , 1, 0   ===&gt;  0  , 0  , 1, 0
  0  , 0  , 0, 1         0  , 0  , 0, 1

</pre>
Not bad - he got shorter then longer - how about getting
a bit fatter too (conservation of cartoon volume) ?
<pre>
  1.2, 0  , 0  , 0      0.9,0  , 0 , 0
  0  , 0.8, 0  , 0      0  ,1.2, 0 , 0
  0  , 0  , 1.2, 0 ===&gt; 0  ,0  ,0.9, 0
  0  , 0  , 0  , 1      0  ,0  , 0 , 1

</pre>
Now the cube got smaller in Y and bigger in X and Z then
got bigger in Y and smaller in X/Z...easy!
<p>
Not only is it easier to think transforms out this way,
but it's invariably more efficient too. By seeing the
entire transformation as one whole operation on a unit
cube, you save a long sequence of glRotate/glTranslate/glScale
commands - which each imply a complicated set of multiply/add
steps to concatenate the new transform with whatever is
on the top of the stack.
</p><p>
Finally, there is one matrix that we all need to know - the "Identity"
matrix:
</p><pre>
  1, 0, 0, 0
  0, 1, 0, 0
  0, 0, 1, 0
  0, 0, 0, 1

</pre>
As you can see, this matrix leaves all the axes completely alone and
performs no translation. This is a "do nothing" matrix.
<p>
Matrices are really easy - it's just a matter of looking at
them pictorially.

            <p>Last week, Jake Stid, a postdoctoral research associate at Michigan State University, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jake-stid-38bb23131_solars-footprint-is-central-to-discussions-activity-7378531783019167744-CIlL/">announced</a> Ground-Mounted Solar Energy in the United States (GM-SEUS). This is a 15K-array, 2.9M-panel dataset of utility and commercial-grade solar farms across the lower 48 states plus the District of Columbia. This dataset was constructed by a team of researchers including alumni from NOAA, NASA and the USGS.</p>
<p>Below is a heatmap of the assets catalogued in this dataset.</p>

</a></p><p>In this post, I'll explore GM-SEUS's Solar Farm dataset.</p>
<div id="my-workstation">
<h2>My Workstation</h2>
<p>I'm using a 5.7 GHz AMD Ryzen 9 9950X CPU. It has 16 cores and 32 threads and 1.2 MB of L1, 16 MB of L2 and 64 MB of L3 cache. It has a liquid cooler attached and is housed in a spacious, full-sized Cooler Master HAF 700 computer case.</p>
<p>The system has 96 GB of DDR5 RAM clocked at 4,800 MT/s and a 5th-generation, Crucial T700 4 TB NVMe M.2 SSD which can read at speeds up to 12,400 MB/s. There is a heatsink on the SSD to help keep its temperature down. This is my system's C drive.</p>
<p>The system is powered by a 1,200-watt, fully modular Corsair Power Supply and is sat on an ASRock X870E Nova 90 Motherboard.</p>
<p>I'm running Ubuntu 24 LTS via Microsoft's Ubuntu for Windows on Windows 11 Pro. In case you're wondering why I don't run a Linux-based desktop as my primary work environment, I'm still using an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU which has better driver support on Windows and ArcGIS Pro only supports Windows natively.</p>

<p>The maps in this post were mostly rendered with <a href="https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html">QGIS</a> version 3.44. QGIS is a desktop application that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. The application has grown in popularity in recent years and has ~15M application launches from users all around the world each month.</p>
<p>I used QGIS' <a href="https://github.com/marklit/tile_plus">Tile+ plugin</a> to add basemaps from Esri to the maps in this post.</p>

<p>I'll use DuckDB to clean up the values and produce both a geometry field and a bounding box for each feature in this dataset. This will make working with this dataset remotely, such as from AWS S3, much easier.</p>

<p>This following produced a ZStandard-compressed, spatially-sorted Parquet file of the arrays dataset. I dropped the Z dimension as it was unused. The unknown values have been turned into NULLs. The original GPKG file was 108 MB and the resulting Parquet file is 37 MB.</p>

</a></p><p>Normally I would produce a Parquet file as even with 10s of thousands of records it'll generate in seconds versus a minute or so with GPKG. But ArcGIS Pro 3.5 didn't want to open the Parquet file I generated. QGIS 3.44 was fine with it but I wanted to use Esri's Nova basemap for the rendering below.</p>
<p>ArcGIS Pro 3.6 should be released sometime in the next few weeks so I'll re-examine this issue when it's out.</p>
<p>Below is the relationship between the sources of data and the installation year.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content"> <main> <h2 id="introduction"> <a href="#introduction" aria-labelledby="introduction"></a> Introduction </h2> <p>Multipath TCP or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_TCP">MPTCP</a> is an extension to the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a> and is described in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8684.html">RFC 8684</a>. It allows a device to make use of multiple interfaces at once to send and receive TCP packets over a single MPTCP connection. MPTCP can aggregate the bandwidth of multiple interfaces or prefer the one with the lowest latency. It also allows a fail-over if one path is down, and the traffic is seamlessly reinjected on other paths.</p><pre><code>graph TD;

</code></pre><h3 id="use-cases"> <a href="#use-cases" aria-labelledby="use-cases"></a> Use cases </h3> <p>Thanks to MPTCP, being able to use multiple paths in parallel or simultaneously brings new use-cases, compared to TCP:</p> <ul> <li>Seamless handovers: switching from one path to another while preserving established connections, e.g. Apple is using Multipath TCP on smartphones mainly for this reason since 2013.</li> <li>Best network selection: using the “best” available path depending on some conditions, e.g. latency, losses, cost, bandwidth, etc.</li> <li>Network aggregation: using multiple paths at the same time to have a higher throughput, e.g. to combine fixed and mobile networks to send files faster.</li> </ul> <h2 id="concepts"> <a href="#concepts" aria-labelledby="concepts"></a> Concepts </h2> <p>Technically, when a new socket is created with the <code>IPPROTO_MPTCP</code> protocol (Linux-specific), a <em>subflow</em> (or <em>path</em>) is created. This <em>subflow</em> consists of a regular TCP connection that is used to transmit data through one interface. Additional <em>subflows</em> can be negotiated later between the hosts. For the remote host to be able to detect the use of MPTCP, a new field is added to the TCP <em>option</em> field of the underlying TCP <em>subflow</em>. This field contains, amongst other things, a <code>MP_CAPABLE</code> option that tells the other host to use MPTCP if it is supported. If the remote host or any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middlebox">middlebox</a> in between does not support it, the returned <code>SYN+ACK</code> packet will not contain MPTCP options in the TCP <em>option</em> field. In that case, the connection will be “downgraded” to plain TCP, and it will continue with a single path.</p> <p>This behavior is made possible by two internal components: the path manager, and the packet scheduler.</p> <h3 id="path-manager"> <a href="#path-manager" aria-labelledby="path-manager"></a> Path Manager </h3> <p>The <a href="https://www.mptcp.dev/pm.html">Path Manager</a> is in charge of <em>subflows</em>, from creation to deletion, and also address announcements. Typically, it is the client side that initiates subflows, and the server side that announces additional addresses via the <code>ADD_ADDR</code> and <code>REMOVE_ADDR</code> options.</p><pre><code>graph LR;

<p>Project documentation: <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">pdfly.readthedocs.io</a></p>
<p><code>pdfly</code> is the youngest project of the <a href="https://py-pdf.github.io/"><code>py-pdf</code></a> organization.
It has been created by <a href="https://github.com/martinthoma">Martin Thoma</a> in 2022.</p>
<p>It's simply <strong>a CLI tool to manipulate PDF files</strong>, written in Python and based on the <a href="https://py-pdf.github.io/fpdf2/">fpdf2</a> &amp; <a href="https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pypdf</a> libraries.</p>
<p>I'm a maintainer of the project 🙂</p>
<h2>What can it do?</h2>
<p>It has meany features, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>display PDF metadata</strong> using <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-meta.html"><code>pdfly meta</code></a> and <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-pagemeta.html"><code>pdfly pagemeta</code></a> commands.
Example:</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pdfly</code> can also combine files into new PDF documents: it can <strong>extract specific pages &amp; merge documents</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-cat.html"><code>pdfly cat</code></a>); selectively <strong>remove pages</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-rm.html"><code>pdfly rm</code></a>); <strong>convert images to PDF documents</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-x2pdf.html"><code>pdfly x2pdf</code></a>); and even <strong>compress documents</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-compress.html"><code>pdfly compress</code></a>) or <strong>build booklets</strong> (<a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-2-up.html"><code>pdfly 2-up</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-booklet.html"><code>pdfly booklet</code></a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pdfly</code> includes some commands to <strong>pull out specific content from PDF files</strong>: <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-extract-images.html"><code>pdfly extract-images</code></a> &amp; <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-extract-text.html"><code>pdfly extract-annotated-text</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes you want to edit a PDF file manually, in a text editor.
But when you do so, you break its <code>xref</code> table, that is an index of byte offsets in the document. <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-update-offsets.html"><code>pdfly update-offsets</code></a> is there to save the day, <strong>fixing manually-edited PDF documents</strong>, so that they can be opened in a PDF viewer again!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Release 0.5.0 &amp; new features</h2>
<p>Today we released a new version: <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/releases/tag/0.5.0"><code>pdfly release 0.5.0</code></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to several contributors, including developers taking part in <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>, new exciting features have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-sign.html"><code>pdfly sign</code></a> allows you to <strong>easily sign PDF documents</strong>, while <a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-sign.html"><code>pdfly check-sign</code></a> makes it easy to check a PDF document signature. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/moormaster">@moormaster</a> for implementing this in PRs <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/165">#165</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/166">#166</a> 👍🙏.</li>
<li><a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-extract-annotated-pages.html"><code>pdfly extract-annotated-pages</code></a> <strong>extract only annotated pages</strong> from a PDF, hence helping to review or rework pages from a large document iteratively. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/hwine">Hal Wine (@hwine)</a> for implementing this in PR <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/128">#128</a> 👍🙏.</li>
<li><a href="https://pdfly.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/subcommand-rotate.html"><code>pdfly rotate</code></a> <strong>rotate specific pages</strong> of a document. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wolfram77">Subhajit Sahu (@wolfram77)</a> for implementing this in PR <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/pull/98">#98</a> 👍🙏.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>We have a bunch of feature ideas: <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aup-for-grabs"><code>up-for-grabs</code> issues</a>, including some <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22"><code>good first issues</code></a> aimed specially at <strong>new contributors</strong>, that are willing to help but new to open-source.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the <code>pdfly sign</code> &amp; <code>check-sign</code> could become handy to many end-users, and I think we should continue to extend those commands usage options, as described in <a href="https://github.com/py-pdf/pdfly/issues/71">issue #71</a>.</p>
<p>We would also be happy to get your feedbacks, bug reports &amp; feature suggestions! 🙂</p>
