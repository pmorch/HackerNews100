<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
              <p>As WebAssembly support has been developed by the Swift community and significantly improved over the years, I would like to put up a pitch for a vision describing WebAssembly support in Swift. Your feedback would be highly appreciated! Full vision text is included below, while <a href="https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/pull/2590">the corresponding PR is also available on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="p-362448-introduction-1" href="#p-362448-introduction-1"></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>WebAssembly (abbreviated <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/intro/introduction.html#wasm">Wasm</a>) is a virtual machine instruction set focused on portability, security, and high performance. It is vendor-neutral, designed and developed by <a href="https://w3.org/">W3C</a>. An implementation of a WebAssembly virtual machine is usually called a <strong>WebAssembly runtime</strong>.</p>
<p>One prominent spec-compliant implementation of a Wasm runtime in Swift is <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit">WasmKit</a>. It is available as a Swift package, supports multiple host platforms, and has a simple API for interaction with guest Wasm modules.</p>
<p>An application compiled to a Wasm module can run on any platform that has a Wasm runtime available. Despite its origins in the browser, it is a general-purpose technology that has use cases in client-side and server-side applications and services. WebAssembly support in Swift makes the language more appealing in those settings, and also brings it to the browser where it previously wasn't available at all<sup><a href="#footnote-362448-1" id="footnote-ref-362448-1">[1]</a></sup>. It facilitates a broader adoption of Swift in more environments and contexts.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly instruction set has useful properties from a security perspective, as it has no interrupts or peripheral access instructions. Access to the underlying system is always done by calling explicitly imported functions, implementations for which are provided by an imported WebAssembly module or a WebAssembly runtime itself. The runtime has full control over interactions of the virtual machine with the outside world.</p>
<p>WebAssembly code and data live in completely separate address spaces, with all executable code in a given module loaded and validated by the runtime upfront. Combined with the lack of "jump to address" and a limited set of control flow instructions that require explicit labels in the same function body, this makes a certain class of attacks impossible to execute in a correctly implemented spec-compliant WebAssembly runtime.</p>
<h3><a name="p-362448-webassembly-system-interface-and-the-component-model-2" href="#p-362448-webassembly-system-interface-and-the-component-model-2"></a>WebAssembly System Interface and the Component Model</h3>
<p>The WebAssembly virtual machine has no in-built support for I/O; instead, a Wasm module's access to I/O is dependent entirely upon the runtime that executes it.</p>
<p>A standardized set of APIs implemented by a Wasm runtime for interaction with the host operating system is called <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a>. <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc">WASI libc</a> is a layer on top of WASI that Swift apps compiled to Wasm can already use thanks to C interop. The current implementation of Swift stdlib and runtime for <code>wasm32-unknown-wasi</code> triple is based on this C library. It is important for WASI support in Swift to be as complete as possible to ensure portability of Swift code in the broader Wasm ecosystem.</p>
<p>In the last few years, the W3C WebAssembly Working Group considered multiple proposals for improving the WebAssembly <a href="https://github.com/webassembly/interface-types">type system</a> and <a href="https://github.com/webassembly/module-linking">module linking</a>. These were later subsumed into a combined <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">Component Model</a> proposal thanks to the ongoing work on <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/wasip2/README.md">WASI Preview 2</a>, which served as playground for the new design.</p>
<p>The Component Model defines these core concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>component</strong> is a composable container for one or more WebAssembly modules that have a predefined interface;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WebAssembly Interface Types (WIT) language</strong> allows defining contracts between components;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Canonical ABI</strong> is an ABI for types defined by WIT and used by component interfaces in the Component Model.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Preliminary support for WIT has been implemented in <a href="https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit/blob/0.0.3/Sources/WITTool/WITTool.swift">the <code>wit-tool</code> subcommand</a> of the WasmKit CLI. Users of this tool can generate <code>.wit</code> files from Swift declarations, and vice versa: Swift bindings from <code>.wit</code> files.</p>
<h2><a name="p-362448-use-cases-3" href="#p-362448-use-cases-3"></a>Use Cases</h2>
<p>We can't anticipate every possible application Swift developers are going to create with Wasm, but we can provide a few examples of its possible adoption in the Swift toolchain itself. To quote <a href="https://www.swift.org/gsoc2024/#building-swift-macros-with-webassembly">a GSoC 2024 idea</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WebAssembly could provide a way to build Swift macros into binaries that can be distributed and run anywhere, eliminating the need to rebuild them continually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can be applicable not only to Swift macros, but also for the evaluation of SwiftPM manifests and plugins.</p>
<p>In the context of Swift developer tools, arbitrary code execution during build time can be virtualized with Wasm. While Swift macros, SwiftPM manifests, and plugins are sandboxed on Darwin platforms, with Wasm we can provide stronger security guarantees on other platforms that have a compatible Wasm runtime available.</p>
<p>The WebAssembly instruction set is designed with performance in mind. A WebAssembly module can be JIT-compiled or compiled on a client machine to an optimized native binary ahead of time. With recently accepted proposals to the Wasm specification it now supports features such as SIMD, atomics, multi-threading, and more. A WebAssembly runtime can generate a restricted subset of native binary code that implements these features with little performance overhead.</p>
<p>Adoption of Wasm in developer tools does not imply unavoidable performance overhead. With security guarantees that virtualization brings, there's no longer a need to spawn a separate process for each Swift compiler and SwiftPM plugin/manifest invocation. Virtualized Wasm binaries can run in the host process of a Wasm runtime, removing the overhead of new process setup and IPC infrastructure.</p>
<h2><a name="p-362448-goals-4" href="#p-362448-goals-4"></a>Goals</h2>
<p>As of March 2024 all patches necessary for basic Wasm and WASI Preview 1 support have been merged to the Swift toolchain and core libraries. Based on this, we propose a high-level roadmap for WebAssembly support and adoption in the Swift ecosystem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make it easier to evaluate and adopt Wasm with increased API coverage for this platform in the Swift core libraries. Main prerequisite for that is setting up CI jobs for those libraries that run tests for WASI and also Embedded Wasm, where possible. As a virtualized embeddable platform, not all system APIs are always available or easy to port to WASI. For example, multi-threading, file system access, networking and localization need special support in Wasm runtimes and a certain amount of consideration from a developer adopting these APIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve support for cross-compilation in Swift and SwiftPM. We can simplify versioning, installation, and overall management of Swift SDKs for cross-compilation in general, which is beneficial not only for WebAssembly, but for all platforms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continue work on Wasm Component Model support in Swift as the Component Model proposal is stabilized. Ensure that future versions of WASI are available to Swift developers targeting Wasm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make interoperability with Wasm components as smooth as C and C++ interop already is for Swift. With a formal specification for Canonical ABI progressing, this will become more achievable with time. This includes consuming components from, and building components with Swift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve debugging experience of Swift code compiled to Wasm. While rudimentary support for debugging exists in some Wasm runtimes, we aim to improve it and, where possible, make it as good as debugging Swift code compiled to other platforms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><a name="p-362448-proposed-language-features-5" href="#p-362448-proposed-language-features-5"></a>Proposed Language Features</h3>
<p>In our work on Wasm support in Swift, we experimented with a few function attributes that could be considered as pitches and eventually Swift Evolution proposals, if the community is interested in their wider adoption. These attributes allow easier interoperation between Swift code and other Wasm modules linked with it by a Wasm runtime.</p>
<h2><a name="p-362448-platform-specific-considerations-6" href="#p-362448-platform-specific-considerations-6"></a>Platform-specific Considerations</h2>
<h3><a name="p-362448-debugging-7" href="#p-362448-debugging-7"></a>Debugging</h3>
<p>Debugging Wasm modules is challenging because Wasm does not expose ways to introspect and control the execution of a Wasm module instance, so a debugger cannot be built on top of Wasm itself. Special support from the Wasm execution engine is necessary for debugging.</p>
<p>The current state of debugging tools in the Wasm ecosystem is not as mature as other platforms, but there are two main directions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/77949">LLDB debugger with Wasm runtime</a> supporting GDB Remote Serial Protocol;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://book.swiftwasm.org/getting-started/debugging.html#enhanced-dwarf-extension-for-swift">Wasm runtime with a built-in debugger</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first approach provides an almost equivalent experience to existing debugging workflows on other platforms. It can utilize LLDB's Swift support, remote metadata inspection, and serialized Swift module information. However, since Wasm is a Harvard architecture and has no way to allocate executable memory space at runtime, implementing expression evaluation with JIT in user space is challenging. In other words, GDB stub in Wasm engines need tricky implementations or need to extend the GDB Remote Serial Protocol.</p>
<p>The second approach embeds the debugger within the Wasm engine. In scenarios where the Wasm engine is embedded as a guest in another host engine (e.g. within a Web Browser), this approach allows seamless debugging experiences with the host language by integrating with the host debugger. For example, in cases where JavaScript and Wasm call frames are interleaved, the debugger works well in both contexts without switching tools. Debugging tools like Chrome DevTools can use DWARF information embedded in Wasm file to provide debugging support. However, supporting Swift-specific metadata information and JIT-based expression evaluation will require integrating LLDB's Swift plugin with these debuggers in some way.</p>
<p>In summary, debugging in the browser and outside of the browser context are sufficiently different activities to require separate implementation approaches.</p>
<h3><a name="p-362448-multi-threading-and-concurrency-8" href="#p-362448-multi-threading-and-concurrency-8"></a>Multi-threading and Concurrency</h3>
<p>WebAssembly has <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/threads">atomic operations in the instruction set</a> (only sequential consistency is supported), but it does not have a built-in way to create threads. Instead, it relies on the host environment to provide multi-threading support. This means that multi-threading in Wasm is dependent on the Wasm runtime that executes a module. There are two proposals to standardize ways to create threads in Wasm:</p>
<p>(1) <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-threads">wasi-threads</a>, which is already supported by some toolchains, runtimes, and libraries but has been superseded;</p>
<p>(2) The new <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads">shared-everything-threads</a> proposal is still in the early stages, but is expected to be the future of multi-threading in Wasm.</p>
<p>Swift currently supports two threading models in Wasm: single-threaded (<code>wasm32-unknown-wasi</code>) and multi-threaded using wasi-threads (<code>wasm32-unknown-wasip1-threads</code>). Despite the latter supporting multi-threading, Swift Concurrency defaults to a cooperative single-threaded executor due to the lack of wasi-threads support in libdispatch. Preparing for the shared-everything-threads proposal is crucial to ensure that Swift Concurrency can adapt to future multi-threading standards in Wasm.</p>
<h3><a name="p-362448-h-64-bit-address-space-9" href="#p-362448-h-64-bit-address-space-9"></a>64-bit address space</h3>
<p>WebAssembly currently uses a 32-bit address space, but <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64/">64-bit address space</a> proposal is already in the implementation phase.</p>
<p>Swift supports 64-bit pointers on other platforms where available, however WebAssembly is the first platform where relative reference from data to code is not allowed. Alternative solutions like image-base relative addressing or "small code model" for fitting 64-bit pointer in 32-bit are unavailable, at least for now. This means that we need cooperation from the WebAssembly toolchain side or different memory layout in Swift metadata to support 64-bit linear memory support in WebAssembly.</p>
<h3><a name="p-362448-shared-libraries-10" href="#p-362448-shared-libraries-10"></a>Shared libraries</h3>
<p>There are two approaches to using shared libraries in the WebAssembly ecosystem:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Dynamic-Linking.html">Emscripten-style dynamic linking</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/Linking.md">Component Model-based "ahead-of-time" linking</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Emscripten-style dynamic linking is a traditional way to use shared libraries in WebAssembly, where the host environment provides non-standard dynamic loading capabilities.</p>
<p>The latter approach cannot fully replace the former, as it is unable to handle dynamic loading of shared libraries at runtime, but it is more portable way to distribute programs linked with shared libraries, as it does not require the host environment to provide any special capabilities except for Component Model support.</p>
<p>Support for shared libraries in Swift means ensuring that Swift programs can be compiled in position-independent code mode and linked with shared libraries by following the corresponding dynamic linking ABI.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Start of the journey</h2>
<p>We started our journey with iOS emulation by looking at existing open-source solutions. We had successfully run <a href="https://github.com/alephsecurity/xnu-qemu-arm64">alephsecurity/xnu-qemu-arm64</a> before, but the project being read-only was concerning.</p>
<p>Then we tried <a href="https://github.com/TrungNguyen1909/qemu-t8030">TrungNguyen1909/qemu-t8030</a> and it had quite a few interesting features:</p>
<ul>
<li>the ability to actually restore iOS (using a second "companion" QEMU for USB connectivity)</li>
<li>running iOS 14</li>
<li>a more recent version of QEMU</li>
<li>a nice wiki on how to bring up the emulator</li>
</ul>
<p>With that project, we quickly managed to get a shell and ssh by modifying <code>System/Library/xpc/launchd.plist</code> so it was a great starting point.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/image_16_ff7341d07a.png" alt="image (16).png"></p>
<p>We set our long term objective on getting a functional iOS emulated, with UI and at least the ability to execute some apps.</p>
<p>The first thing that bothered us with the <code>t8030</code> project was the fact that they added code in QEMU itself to patch the xnu kernel. We knew we were going to probably need more patching and wanted a cleaner way to do this.
As we had some experience with a jailbroken real iPhone, we looked into using <a href="https://github.com/palera1n/PongoOS">Pongo</a> to apply checkra1n patches, as this would allow us to remove any patching done in QEMU.</p>
<p>In a jailbreaking scenario, after getting pwned by checkmate, PongoOS is injected in SRAM and the checkra1n-kpf module is sent through USB.
Rather than bothering with early USB we chose to increase the SRAM on our emulated phone, and use PongoOS with checkra1n’s KPF module.</p>
<p>Executing PongoOS, first, was not without its issues, any boot code usually done by the bootrom or iboot would be missing, such as setting up the FPU before performing any double/float instructions. Skimming through <a href="https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0527/latest/">ARM documentation (section 5.4)</a> and a some <a href="https://github.com/citruz/pongoOS-QEMU/commit/033413bfaa6ebc4e1b8680b7548a3505fabe808b#diff-94255394208544c1bce0ef3fc2b955262dc6f5e8ed391005a521f28a0440a042L109-R117">Googling</a> helped.</p>
<p>Features introduced with A13 and later devices, not supported by Pongo, broke the pattern-matching of some patches. For example Pointer Authentication (PAC) instructions added <code>autda</code> / <code>xpacd</code> and Apple used a different slide.</p>
<p>Example with the infamous <a href="https://theapplewiki.com/wiki/Tfp0_patch">task_for_pid (tfp0)</a></p>

<p>Pongo allowed us to get access to existing checkra1n patches for multiple iOS versions, and although the dynamic application was interesting, it wasn't easy to read, modify or share. We wanted a more declarative approach, just like actual code patches.</p>
<p>So we made tools allowing us to diff between two <code>Mach-O</code>, and generate a text patch file with the assembly differences. The other program would take this patch file and simply apply to a binary.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/Screenshot_20250224_174126_cde0ed3bb5.png" alt="Screenshot_20250224_174126.png"></p>

<p>We then booted with Pongo, and used QEMU monitor to dump the memory sections patched by Pongo, then reassembled a patched kernel and finally generated a patch file with all the modifications.
The big patch was then split and commented properly, allowing us to review and control exactly what was patched in the kernel.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed_e4a4ff90f0.png" alt="unnamed.png"></p>

<h2>It’s dark in there</h2>
<p>We knew that on modern iPhones every graphical rendering ends up going through their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal"><code>Metal</code></a> API, which then needs an actual GPU. We believed emulating the Apple Silicon GPU would be way too complex and so we had two solutions in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use software rendering: it seemed it was possible in older versions of iOS (using the gpu=0 bootarg)</li>
<li>Forwarding the Metal calls to a device capable of doing the rendering such as real iPhone or maybe a Mac with OSX</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/graphic_architecture_8d6484c452.png" alt="graphic_architecture.png"></p>

<p>The software rendering seemed much easier, so we first looked into that. Unfortunately, the <code>XNU</code> kernel bootarg option was gone in iOS 14. After looking at the <code>QuartzCore</code> framework with Ghidra it seemed that the software rendering would only be called as a fallback if no <code>Metal</code> renderer was available.</p>
<p>In order to confirm that software rendering was indeed usable we worked on a real jailbroken iPhone, and patched <code>Quartzcore</code> to use software rendering. And indeed we confirmed it was possible! With these modifications, the UI was much slower, and had artifacts on parts which probably directly required <code>Metal</code> for rendering.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/iphonex_sw_rendering_fae74d73b1.png" alt="iphonex_sw_rendering.png"></p>

<p>After these experiments, we knew we could get software rendering on QEMU, for anything not using <code>Metal</code> or <code>OpenGL</code> directly (so basically all <code>UIKit</code> apps).</p>
<p>We also explored the alternative of proxying the metal calls, working with 2 physical iPhones. What we did was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parse all iOS headers with LLVM</li>
<li>All pointers to objective C object on the server is a stub pointer on the client</li>
<li>Generate automatic code to exchange structs and pointers</li>
<li>Hook all functions and methods</li>
<li>Forward every call to a server, executing them and returning the result</li>
</ul>
<p>We got some basic calls to go back and forth for Metal initialization, but we realized the road was still very long to get something to actually work. The Objetive C language and the <code>Metal</code> API are quite complex and have many features making this endeavor very complex.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/metal_hook_da83384ee9.png" alt="metal_hook.png"></p>

<p>We ended up postponing this solution for a later time and thought starting with software rendering, even though it’s more restrictive, would help us advance with other problems faster.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we found out, iOS frameworks actually expose private APIs not present in the public headers. Although there are some ways to parse these and generate headers, they are most of the time not usable directly and complicate things further.</p>

<h2>IOSurface hunting</h2>
<p>After trying to make software rendering work, we decided we still needed at least a framebuffer device and the original t8030 QEMU didn’t implement one. However, we found <a href="https://github.com/ChefKissInc/QEMUAppleSilicon">a fork of the project</a> which was apparently working on IOMFB support, and decided to try debugging the display with it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/image_2_2c83473f84.png" alt="image (2).png"></p>

<p>And indeed while restoring iOS with that version, we could see the Apple logo and progress bar. However on normal boot the display would remain completely black so it was time for debugging!</p>
<p>Looking at the IOMFB kext in Ghidra and the framebuffer implementation in QEMU, it seemed that two modes were possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>A raw framebuffer at fixed hardware address was available (we guessed for early display)</li>
<li>A more complex API using registers to configure multiple planes and using dma to write surfaces data</li>
</ul>
<p>We first started experimenting with the raw framebuffer (which we later found out was how <code>Pongo</code> displayed stuff). Using it, we could display arbitrary ARGB surfaces, but when booting, that framebuffer was never written to by the system.</p>
<p>Therefore, we started looking into the second display mode. By enabling traces in the framebuffer implementation in QEMU, we could see that the kernel would set up graphical planes using registers but then nothing happened.</p>
<p>At this point we needed to debug why nothing was displayed after boot, even though the framebuffer seemed implemented and detected by the kernel.</p>

<h2>Address randomization</h2>
<p>Even though we had SSH access, we quickly got limited on what we could observe on the running system. We needed to be able to debug the kernel and userspace components with GDB.</p>
<p>For the kernel randomization, it was actually set up in the t8030 board initialization and allowed to turn it off entirely, so it was easy enough.</p>
<p>For userland we had two cases, randomization for executables and for dynamic libraries inside the dyld cache. For executables, simply patching the _load_machfile kernel function was enough to disable it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/image_20_ec79b11511.png" alt="image (20).png"></p>

<p>For the dynamic libraries we ended up handling it a bit differently.  The first thing to know is that every library is contained in a big binary blob called the dyld cache (located at <code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.dyld/dyld_shared_cache_arm64e</code>).</p>
<p>All libraries from this cache (called frameworks) are loaded once at boot and then mapped into processes memory space, even though dlopen is called with a path on the filesystem (like <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/QuartzCore</code>).</p>
<p>We noticed that address randomization actually happened only once at boot, and then a library was always loaded by every executable at the same address later on.</p>
<p>So all we had to do was to write some C tool which would dlopen every framework library and then use the <code>_dyld*</code> functions to list the loaded images and get their offset.</p>
<p>Using this solution (and also the reverse process while debugging with addresses coming from GDB), we could easily debug any library from the dyld cache. We were particularly interested with the <code>IOMFB</code> kext, the <code>backboardd</code> and <code>SpringBoard</code> daemons and the <code>QuartzCore</code> framework.</p>

<pre><p><code><span>debugserver localhost:1111 –attach backboardd
</span>iproxy 1111:1111
<!-- -->gdb-multiarch -x "set architecture arch" -x "target remote localhost:1111"
</code></p></pre>
<p><strong>Note2:</strong> we later found out how to disable the dyld  cache by patching the kernel. Doing so allows to get look for virtual address directly in the dyld cache on the host (which we did using the great <a href="https://github.com/gimli-rs/object">object</a> Rust library from the Gimli project).</p>
<p><strong>Note1:</strong> to debug userspace you need to have a gdb server on the guest (see the debugserver package from <a href="https://github.com/ProcursusTeam">Procursus</a> for example). We started using gdb on the host but it’s somehow limited or bugged, and lldb seemed better.</p>

<h2>Please talk to me</h2>
<p>Armed with a working GDB we could see that  <code>backboardd</code> appeared to be starting properly, but we realized system logs would be a great help to know what was or wasn’t happening.</p>
<p>On a real iPhone, you can get the system logs (after pairing with you computer in USB) with the tool <code>idevicesyslog</code>. This pairing process involves the generation of key pair with the private key being stored on the phone. <code>lockdownd</code> uses this to verify the identity of the computer (after the user has authorized it once in the UI).</p>
<p>In our case, although we could interact with the phone through USB, <code>lockdownd</code> would not work properly. After some Ghidra sessions we realized that <code>lockdownd</code> was trying to use the <code>keybag</code> to store the private key, which would require the SEP we are lacking.</p>
<p>In order to go further, we created a shellcode injected in place of some presumably useless existing function. The code reads a pre-generated pair of private/public keys from the filesystem, and basically loads them every time <code>lockdownd</code> tries to get them from the <code>keybag</code>.</p>
<p>After much debugging (and some more patching to simulate the user trusting the computer and the phone being unlocked), we finally got it to work, and could pair with the emulated iPhone from our companion QEMU.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed7_d7cd518551.png" alt="unnamed7.png"></p>
<p>We found out later on you can also use a tool called oslog on the iphone directly to show the logs (didn’t seem to work at the time), although having the ability would give us much more than just the logs afterwards.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed8_a1c58cc9ab.png" alt="unnamed8.png"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the logs revealed that <code>QuartzCore</code> seemed to be initializing properly, detecting the size of the display. It also showed that software rendering was being used as a fallback. So everything was working properly but still no display!</p>
<p>Note:  a single error about pixel format was showing and we worked around it by forcing RGBA (we’ll talk later about patching userspace), although this was removed later on.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed9_675d25af99.png" alt="unnamed9.png"></p>

<h2>PAC or not PAC</h2>
<p>Modifying <code>backboardd</code> to fix a pixel format error showed us we were going to have issues with multiple aspects of iOS security.</p>
<p>The signature check at load and runtime were fixed with kernel patches, however we still had issues with pointer authentication failure interrupting our modified <code>backboardd</code> execution.</p>
<p>Pointer authentication is a feature added with ARM8.3 which is used on the <code>t8030</code> board we were emulating and not on t8015 which we used before, so this was new to us.</p>
<p>Since we had foreseen a lot more patching in the future, we decided to tackle that issue at that moment, and try to find a way to bypass this to make our life easier.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/esr_pac_2e382a4e6a.png" alt="esr_pac.png"></p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/esr_pac_decoded_8ec8ba3ab6.png" alt="esr_pac_decoded.png"></p>
<p>At the time, we first thought we could just replace all the PAC instructions with either NOP or equivalent non PAC instructions.</p>
<p>Although this would have probably worked, it was a bit invasive and we later found out that you can build an ARM64 PAC binary two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either use a dedicated PAC instruction set, which can only be executed on ARM8.3+ CPU</li>
<li>Or an “unused” instruction set which will be interpreted as PAC on ARM8.3+ or non and non PAC equivalent on earlier ARM versions</li>
</ul>
<p>After running some tests with buildroot and an ARM64 linux system, we verified this to be true and also verified that the binaries compiled for our t8030, used the backward compatible instruction set (architecture called arm64e).</p>
<p>So basically, all we had to do was to disable PAC enforcing in QEMU, and it would just run like non PAC code. Unfortunately this didn’t work, and at the time we were using QEMU 7, and found out that QEMU 8 didn’t have the same behavior.</p>
<p>So we did the natural thing, and started porting the current code base to QEMU 8.2.1. This was painful as a lot of code modified QEMU generic code, particularly the code handling the apple specific instructions <code>genter</code>/<code>gexit</code> and the GL exception levels.</p>
<p>After countless xnu panics, gdb attaching to the kernel, gdb attaching to qemu itself, and a desperate git bisect to find our last bug, we finally got iOS booting again on QEMU 8!
And with it, the ability to disable PAC, and modify any executable code, anywhere as we want it.</p>

<h2>The light at the end of the tunnel</h2>
<p>Since <code>backboardd</code> appeared to be working properly in the system logs, we had no choice but to dig further into backboard behavior to try and understand why it still wasn’t displaying anything.</p>
<p>Writing raw ARGB frames on these addresses allowed us to actually modify the display and write on the different graphical planes, so we knew that the display part was actually working properly.</p>
<p>We were left with a few possibilities, either:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>backboardd</code> was not writing anything for some reason</li>
<li>or it wasn’t writing at the proper addresses</li>
<li>or what was written was not valid</li>
</ul>
<p>To investigate, we started by trying to dump physical DMA memory, where <code>backboardd</code> was supposed to write, maybe it was written to but not displayed properly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/Screenshot_20250225_092231_cf2b7f405a.png" alt="Screenshot_20250225_092231.png"></p>

<p>To do this, we used a QEMU monitor to get the non contiguous addresses, and then a crude script to dump the physical memory and merge it all in a single file.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/Screenshot_20250225_092657_bec571344d.png" alt="Screenshot_20250225_092657.png"></p>

<p>Finally using ffplay we tried interpreting that data as an ARGB frame but unfortunately we didn’t get anything interesting.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed10_1e6630e287.png" alt="unnamed10.png"></p>

<p>The second idea was to play with the surfaces allocated by iOS, getting the mapped address in <code>backboardd</code> memory with GDB (by breaking in iosurface_lock).</p>
<p>Searching for all these addresses for some clue, even though we had no idea what was being displayed or if something was even supposed to be displayed. We sometimes found strange things shaped apple an logo, but clearly something was wrong about the way the frames were being written.</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed11_5f113d14b2.png" alt="unnamed11.png"></p>

<p>We did the same thing on a real iPhone 10, and we easily dumped perfect raw ARGB frames of the current display. It turned out that with iPhone 11 (so t8030) and later, surfaces appear to be passed compressed to the GPU which knows how to handle it.</p>
<p>But since this doesn’t happen on iPhone X (t8015), we tried modifying the DTB in the QEMU to pass 8015 as <code>chip-id</code> instead of 8030. And finally, we got some apple logo showing on screen after the boot!</p>
<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed12_7806fbaf2d.png" alt="unnamed12.png"></p>

<h2>Some progress…bar</h2>
<p>At this point, we were happy to finally get a logo displayed but that’s all it did, and the system logs were quite verbose with many system daemons and different libraries we didn’t know about.</p>
<p>All we could do at this point is guess which of the many errors shown in the logs were related to the current issue and fix them one by one until the behavior of the UI changed.</p>
<p>We noticed issues about user authentication and found the errors originated from the daemon <code>mobileactivationd</code> and the framework <code>SpringBoardFoundation</code>.</p>
<p>After patching these, the UI started to display a white progress bar similar to what is shown during the restore phase. The bar seemed to progress indeed but seemed stuck at 90% even after waiting for hours :\</p>

<h2>Patching them all</h2>
<p>Patching the userspace and the framework of the dyld cache was made possible by disabling address randomization. The same way we patched the kernel, we created textual patch files split for each binary / library that we applied with our internal tools.</p>
<p>However, we quickly realized we were going to patch the dyld cache quite often, and while trying modifications it was very painful to handle the 2GB binary file.</p>
<p>Patching it directly was not realistic, we all work on Linux so we cannot modify the nvme directly, and copying the 2GB back and forth through SSH would take forever.</p>
<p>So what we did was to update our internal diffing/patching tool to work with dyld, search the offset of the framework in the dyld cache blob.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we added an option to allow generating simple “dd” commands (and their revert), which can be applied directly on the iPhone (after remounting the fs in rw).</p>
<p>This method allowed us to test many iterations of modifications, and only required a reboot of iOS to have modifications of the dyld cache taken into account.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> a few extra modifications of signature checks in the kernel were necessary for these to work.</p>

<h2>It’s alive!</h2>
<p>Before finding out how to fix the stuck progress bar, we had a little experiment with a system process called <code>PreBoard</code>. It appears to be normally only shown to the user if something goes wrong (like an update interrupting).</p>
<p>Because it’s a system application which draws directly using <code>backboardd</code> (just like <code>SpringBoard</code> would do), it can be started directly from the command line. And with it we get a white screen asking us to swipe to upgrade!</p>

<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed13_35a54c70e0.png" alt="unnamed13.png"></p>

<p>Armed with knowledge of a past project about using a VNC server on a physical iPhone, we tried adding it, and after quite a few failed attempts, managed to actually unlock that white screen (not by swiping but with a keyboard key).</p>
<p>Right after unlocking, QEMU would stop the execution because iOS was apparently using an illegal instruction. After some digging into <code>backboardd</code>, we found out that it uses the <code>vImage</code> framework to do some hardware accelerated graphical operations (like _vHorizontal_Scale_ARGB_8888_Accelerate).</p>
<p>These operations rely on AMX (Apple Matrix Coprocessor) which have a set of proprietary instructions which are not implemented in the emulated ARM CPU running in QEMU. Fortunately, the <code>vImage</code> framework provides alternative software versions for these calls which only use generic ARM instructions, so we did yet again some patching.</p>
<p>The result is a new screen with an actual <code>IOKit</code> window asking us to enter the passcod and working textbox, in which we can type with the VNC injected keyboard events.</p>

<p><img src="https://cms.eshard.com/uploads/unnamed14_9319700bbb.png" alt="unnamed14.png"></p>

<p>At this point we knew everything was ready for <code>SpringBoard</code> to display properly and it was only a matter of time before we got it to start.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    <h2>Why we made this</h2>
  
    <p>We built our own typeface for a few key reasons:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Personalization</strong>: we can customize the fonts to align with our preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Features</strong>: we can integrate advanced typography features tailored to our use cases.</li>
      <li><strong>Sustainability</strong>: the cost of licensing commercial typefaces increases as we grow.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Source Sans was the perfect foundation for Nebula Sans because it shares many primary characteristics with <em>Whitney SSm</em>, our previous brand typeface — both were designed to bridge the gap between American gothic and European humanist typefaces, with a strong emphasis on readability. The majority of the adjustments we made were to adapt the metrics of <em>Source Sans</em> to better match those of <em>Whitney SSm</em>, since <em>Source Sans</em> is smaller and narrower by default.</p>

  <h2>Typographical Details</h2>

  <h3>Punctuation</h3>
  <p>The default punctuation marks in <em>Whitney SSm</em> were, to our taste, too straight. Nebula Sans uses beautiful curly glyphs from <em>Source Sans</em>.</p>

  <h3>Stylistic Alternates</h3>
  <p>Nebula Sans features the same stylistic alternates as <em>Source Sans</em>, with the defaults aligned with those of <em>Whitney SSm</em>.</p>

  <figure role="group">

  <h3>Asterisk</h3>
  <p>In typography, the asterisk symbol was named as such because it resembles a star. We love stars, so how could we not put our own spin on this little glyph?</p>

  </figure>


  <h3>Tabular Figures</h3>
  <p>The default version of <em>Whitney SSm</em> lacks support for tabular lining figures, so we were thrilled to be able to include them in Nebula Sans. Tabular figures (or monospaced numerals) allow us to do things like increment the timestamp in the video player while keeping the digits from jumping around as they change.</p>

        <p><strong>Marca Tatem</strong><em>&nbsp;</em>—&nbsp;San Francisco, April 3rd, 2025</p><p>After years of finding it confusing and unintuitive, I finally gave <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Ableton Live</strong></a> another shot. With <strong>version 12</strong> (current as of this writing), it feels significantly more refined—so much so that it's officially become my DAW of choice.</p><p>When learning a new music production software, recreating a cover track is always a smart move. You don't have to worry too much about the songwriting itself, which frees you up to focus on the tools and the production process.</p><p>For this project, I picked a track that's emblematic of the<strong> French Touch</strong> movement and now nearing its 25th anniversary: <strong>Daft Punk's </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOS9aOIXPEk&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong><em>Something About Us</em></strong></a>. Rebuilding it in a modern production environment turned out to be trickier than I expected, but here's how it went, track by track.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="wait-whats-the-french-touch-anyway">Wait... What's the French Touch, Anyway?</h2><p>To me, <strong>French Touch</strong> isn't just a genre—it's a <em>cultural artifact</em> born from a very specific time and place: France in the late <strong>'70s</strong> and <strong>'80s</strong>. Its distinct sound is the product of a generation raised on <em>analog dreams of the digital future</em>.</p><p>These artists—<strong>Daft Punk</strong>, <strong>Justice</strong>, <strong>Kavinsky</strong>, and others—grew up immersed in a bizarre and colorful media landscape. Japanese TV shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rV2yjpuPjaU&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><em>X-OR</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amrDS3CvrNI&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><em>Sankukai</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROXpxDtKv7o&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><em>Albator 84</em></a> filled French screens with space corsairs, robotic heroes, and mythological remixes set in futuristic worlds. Their themes were packed with synths, arpeggiators, and digitized voices—sounds that now echo, with a grown-up edge, in the textures of <strong>French Touch</strong> music.</p><p>At the same time, France was pushing into the future: science museums, open-air <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRO2EtDQ_nA&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io">electronic concerts by pioneers like <strong>Jean-Michel Jarre</strong></a>, and a sense that the 21st century was just around the corner. Yet beneath that techno-utopian veneer, cities like Paris remained gritty and raw. That tension—between the shiny and the grimy—runs deep in the DNA of <strong>French Touch</strong>. You hear it, especially in the darker, distorted edges of <strong>Justice</strong> and <strong>Kavinsky</strong>.</p><p>Let's also not forget the artists who laid the groundwork long before the <strong>French Touch</strong> became a thing. Quirky French electronic pioneers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gv3wVHiqP9g&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Jacno</strong></a>, the retro-futurist charm of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OpnRuooGfw&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Telex</strong></a> from Belgium, and, of course,<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-HqE1VdPgA&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Giorgio Moroder</strong></a>, the godfather of <strong>Italo Disco</strong>—all contributed textures, tones, and sensibilities that would echo decades later. Even mainstream pop acts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJZ1G0e5bWU&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Lio</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqeJUGzvnq0&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Étienne Daho</strong></a>, or the orchestral-synth hybrids of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4FrnrD7jCA&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Rondo Veneziano</strong></a> were constantly spinning on French FM radio, which in the '80s was a chaotic, genre-blurring space. This eclectic mix quietly wired an entire generation of young listeners with an appetite for melody, groove, and synthetic textures—key ingredients in what would later become <strong>French Touch</strong>.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/outrun.png" alt="" loading="lazy" width="1536" height="1024" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/outrun.png 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/outrun.png 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/outrun.png 1536w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>Outrun never looked as good as in your dreams</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also a certain <em>California dreamin</em>g that runs through much of <strong>French Touch</strong>. The imagery of Los Angeles—<em>endless boulevards flanked by towering palm trees and that golden sunset light</em>—is a romanticized vision of America that influenced the aesthetic, especially in later works. This fusion of European electronic sensibilities with American dream imagery created something uniquely transportive.</p><p>What started as a movement became a signature sound: <em>nostalgic, futuristic, cinematic, dirty, emotional.</em></p><h2 id="why-it-was-so-hard-to-recreate">Why It Was So Hard to Recreate</h2><p>Part of what makes <strong>French Touch</strong> so compelling is also what makes it hard to replicate today. Those<em> lush, imperfect textures</em> weren't just stylistic choices—they were the natural result of a specific time, place, and set of tools. Many of these tracks were recorded in a single take, often in cramped Parisian apartments or modest studios, using vintage analog gear and early digital samplers.</p><p>There's a rawness and spontaneity to that process. The <em>hiss of a dusty synth</em>, the <em>unquantized groove of a looped disco break</em>, the warmth of <em>tape compression</em>—all of it baked into the DNA of those tracks. Today’s high-resolution digital tools are often too clean, too precise. When you remove the imperfections, you also risk scrubbing out the soul.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/124DC7C1-7FAF-427F-9C62-8B637496C697_1_102_a.jpeg 2364w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>The Ableton Live's session</span></figcaption></figure><p>So when I set out to recreate <em>Something About Us</em> using modern software, I knew that recreating this track would be more than just copying notes or layering samples—I’d have to <em>chase a feeling</em>.</p><h2 id="the-keys">The Keys</h2><p>In the original track, the keyboard part is likely played on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wurlitzer_electronic_piano?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Wurlitzer</strong></a><strong> electric piano</strong>—its <em>signature bite and warmth</em> are unmistakable. For my version, I opted for something slightly different: a warmer, more rounded tone using the excellent <a href="https://www.skystudiosplugins.com/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>S.K.Y.&nbsp;Keys plugin</strong></a>, specifically the <em>Everything Right</em> preset. It doesn't try to mimic the original exactly but brings a vibe that fits the song's emotional core.</p><p>I kept the processing minimal: just a gentle midrange boost (mainly to make the part shine a bit more on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smiley_face_curve?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>AirPods</strong></a>), a touch of Ableton's stock <strong>Vinyl Distortion</strong> for added warmth, and <strong>side-chain compression</strong> tied to the kick for subtle movement in the mix. After the intro section, I remove the bass note from the keys to carve out space for the actual bassline to enter cleanly.</p><p>Here's what that part sounds like, dry and uncompressed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/keys_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="drums">Drums</h2><p>The drum part in <em>Something About Us</em> is deceptively simple. For this project, I built a custom kit: the <strong>kick</strong> comes from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-505?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Roland TR-505</strong></a>, the <strong>closed hi-hats</strong> are from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>TR-808</strong></a>, and I kept the <strong>open hi-hat</strong> from the stock<strong> TR-505</strong> sounds. It’s a classic combo that delivers the crisp, laid-back groove the track needs.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1381" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1131-1.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>My Arturia Beatstep Pro</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now—the <strong>snare</strong>. This one was tough. I spent a long time trying to recreate it, convinced it was a processed acoustic snare layered with something synthetic. After too many failed attempts, I caved and sampled the original. Yes, the snare is the only part I couldn’t fully replicate.</p><p>To isolate it, I used an AI stem-splitting tool called <a href="https://www.landr.com/plugins/landr-stems?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>LANDR Stems</strong>,</a> which did a surprisingly clean job of pulling the drum track apart from the rest of the mix.</p><p>Here's the full drum pattern:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Drums_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><p>Here's the final snare sample, isolated:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Snare_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><p>In terms of processing, I applied <strong>compression</strong> to give the groove some punch and then ran the whole drum track through a <strong>tape emulation</strong> plugin (<a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/trtapemac24/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Tape Machine 24</strong></a> from IK Multimedia) to smooth out the transients and give it that slightly worn-in warmth.</p><h2 id="bassline">Bassline</h2><p>Like the drums, the bassline in <em>Something About Us</em> is incredibly minimal—just a straightforward <strong>octave pattern</strong>, no ghost notes. It's tightly quantized and split across two layers that work together to form the full tone.</p><p>The <strong>low octave</strong> is a simple synth—nothing fancy. I used Ableton's stock <strong>Operator</strong> with the <em>Guitar Bass</em> preset as a starting point. A bit of EQ boosts the low mids and rolls off everything below 40Hz, and it sits nicely in the mix.</p><p>The <strong>high octave</strong>, on the other hand, comes from a sampled electric bass. I recorded a single plucked note on my own bass, loaded it into <strong>Simpler</strong>, activated Warping, and that was enough to get the right texture.</p><p>I grouped both tracks and ran them through a <strong>Glue Compressor</strong>, side-chained to the drum track for a bit of breathing and bounce. It's clean, tight, and fits under the keys without stepping on anything.</p><p>Here's the bassline coupled with drums:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Drums-and-Bass_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><p>Here's the bassline soloed.</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Bass_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="the-cocotte">The Cocotte</h2><p>One of the more unique textures in <em>Something About Us</em> is what we in France call a <em>"cocotte"</em>—a muted, rhythmic funk guitar riff, aka <strong>chicken guitar</strong>. In this case, it's processed through a <strong>Talkbox</strong>, which gives it that vocal, filtered tone.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/00C0D7EA-02BB-46CC-96C7-A738C7E4824E_1_102_a.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>My old, beaten Talkbox</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're unfamiliar with a <strong>Talkbox</strong>, it's essentially a tiny speaker pushing sound through a plastic tube into your mouth. You shape the sound using your mouth movements, almost like playing a <em>mouth harp</em>, and that modulated sound is then picked up by a microphone. It's been famously used by artists like <a href="https://youtu.be/L_CBZkd2tGE?t=31&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Zapp &amp; Roger</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-c3N_0a_WJc&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Stevie Wonder</strong></a>, and of course, <strong>Daft Punk</strong>.</p><p>I must admit something: while I consider <strong>Daft Punk's</strong> first two albums absolute masterpieces, I've never been a huge fan of their guitar tones—especially their later collaborations with <strong>Nile Rodgers</strong>. There's nothing technically wrong with them, but I prefer funk guitars that are punchier, more percussive, and full-bodied. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtzBduHNol8&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Yarol Poupaud’s</strong></a> work with <strong>FFF</strong> is more my jam—or, even closer to home, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzjJQs9jHBY&amp;ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Nicolas Bogue</strong></a>, <strong>Breakbot's</strong> guitarist, who taught me everything I know about <strong>funk guitar</strong> when I was a teenager.</p><p>In <em>Something About Us,</em> the cocotte is very subdued—the ghost notes are barely there, almost unnaturally so. That may have been intentional, but I wanted to bring a little more texture and bounce into my version.</p><p>I recorded the part using a <strong>Les Paul</strong> through <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/guitar/guitar-rig-7-pro/amps-and-cabinets/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Guitar Rig's</strong></a><strong> "High White"</strong> amp sim (a <strong>Hiwatt</strong> emulation), with a touch of cabinet (around 5%) to keep it from sounding too boxy. The space and depth come mostly from reverb, sent through a bus using <a href="https://www.wavealchemy.co.uk/product/magic7/?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Wave Alchemy's Magic 7</strong></a> (a lush emulation of the <a href="https://www.bricasti.com/en/pro/m7.php?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Bricasti M7</strong></a>).</p><p>Here's the cocotte soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Cocotte_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="the-wakawak">The Wakawak</h2><p>Okay, I couldn't think of a better name for this one—<em>Wakawak</em> just fits. It's a synthetic take on a trimmed <strong>funk guitar chord</strong>, dripping in <strong>reverb</strong> and slapped with a tightly <strong>synced, panned echo</strong>. It's playful and rhythmic and adds a little magic sparkle in the background.</p><p>This sound was one of the trickiest to get right. It took quite a bit of back-and-forth. At its core, it's a <strong>synth patch</strong> designed to mimic that snappy, vocal-like quality you'd get from a well-timed guitar chop.</p><p>The patch starts with a simple waveform in Ableton Live's <strong>Wavetable</strong>, shaped by a smooth, triangle-like <strong>LFO</strong> that modulates both the amplitude and filter cutoff frequency, creating the signature pulsing movement. To add a bit more funk character, I ran it through an <strong>envelope filter stompbox</strong> emulation, which gave it a gritty, slightly overdriven sweep—more like a dusty analog auto-wah you'd find on an old pedalboard than a pristine digital effect.</p><p>The spacey vibe comes from a stock Ableton <strong>Delay</strong> on a send bus, <strong>panned hard right</strong> and set to <strong>tempo-sync</strong>. Tons of reverb helps it blend into the background without losing presence.</p><p>Here's the Wakawaka soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Wakawaka_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="the-theme">The Theme</h2><p>This lead sound—<em>silly, playful, and deceptively simple</em>—was surprisingly difficult to pin down. After quite a bit of experimenting, I landed on something pretty close using <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/software-instruments/jun-6-v/overview?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Arturia's Jun-6V</strong></a>, their emulation of the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Juno-60?ref=thoughts-and-things.ghost.io"><strong>Roland Juno-6</strong></a>.</p><p>That<em> soft, rubbery tone</em> with just a hint of analog instability is key to the emotional feel of <em>Something About Us</em>. While you can approximate it using Ableton Live's <strong>Operator</strong> with the <em>Analog Bouquet</em> preset, it still lacks the warmth and nuance of a proper analog emulation.</p><p>Here's the theme soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Theme_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="the-guitar-solo">The Guitar Solo</h2><p>The <em>silky, melancholic guitar solo</em> is one of the emotional peaks of <em>Something About Us</em>. While I can't say for sure, I'd wager the original was played on a <strong>hollow or semi-hollow body guitar</strong>—you can hear that smooth resonance and airy tone in the phrasing.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2025/04/IMG_1128.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>My humble Honey burst Les Paul ❤️</span></figcaption></figure><p>For my version, I recorded the solo <em>ad-lib</em> on my <strong>Les Paul</strong>, and I was lucky enough to stumble upon a preset in <strong>Guitar Rig</strong> that felt just right. I gave it a few subtle tweaks, adding in simulated hum and noise via the <strong>Noise Machine</strong> rack to inject a bit of vintage character and imperfection.</p><p>I ran it through a <strong>compressor</strong> to even out dynamics and used <strong>Raum</strong>, also in <strong>Guitar Rig</strong>, for some warm, spacey reverb that lets the notes breathe without feeling too polished.</p><p>Here's the guitar solo (with the keys):</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Solo_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="the-vocals">The Vocals</h2><h3 id="lead">Lead</h3><p>Ah yes—the vocals. Now<em> that's</em> a big one. First, I genuinely believe you can't fully replicate the vocal texture of the original unless you're <em>slightly sick</em>—it's got that warm, congested, <strong>Vick Vaporub feel</strong>.</p><p>I tried a few approaches, including a <strong>vocoder</strong>, but it ended up sounding too synthetic. Even with careful dry/wet blending, it was either too robotic or too clean—and in both cases, it lost clarity.</p><figure><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg" alt="" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2000" srcset="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1000/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 1000w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w1600/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 1600w, https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/images/size/w2400/2025/04/IMG_1129.jpeg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><span>A dreamy vocal booth</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the end, I went with a more organic solution: I tracked the vocals in my apartment in the Mission, San Francisco, and used Ableton's <strong>Auto Filter</strong> to sculpt the tone dynamically. I automated the filter to <strong>gradually open</strong> during the second half of each phrase, and <strong>close it sharply</strong> at the start of the next one—giving the vocal that breathing, evolving texture. I also played around with the filter automation on specific words like<em> "do"</em> and <em>"you"</em> in the phrase <em>"I've got to do/share with you."</em> It's not perfect, but it captures the vibe.</p><h3 id="harmonies">Harmonies</h3><p>There's a beautiful, super-typical Daft Punk harmony on <em>"right one"</em> and <em>"right time"</em> in the second verse—possibly vocoded in the original. It took me a while to figure out the voicings (I'm no music theory wizard), but after some trial and error, I got something I'm really happy with. <em>"Right one"</em> might still be a little off, but I think I nailed <em>"right time"</em>—and let's be honest, that's <strong>the pretty one</strong>.</p><p>I filtered the harmonies using <strong>Auto Filter</strong> again, bounced them down to a stereo track, and used the <em>Wide Stereo</em> preset in Ableton's <strong>Utility</strong> plugin to give them that spread. Add a bit of <strong>Magic 7 reverb</strong> on a bus, and boom—they melt right into the mix.</p><p>Here are the harmonies soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Harmonies_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><p>Here they are with the lead vocals:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Harmonies-and-Main_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h3 id="vocoder">Vocoder</h3><p>For the final section, I went <em>full robot</em>. I used a stock <strong>Operator</strong> synth as the carrier, routed it into Ableton's stock <strong>Vocoder</strong>, and processed the output with a <strong>high-pass filter</strong> and the <strong>Chorus-Ensemble</strong> plugin to give it more dimension and movement.</p><p>The vocoder is mixed in with the dry vocal until the balance feels just right—enough to sound synthetic but emotionally grounded. Basically, it ends up sounding like <em>a little robot backing me up with its heart on its sleeve.</em></p><p>Here's the vocoder soloed:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Vocoder_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><p>And here's the vocoder blended with the lead:</p><div><p><img src="https://thoughts-and-things.ghost.io/content/media/2025/04/Vocoder-and-Main_thumb.png" alt="audio-thumbnail"></p></div><h2 id="from-paris-to-san-francisco-a-personal-note">From Paris to San Francisco: A Personal Note</h2><p>This project was as much about nostalgia as it was about production techniques. Born and raised in <strong>Paris in the '80s</strong>, I grew up surrounded by the cultural influences that would eventually shape <strong>French Touch</strong>. Now, having lived in California for the past seven years, reconstructing this track felt like building a <em>sonic bridge</em> between my past and present.</p><p>This recreation isn't perfect—nor was it meant to be. It's a <em>personal interpretation</em> filtered through my musical sensibilities and the tools available to me.

<p>President Trump on Wednesday announced tariffs on practically every foreign country (and some non-countries), ranging from a 10 percent minimum all the way up to 50 percent. The economic fallout has been dramatic, with the stock market losing nine percent of its value (based on the S&amp;P 500 index at the time of writing) and forecasted probabilities of a recession rising.</p>



<p>President Trump described the tariffs as reciprocal, equal to half of the rate of tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers imposed by other countries. However, they are nothing of the sort. The tariff the United States is placing on other countries is equal to the US trade deficit divided by US imports from a given country, divided by two, or 10 percent, whichever rate is higher. So even if the United States has no trade deficit (or a trade surplus) with a country, they still receive a minimum tariff of 10 percent.</p>



<p>As an example, if the US imports $100 million worth of goods and services while exporting $50 million to a country, then the Trump Administration alleges that country levies a 50 percent tariff on the United States (the difference between $100 million and $50 million, divided by $100 million). The “reciprocal” tariff put into effect by President Trump on Wednesday would be half of that, 25 percent.</p>



<p>The formula for the tariffs, originally credited to the Council of Economic Advisers and&nbsp;<a href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, does not make economic sense. The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even if one were to take the Trump Administration’s tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold. As a result, the “reciprocal” tariffs imposed by President Trump are highly inflated as well.</p>



<p>Though in effect the formula for the tariff placed on the United States by another country is equal to the trade deficit divided by imports, the formula published by the Office of the US Trade Representative has two additional terms in the denominator that just so happen to cancel out: (1) the elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices,&nbsp;<em>ε</em>, and (2) the elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs,&nbsp;<em>φ</em>.</p>


<div>
<figure><img decoding="async" width="236" height="83" src="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/corinthveugerequation040425.png?x85095" alt=""></figure></div>


<p>The idea is that as tariffs rise, the change in the trade deficit will depend on the responsiveness of import demand to tariffs, which depends on how import demand responds to import prices and how import prices respond to tariffs. The Trump Administration assumes an elasticity of import demand with respect to import prices of four, and an elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs of 0.25, the product of which is one and is the reason they cancel out in the Administration’s formula.</p>



<p>However, the elasticity of import prices with respect to tariffs should be about one (actually 0.945), not 0.25 as the Trump Administration states. Their mistake is that they base the elasticity on the response of&nbsp;<em>retail&nbsp;</em>prices to tariffs, as opposed to&nbsp;<em>import</em>&nbsp;prices as they should have done. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aeri.20190536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a>&nbsp;they cite by&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/albertocavallo/status/1907974351967633570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alberto Cavallo</a>&nbsp;and his coauthors makes this distinction clear. The authors state that “tariffs [are] passed through almost fully to US import prices,” while finding “more mixed evidence regarding retail price increases.” It is inconsistent to multiply the elasticity of import demand with respect to&nbsp;<em>import</em>&nbsp;prices by the elasticity of&nbsp;<em>retail</em>&nbsp;prices with respect to tariffs.</p>



<p>Correcting the Trump Administration’s error would reduce the tariffs assumed to be applied by each country to the United States to about a fourth of their stated level, and as a result, cut the tariffs announced by President Trump on Wednesday by the same fraction, subject to the 10 percent tariff floor. As shown in Table 1, the tariff rate would not exceed 14 percent for any country. For all but a few countries, the tariff would be exactly 10 percent, the floor imposed by the Trump Administration.</p>



<p>Now, our view is that the formula the administration relied on has no foundation in either economic theory or trade law. But if we are going to pretend that it is a sound basis for US trade policy, we should at least be allowed to expect that the relevant White House officials do their calculations carefully. Hopefully they will correct their mistake soon: the resulting trade liberalization would provide a much-needed boost to the economy and may yet help us stave off a recession.</p>

<p>From The Flori­da Muse­um of Nat­ur­al His­to­ry comes the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/gallery/">open­Ver­te­brate project</a>, a new ini­tia­tive to “pro­vide free, dig­i­tal 3D ver­te­brate anato­my mod­els and data to researchers, edu­ca­tors, stu­dents and the pub­lic.” Intro­duc­ing the new project (oth­er­wise known as oVert), the muse­um writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Between 2017 and 2023, oVert project mem­bers took CT scans of more than 13,000 spec­i­mens, with rep­re­sen­ta­tive species across the ver­te­brate tree of life. This includes more than half the gen­era of all amphib­ians, rep­tiles, fish­es and mam­mals. CT scan­ners use high-ener­gy X‑rays to peer past an organism’s exte­ri­or and view the dense bone struc­ture beneath. Thus, skele­tons make up the major­i­ty of oVert recon­struc­tions. A small num­ber of spec­i­mens were also stained with a tem­po­rary con­trast-enhanc­ing solu­tion that allowed researchers to visu­al­ize soft tis­sues, such as skin, mus­cle and oth­er organs.</p>
<p>The mod­els give an inti­mate look at inter­nal por­tions of a spec­i­men that could pre­vi­ous­ly only be observed through destruc­tive dis­sec­tion and tis­sue sam­pling.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the com­ing years, the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/gallery/">open­Ver­te­brate</a> team will “CT scan 20,000 flu­id-pre­served spec­i­mens from U.S. muse­um col­lec­tions, pro­duc­ing high-res­o­lu­tion anatom­i­cal data for more than 80 per­cent of ver­te­brate gen­era.” The project will also make dig­i­tal images and 3D mesh files avail­able to down­load and 3D print.</p>
<p>The video below pro­vides a short, visu­al intro­duc­tion to the <a href="https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/overt/">dig­i­tal col­lec­tion</a>.

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://unixmagic.net/">https://unixmagic.net/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43589042">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get ready for some Unix magic... 🪄</p><div id="poster-info"><p>This is the <strong>UNIX Magic Poster</strong>, originally created by <strong>Gary Overacre</strong> in
the mid-1980s and published by UniTech Software.
It was later seen on display at a <a href="https://www.usenix.org/" target="_blank">USENIX
Conference</a>, reflecting its lasting influence in UNIX culture.
Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/drio/unixmagic" target="_blank">repo</a> if you’d like to
contribute!</p><p>UNIX has been a major influence on my career
from the very beginning. My first exposure to UNIX was during my college years,
when I had to write most of my first-year programming assignments on terminals
connected to an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">HP-UX</a> main server.
I was immediately captivated by the simplicity
and power UNIX offered—especially compared to the operating systems I had used
before, like DOS and Windows.</p><p>That experience changed the way I thought about computers. From that point on,
I never looked back—UNIX has been my constant companion in my computing journey
ever since.
This project is my humble rendition—a celebration of UNIX and its lasting impact
on me.</p></div><div><div id="annotation-01-shell"><p>The prominent position of the shell in the UNIX Magic poster reflects its
central role in UNIX systems. The shell was (and still is) the primary
interface for interacting with the kernel, serving as the workbench of the UNIX
user. It is an incredibly powerful tool, allowing users to launch and
coordinate processes, perform complex computations, and interface directly with
the operating system.</p><p>The shell is not just an interface; it is also a full programming language.
Users can write scripts to automate tasks, control processes, and build
pipelines to process data efficiently. This makes the shell both interactive
and programmable—something remarkably different from other operating systems of
its time.</p><p>While many shells exist today, the original was the Bourne shell (sh), which
laid the foundation for everything that followed.</p><p>Finally, I want to emphasize that the shell is the gateway to UNIX power. It is
the first point of contact when learning UNIX, and mastering it unlocks the
system’s full potential. I believe the poster captures this perfectly—the shell
is at the heart of the wizard’s magic because it is the gateway to controlling
the system.</p></div><div id="annotation-02-man"><p>The <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/man.1.html">man(1)</a>
command (short for manual) is used to display online reference manuals (man
pages) for commands, system calls, configuration files, and other aspects of
the system. man provides detailed documentation on how to use a command,
including its options, usage examples, related files, and other pertinent
details.</p><p>There’s some ambiguity as to what the interpretation of the man in the window
could represent.
The man is holding a scythe, which could represent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process">reaping a process</a>.
Under Unix like systems, process reaping is when a parent process reads
the exit status of a spawned child process, allowing the child process
to be removed from the process table.</p><p>Others have suggested that the man could represent a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker">hacker</a>,
a term used to mean a skilled or clever programmer.</p></div><div id="annotation-03-pipes"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)">Pipes</a> are a
foundational feature in Unix that enable you to combine simple utilities into
more powerful workflows. By passing data from one command’s output to another
command’s input, pipes allow you to quickly create flexible, efficient, and
maintainable solutions directly at the command line. They are denoted in the
shell by the vertical bar character (|).</p></div><div id="annotation-04-leak"><p>A memory leak occurs when a computer program improperly manages memory
allocation, failing to release memory that’s no longer needed. Over time, these
un-freed allocations accumulate, reducing the amount of available memory for
other processes and potentially leading to slowdowns or crashes.</p></div><div id="annotation-05-kandr"><p>In the context of Unix history these three sets of initials refer to legendary
figures in the creation and development of Unix:</p><p>dmr: Dennis M. Ritchie, co-creator of Unix and creator of the C programming
language.</p><p>kt: Ken Thompson (often just “ken” in historical Unix references), co-creator
of Unix alongside Ritchie.</p><p>bwk: Brian W. Kernighan, co-author of several influential Unix programs and
books (including “The C Programming Language” and “The UNIX Programming
Environment”).</p></div><div id="annotation-06-c"><p>C is deeply intertwined with the history and development of the Unix operating
system. Created by Dennis M. Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, C was
used to rewrite Unix from low-level assembly into a higher-level language. This
shift made Unix significantly more portable across different hardware
platforms, fueling its rapid adoption in academia and industry. Over time, C
evolved into one of the most influential and widely used programming languages
in history.</p></div><div id="annotation-07-backpressure"><p>When two processes communicate over a pipe, the process sending data is the
producer, and the process receiving data is the consumer. The OS maintains a
buffer to temporarily store data if the producer sends data faster than the
consumer can process it. However, if the buffer becomes full, the OS will block
the producer until space is available.</p><p>Was that the intention of the artist? You decide—is the valve handle in the
pipes a clever reference to UNIX back pressure, or is that a stretch?</p></div><div id="annotation-08-daemons"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">Daemons</a> are programs that run in the background
and are often started at system boot time. They respond to network requests, hardware activity,
or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron may also perform
defined tasks at scheduled times.</p><p>The term was coined by the programmers at MIT’s Project MAC. It is inspired by Maxwell’s demon and
greek mythology, acting as a metaphor for a supernatural being working in the background.</p></div><div id="annotation-09-su"><p>The <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/su.1.html">su</a> command (short for “substitute user” or
“switch user”) is used to start a shell under a different user account.
Typically, one of the most common uses of su is switching to the superuser
(root) account to gain administrative privileges.</p></div><div id="annotation-10-null"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_device">Null device</a> is a device file that discards all data written
to it but reports that the write operation succeeded.
This device is called /dev/null on Unix and Unix-like systems.
The null device is typically used for disposing of unwanted output streams of a process, or as a convenient empty file for input streams.</p></div><div id="annotation-11-oregano"><p>From <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/comp.unix.wizards/c/qkiqSJWgEPE/m/E5BwZYMvXwAJ">Sarah Groves Hobart</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The oregano is reputedly referring to an incident in which one of the
original folks involved with BSD was hassled for coming across the
Canadian/U.S. border with a bag of what was assumed to be an illegal
substance, and turned out to be oregano.</p></blockquote></div><div id="annotation-12-tar"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing)">Tar</a> is a software tool for collecting multiple
files into a single archive file, often called a tarball.
The name is derived from “tape archive”, as it was originally developed to write
data to sequential I/O devices with no file system of their own, such as devices that use magnetic tape.</p><p>The command-line utility was first introduced in the Version 7 Unix in January 1979, replacing the <code>tp</code> program (which in turn replaced <code>tap</code>).</p></div><div id="annotation-13-fork"><p>In multitasking operating systems, processes need a way to create new processes.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(system_call)">Forking</a> a process is typically the
only way of doing so in Unix-like systems.</p><p>One of the earliest references to a fork concept appeared in A Multiprocessor System Design by Melvin Conway, published in 1962.</p></div><div id="annotation-14-shell-script"><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script">shell script</a> is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell.
The term is also used more generally to mean the automated mode of running an operating system shell.</p></div><div id="annotation-15-awk"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK">AWK</a> is a domain specific language designed for text
processing, either run directly on files or used as part of a pipeline.</p><p>AWK was created at Bell Labs in the 1970s, and its name is
derived from the surnames of its authors: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger and Brian Kernighan.</p></div><div id="annotation-16-usr"><p>The “user file system” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_filesystem#Conventional_directory_layout"><code>/usr</code></a> ),
is a directory holding user home directories, including executables, libraries and shared resources.</p><p>The spool of threads may be also a reference to <strong>Unix threads</strong>, which are lightweight processes.<br>A <strong>process</strong> is an instance of a running program, with its own separate memory space.<br>A <strong>thread</strong>, on the other hand, is a <strong>lighter-weight unit of execution within a process</strong>.<br>Threads <strong>share the same memory space</strong> as the process but <strong>can run independently</strong>, allowing for:</p><ul><li><strong>Parallelism:</strong> Different parts of a program can run at the same time.</li><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Threads are faster to create and use fewer system resources compared to processes.</li><li><strong>Easy Data Sharing:</strong> Threads can easily access and modify shared data since they operate within the same memory space.</li></ul><p>This makes threads a powerful tool for <strong>concurrent programming</strong> in Unix systems.</p></div><div id="annotation-17-troff"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troff">Troff</a> is the major component of a document processing system developed by Bell Labs for the Unix operating system.
Troff stands for “typesetter roff”, where <code>roff</code> is a typesetting markup language.
A typical distribution of troff includes macros for many document styles, including ones for the Unix <code>man</code> pages.</p><p>Troff was developed by Bell Labs in th 1970s, where Joseph Ossanna created <code>troff</code> by modifying <code>nroff</code> to support multiple fonts and proportional spacing.</p></div><div id="annotation-18-B"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_(programming_language)">B</a> is a programming language
designed for recursive, non-numeric, machine-independent applications.

abstraction pioneered by UNIX in BSD UNIX (4.2BSD, 1983). Sockets provided a
unified interface for interprocess communication (IPC), enabling processes to
communicate both locally (on the same machine) via UNIX domain sockets, and
over a network using TCP/IP. This innovation became foundational to modern
networking, and the socket API was later adopted by all major operating
systems, shaping how network programming is done today.</p></li></ul><p>For more on the history of BSD sockets, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_sockets">Berkeley Sockets –

that reads in a configuration <code>Makefile</code> that is often used in code executable
compilation and automation.
Before Make, building on Unix mostly consisted of shell scripts written for each program’s codebase.
Make’s dependency ordering and out-of-date checking makes the build process more robust and more efficient.</p><p>Stuart Feldman was the original author of Make, completing an early version in April 1976 at
Bell Labs.</p></div><div id="annotation-23-spawn"><p>Spawning is the process of loading and executing a new child process.
Closely related is the idea of <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code> that can be used
to simulate spawning, by forking a process, having the parent terminate
and <code>exec</code>ing the child into the desired spawn process.</p><p>POSIX allow for the concept of spawning by itself that can be made
to be more efficient than <code>fork</code> and <code>exec</code>.</p><p>The spawn metaphor had its early use in the VMS operating system from 1977.</p></div><div id="annotation-24-jfo-nroff"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nroff"><code>nroff</code></a>, short for “new roff”

It is an integral part of the Unix help system, being used to format man pages for display.</p><p>The letters <em>Jfo</em> stand for Joseph Frank Ossanna
who created the original version of <code>nroff</code> for Version 2 Unix.</p></div><div id="annotation-25-root"><p>The root user is the name often given to the administrator or superuser account
on UNIX systems.
In Unix-like systems, root is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or
permissions to all files and programs in all modes (e.g. single- or multi-user).
The root user can do many things an ordinary user cannot, such as changing the
ownership of files and binding to network ports numbered below 1024.</p></div><div id="annotation-26-dates"><p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html"><code>date</code></a> is a command to display and set a UNIX system date.</p><p>Unix time is currently defined as the number of non-leap seconds which have passed since 00:00:00 UTC on Thursday, 1 January 1970,
which is referred to as the Unix epoch.</p><p>The earliest versions of Unix time had a 32-bit integer incrementing at a rate of 60 Hz, which was the rate of the system clock
on the hardware of the early Unix systems.
Timestamps stored this way could only represent a range of a little over two and a quarter years.</p><p>The current epoch of 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC was selected arbitrarily by Unix engineers because it was considered a
convenient date to work with.</p></div><div id="annotation-27-whoami"><p>Users on UNIX systems may want to
switch to other accounts, allowing for switching roles, escalation or deescalation of

that shows your current location in the filesystem. Is it a coincidence that
<code>pwd</code> is visually presented in a box? Maybe. But perhaps it’s a visual clue,
suggesting that <code>pwd</code> is a small, self-contained tool—like many classic UNIX
commands.</p></div><div id="annotation-29-mbox"><p><code>mbox</code> is a reference to the mail format from the early days of UNIX. UNIX was
one of the first operating systems to come with built-in email capabilities,
and it did so while staying true to its mantra: “everything is a file.” In the
<code>mbox</code> format, all email messages are stored in a single file, with new
messages simply appended to the end. By default, users’ mail was stored in
<code>/usr/mail/&lt;username&gt;</code>. This design naturally enabled the integration of
system logs and notifications to be sent via email—further embedding email as
a core part of the UNIX experience.</p></div><div id="annotation-30-login"><p><code>login</code> is the gateway into the system. It authenticates the user, initializes
the environment by changing to the user’s home directory, and spawns a process
running as the user (with their <code>uid</code> and <code>gid</code>), using their shell of choice.</p><p>Additionally, the standard input and output need to be attached to a terminal:

and displays the differences in the contents of files.
<code>diff</code> is line oriented and is often used to determine changes between two versions
of the same file.

have been in the history of UNIX, the imagery might be intentional. The
overflowing liquid from the shell could be a visual reference to a buffer overflow.</p><p>A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data into a buffer (a fixed
block of memory) than it can hold. The excess data “spills over” into adjacent
memory, often overwriting critical information like return addresses, which can
cause crashes or open security vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows were (and still
are) a classic type of exploit in C programming on UNIX systems.</p><p>For more information, see
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow">Buffer overflow – Wikipedia</a>.</p></div><div id="annotation-37-tee"><p>The T shape of the pipes may also reference the
<a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tee.1.html"><code>tee</code></a> command, a classic
utility in UNIX. The <code>tee</code> command is used to split the output of a command,
sending it to both a file and the next command in a pipeline.</p></div><div id="annotation-38-tree-graph"><p>The tree-like shape of the liquid the wizard is manipulating may be a reference to
the UNIX filesystem hierarchy. UNIX organizes files and directories in a tree
structure, starting from the root (<code>/</code>) and branching into subdirectories.</p><p>Navigating this structure is a fundamental part of working with UNIX, typically done
through the shell using commands like <code>cd</code>, <code>ls</code>, and <code>pwd</code>. The tree shape could
symbolize this concept, visually representing how users move through directories,
access files, and execute commands.</p><p>Alternatively, the branching form could represent recursive operations or the
parent-child relationships in process trees, both key concepts in UNIX systems.</p><p>Some modern readers might associate the tree shape with version control systems like
Git, where branching is a common visual metaphor. However, this is likely not the
intended reference, as branching version control workflows were not as prevalent in
the UNIX world at the time the poster was created. Tools like SCCS (1972) and RCS
(1982) were available, but they focused more on linear versioning and file locking
than the branching models popular today.</p></div><div id="annotation-39-skull"><p>The skull connected to the shell may symbolize <code>/dev/null</code>, the special UNIX
device that discards all data written to it.
In UNIX, redirecting output to
<code>/dev/null</code> effectively sends it into a “black hole,” where it is lost
forever.
Output redirection is part of a broader
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams">standard stream</a> UNIX concept that
allows outputs of one process to be redirected to the input of another.</p><p>Another interpretation is that the spigot is reminiscent of a gargoyle, perhaps
referencing a UNIX <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)">daemon</a>
process.</p><p>See the (<a href="#annotation-10-null">/dev/null</a>) mark.</p></div></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>
	On March 27, 2022, on the heels of a weekend marked by dozens of gang-related murders, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/el-salvador/" id="auto-tag_el-salvador" data-tag="el-salvador">El Salvador</a>’s President <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/nayib-bukele/" id="auto-tag_nayib-bukele" data-tag="nayib-bukele">Nayib Bukele</a> and his legislature plunged the country into a <em>régimen de excepción</em> — a state of exception — and declared war against the gangs. The state of exception suspended fundamental rights like freedom of assembly and association, the right to legal representation, and the right to see a judge within 72 hours of detention. The age of criminal responsibility was lowered to 12.</p>



<p>
	The crackdown that ensued saw tens of thousands of arrests of suspected gang members, who were tried en masse and disappeared into the nation’s prison system without even the illusion of due process. Allegations of torture, extrajudicial killings, and other human rights abuses abounded — and still do. Bukele is serving a second term despite a constitutional prohibition against it. The state of exception — originally a 30-day decree —&nbsp; has been extended 37 times. Over the course of three years, human rights in El Salvador have crumbled under its boot.

	</p>




<p>
	It’s here that President <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/" id="auto-tag_donald-trump" data-tag="donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> hopes<strong> </strong>to find a workable model for his own <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/immigration/" id="auto-tag_immigration" data-tag="immigration">immigration</a> crackdown, and the potential eradication of opposition to his nativist, right-wing agenda.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In March, the Trump administration sent three plane loads of primarily Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, where they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/world/americas/deportation-videos-el-salvador.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">greeted by professional camera crews</a>, blinding lights, and soldiers clad in military fatigues who manhandled them as they were frogmarched, shaved, and transported into the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) — a massive prison that functions as both a detention center, and a propaganda soundstage for the Bukele government.<strong> </strong>The planes landed in El Salvador despite a court order from a federal judge <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-deport-alleged-gang-members-court-order-1235297412/">blocking the administration</a> from deporting the detained migrants to a third nation without appropriate due process. The Trump administration paid El Salvador <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/16/politics/trump-administration-deportations-alien-enemies-act/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">at least $6 million</a> for the stunt, and the migrants have been thrust into a legal void that few manage to escape.&nbsp;

<p>
	“The Venezuelans have been sent to basically a judicial black hole,” says Noah Bullock, executive director of Cristosal, a leading human rights organization that has represented victims and the families of those internally displaced and disappeared in Central America for more than 20 years. “There’s already tens of thousands of El Salvadorans who are in it, who have not been able to exercise a defense, who have been subjected to systematic torture. Hundreds — probably more like thousands — have been killed.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Ruth López, a <a href="https://www.elsalvadornow.org/2024/12/03/bbc-nominates-lawyer-ruth-eleonora-lopez-among-the-100-most-influential-women-on-the-planet-in-2024-la-cadena-publica-britanica-bbc-nomina-a-la-abogada-ruth-eleonora-lopez-entre-las-100-muje/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">renowned</a> Salvadoran human rights lawyer who works as a chief legal officer at Cristosal, says the organization has been contacted by roughly 70 relatives and families of individuals caught in the deportation stunt, including “migrants without a prior criminal record, people who were detained on the street or upon entering the United States, others who had previously applied through the CPB One app or had existing formal asylum processes.”</p>



<p>
	López says it’s often Cristosal’s job to explain to families — who in these cases live primarily outside of El Salvador — the reality of what the detained person will face, and the challenges of fighting for their release. “Here in Salvador, between March 27, 2022, and December 31, 2024, there have been over 7,200 writs of habeas corpus submitted just to the Supreme Court. We can estimate that the rulings in favor of the people on those cases don’t surpass one percent,” she says. “These cases are also unique because these are not Salvadoran citizens, and additionally the government of El Salvador is being paid to hold them in an irregular situation — an unconstitutional situation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	El Salvador’s state of exception — billed as a necessary measure to eliminate crime and corruption — has led to the imprisonment of thousands of innocents alongside dozens of community leaders, union leaders, and human rights defenders. The situation in El Salvador may seem like a far cry from the institutions of the United States, which for decades have been revered as the global gold standard for democratic governance. But the erosion of individual rights, and the Trump administration’s willingness to recreate — even partially — the Bukele model at home, should be a warning and a wake up call for Americans.&nbsp;

<p>
	“America constantly talks about corruption elsewhere, this assumption that American institutions are incorruptible,” Bullock says. “In the end, human rights, corruption, autocracy — from an American exceptionalist mindset — is for the third world, and it makes it hard for people to see when it’s playing out in front of their faces.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In the aftermath of the Salvadoran Civil War — a more than decade-long conflict <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/jimmy-carter-oscar-romero-legacy-el-salvador-1235224083/">made exponentially worse</a> by the meddling of the United States — the country struggled to create a new egalitarian state, at the the same time that the American government began deporting undocumented migrants with criminal convictions from California <a href="https://newamericanstoryproject.org/context/brief-history-of-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back to Central America</a>. The result was the rapid entrenchment and growth of criminal groups within an already unstable El Salvador, and the nation quickly became one of the world’s most dangerous countries. When Bukele entered office in 2019, the murder rate in El Salvador was 38 per 100,000 people, and gangs outright controlled parts of rural El Salvador. While it’s undeniable that the Bukele crackdown has reduced violent crime in the nation, the extent of its success is a matter of debate, as crime statistics are <a href="https://www.dw.com/es/los-presuntos-%C3%A9xitos-de-nayib-bukele-en-la-lucha-contra-la-violencia/a-63107030" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">controlled by the Bukele government</a>. Allegations have also persisted that Bukele negotiated <a href="https://apnews.com/article/nayib-bukele-el-salvador-gangs-c378285a36d55c18f741c3f65892f801" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a backdoor truce</a> between some of the nation’s <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/secret-bukele-trump-deal-grenas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">most powerful gangs</a>. At the same time, over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/15/americas/el-salvador-war-on-gangs-bukele-intl-latam/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two percent</a> of the nation’s population is now incarcerated — the highest percentage in the world — and reports of state-sponsored violence and human rights abuses have skyrocketed.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	“Of course we were on board with neutralizing the gangs and the criminal elements, but that wasn’t the only thing the state of exception was for,” says Samuel Ramirez, founder of Movimiento de Víctimas del Régimen (Movement of Victims of the Regime), a protest and advocacy group that works with thousands of individuals and families affected by the state of exception. Bukele “used the gangs to create a spectacle, to command the attention of the world” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	While polling consistently shows that Bukele is quite popular in El Salvador, surveys also show <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/el-salvador/freedom-world/2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a steady increase</a> in fear of public criticism of the government — to degrees that sometimes match the president’s approval rating. “There’s a sector of the population that feels better, because it’s true that we perceive more security, we’re no longer afraid of the gangs. Now we’re afraid of the regime,” says Ramirez. “We see soldiers everywhere, police everywhere, patrol cars, and they’re arresting people.” Ramirez notes that on top of Bukele’s control of all three branches of government, and repression of <a href="https://latamjournalismreview.org/articles/journalists-fear-renewed-hostility-towards-the-press-with-bukeles-re-election-in-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the free press</a>, families and activists he works with fear retaliation or arrest if they speak out against abuses or advocate for their imprisoned relatives. The murder rate — a statistic <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/08/08/el-salvador-bukele-crime-homicide-prison-gangs/#:~:text=In%20May%202021%2C%20Bukele's%20government,of%20the%20nation's%20homicide%20figures." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">provided by</a> the Bukele government — is down, but doesn’t include those who die in custody of the prison system or are killed by police.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	El Salvador’s prisons have long been a hotbed of arbitrary detention and abuse, but the Bukele regime has operated under new levels of impunity. Officers are reportedly given daily <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/12/20/el-salvador-statement-us-house-tom-lantos-human-rights-commission#:~:text=Many%20arrests%20appear%20to%20be,number%20of%20people%20per%20day." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">arrest quotas</a>, transfers to other prisons are frequent, and the government closely guards information about detainees from families, attorneys, and their advocates. The state of exception means little more is needed than the suspicion of an arresting officer to secure a lengthy stay in prison. Detainees are <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/el-salvador-launches-mass-trial-nearly-500-accused-gang-leaders-2024-02-08/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tried en masse</a>, with no opportunity to present counter evidence — or even access to the evidence against them — and are often handed decades-long prison sentences. “People [are] being held for now three full years [since the state of exception was imposed], in some cases, without even going to trial,” Bullock says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	As the Trump administration looks to crack down on undocumented immigration — using the specter of crime, gang violence, and “terrorism” as the justification for their dismissal of established law — their playbook is looking increasingly similar to Bukele.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Over the weekend, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) <a href="https://x.com/reichlinmelnick/status/1906378176856572001?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">obtained a copy</a> of a “Validation Guide,” used by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to determine if a Venezuelan detainee was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ice-list-venezuelan-immigrants-gang-members-1235306641/">a member of the Tren de Aragua (TDA) gang</a>, and subject to removal under the Alien Enemies Act — an <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/alien-enemies-act-explained" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">18th century law</a> that allows the government to arrest, detain, and deport men over the age of 14 who are citizens of an enemy nation during times of war. Citing this infamous law — which was used to justify the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II — is a major stretch. The United States is not at war with Venezuela.</p>



<p>
	The guide included a points system through which suspected members are graded on their degree of suspected affiliation with the gang (scoring anything above a five is potentially enough to be declared an “alien enemy”). Criteria include tattoos and other symbolism; residing with someone declared a member of TDA; group photos featuring two or more “known” TDA members; and any form of communication with alleged members of TDA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The administration’s guide does not require due process; the supposed links between the detainee and a criminal group are not presented as evidence before a judge at a deportation hearing. The arresting officer has discretion, much like in El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Following the deportations in March, the Trump administration resisted releasing information regarding the identities of those arrested, and any evidence against them. The names of the more than 200 men deported were not made public <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuelans-deported-el-salvador-names/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">until CBS News</a> obtained the full list from an anonymous source last month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The Trump administration <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/noncitizens-deported-alien-enemies-act-criminal-records-ice/story?id=119912375" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">admitted in court documents</a> that “many” of those sent to El Salvador did not have criminal records. As more information about those deported was unearthed, it became clear that some of the “evidence” against them was as absurd as a tattoo of <a href="https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2025/03/21/eeuu/tatuajes-ordinarios-deportados-el-salvador-ap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Real Madrid CF</a> logo, or an <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/-incredible-trump-admin-reportedly-deports-man-over-autism-awareness-tattoo-235625029616" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">autism awareness</a> tattoo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Under the Alien Enemies Act, they have no recourse to challenge their removal, especially when they’re sent into a third country’s penal system as part of a financial agreement to hold prisoners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The videos produced by Bukele’s government in CECOT make clear the prison is also a propaganda casting department. Inmates are more often than not shirtless, displaying large tattoos and body art supposedly indicating their affiliations with transnational gangs. It’s an image both Bukele and the Trump administration are actively searching for when they make arrests — even though, for years now, gangs have been <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna22279005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">increasingly reluctant</a> to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/tattoos-deported-venezuelans-not-necessarily-gang-members-rcna197089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand members</a> with clearly identifying, permanent symbols and tattoos as governments crack down on organized crime. More often than not, arrests in El Salvador are based on anonymous tips to police, or social and geographic proximity to someone previously arrested.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>

	</p>




<p>
	On Tuesday, a report from <em>The Atlantic </em>revealed that in one court filing, the Trump administration admitted it had <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-admin-admits-wrongfully-deported-el-salvador-1235307858/">wrongfully deported</a> a man with protected status to El Salvador. The man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, previously won a legal battle against the Trump administration after being accused in 2019 of being a member of the gang MS-13, and was granted protected status that should have prevented his removal to El Salvador.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	While the Trump administration acknowledged that Abrego Garcia had been deported due to an “administrative error,” they claimed neither they nor the court had standing to order the U.S. government to secure his return, as he was in the custody of El Salvador and outside of their jurisdiction. Despite that logic, the Trump and Bukele administrations last week <a href="https://sv.usembassy.gov/secretary-kristi-noem-visits-el-salvador/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inked</a> a “memorandum of cooperation” in which the two countries agreed to work together to deport “fugitives” who are wanted in El Salvador back to the Central American nation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem thanked Bukele for his “partnership” <a href="https://x.com/AdamParkhomenko/status/1905050186977624065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in a video</a> filmed inside CECOT late last month. Before a backdrop of shirtless prisoners crowded into cage-like cells, Noem — sporting a $50,000 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/kristi-noem-venezuela-prison-rolex-watch.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rolex Daytona watch</a> — warned that CECOT is “one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.”</p>



<p>
	Bullock, of Cristosal, notes that the Trump administration sending people without convictions to El Salvador with no chance to defend themselves constitutes a “forced disappearance,” a violation of international human rights law. “It also violates another principle of international law, which is called <a href="https://migrationnetwork.un.org/resources/principle-non-refoulement-under-international-human-rights-law" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">non-refoulement</a>, he says. “Non-refoulement is an established tenant of international human rights law that prohibits nations from <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Migration/GlobalCompactMigration/ThePrincipleNon-RefoulementUnderInternationalHumanRightsLaw.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">deporting or removing</a> individuals under their control — regardless of their immigration status — into a situation where they are likely to face imminent harm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Bullock continues: “[Bukele] brags about the ways that they use cruel and inhumane treatment in CECOT and our organization has documented amply systematic practices of torture generally in the prison system. So the United States, in doing this, is generating a point of inflection for the international human rights system. The outcome of this is basically the creation of this transnational penal colony where a president, a head of state, can make a deal with President Bukele and disappear undesirables indefinitely.”&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Disappeared is an apt description for the state of those in El Salvador’s prisons. Cristosal and other advocacy groups working with the families of the detained say that CECOT is just “the public face” of a much larger system of prisons in El Salvador holding the vast majority of those arrested under the state of exception. The Bukele administration makes it nearly impossible to track the whereabouts of an arrestee once they’ve entered the system. Family members are not allowed contact with inmates, and are given little information on their condition and location. Release papers, if they manage to secure them, <a href="https://www.vozdeamerica.com/a/el-salvador-no-excarcela-a-sus-presos-pese-a-que-tienen-cartas-de-liberacion-/7801430.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">are often ignored</a>. “We do work with hundreds of families of people, innocent people have been detained, and they don’t even know for sure if they’re alive.” Bullock says. “They bring monthly packages [of basic goods] to the prisons out of fear that their loved ones don’t think they’ve been forgotten, but they have no guarantees or assurances that they’re even there or they ever received the packages.” (In many Latin American countries, prisons do not provide basic goods for inmates, whose families are expected to collect and deliver them to detention centers on a monthly basis.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In 2024, Cristosal <a href="https://cristosal.org/ES/el-silencio-no-es-opcion-informe-completo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">published a report</a> detailing alleged torture within El Salvador’s prison system, unreported deaths of inmates, and the systematic dissappearances of those arrested. The organization has received thousands of complaints, investigated over 1,000 specific cases of alleged abuse, and documented the deaths in custody of over 200 prisoners.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Cristosal provided <em>Rolling Stone</em> with recorded testimony from a former inmate named Oscar<em> </em>who said he and other detainees are often forced to sign confessions by arresting officers, crammed into cells with over 250 other inmates, and regularly beaten by guards. Oscar describes witnessing food deprivation, denial of medical treatment, frequent transfers (he spent time at several prisons in El Salvador), deaths of inmates due to illness or abuse, and burials in mass graves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In a 2023 <a href="https://cristosal.org/EN/2023/08/17/report-one-year-under-the-state-of-exception/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> examining in-custody deaths investigated by the state-run Institute of Legal Medicine (IML), Cristosal was able to corroborate that the institute has investigated at least 28 deaths within prisons that were likely caused by torture. The actual number is estimated to be at least in the hundreds. Deaths in custody are often reported to be the result of chronic disease or natural causes, despite inmates’ families claiming they had no known conditions before being arrested.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	In the case of a 30-year-old man whose IML reports were obtained by Cristosal, “the forensic medical examination of the IML stated that he had died as a result of ‘mechanical asphyxia by strangulation.’ The corpse presented a kind of protuberance at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and hematomas, possibly perpetrated with a rigid object. That is to say, he could have been strangled with a stick, club, or tonfa.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	One 24-year-old man, whose family spoke to Cristosal, died of a burst intestine theorized to have been caused by a severe beating. After an initial hospitalization due to malnutrition after seven months in prison, he was granted special release by a judge who told him that the “good news” was that a polygraph determined he was innocent — but the bad news was that he had “terminal renal insufficiency.” He told a relative shortly before he died that at Mariona Prison the “water is hot and tastes like chlorine and they hardly give us food, we get fed once a day, they don’t give us breakfast or lunch only dinner … we wait in line in a large court and everyone who gets food receives two hard blows on the back … so I stopped going out to eat so they wouldn’t hit me, because those blows hurt.”</p>



<p>
	One man previously incarcerated at Mariona testified to Cristosal that at one point, guards “showed up with a bucket of food. We arrived on a Thursday (and it was Monday), the guard asked, ‘Are you hungry?’ When we answered yes, the guard threw the food on the floor, which was full of mud and other dirt, and said, ‘You are only going to pick the food up with your mouth and if you grab it with your hands I will take you out and I will beat you,’ and gave them five seconds to pick up the food with their mouths.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Luisa — a woman whose daughter was arrested by the regime — wondered in an interview with Cristosal why her daughter was being held prisoner. “I would like for someone to come to me and say, ‘Look, here is [the evidence against your daughter] I can prove it,’ but I’ve always said we’re not of a dual-morality.” Luisa notes that since her daughter, who was the primary source of the family’s income, was arrested, she now spends around $120 a month on supplies her daughter needs, taking them to the prison with only the vaguest assurance that they will actually reach her daughter. Thousands of families whose loved ones are lost in the system are now forced to carry a similar financial burden. “Many of them already have a letter of release, they know they are innocent, why don’t they let them go?” Luisa asks.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	It’s into this system that the United States is now sending migrants without trial, with the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment being part of the system’s appeal. The families of those deported from the United States cannot deliver life-saving subsistence packages to inmates. They may not even know where they are. And they will face the additional challenge of having to contend with two hostile governments — one of which is their own — as they work to extricate their loved ones from a foreign penitentiary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Meanwhile, the changes ushered in by the Trump administration are quickly eroding support services in El Salvador. Cristosal has had to <a href="https://episcopalnewsservice.org/2025/02/04/trumps-foreign-aid-freeze-halts-episcopal-affiliated-humanitarian-aid-program-in-central-america/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">downsize its operations significantly</a> in the wake of Trump and billionaire Elon Musk’s purge of international aid and financial assistance programs. The cuts to their operations are also taking place alongside <a href="https://amnesty.ca/urgent-actions/el-salvador-free-fidel-zavala-and-other-community-leaders/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a wave of government retaliation</a> against activists and advocates in El Salvador. “The capacity of the human rights community in El Salvador to respond is significantly diminished,” Bullock says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The biggest challenge, Bullock explains, is helping the families of those who are detained or missing navigate a system in El Salvador that is increasingly serving the interests of the president rather than the people — a pattern he says mirrors the changes rapidly taking place in the United States. “Bukele often talked about his popularity and his electoral victories as a source of legitimacy that makes any institution or norm that doesn’t align with him, illegitimate,” he says. “You hear that same language with President Trump.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	The public dialogue taking place between Bukele and the Trump administration is undeniable. In the aftermath of U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg’s attempt to block the deportation flights, Bukele echoed Republican complaints of obstruction and claimed that the U.S. was “facing a judicial coup” on <a href="https://x.com/nayibbukele/status/1902164881769467923" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>. Bukele would know all about it, given that one of his first actions upon gaining control of the legislature in 2021 was to launch a judicial coup within El Salvador. Five Supreme Court justices and the attorney general — who had ruled against Bukele’s attempts at overreach — <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56970026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">were removed from their positions</a> via votes by the legislature, and replaced by Bukele loyalists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	From López’s perspective in El Salvador, the similarities between the two men — and the manner in which they approach power — is clear. “One has to understand that the limits [placed on power] are for the population,” she says.&nbsp;

	</p>




<p>
	Checks and balances are often explained as a mechanism to prevent discord between branches of a government, or resolve disputes, but López argues that their primary function is the “protection of the population” from government abuses and overreach. When those protective systems are attacked and dismantled “the population ends up suffering those consequences.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Trump is currently testing the limits of the United States’ checks and balances, seizing power for the executive through initiatives like he and Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), daring the courts to defy him, and threatening consequences if they do. El Salvador’s state of exception has only been in place for three years — ages for those in it, a blink in the timeline of global politics — but it’s been long enough for democratic norms to crumble virtually unopposed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	In a 2023 speech before <a href="https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/nayibbukeleunga78.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the United Nations General Assembly</a>, Bukele defended his attacks against El Salvador’s judiciary, telling the international community that if his party “had left the same general prosecutor as before, if we had left the magistrates of the previous chamber, if we had left the judges, who many protected and who even issued convictions when we removed them, we would still be the murder capital of the world. If we had listened to them, we would still be losing thousands of Salvadorans to terrorists.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Bukele made similar statements during a decidedly Trumpian speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last year. He <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfgSshYXD98" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">received raucous applause</a> after telling the audience that in order to “cleanse our society,” his government embraced the “unthinkable” and removed “corrupt judges, and corrupt attorneys, and prosecutors,” who — according to him — were practically supportive of the violent criminals he sought to thwart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>
	Trump’s inauguration earlier this year brought with it a purge of career prosecutors and federal attorneys who the president deemed disloyal to the cause, and now threats of impeachment or investigation against jurists who don’t let him have his way. Foreign student activists opposing American policies toward Israel and Gaza have been arrested, stripped of their visas, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/31/us/what-we-know-college-activists-immigration-hnk/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and deported</a>. “It’s the classic authoritarian proposition that ‘I as the leader am uniquely equipped to solve this crisis and everyone else needs to get out of my way,’” says Bullock.

	</p>




<p>
	“Leaders constantly need emergencies in order to justify the concentration of power, the capture of the state itself, and also they need to create the image of an internal enemy,” Bullock explains.

<p>
	Trump has centered his political career around a drumbeat of fear mongering over “invasions” by criminal gangs and undocumented migrants, positioning himself as the only one who can combat them. The beat grew especially intense down the stretch of his most recent presidential campaign. In October, just weeks before the election, Trump drew <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-enemy-from-within-democrats-evil-1235135375/">widespread backlash</a> after repeatedly stating that he intended to squash the threat of the “enemy from within.” One of his first actions upon assuming office in January was to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign an executive order</a> declaring a national emergency at the southern border, and he’s since used this imaginary war against immigrants as a predicate for a fascist crackdown — one many Americans never thought they’d see.</p>



<p>
	“This deceptive bargain between security and rights will only take the American people down a pathway of loss of rights for all people,” Bullock adds. “A leader who offers that bargain to their population doesn’t do it out of a concern for security, rather to concentrate power and to capture institutions.”</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" tabindex="-1"><article><!--[--><img src="https://joshcollinsworth.com/images/post_images/zen.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080"><!--]-->  <p><b>Published:</b> April 4, 2025 </p> <!----><p>Yesterday, like just about every other evening, my wife and I put our kid to bed, and sat down on the couch together. But for the first time in months, I picked up my laptop instead of my Switch.</p> <p>I don’t remember the last time I took a new side project at all seriously, but a glance through my projects folder indicates it’s been at least a year since I spent more than a day or two on one. I found a few I didn’t even remember starting, it’s been so long. Some I hadn’t even taken far enough to demonstrate whatever basic idea must’ve been in my head at the time; abandoned before they were even working.</p> <p>So it’s been a while. I haven’t exactly been feeling inspired since…</p> <p>Well, since I don’t know when.</p> <p>Maybe I’ve been depressed, or burned out. I don’t know. I haven’t been at my best; that’s all I really know for sure. It’s not that things have been bad, exactly, but they haven’t been easy, either.</p> <p>Whatever the reason: I realize now I’ve let it push my consumption-to-creation ratio wildly out of balance.</p> <p>I’ve spent pretty much every night in recent memory burning through video games, and I finally, inevitably, hit the wall with that approach. I wasn’t interested, or compelled. The fun things weren’t even fun anymore. The diminishing returns finally dwindled to the point I felt like I <em>had</em> to try something new.</p> <p>Something I’d been resisting.</p> <p>Something I was afraid of.</p> <p>I’m not sure why.</p> <p>Maybe I was scared to fail. Maybe I didn’t think I had a good enough idea. Maybe I didn’t think I was inspired enough yet.</p> <p>Maybe I thought it would be too hard.</p> <p>But finally, the pain of continuing with my existing approach outweighed the fears of change. So, for the first time in many months, I spun up a new project.</p> <p>It was a SvelteKit project, incidentally, although that’s entirely beside the point. I considered just creating HTML/CSS/JavaScript files and building from scratch. I also considered learning something new.</p> <p>I don’t think what I picked matters, though; I think it just matters that I picked <em>something</em>.</p> <!----> <p>It doesn’t matter <em>what</em> the project is; it matters <em>that</em> it is.</p><!----><!----> <p>Soon enough, I was staring at a blank white page with minimal black text in my browser; the web equivalent of a blank canvas.</p> <p>I began to write the variables I knew I’d need. I grabbed some things here and there from other projects. I added some minimal CSS classes just to get things roughly laid out. Functions and event handlers soon followed.</p> <p>A loose demo began to take shape.</p> <p>An hour or two went by, as I prototyped the idea. I tried some things; they didn’t work; I tried some others. I changed my approach, then changed it again, free to do whatever I saw fit, free to explore in any direction I liked.</p> <p>This morning, I tried a few more things. And though I’m not sure the core idea really works, or is anything special, simply <em>allowing</em> myself to explore it felt like being able to finally take a deep breath after a long time underwater.</p> <p>I felt something in that freedom. I felt a simple, understated joy that I hadn’t felt in a long time; a candle in a long-darkened room.</p> <hr> <p>Maybe you can relate. Maybe there’s an idea that’s been in your head.</p> <p>Maybe not; maybe you just haven’t created something in a long time. Maybe what you’re doing isn’t working for you. Maybe you just aren’t having <em>fun</em> anymore.</p> <p>I don’t know your situation, and I’m certainly not qualified to give out helpful life advice.</p> <p>But I know that when <em>I’m</em> not creating something, a part of me withers. And I think, in some way, we all have that compulsion inside of us.</p> <p>I don’t think <em>what</em> we create is the important part. I don’t even think it needs to be something “creative” to begin with.</p> <p><strong>Don’t limit your view of creation to things considered creative</strong>—or, for that matter, to things you’ve done before. These days I make apps, but I used to make entirely different things, and got the same pleasure from those.</p> <p>Some days, all I want to create is something tangible and functional. Last summer, my wife and I built new steps to our patio door, and even though that was well beyond both my range of experience and the typical definition of creativity, I found the work more engaging and compelling than anything else I had going on at the time.</p> <p>Sometimes it’s artistic; sometimes it’s not; other times, what we create isn’t a tangible thing at all.</p> <p>What you create might be words. It might be relationships, or time and space for others. Sometimes it’s the intangible places we create together. Sometimes we create experiences. Sometimes we create homes, communities, and families, of both the literal and figurative varieties.</p> <p>Sometimes we just create <em>change</em>.</p> <hr> <p><strong>I think we exist to bring new things into existence</strong>. If you ask me, to the extent there <em>is</em> a meaning of life, that’s it. We exist to create. It lights us up in a way nothing else does, putting something new into our world—and in doing so, fundamentally changing it, in whatever way, however big or small.</p> <p><em>What</em> you create, and <em>how</em> you do it, is entirely up to you. That’s the beauty of it.</p> <!----> <p>Enjoying the freedom to explore possibilities, and happily follow any compelling whim—that’s the blissful zen of a good side project.</p><!----><!----> <p>It’s having a carved-out space in your life where you, and only you, get to make the choices.</p> <p>Nobody else. You might have to share everything outside this little room, but everything in here is yours and yours alone.</p> <p>You don’t have to listen to any other voices here, except that quiet one inside of you that’s gently urging you to do the thing you know you need to do. You don’t owe it to anyone to choose anything—except yourself, and what you honestly feel.</p> <p>You don’t need to know where it’s going to lead. For that matter, it doesn’t have to lead <em>anywhere</em>. Nothing ever has to come of it. It’s ok if this project never even exists, as far as anyone else is concerned. Failure isn’t failure; it’s part of the process. It’s done when you’re done with it.</p> <p>The important part is that you explored that little corner of the map, and uncovered what was there. It’s ok if that was nothing. The exploration was the success. Now you know better where to explore next.</p> <p>So whatever your side project is: I encourage you to pick it up, and let that part of you exist (again).</p> <p>Happy wandering.</p><!---->  <!--[--> <!--]--></article><!----></div></div>]]></description>

<p><span>8-pin Linux</span></p><h2>An interactive-speed Linux computer on a tiny board you can easily build with only 3 8-pin chips</h2>


<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I've long been experimenting with minimal computers that can run Linux. I've flirted with the <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=35.%20Linux4004">extreme</a> <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit">low-end</a> and with <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">fun form factors</a>. I felt like there was a place for another fun experiment: a simple-to-build kit computer using only 8-pin chips.

<h2>A minimal computer</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plAssembled.jpg"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plAssembledSmall.jpg"></a>

<a name="_TOC_7ee4079a39b0cfcb828325af6aa657e0"></a></p><h3>Initial Thoughts</h3>
<p>There was a time when one could order a kit and assemble a computer at home. It would do just about what a contemporary store-bought computer could do. This time is long gone. Modern computers are made of hundreds of huge complex chips, with no public datasheets, with many hundreds of watts of power supplied to them over complex power delivery topologies. It does not help that modern operating systems require gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of storage, and always-on internet connectivity to properly spy on you. But, what if one tried to fit a modern computer into a kit that one could easily assemble at home?
</p>
<p>What is the minimum to be considered a "modern computer"? I would say being able to run Debian Linux, <span>vi</span>, <span>gcc</span>, and <span>make</span> is close enough, so that became the goal. Thanks to my previous exploits, I knew that this could be accomplished in 8MB of RAM and with 1 MIPS of CPU. Storage is easy: SD cards easily provide storage of any size. A serial port is still the de-facto method for easily interfacing with an embedded system, but as computers no longer have serial ports, USB-serial takes its place. Thus, I had the target: at least 8MB of RAM, at least 1 MIPS of CPU, SD card, USB.
</p>
<p>On the hardware front, I wanted to design something that could be assembled by someone with little-to-no soldering experience and a RadioShack 45W soldering iron, something small, cute, and cheap. Chips with fewer pins are easier to solder, so I settled on using <b>only chips with 8 pins</b>, as a fun challenge. Since all chips need at least a power supply and a ground pin, this limits each chip to no more than 6 useful pins. This decision turned out to inform a lot of the design's features and limitations. Physically, I decided to make it a small circular board, with a board-edge USB-C connector on top, as you can see on the image here. That is the final working design, assembled using the directions below, by me, actually using a RadioShack 45W soldering iron.
</p>
<h3>Parts Selection</h3>
<p>There really are not too many 8-pin chips that can speak USB. One and a half options exist. The first was the very cute <a href="https://prolificusa.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/DS-23181002_PL2303GL.pdf">PL2303GL</a>, which is a USB-to-serial bridge that requires <em>NO external components at all</em>, and even provides 100mA of 3.3V regulated output. Super convenient! It works precisely as promised. I am a fan! Prolific even have drivers for all major and minor operating systems available easily. Sadly, on macOS, they <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pl2303-serial/id1624835354?mt=12">need to be installed from the AppStore</a>, but it is a simple process. It should be noted that its predecessor, the PL2303SA could also be considered, but it is EOL, and thus not worth mentioning. So, what is meant by "half a chip"? Well, thanks to <a href="https://www.obdev.at/products/vusb/index.html">V-USB</a>, The <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/attiny85">ATTINYx5</a> series chips can also speak USB. It is only USB low-speed, and uses a lot of CPU time, but it works. The problem is that all existing USB-serial protocols require bulk endpoints, and USB low-speed is prohibited by the USB spec from using BULK endpoints. To stay spec-compliant this would then require designing my own comms protocol using interrupt endpoints and writing drivers for all major OSs. No fun. Luckily, <em>ALL</em> major OSs do not enforce this no-bulk-EPs-on-USB-low-speed thing. It <em>just works</em>, and implementing ACM to act as a serial port works. So, there they are - the two options for USB interfacing.
</p>
<p>There were not really any questions with regards to the RAM to use. SOIC-8 PSRAMs are the solution. <a href="https://www.issi.com/us/product-cellular-ram.shtml#jump1">ISSI</a>, <a href="https://www.apmemory.com/products/psram-iot-ram/">APMEMORY</a>, and <a href="https://www.vilsion.com/VTI7064MSM.shtml">Vilsion</a> make them. All of them have been promising 16MB chips for a year now, and none have delivered, so it is probably fair to assume that they are all bullshitting. However, 8MB parts are easily available for a few bucks at the usual retailers, so it was decided to make it work with 8MB of RAM.
</p>
<p>The last question was: which microcontroller to use? <a href="https://www.mouser.com/c/semiconductors/embedded-processors-controllers/microcontrollers-mcu/?number%20of%20i%2Fos=2%20I%2FO~~6%20I%2FO&amp;package%20%2F%20case=DFN-8~~DIP-8%7C~MSOP-8%7C~PDIP-8%7C~QFN-8~~SO8N-8%7C~SOIC-8~~SO-N-8%7C~SOT-23-8~~SOT-8%7C~TSSOP-8~~UDFN-8%7C~USON-8%7C~WDFN-8%7C~WSON-8&amp;rp=semiconductors%2Fembedded-processors-controllers%2Fmicrocontrollers-mcu%7C~Number%20of%20I%2FOs%7C~Package%20%2F%20Case">A parametric search</a> presented a few families of options:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PIC16F is a messy old 8-bit architecture that can really only be programmed well in assembly. There is a C compiler, but it produces shit code (not its fault - the architecture is not well suited for C). These clock up to 32MHz, but as they take 4 cycles per instruction, the real performance is 8MIPS at 8 bits per op at best. The fact that this is an accumulator-based arch means that most things take more instructions. Overall, not a performant option. The largest code space available is 8192 instructions' worth (14KB), and the largest RAM available is 1KB.</li>
<li>Renesas R5F series is a weird little 16-bit core they call RL78. There is a passable GCC port for it too. The instructions <a href="https://www.renesas.com/en/document/mah/rl78-family-users-manual-software-rev230">take a variable number of cycles between 1 and 6</a>. For typical code it'll average an IPC of 0.55, and at 16MHz at most. They do not overclock well either. At least these cores are 16 bits wide, so they can do more per cycle than the PIC. In the 8-pin package, the largest possible flash size is 8KB. RAM? 1KB. As instructions are all <em>at least</em> 2 bytes, this option is limited to 4096 instructions at best, possibly less. It would be fair to expect 8MIPS at 16 bits per op.</li>
<li>PSoC1 series uses a core Infineon (née Cypress) calls <a href="https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-PSoC_CY8C20x24_CY8C20x34_Technical_Reference_Manual_(TRM)-AdditionalTechnicalInformation-v08_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f904c2b7cc0">M8C</a>. Instruction encoding is pretty dense, with many instructions being only a byte long. Sadly, the performance is not there. No instruction takes fewer than 4 cycles, and some take over 10 cycles, including function calls. The maximum clock rate is 24MHz, with overclocks of 28MHz possible. But at an average of 6 cycles per instruction in a typical program, this only nets ~4.7MIPS at 8 bits per op. Not great. The maximum flash size is 4KB, and RAM is only 256 bytes. This is ... not great.</li>
<li>Somehow, ZiLOG still exists, and they sell 8-pin microcontrollers based on the core they call <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/240/PS0243-2584610.pdf">eZ8</a>. In the 8-pin package, the maximum flash size is 8KB, and RAM is 1KB. The core seems to use variable-length instructions, but they are quite slow. Most seem to take 2-4 cycles to fetch and then 3 or more to execute. Jumps take a lot more. Overall, expecting this core to get an IPC of over 0.2 is probably asking for too much. The maximum clock rate for these microcontrollers is 20Hz, so that should be about 4 MIPS at 8 bits per op. A new low.</li>
<li>NXP's <a href="https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/302/MC9S08QG8-3139058.pdf">S08CPUv2</a> core makes an appearance in a few chips here. It is an 8-bit accumulator-based architecture that clocks up to 40MHz. The maximum flash is 8KB, RAM size is 512 bytes - tight. Instructions are 1-4 bytes long. While some of them execute in 1 cycle, most take 2 or more. My guess at this thing's IPC in typical scenarios would be 0.6 or so. It is 8-bits wide. Expected perf is thus around 24MIPS at 8 bits per op.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.st.com/resource/en/programming_manual/pm0044-stm8-cpu-programming-manual-stmicroelectronics.pdf">STM8</a>-based chips are an option. They are 8-bits-wide, run at 16MHz, have a pretty compact instruction encoding, and feature very high IPCs near 0.8, if you are lucky and keep the prefetch queue full. There is a C compiler available for these, too. In the 8-pin package, the maximum amount of flash is 8KB, and 1.5KB of RAM. Expected perf is around 13MIPS at 8 bits per op.</li>
<li>MSP430 (aka: the 2000s' PDP11) is represented in the search results too. Sadly, with only 2KB of flash and 128bytes of RAM, none of these chips are of much use for this project - they are simply too tiny.</li>
<li>There is, of course, AVR: 20MHz at 1.0 IPC, overclockable to around 25MHz easily, 8KB of flash and 512 bytes of RAM in the ATTINY85. There is an active GCC port, and the instructions are designed in the modern day and age, producing very compact and efficient code, none of that "move things into accumulator, now move them out of the accumulator" nonsense. This is the best option so far. As an extra bonus, if used for USB, then the entire board could be just two chips: the AVR for USB and CPU, and the RAM chip for RAM. Tempting. However, as V-USB needs about 1.5KB of flash and a hundred bytes of RAM, that leaves rather little to the emulator. It likely would not easily fit.</li>
<li>My old friend, the <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=23.%20PSoC4">PSoC4</a> is also represented in the results. A 16MHz ARM Cortex-M0 core basically obliterates all of the above options on performance trivially. It will execute most instructions in a single cycle (but branches take 3) and it is 32-bits wide. Flash size is 8KB officially, but, as I <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=24.%20PSoC4%20confidential">had documented</a>, really there is 16KB. RAM really is just 2KB in size. The major downfall of this option is that it uses three pins for supplying power to the chip, leaving only 5 pins available for I/O. Being already short on pins, giving one up is a lot to ask!</li>
<li>TI's new <a href="https://www.ti.com/microcontrollers-mcus-processors/arm-based-microcontrollers/arm-cortex-m0-mcus/overview.html">MSPM0C series</a> is a possibility. The Cortex-M0+ core is even faster than a Cortex-M0 by virtue of taking one cycle fewer to branch. In an emulator this matters! 16KB of flash, 1KB of RAM, and all 6 pins usable as I/O. What's not to like? Well, one pin is open-drain only, which sucks. This makes the pin unsuitable for fast output. The speed is 24MHz, with a little bit of overclockability available. However, without a PLL, this chip cannot overclock far. Still, this is now the best option, easily outperforming the AVR.
</li>
<li>The last option (as using STM's chips should always be the last option due to their habit of not publishing accurate and complete errata sheets) is the STM32G0 series. The STM32G030 is immediately discarded as an option, since one of the pins is a permanent RESET input, leaving only 5 I/Os. The <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/511-STM32G031J4M6">STM32G031J4M6</a> seems like a possibility. It is a relatively recent chip, so there is hope that STM got their shit together and fixed some of the usual myriad of issues their chips contain. Then again, as the plan called for minimal use of on-chip peripherals, maybe it'll be fine? 32KB of flash, 8KB of RAM! Those are serious numbers, completely obliterating the previous contestants. The Cortex-M0+ core makes it a tie for the best so far. Officially, this chip clocks at 64MHz. With effort, it'll overclock to 80MHz. With more effort (see below), it'll run at 150MHz. Assuming one can avoid the errata, this seems like the clear winner by far, as much as I hate it. Maybe one day there'll be an RP2354 in an SOIC-8 package with 6 PIO pins?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Designing the hardware</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plSchematic.png"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plSchematicSmall.png"></a>
<a name="_TOC_e4f7809d0d0a71f1f6d8a954f6ed011b"></a></p><h3>The Console</h3>
<p>The UART pins cannot be combined with anything. Any attempts to combine UART RX with something would create the possibility of missing some incoming data while the "something" is going on. Combining UART TX with something, no matter how fast that "something" is, is problematic as well. Any low pulse would be seen as a character by the PC. For brief lows it would be seen as a <span>0xFF</span> byte. In theory, parity could be enabled and used to hide this, but this is not surefire. Plus, who uses parity in 2024? Really, UART pins, lacking a higher-level protocol, chip select, or a separate clock are basically un-combinable with anything else. There go two of the 6 pins. Oh well...
</p>
<h3>RAM</h3>
<p>All the SPI PSRAMS support QSPI mode for speed. Sadly, QSPI requires 6 pins and only 4 are left. OK, most of them also support dual-SPI, wherein <span>MISO</span> and <span>MOSI</span> are used concurrently to send two bits of data per clock unidirectionally. This is twice the speed of normal SPI, just as you'd imagine. As an extra credit, it does not require any more pins than normal SPI and is compatible with sharing the SPI bus with other devices, since they would not expect to read <span>MOSI</span> or drive <span>MISO</span> when deselected.
</p>
<p>STM32G031 does not support dual-SPI. It could be bit-banged, of course. But, could it be done fast enough to beat the hardware SPI unit? The hardware SPI unit can run at one-half of the CPU clock and mate to the DMA unit for nonstop transmission/reception. To match this via CPU, would require bit-banging dual-SPI using no more than 4 cycles per clock. This is barely possible, given a few preparatory steps. Doing it any faster than that is impossible. Since the best that can be done is to match the hardware SPI unit, why bother? RAM will be accessed using garden-variety SPI. That uses four of the remaining four pins. Damn...
</p>
<h3>SD Card</h3>
<p>So, here was the situation: no pins left and still an SD card to attach. SD cards speak SPI, so one more pin to give it a chip select signal would be enough, but there were no pins left. A few options were considered. The simplest idea was to include an inverter on the RAM's <span>nCS</span> and use that as the SD card's <span>nCS</span>. This was prototyped and it worked somewhat well. The issue with this approach is two-fold. First of all, some cards did not like being selected and deselected with no data bytes being sent to them, but that is precisely what two RAM accesses would look like to them. Not many cards had this issue, so it is not a showstopper. The second issue is that the inverter is either an extra IC or an extra transistor. The more components the board has, the harder it is for a novice to assemble. This solution was put aside, labeled "worst case". A search of a better one went on.
</p>
<p>This device will not produce data very quickly, so it is safe to run the <span>UART</span> super slowly. So, then the UART TX pin can be low-pass-filtered on the way to the USB-to-serial chip. That same pin can then be used for SD card's <span>nCS</span>, as long as the commands are short and the clock rate is high enough that the selection time is below what the low-pass filter will permit through. This solution is workable but fragile. Once the math is worked out for the baudrate necessary to permit card initialization as per spec, it gets sadder. The UART would need to be run at a 300 bps rate or slower to make this work. And even then, it is fragile if the card decides to be slow, since the SD spec's SPI chapter does not technically allow deselecting the card while waiting for it to read data. No, this was even worse than the first option.
</p>
<p>Before surrendering to the first option, there was a crazier yet option to consider. Would the SPI RAM at all mind being selected and then deselected with no commands or data in between? Experimentation provides the answer: no. This test passed on all the SPI RAM chips. Why? Well, besides SPI, SD cards also speak the SDIO protocol. Instead of using four unidirectional wires, this protocol uses one unidirectional <span>CLK</span> signal and two bidirectional signals: <span>CMD</span> and <span>DAT</span>. The four-bit-wide version uses three more data pins, but that does not matter here. Unlike SPI, this protocol is not quite documented in the public SD documentation, but it is not too hard to figure out. Using one fewer pins is nice, but there were <em>no</em> free pins, and this approach would have needed three, so this was not immediately useful. Before trying to make it <em>useful</em>, it had to first be make to work at all. After some time, this was done and a working implementation of SDIO 1-bit protocol was produced. It successfully initialized and accessed all SD cards tried. Cool.
</p>
<p>So, which pins could be combined with SDIO's three? After much thinking, the solution is obvious. RAM's <span>nCS</span> can be the SD card's <span>CLK</span>. RAM's <span>CLK</span> can be the SD card's <span>CMD</span>. RAM's <span>MOSI</span> can be the SD card's <span>DAT</span>. Try and figure out all the possible interactions with each device and what that would look like to the other, to convince yourself that it will work safely. When the RAM is selected, the SD card will see its <span>CLK</span> go down, when RAM is deselected, the SD card will see its <span>CLK</span> go up. The RAM's SPI is configured for mode 3, which means that its <span>CLK</span> idles high. This, in turn, means that every RAM access, no matter how short, is seen by the SD card as a single bit sent to it, a <span>1</span> bit. This is the idle state of the SDIO's <span>CMD</span> line between commands, and this is safe. SD cards do not drive or read the <span>DAT</span> line between commands so the movement of the RAM's <span>MOSI</span> will be ignored. Good so far. Accessing the SD card requires toggling its <span>CLK</span> line, while reading or writing its <span>CMD</span> and <span>DAT</span> lines. To the RAM, this will look like it is being selected and deselected with nothing in between happening. This is safe. Cool!
</p>
<p>It should be noted that this will only work if the entire SD transaction is done to completion at a time without any intervening RAM accesses. This means that multi-block reads or writes cannot be used. This is acceptable given the pin deficit. Well, there it is, a potentially working solution! Experimental verification followed. Success! Of course, the STM32G031 does not have the proper pinout to use any hardware unit for this, so the SD accesses are entirely bit-banged. This is acceptable, and my assembly code to do this achieved about 14 CPU cycles per bit throughput. Overall, not too bad.
</p>
<h3>The Console again</h3>
<p>Now that it was clearly established that all the I/O could, at least in theory, fit into 6 pins, it was time to assign things to pins. Some of that was trivial: the RAM needs real SPI so those are the pins. The SD card shares the RAM's pins so that's clear too. Left over were pins 7 and 8. These pins make up the SWD interface, which was convenient for early debugging. Also, by process of elimination, they needed to be the serial port. Pin 8, as <span>A14</span> can act as <span>USART2.TX</span>, and with USART's "pin swap" functionality enabled, this can be turned into <span>USART2.RX</span>. This is good, since UART receive is a pain to do without hardware assistance. That leaves pin 7 as my <span>TX</span> pin. This pin has no alternate functions related to any USART at all. Well, luckily, it is not too hard to bit-bang UART transmission. This is ironic - an earlier approach called for an as-slow-as-possible UART baudrate. Bit-banging UART calls for an as-fast-as-possible baudrate since the entire world needs to stop while the transmission is going on. Sending every character at 115,200bps will take 87 microseconds. In theory, a very slow baudrate could be used, with timer-driven interrupts use to send bits of each character, but the jitter in interrupt timing could cause issues. Anyways, most of the time the board is not outputting anything, so it is OK as is. Bit-banging UART transmit works well. Pins are assigned. Time to get to the software.
</p>
<p>But, you might say, what about initial flashing? Surely STM's bootloader will not support using these weird pins for initial flashing? Indeed, that is the case. This is why the board has four solder bridges that configure the wiring for the serial port. In one configuration, the bootloader will work but RAM and SD card will not and cannot work, in the other, the ROM bootloader is no longer useful but the project will boot. Luckily, this project includes its own bootloader, so the ROM bootloader is not needed after the initial flashing.
</p>

<h2>The software story</h2>
<h3>The Emulator</h3>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plConsole.png"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plConsoleSmall.png"></a></p><p>I <a href="https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&amp;proj=33.%20LinuxCard">did already have</a> a MIPS emulator that could boot Linux, written in ARMv6M assembly. Reusing this would be trivial. In search of more speed, I actually wrote a MIPS-to-ARMv6M JIT, which worked well. The tragedy is that it was too big (compiling to 46KB of code) and did not produce that much speed gain with only 6KB of translation cache to be of use on this project. It was shelved, until another time.
</p>
<p>The 32KB of flash in the STM32G31 was split into an 8KB area for the bootloader and a 24KB area for the main code. The rest was simply polish. The main emulator code remains as it was before.
</p>
<h3>The Bootloader</h3>
<p>Why was there a need for a bootloader? Well, there were no pins left for debugging, there was a need to find a way to update the firmware to fix bugs or add features. The simplest solution would be a bootloader that can use the SD card, understand FAT filesystem, and apply an update from it if it finds it. That is precisely the solution chosen. The reason that the bootloader is a whopping 8KB in size (well, actually 6.5KB, but flash blocks are 2KB so it gets rounded up) is that it must include a full SDIO driver, FAT filesystem driver, flash writing code, and lots of logging to help debug any issues that come up. Of course, it also includes a copy of the bit-banged UART transmit code. The word at offset 16 in the application image is considered a version number and an update will only be applied if its version is higher than the current application's version and it passes some basic checks. The byte at offset 8 in the bootloader is the bootloader version. This is not used for any way other than displaying in the main app's boot text. The firmware update is applied if it passes all tests and is called <span>FIRMWARE.BIN</span>.
</p>
<p>The bootloader itself runs after the chip is reset, so it runs at 16MHz. The main application can run at various CPU speeds, to allow everyone to experiment with overclocking. However, there needs to be a failsafe way to change the speed, and manually recompiling the image each time seemed like too much of a drag. This is solved  easily. The bootloader already mounts the FAT filesystem on the card to look for firmware updates. While doing that, it also looks for any file or directory whose name begins with <span>CLOCK</span>. If found, the numbers following the name are used the clock rate for the main application. If the number is out sane range (32-200MHz), or no such file is found, 132 MHz is used. Yes, 132MHz. More on that later.
</p>
<h3>Card partitioning and the boot process</h3>
<p>Same as in my previous MIPS-emulating projects, the boot process is reminiscent of the PC boot process. The first sector of the card is read into the first bytes of RAM and jumped to. It may then load the next stage. It does so by looking for a partition with type <span>0xBB</span> and loading it into ram at address <span>0x80001000</span> and then jumping to it. There, lives the second-stage bootloader. It is large enough to contain logging and console output. It will look for a partition marked as active, attempt to mount it as <span>FAT16</span>, and find a file there called <span>VMLINUX</span>. If it is found, it is loaded as an ELF file and its entry point is jumped to. If this is a valid Linux kernel, it will then boot. The commandline passed to the kernel is embedded in the bootloader since it is not expected to change. It instructs the kernel to mount <span>/dev/pvd3</span> as root and use <span>/sbin/uMIPSinit</span> as init. It will try to mount <span>/dev/pvd1</span> as <span>/boot</span>
</p>
<p>A careful read of the above paragraph would show that while the rootfs needs to be the third partition, no other order is specified or matters. This is on purpose. For this project, the FAT partition is first, the bootloader partition second, and rootfs third. Why? When an SD card with multiple partitions is inserted, Windows and macOS will mount the first partition. Linux will mount them all. This means that (1) the FAT partition can be used to easily get files in and out of this machine as they are also visible to the booted Linux in <span>/boot</span> and (2) clock speed changing/overclocking is easy from the host machine <em>and/or</em> from the booted Linux itself.
</p>
<p>The first thing the bootloader does is simply wait six seconds without doing anything. This is done before reconfiguring the pins. The delay allows for some time to attach an SWD debugger, if so desired (the board has a 4-pin header for that). After this delay, the pins are reconfigured and there are no more pins assigned to SWD, and thus a debugger cannot be attached anymore. As a secondary backup, the bootloader configures the option bytes to allow forcing the chip to boot from ROM by raising the <span>BOOT0</span> pin (pin 8). It also programs the option bytes to disable the reset pin (it is being used as a GPIO) and to disable the BOR (it is of no use here). Then it will try to initialize comms with the SD card and check for updates, then it will boot.
</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>STM32G031 is specified to run at 64MHz, so why all this talk about running it at 150MHz? Well, with the proper application of dark magic, STM32G031 overclocks quite well. The CPU core runs from an internal regulator whose voltage is adjusted using the <span>PWR-&gt;CR1</span> register. STM documents two settings: <span>VOS2</span> (corresponding to <span>Vcore</span> of 1.0V) where the chip can only be run up to 16MHz and <span>VOS1</span> (corresponding to <span>Vcore</span> of 1.2V) where the chip can only be run up to 64MHz. Indeed, at <span>VOS1</span>, the chip will not run well past about 75MHz. A respectable overclock, but not that exciting. However.... older documentation (and documentation of similar chips) also mentions <span>VOS0</span>, corresponding to <span>Vcore</span> of 1.35V. What if one tries? Well, what do you know? It works, and the chip gets a <em>LOT</em> more overclockable. Now, most instances of the chip run well at 136MHz, and some get to 180MHz. You do need to manage the flash wait states correctly, since the flash memory will not magically get any faster. The extra wait states do eat into the speed gains, but it is still worth it.
</p>
<p>At 148MHz host CPU speed, the emulated MIPS CPU is approximately equivalent to a 1.65MHz MIPS R3000 with FPU disabled. It is not a speed beast, but it does boot in about a minute, and things like <span>vi</span>, <span>make</span>, <span>objdump</span>, and <span>gcc</span> work. This is a full Debian system, so you can bring in <span>.deb</span> packages via <span>/boot</span> and install them even. It all works.
</p>

<h2>Assembly</h2>
<p><a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plNakedBoard.png"><img alt="An empty 8-pin Linux PCB" src="https://dmitry.gr/images/8plNakedBoard.png"></a>
<a name="_TOC_7a077d612f50226cff67a767f4b8af00"></a></p><h3>Acquisition</h3>
<p>You can buy the parts yourself and get a board made by your favourite board house (all the things you need are in the downloads below), or (I hope) you'll be able to buy a kit soon. I am looking for a company that wants to sell the kit. <a href="mailto:contact@dmitry.gr">Contact me</a> if you have a lead on this. They would make great gifts!
</p>
<h3>Initial assembly</h3>
<p>The part you came here for: how to build your own. Here you see the board you are likely holding in your hands. It is pretty easy to assemble, and this is by design. The first thing you solder in should be the SD card socket. Line it up carefully in the box and solder the pins one at a time, then solder the four corner pads that hold it to the board. These take a bit more heat so be patient. Next, solder in all the capacitors. There are four and they are all the same value so it is easy. They go into slots labeled <span>C1</span> through <span>C4</span>. Next up, solder in all the resistors. They are also all the same value for ease of assembly. They go into places labeled <span>R2</span> through <span>R7</span> (there is no R4). Do not fill in slots <span>R101</span>, <span>R102</span>, <span>R201</span>, and <span>R202</span> yet.
</p>
<p>Next up, solder in the microcontroller (STM32G031J6). It goes into the place labeled <span>U1</span>. Direction matters here. On these, the first pin is labeled by a little image of the STM logo. On the board, pin 1 is labeled using a small circle inside the outline as well as outside of it. Rotate the chip correctly and solder it in. Next, solder in the USB-to-serial chip (PL2303GL). It goes into the slot labeled <span>U3</span>. On this chip, pin one is indicated by a little dimple in the corner on top of the chip. Line that up with the board's pin 1 marker and solder it in.
</p>
<h3>Secondary assembly</h3>
<p>At this point in time, you must program the bootloader into the microcontroller. To do this, use STM's "flasher" utility. You'll need a USB-C cable. To connect the proper pins to the serial port, you'll need to use two pieces of wire (or just solder) to bridge the places labeled <span>R101</span> and <span>R201</span> on the board. Make sure you do <em>not</em> have an SD card inserted into the onboard socket and you did not yet solder-in the RAM chip. Then, plug the cable into your computer and insert the board carefully <em>into</em> the USB-C end of the cable. The PC should detect a virtual serial port and install drivers automatically. Now you'll need the flasher utility. You may get it <a href="https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/flasher-stm32.html">here</a> for windows. There is an open-source alternative with other platform support <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/stm32flash/">here</a>. If you build that tool, the process is the usual one: <span>./configure &amp;&amp; make</span>. Using it is easy too: <span>./stm32flash -w BOOTLOADER.BIN -v /dev/ttyUSB0</span>, assuming those names and paths are correct for your use case. If you have an SWD debugger you may instead use it to program the bootloader into the chip. From the download package, grab "BOOTLOADER.BIN" and have that programmed into the chip.
</p>
<p>At this point, remove the solder bridges or wires you used to bridge <span>R101</span> and <span>R201</span> and instead bridge <span>R102</span> and <span>R202</span>. This is the proper final configuration for the serial port pins. Solder in the RAM chip now (APS6408 or VTI7064), marked <span>U2</span>. Pin 1 on this chip is also marked with a small dimple. Match that up with the small circle on the board and solder the chip in. This concludes the hardware assembly.
</p>
<h3>Flashing the main firmware and first boot</h3>
<p>Use a disk imaging tool (<a href="https://win32diskimager.org/">WIN32 DISK IMAGER</a> for windows, built-in "Disk Utility" for macOS, dd for Linux) to write the provided disk image unto an SD card of at least 1GB in size. This image includes the first-stage MIPS bootloader, the second-stage MIPS bootloader, a partition with the Linux kernel and a copy of the firmware, and a debian rootfs. After the card is written, eject it and reinsert it. Your PC should now recognize the FAT filesystem and mount it. Drop the main firmware into it from the download package, named FIRMWARE.BIN. This will allow the bootloader to pick it up and self-flash it on first boot. This step is not necessary if you did not rebuild it, as the provided image already contains that file there. It is, however, safe to do it anyways. You're done!
</p>
<p>Insert the SD card, connect the cable to the PC again, open your favourite serial terminal, and configure it for 115,200 bps, 8N1. After a few seconds you'll see text appear as the various stages of bootloaders run. The very first time, STM32's fuses will be programmed and you may need to unplug and replug the USB-C cable to continue the boot process. This will only need to happen once since the fuses are nonvolatile. After about 20 seconds, the Linux kernel boot messages will start. The boot process will take about a minute. At the end you'll end up at a shall prompt. As there is only 8MB of RAM, making <span>swapon /swapfile</span> your first command is strongly suggested. This will take a few dozen seconds to complete, but after it you'll have swap and ability to run a lot more things. Play around. Enjoy!
</p>


<h2>Downloads and Use</h2>
<h3>The files</h3>
<p>The main download is [<a href="https://dmitry.gr/images/uMIPS.8PL.zip">here</a>]. That is an archive that contains everything you need. The <span>schematics</span> directory contains the schematics, <span>gerbers</span> contains the gerbers you'd need to have boards made, and <span>srcs</span> contains the sources of the emulator and the bootloader. In the <span>binaries</span> directory you'll find the SD card image (<span>SD.img</span>) that you'll want to write directory to your card, <span>BOOTLOADER.BIN</span> is the bootloader you'll write to the chip in the middle of assembling the project, and <span>FIRMWARE.BIN</span> is a pre-built firmware image (a copy of which is already in <span>SD.img</span>'s first partition). 
</p>
<h3>Using it</h3>
<p>The device boots to a shell prompt using <span>sh</span>. You may start bash if you wish - it works. To not run out of RAM, as mentioned above, it is advisable to enable swap. A pre-made swapfile is in the image, simply run <span>swapon /swapfile</span> as one of your first commands. The effective CPU speed is about 1.5MHz assuming you're running the MCU at 120MHz, so go keep in mind that commands will take time. Compiling a simple program with gcc will take a few minutes, but it will work. Provided examples include two Mandelbrot set generators (floating point and fixed point), compiled and binary both.
</p>
<p>The usual tools are installed: <span>vim</span>, <span>make</span>, and <span>gcc</span>. All the usual debian packages are there too, and you can load more things using the shared FAT16 partition on the SD card. Under Linux it is mounted under <span>/boot</span>

<blockquote><p>I feel very comfortable working in a company where you can’t touch anything.</p>
<p>— Walter Forbes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of 1996, Sierra On-Line was still basking in the success of the previous summer’s <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/08/making-sierra-pay"><em>Phantasmagoria</em></a>, the best-selling game it had ever published. With revenues of $158.1 million and profits of $16 million in 1995, the company was bigger and richer than it had ever been. In light of all this, absolutely nobody anticipated the press release that went out from Sierra’s new headquarters in Bellevue, Washington, on February 20. It announced that Sierra would soon “merge with CUC International, Inc., a technology-driven retail and membership-services company that provides access to travel, shopping, auto, dining, home-improvement, financial, and other services to 40 million consumers worldwide. Sierra stockholders will receive 1.225 shares of CUC common stock for each share of Sierra common stock. The transaction is valued at approximately $1.06 billion. The merger is subject to stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.”</p>
<p>As this bombshell filtered down to the gaming sites that were popping up all over <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/06/a-web-around-the-world-part-11-a-zero-sum-game">the young Web</a>, and eventually to the laggardly print magazines, one question was first on the lips of every gamer who read about it. Just who or what was this CUC International anyway? Or, to frame the question differently: if CUC was such a big wheel, why had no one ever heard of it, and why did CUC itself seem to have such a hard time explaining what it actually did?</p>
<p>Time would show the answers to both of those questions to be more complicated and fraught than anyone could have expected. Still, it was clear from the outset that the path to understanding must pass through CUC’s CEO, a sprightly, dapper-looking man of business named Walter Forbes. This particular Forbes was not a member of the wealthy family who owned and operated <em>Forbes</em> magazine, one of the business and investment world’s primary journals of record. That fact notwithstanding, he had been born into decidedly privileged circumstances, and would certainly not have looked out of place with that other Forbes family at a blue-blood country club. Walter Forbes was a titan of industry straight out of Central Casting, from his artfully arranged salt-and-pepper coiffure to the gleaming Gucci loafers he donned on “casual” days. He was as convincing a figure as has ever walked into a corporate boardroom. In a milieu where looking the part of a General Patton of business was a prerequisite to joining the war for hearts, minds, and wallets, Forbes had the role down pat. With a guy like this at its head, how could CUC be anything but amazing? And how could little Sierra count itself anything but fortunate to become a part of his burgeoning empire?</p>
<p>As Forbes himself told the story to a wide-eyed journalist from <em>Wired</em> magazine in 1997, it had all begun for him back in 1973, when, having recently graduated from Harvard Business School, he was eating dinner one evening with some friends and some of his former professors. Somehow the discussion turned to the future of shopping. “Wouldn’t it be neat if we could bypass stores and send products from the manufacturer to the home, and people would use computers to shop?” Forbes recalled “someone” at the table saying. “Everyone forgot about what we talked about that night. Except me.”</p>
<p>Forbes envisioned a scenario in which brick-and-mortar retailers, those traditional middlemen of the chain of commerce, would be replaced by digital storefronts operated by his own company, which was founded in 1973 under the name of Comp-U-Card. According to his own testimony, he mooted various impractical schemes for priming the e-commerce pump before the technology of telecommunications finally showed signs of catching up with at least some of his aspirations circa 1979, the year that <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2017/10/a-net-before-the-web-part-1-the-establishment-man-and-the-magnificent-rogue">the pre-Web commercial online services The Source and CompuServe</a> made their debut. Now favoring the acronym CUC over the “Comp-U-Card” appellation — needless to say, nobody would rush to embrace that name today; the evolution of language can be a dangerous thing for corporate branders — Forbes took his company public in 1983, with an IPO that came in at $100 million. His business plan at the time, at least as he explained it fourteen years later, rings almost eerily prescient.</p>
<blockquote><p>Manufacturers would simply send information about their products to [Forbes’s] database company, which would aggregate the data, organize it, and then present it to consumers in an engaging way. When a shopper ordered something, the manufacturer would be notified to ship it directly to the consumer’s home. Since no retailer would be involved, the customer would simply pay the wholesale price, plus shipping charges. The database company would make almost no money on the transactions. Rather, it would make its money by charging the consumer a flat annual membership fee — typically $49 — for access to the data and the chance to buy at such low prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apart from a few details here and there, this is the way that Amazon, the 800-pound gorilla of modern online retail, operates today, right down to the “buyers club” where it makes most of its real money.</p>
<p>But here’s where the waters surrounding Walter Forbes and CUC start to get muddy. (I do hope you packed your diving goggles, because there are a lot of such waters ahead.) For the first ten years after the IPO, CUC actually took very little in the way of concrete steps in pursuit of the proto-Amazonian dream that Forbes had supposedly been nursing since 1973. Instead it administered offline shopping clubs that were marketed via bulk-rate post and telephone cold-calling. This was a sector of the consumer economy that thrived mostly on fine print and the failure of its often elderly customers to do their due diligence, being just one step removed from timeshares on the continuum of shady business models that never turn out to deliver quite what their customers think they are getting; in fact, timeshares soon became a part of CUC’s portfolio too. CUC sold its shopping clubs and other services as turnkey packages that could be purchased and branded by other corporations, thus partially explaining why so few people had ever heard of the company even fourteen years after its IPO. It wasn’t above using guile to retain customers, such as quietly signing them up for automatic recurring billing plans — charges that, it hoped, some portion of its customers who thought they were just making a one-time payment would fail to notice on their credit-card statements. Even the fawning profile in <em>Wired</em> had to acknowledge how close to the ethical edge CUC was prepared to fly.</p>
<blockquote><p>If a customer takes the trouble to call and quit, the CUC telephone operator goes into what any football fan would recognize as a prevent defense. The operator frantically starts explaining the value of the service, then often sacrifices a $20 coupon or check as a bribe to stick around. They will give up ground, but [will] do anything to keep you from reaching that goal line.</p></blockquote>
<p>As late as the year that CUC acquired Sierra On-Line, it was the offline shopping clubs that were still the heart of its revenue stream, the subject that its annual report for the year chose to open with and to return to again and again.</p>
<blockquote><p>CUC International is a leading technology-driven, membership-based consumer services company, providing approximately 66.3 million members with access to a variety of goods and services. The Company provides these services as individual, wholesale, or discount program memberships. These memberships include such components as shopping, travel, auto, dining, home improvement, lifestyle, vacation-exchange [i.e., timeshares], credit-card and checking-account enhancement packages, financial products and discount programs. The Company also administers insurance-package programs which are generally combined with discount shopping and travel for credit-union members, distributes welcoming packages which provide new homeowners with discounts for local merchants, and provides travelers with value-added tax refunds. The Company believes it is the leading provider of membership-based consumer services of these types in the United States.</p>
<p>The Company solicits members for many of its programs by direct marketing and by using a direct sales force calling on financial institutions, fund-raising charitable institutions and associations…</p>
<p>The Company offers Shoppers Advantage, Travelers Advantage, AutoVantage, Dinner on Us Club, PrivacyGuard, Buyers Advantage, Credit Card Guardian, and other membership services. These benefits are offered as individual memberships, as components of wholesale membership enhancement packages and insurance products, and as components of discount-program memberships. For the fiscal year ended January 31, 1997, approximately 536 million solicitation pieces were mailed, followed up by approximately 70 million telephone calls.</p></blockquote>
<p>Walter Forbes’s digital aspirations that got <em>Wired</em> so hot and bothered are mentioned only in passing in the report: “Some of the Company’s individual memberships are available online to interactive computer users via major online services and the Internet’s World Wide Web.”</p>
<p>Forbes first became associated with Sierra in 1991, when he agreed to join the company’s board. Ken Williams, Sierra’s co-founder and CEO, considered this a major coup, a sign that his little publisher of computer games was <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/01/sierra-at-the-cusp-of-the-multimedia-age">really going places</a> in this new decade of multimedia and cyber-everything. He was excited even though, as he admits in his recent memoir, he “never completely understood Walter’s business. To this day, I can’t completely tell you what it was. There were components of it that made sense — for instance, they owned a company called RCI that facilitated timeshare swapping. They also operated a series of discount shopping clubs, where customers would pay an annual subscription fee, allowing them to buy products at near-wholesale prices. Whatever it was, they were certainly doing something right. They had $2 billion in revenue and over $200 million in profit.”</p>
<p>The voice of Forbes whispering in Ken Williams’s ear was a hidden motivator behind <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/the-mortgaging-of-sierra-online">the spate of acquisitions</a> that the latter pursued during the first half of the 1990s, which saw the American educational-software developer Bright Star, the French adventure-games maker Coktel Visions, the British strategy house Impressions, and the American sim specialists Papyrus and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2021/01/the-dream-of-flight">subLOGIC</a> all entering the Sierra tent. Having thus hunted down and captured so much smaller prey with Forbes at his side, Williams perhaps shouldn’t have been surprised when his trusted advisor started eying his own company with a hungry look. Nevertheless, when Forbes broached the subject with Ken’s wife Roberta Williams, the designer of Sierra’s flagship <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2013/07/the-unmaking-and-remaking-of-sierra-on-line"><em>King’s Quest</em> series</a> as well as <em>Phantasmagoria</em> and many other adventure and children’s games, she at least was taken aback.</p>
<p>“Have you and Ken ever thought about selling Sierra?” he asked her out of the blue one day in the lobby of the Paris hotel where they happened to be attending a board-of-directors meeting. (An insatiable connoisseur of French food and wine, Forbes had had enough sway with Ken to convince him to hold the meeting at this distant and expensive location.)</p>
<p>“No,” Roberta answered shortly. “We’re not interested.”</p>
<p>“But if you ever were, what sort of price would you be looking at?”</p>
<p>“A lot,” Roberta replied, then walked away as quickly as decorum allowed. She had the discomfiting feeling that Forbes was a predator probing for a flock’s weak link, and she was determined that it wouldn’t be her.</p>
<p>But when Forbes brought the subject up in a more formal way, at another Sierra board meeting closer to home on February 2, 1996, Roberta’s husband proved far more receptive than she had been.</p>
<p>The only detailed insider account of what happened next and why is the one written by Ken Williams. Needless to say, this must raise automatic red flags for any historian worth his salt. And yet his memoir does appear to be about as even-handed as anyone could possibly expect under the circumstances. To his credit, he owns up to many of his own mistakes with no hesitation whatsoever. While we would be foolish to take his account as the unvarnished gospel truth, he doesn’t strike me as a completely unreliable witness by any means. I think we can afford to take much if not all of what he writes at face value as we ask ourselves what led him to the most monumental decision of his life, excepting only the decision to <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/on-line-systems-is-born">found Sierra</a> in the first place all the way back in 1980.</p>
<p>To begin with, Williams admits forthrightly that he was quite simply <em>tired</em> at this juncture of his life, and that his sense of exhaustion made the prospect of selling out and taking a step back more appealing than it might have been just a few years earlier. His fatigue is eminently understandable: Sierra had consumed almost his every waking hour for over fifteen years by this point. He tells us that people had been telling him for ages that he “needed to delegate more, but it just wasn’t in my personality to do so.” More and more as the games got more expensive and the stakes for every new release higher, Williams had felt forced to play the role of the corporate heavy.</p>
<blockquote><p>My visits to Sierra’s development teams were occasionally liked, but not very often. Left to their own devices, the teams would agonize over the games forever. Asking an artist to compromise quality in order to bring the art in on budget is not a win-win for either of us, but it’s something I had to do every day. Shutting down projects, ruining dreams, staring endlessly at spreadsheets, riding on airplanes. That was my life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sierra had become rather notorious these last few years for <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2018/10/quest-for-glory-iii-and-iv">shipping games before they were ready</a>. At the end of the day, the decision to do so was Ken Williams’s, but he often believed he had no real choice in the matter at all. For Sierra was now a publicly traded company, and he felt it couldn’t afford the hit to the stock price that would result from not having Game X on the shelves in time for some given Christmas shopping season. Now, the skeptical reader might argue that there were surely ways to improve internal processes such that games weren’t continually falling behind schedule, going over budget, and winding up caught in the “ship it now or die” trap — and such a reader would be absolutely right. But that doesn’t change the state of play on the ground from the perspective of Ken Williams, who was not a good delegater and seemed to lack the turn of mind that was required to implement more rigorous methodologies of game development. This situation being what it was, he hoped that the (apparently) deep pockets of CUC would insulate Sierra somewhat from the vagaries of stock prices and holiday seasons, would give him more leeway to grant a promising game the six more months in the oven it needed to become a great one.</p>
<p>In addition to all of the above, Williams leans heavily on his “fiduciary duty” to his shareholders to explain why he was so willing and even eager to embrace Forbes’s offer. As CEO, he says, he was obliged to maximize his shareholders’ return on their investment, regardless of his personal feelings: “To state it simply, the decision wasn’t mine to make. I had a responsibility to the company’s true owners.” Alas, it’s here that I do have to part ways somewhat with the idea of Ken Williams as a completely reliable witness; this statement does begin to veer into self-serving territory.</p>
<p>The majority of Sierra’s shareholders were of the passive stripe, who had little understanding of the company’s business and were thus very ready to listen when the CEO who had just delivered a record profit told them what he thought they ought to do. And Ken Williams made it abundantly clear to these shareholders that he thought they ought to take the deal.</p>
<p>Yet he did so over the objections of virtually everyone he talked to who <em>did</em> understand Sierra’s business reasonably well. His board of directors was unanimous in its opposition, with the exception only of the member named Walter Forbes. Mike Brochu, Sierra’s hard-nosed president and chief operating officer, who was in many ways the architect of the company’s last couple of years of solid growth and profitability, saw no reason for it to surrender its independence now, just when things were going so swimmingly for it.</p>
<p>Likewise, Jerry Bowerman, a former investment banker who was now vice president for product development, says today that he “pleaded” with Williams to at the very least take a longer, harder look at Forbes and his “company that sells coupons” than he had shown any interest in doing prior to this point; something about CUC, Bowerman says, “made [the] hair stand up on the back of my neck.” In particular, he saw a communist convention worth of red flags in CUC’s habit of <em>just</em> beating its earnings expectations on Wall Street every single quarter: “That’s categorically impossible. Does not happen.” But somehow with CUC it did. “He has a fiduciary responsibility, and the board has a fiduciary responsibility, to take the offer seriously,” acknowledges Bowerman. “What [Williams] never <em>did</em> do was, like, hire an investment bank to say, is this actually a fair offer?”</p>
<p>Even Ken’s own wife Roberta was dead-set against the acquisition: “When Walter asked me, did we ever think of selling the company, and I said no, I meant it. I always had a little bit of intuition about Walter. Not that he was a crook or anything like that. Just… take him with a grain of salt.”</p>
<p>Ken Williams normally listened to his wife. As lots of people knew then and will happily tell you today, Roberta was often the final arbiter of what did and didn’t happen at Sierra, in discussions that took place around the Williams family dinner table long after the lights in the boardroom and executive suites had been extinguished. In this case, however, he ignored her advice, as he did that of so many of his professional colleagues. Instead of taking Walter Forbes with a grain of salt, he took his deal — signed on the dotted line, with no questions asked, selling the company that had been his life’s work to another one whose business model and revenue streams were almost entirely opaque to him.</p>
<p>Doing so was without a doubt the worst decision Ken Williams ever made in his business career, but it wasn’t totally out of character for the man. There’s a theory in pop psychology that every alpha male is really looking to become the beta to an even bigger cock-of-the-walk. Be that as it may, Ken Williams — this man’s man who had the chutzpah to imagine becoming a transformative mogul of mass media, a Walt Disney-like figure — could be weirdly quick to fall under the sway of other men who seemed to embody the same qualities he cherished in himself. Sometimes that worked out okay, as when he met the furloughed police officer Jim Walls through his hairdresser and asked that man who knew nothing of computers or the games they played to join Sierra as a game designer. The three <em>Police Quest</em> games that resulted were… well, it’s hard to really call them&nbsp;<em>good</em> in any fundamental sense, but they were good enough for the times, whilst being fresh and unique in their subject matter when compared with all those other adventure games about dragons and spaceships. At other junctures, however, Williams’s gut instinct led him badly astray, as when he asked the police brutalist <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2019/07/chief-gates-comes-to-oakhurst-a-cop-drama">Daryl F. Gates</a> to replace Walls as the personality behind <em>Police Quest</em>, a decision which appalled and outraged most of his own employees and left a stain on Sierra’s legacy that can never be fully expunged.</p>
<p>Just as the aforementioned two men walked and talked the part of the hard-edged, no-nonsense cop in a way that profoundly impressed Ken Williams, Walter Forbes was the very picture of the suave and sophisticated financier, making monumental deals next to a crackling fire in his elegant parlor, a glass of Chianti in hand, before rushing off to Europe in his private jet to take in an opera. For Ken, <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2011/10/ken-and-roberta">a working-class striver</a> without any university degree to his name, much less one from Harvard, the idea that a man like this would be so interested in him and his company must have been a very alluring one indeed.</p>
<p>Had Ken Williams followed the advice of Jerry Bowerman and dug a little deeper into Walter Forbes and CUC, he might have learned some things to give him pause. He might have discovered, for example, that Forbes hadn’t founded CUC himself to pursue his grand vision of e-commerce, as the interview in <em>Wired</em> implies; he had rather bought himself a seat on an existing company’s board with a cash investment from his familial store of same, then fomented from that perch a revolt that led to the real founder being defenestrated and Forbes himself taking his place. If nothing else, this did cast Forbes’s willingness to join Sierra’s board and his early chat with Roberta Williams on the subject of an acquisition, as if he was nosing around for a weak link, in rather a different light.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s been an elephant in the room through all of the foregoing paragraphs, one which we can no longer continue to ignore. Once more to his credit, Ken Williams doesn’t fail to mention the elephant in his book: “Personally speaking, it would be a nice payday.”</p>
<p>Ken Williams had grown up with just one dream. It wasn’t to make great games or to revolutionize entertainment or even to become the next Walt Disney, although all of those things were eventually folded into it as the means to an end. It was to become rich — nothing more, nothing less. “Somewhere along the way, I developed an aggressive personality,” he writes of his boyhood and adolescence. “All that I could think about was becoming rich. Note that I said ‘rich,’ not ’employed’ or ‘successful.’ Amongst the few memories I have from that time is the constant thought of wanting to live a different life than the one I grew up in. I read books about business executives who owned yachts and jets, and who hung out with beautiful models in fancy mansions. I knew that was my future and I couldn’t wait to claim it.”</p>
<p>By most people’s standards, Ken and Roberta Williams <em>were</em> rich by the mid-1990s. But most of their wealth was illiquid, being bound up in their company — an arrangement which entailed duties and obligations that were becoming, for Ken at least, increasingly onerous. “It seemed like everyone associated with Sierra except me was having fun,” he says.</p>
<p>I just wrote that the decision to sell to Walter Forbes was the worst business decision Ken Williams ever made. Ironically, though, it was his best decision ever in terms of his private finances. For he sold Sierra when the “Siliwood” craze of which he had been the industry’s most outspoken and articulate proponent — that peculiar melding of computer games with Hollywood movies, complete with live actors and unabashedly cinematic audiovisual aesthetics — was at its absolute zenith; he sold when <em>Phantasmagoria</em>, the latest poster child for the trend, had just become Sierra’s best-selling game ever. The remainder of 1996 — <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2022/06/toonstruck-or-a-case-study-in-the-death-of-adventure-games">a year which produced no more Siliwood hits</a> on the scale of&nbsp;<em>Phantasmagoria</em>, from Sierra or anyone else — would show that there was only one way forward for “interactive movies” from here, and that way was down. They were <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2020/06/the-shareware-scene-part-5-narratives-of-doom">doomed</a> to be replaced by a very different vision of gaming’s future, emphasizing visceral action, emergent behavior, and player empowerment over the elaborate set-piece storytelling that had been Sierra’s bread and butter for so long.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades, signing Walter Forbes’s contract has allowed Ken and Roberta Williams to enjoy that enviable lifestyle that is the preserve of the ultra-wealthy alone, with multiple homes in multiple countries and a boat in which they have cruised around the world several times. Mind you, I don’t say that such a lifestyle was foremost on Ken Williams’s mind when he made the decision to sell; on the contrary, he had every expectation at the time of continuing to manage Sierra for the foreseeable future. I merely say — as if it needs to be said yet again! — that life is seldom black and white.</p>
<p>But we’ve belabored these points enough: Ken secured the preliminary approval of Sierra’s shareholders, signed on the dotted line on their behalf, sent out the press release, then secured their final approval to complete the transaction a few months later. On the face of it, it was indeed a great deal for them: they got to trade in their Sierra stock for 22 percent more shares in CUC, a far bigger, even faster-growing company.</p>
<p>Once all that was behind them, Walter Forbes and Ken Williams and all of their closest associates flew off to Paris in Forbes’s jet to celebrate the acquisition. Some members of the entourage were happier than others. At an expensive Parisian restaurant, Forbes ordered a $5000 bottle of wine, saying it was on him. “I [found] out after the fact, digging around in the accounting system, that he’d expensed it,” says Jerry Bowerman. “So he was just a liar. Just a very fat liar.”</p>

Amazingly, Sierra On-Line wasn’t the only software publisher that Walter Forbes and CUC agreed to purchased during February of 1996. In a way, the other major acquisition turned out to be even more of a plum prize than this one. It was a publisher and distributor of educational software and games called Davidson and Associates. If that name fails to set any bells a-ringing, know that Davidson was itself the proud owner of Blizzard Entertainment, whose <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/06/a-dialog-in-real-time-strategy"><em>Warcraft 2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.filfre.net/2023/07/diablo"><em>Diablo</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/07/starcraft-a-history-in-two-acts"><em>Starcraft</em></a>, combined with <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/01/the-rise-of-pomg-part-1-it-takes-a-village">its innovative Battle.net</a> service for online multiplayer play, would make it the hottest brand in gaming over the course of the next few years, a veritable way of life for millions of (mostly) young men. CUC, this company nobody had ever heard of, was suddenly in possession of a gaming empire with few peers.</p>
<p>But for Ken Williams, the time to come would be filled with far less pleasant surprises than the meteoric ascent of Blizzard. After the acquisitions of Sierra and Davidson were finalized in June of 1996, it slowly and agonizingly dawned on him that he had made a terrible mistake. He learned that Walter Forbes had given the exact same promise of ultimate superiority in the new software arm of CUC to both him and Bob Davidson, the co-founder of Davidson and Associates. Forbes obviously couldn’t honor his promise to both men. Worse, it soon became clear that he favored Davidson whenever push came to shove. Davidson’s people took over most of the marketing and distribution of Sierra’s games, with Williams’s own people being sidelined or laid off. Williams chafed at his newfound beta status, and feuded bitterly if futilely with his de-facto superior. When Sierra failed to come up with another hit to rival <em>Phantasmagoria’</em>s sales in 1996 — a failure which further reduced his standing in the conglomerate as a whole, what with the numbers Blizzard was shifting — he blamed it on Davidson’s logistics and marketing.</p>
<p>Yet he did manage to do Sierra and CUC one great service that year, despite the constraints that were being laid upon him. Late in 1996, he agreed to hear a pitch from a new studio called Valve Corporation, founded by a couple of former Microsoft employees who had never made a game before and who were therefore having trouble gaining inroads with the other major publishers. With his background in adventure games, Williams was intrigued by Valve’s proposal for <a href="https://www.filfre.net/2024/12/half-life"><em>Half-Life</em></a>, a first-person shooter which, so he was told, would place an unusual emphasis on its story. Even when setting that element of the equation aside, Williams knew all too well that Sierra really, really needed to become a player in the shooter space if it was to survive the popping of the Siliwood bubble. Listening to his gut, he signed Valve to a publishing contract. Well after he left Sierra, <em>Half-Life</em> would become by most metrics the most successful single shooter in history, by a literal order of magnitude the best-selling game that Ken Williams was ever involved with. The landscape of gaming might look vastly different today had he not made that deal; Steam, for instance, was able to come to be only thanks to <em>Half-Life’</em>s publication and success. Not all of Ken Williams’s gut decisions were bad ones. Far from it.</p>
<p><em>Half-Life</em> aside, though, life under the new regime had little to offer him beyond constraints and warning signs. One of the other perks he had been promised, and that in this case was delivered, was a seat on CUC’s board. His first board meeting only reinforced his sense of the cloud of obscurity hanging around CUC’s operations. He realized that he wasn’t the only person sitting at the table who didn’t entirely understand what the company they were all supposed to be overseeing actually did. The other board members, however, didn’t much seem to care. As long as the stock price kept climbing, they were happy to leave it all in the evidently capable hands of Walter Forbes. Ken Williams:</p>
<blockquote><p>By the end of the first hour, we had covered everyone’s golf scores and favorite wines. I was not a golfer and was left out of the discussion. I avoided the game, and was disappointed that these pillars of the business world thought it was important enough to disrupt a board meeting. We finally sat at the table, and vacations were discussed. Walter was asked at some point, “How’s business?” He answered that all was good, followed by hardly anything more. I was waiting patiently for the lights to dim and the projector to light up. It never happened. Instead we were back to conversations having nothing to do with CUC. And then the meeting ended.</p></blockquote>
<p>Feeling out of place among the old-money scions gathered around tables such as this one, tired of having his decisions in the software space countermanded by Bob Davidson, Williams started casting about for someplace else within CUC where he could rule the roost as he had once done at Sierra. He dove deep into another recently acquired company, the e-commerce facilitator NetMarket, which had scored a prominent write-up in <em>The New York Times</em> two years earlier for enabling the first encrypted credit-card transaction — for a Sting CD — ever to take place on the Internet. Yet he was never quite sure of his ground there, and never felt that NetMarket was much of a priority for Forbes — a strange thing in itself, given the way the latter was always rattling on about e-commerce in interviews. Williams had become an executive without a clear role or any clearly delineated scope of authority. It was not a comfortable situation for a man of his personality and predilections.</p>
<p>It might therefore have seemed like good news when Bob Davidson abruptly quit in January of 1997. And yet the circumstances of his resignation were just odd enough that it was hard for even his primary internal rival to feel too sanguine about it. Davidson had had a dream job, running a software empire that had just shipped Blizzard’s <em>Diablo</em> to a rapturous reception. Why had he thrown it away? Williams heard through the grapevine that Davidson had come to Forbes with an ultimatum, demanding that the software arm be spun out from the CUC mother ship to become its own company as the condition of his staying on there. Why had he been so strident about this? Had he discovered something that other people hadn’t? It was almost as if he felt he had to <em>protect</em> the software business from whatever was coming for the rest of the company.</p>
<p>As it happened, Williams was never offered Davidson’s job anyway. It was given instead to one Chris McLeod, a “member of the office of the president and executive vice-president” of CUC with no background in technology, software, or gaming, although he did sport a rather impressive golf handicap.</p>
<p>In May of 1997, Walter Forbes announced his latest deal. CUC was to merge with another company that nobody other than Wall Street investment bankers had ever heard of, one that went by another anonymous-sounding three-letter acronym. But it turned out that HFS (“Hospitality Franchise Systems”) owned a considerable number of brands that actually were household names: Avis Rental Cars, the real-estate chains Century 21, ERA, and Coldwell Banker, and the hotel chains Days Inn, Ramada, Super 8, Howard Johnson’s, and Travelodge. <em>The New York Times</em> diplomatically described CUC, by contrast, as “a powerful but less known force in telemarketing, home-shopping clubs, and travel information.” HFS was far too big for CUC to gobble up like it had Sierra On-Line and Davidson and Associates. This was to be a “merger of equals.”</p>
<p>HFS had been founded in 1990 by an infamously ruthless, hard-charging Wall Street money man named Henry Silverman, who had grown tired of playing “second banana” to the moguls and investors he stood in between. His business plan was deceptively simple: HFS bought brands, then rented them out to others under the franchising model. Said model allowed the company to accrue most of the benefits of running a chain of real-estate firms or rental-car offices or hotels without getting bogged down in most of the responsibilities. Anyone who wished to open a branch of one of these businesses could apply to HFS for a license to use one of its brands. If approved, they would pay a lump sum up-front, followed by ongoing “subscription” fees. In return for their money, they would receive, in addition to the brand itself, guidance on best practices and access to proprietary computer systems. On the stick side of the ledger, they would also need to pass regular inspections, to assure that they didn’t dilute the cachet of the brand they leased. It would be an overstatement to claim that administering such a franchising system was trivial for HFS, but it was much less financially and logistically fraught than actually owning and running thousands of properties all over the country. The Wall Street portfolio managers who had so recently been Silverman’s colleagues ate it up. And why shouldn’t they? An investor who got in on the ground floor with HFS in 1992, when it first went public, would have gotten her money back twenty-fold by the time of the merger with CUC.</p>
<p>HFS was a larger company than CUC in 1997, with a more transparent and more obviously sustainable business model. Although both stock prices were overvalued by any objective measure, sporting fairly outrageous price-to-earnings ratios, you could go out into Main Street, USA, and see the sources of HFS’s revenues right there in bricks and mortar. This was not true of CUC.</p>
<p>Given this reality, those who knew Henry Silverman well would continue to ask themselves for years to come why he had wanted to make this deal in the first place, and why he had failed to look harder into CUC’s business before consummating it. For Silverman, unlike Ken Williams, was not in the habit of letting the gravitational pull of charm, power, and ostentatious displays of wealth trump sober-minded judgment. On the contrary, Silverman was a numbers guy to the core, a classic cold fish who seemed immune to personal charisma when he considered his potential business partners. And yet he allowed Walter Forbes to reel him in almost as easily as Ken Williams had. The player got played: “A master deal-maker bought a pig in a poke,” as <em>Fortune</em> magazine would be writing in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Still, the terms of this deal quite clearly left Silverman rather than Forbes in the catbird seat. The merger agreement stipulated that Silverman would be the CEO of the conjoined venture and Forbes only the chairman of the board until January 1, 2000, after which date the two would swap roles. They would then continue to trade places, in two-year cycles, for as long as they both wanted to keep at it. That said, many of those who knew Henry Silverman best suspected that he never intended to relinquish the position of CEO, that he would find some way to freeze Forbes out when the time came to trade places. In the end, though — and as we’ll see in my next article — other developments would make all of that a moot point. In the meanwhile, Wall Street was all-in; one investment analyst said that it would take “mismanagement for this deal not to work.” She had no idea what a soothsayer she was…</p>
<p>Any merger as big as this one, valued at $14 billion, takes some time to effectuate. It wouldn’t go through until the very end of 1997, by which point Ken Williams would be gone from CUC and from Sierra.</p>
<p>In August of 1997 — “one miserable year after Sierra’s acquisition had been completed,” as he puts it — Williams decided that he had had enough. A proud man, he felt disrespected, even “humiliated,” at that month’s board meeting, where his proposals and all of his attempts to steer the conversation around to actual matters of business had not gone down well. As soon as the meeting adjourned, he sat down at the computer in his office and typed out a letter of resignation. Walter Forbes, this fellow whom Williams had once thought he shared a special bond with as a fellow dynamic man of business, accepted the letter without much comment or expression of regret. It took some time to finalize Williams’s departure with Human Resources, but it was agreed in the end that his last day would be November 1.</p>
<p>So, Ken Williams’s association with Sierra On-Line, the company he had founded and built from the ground up over almost eighteen years, officially ended on November 1, 1997. There was no public or private fanfare — no going-away party, no line of colleagues awaiting a last handshake. Nothing like that. “I just packed my stuff and went home,” he says. Both coincidentally and not so coincidentally, Mike Brochu and Jerry Bowerman, Williams’s right-hand men who had argued so fruitlessly against the acquisition, likewise decided they had had enough at around the same time. This left Sierra as little more than another of Henry Silverman’s brands, in the hands of people who had bought their way into it rather than growing it from the grass roots. They would deign to fund and release a few more games that played in the old Sierra’s worlds, would even employ a few of the old designers to make them. Nevertheless, one can make a compelling argument that the main story of the Sierra that is still so fondly remembered by adventure-game fans today ended on that November 1, 1997, when Ken Williams walked out of his office for the last time, with no one even bothering to tell him goodbye. What followed — and will follow, in the next two articles of this series — was merely the epilogue, or perhaps the hangover; you can pick your own metaphor.</p>
<p>It beggars belief that something so huge — something that touched the lives of so many people who worked for Sierra or played the many, many games of its golden years — could end so anticlimactically, with one unremarkable-looking 43-year-old office worker quietly switching off his computer and driving home. But such is life in the real world. Concluding whimpers are more common than bangs.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  

  <p><em><strong>Advisory:</strong> I am not a legal expert and there could likely be inaccuracies in this post.</em></p>
<p>Today Gumroad announced that they’ve become open source, with this being echoed by the founder and on social sites like Hacker News:</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/gumroad/status/1908142543100842303" target="_blank"><img src="https://danb.me/blog/images/2025/04/gumroad_x.png" alt="Gumroad X account post announcing 'Gumroad is officially open source!'"></a>

</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, this <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/main/LICENSE.md">uses a custom license</a> which wouldn’t meet <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">the widely regarded definition of open source</a>, and therefore wouldn’t be widely regarded as open source so calling this open source could be misleading to many.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-it-not-open-source">Why is it not open source?</h3>
<p>The license <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/d0eaae04935d3cc011dfda29efc822e725d7437b/LICENSE.md?plain=1#L18-L29">sets limits</a> upon open rights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Small Business and Exempt Organizations <br>
You may use the software under this license only if (1) your company has less than 1 million USD (2024) total revenue in the prior tax year, and less than 10 million USD (2024) GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), or (2) you are a non-profit organization or government entity. Adjust the revenue threshold for inflation according to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, for all items, not seasonally adjusted, 1982–1984=100 reference base. If you are a company and exceed either of the limits in (1), your license ends. You may contact the licensor to discuss an alternative license.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Redistribution is also questionable from my non-legal-expert understanding since the license explicitly allows distribution while also not allowing sublicensing or license transfer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of your licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from granting licenses to anyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These parts of the license go against the following requirements of the <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">open source definition</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1. Free distribution</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ignoring the questionable redistribution part of the license, it still limits distribution rights to only those meeting the “Small Business and Exempt Organizations”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>3. Derived Works</strong>
<ul>
<li>Again, these are only allowed by those meeting the “Small Business and Exempt Organizations”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</strong>
<ul>
<li>License specifically limits rights provided to those that meet their criteria.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>7. Distribution of License</strong>
<ul>
<li>This part is questionable as per my quoted line above</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="isnt-this-fair-though-whats-wrong">Isn’t this fair though, what’s wrong?</h3>
<p>Sure! I personally believe that it’s fair for folks to license their own efforts however they wish.
The issue isn’t that the license exists, it’s that it’s misrepresented as open source.</p>
<p>This appears to be another example of a business wanting to use “open source” for its marketing &amp; reputation potential,
while not wanting to give away the rights usually afforded in open source to limit risk.
But it’s the risk taken and rights given by other developers &amp; projects which has given open source that reputation and marketing power.</p>
<p>Not to say that it’s the intention to mislead or be malicious though, this can easily be done by not understanding, or not considering, the commonly regarded open source definition.</p>
<h3 id="to-users-whats-the-actual-difference-compared-to-being-open-source">To users, what’s the actual difference compared to being open source?</h3>
<p>All of the rights provided to users depend on being within the “Small Business and Exempt Organizations” conditions quoted above.
With open source, rights are provided evenly, without specific targeting of software users.</p>
<p>While you may think that the requirements won’t impact normal users, their wider effects can do so.
For example, this could limit possibilities of service providers providing the software as a service, meaning less hosting options for users.
It also can impact forking, a crucial part of open source which allows software to thrive and survive beyond it’s original author, especially on a larger project like this since development &amp; maintenance efforts would be limited to those that fit their conditions.</p>
<p>With the specific wording used here, these conditions may have wider impact than you expect. Looking at <a href="https://github.com/antiwork/gumroad/blob/d0eaae04935d3cc011dfda29efc822e725d7437b/LICENSE.md?plain=1#L82">their definitions</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Your company</strong> is any legal entity, sole proprietorship, or other kind of organization that you work for, plus all organizations that have control over, are under the control of, or are under common control with that organization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite broad. For example, if you just worked for a $1M revenue company, you wouldn’t have rights to use/modify/redistribute the software as a side project, for self-hosting, or for other uses like a community-project/charity etc…
$1M revenue isn’t a lot when it comes to business, and I think there’s a considerable overlap in admins &amp; developers able to work with the code-base, and those working for $1M+ revenue business.</p>
<h3 id="so-whats-the-solution">So what’s the solution?</h3>
<p>Just don’t call it open source. “Source Available” is a common term for the wider scope of software which has been made available to viewing.
There are some more focused movements like <a href="https://faircode.io/">Fair-code</a>, <a href="https://fair.io/">fair source</a>, and <a href="https://sourcefirst.com/">source first</a> but I’m not sure it fits into any of those.
The <a href="https://commonsclause.com/">commons clause</a> is kind of similar without a threshold.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a license meeting <a href="https://opensource.org/osd">the OSD</a> could be used instead.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="aside-problematic-license-wording">Aside: Problematic License Wording</h3>
<p>Upon the mentioned questionable distribution rights of the license, there are other things in this custom license which just appear quite strange.</p>
<p>Firstly, the USD specific condition is just odd. I can’t see any mention of equivalent or other currency. Going by the text, it seems like you might not be subject to some of the conditions if you don’t deal with USD. This requirement is also a bit complex, having to adjust it for inflation following the “United States Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer price index”. What if the Bureau of Labor Statistics is dismantled? Wouldn’t say that’s out of the question at the current state of things.</p>
<p>Secondly, the way rights are afforded are a little strange:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The licensor grants you a copyright license for the software to do everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor’s copyright, but only as long as you meet all the conditions below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Normally licenses provide specific rights, but this allows “everything you might do with the software that would otherwise infringe the licensor’s copyright”. The “licensor” is specifically defined as “Gumroad, Inc.” but this otherwise seems very broadly scoped.
Thinking out a scenario, I could modify the software to consume other content &amp; repos from “Gumroad, Inc.”, then republish that as my own? Usually that’s be infringing on their copyright but here I’ve been provided permissions to infringe their copyright in “everything you might do with the software”. Not sure it’d hold up in court, but seems like a questionable approach to provide rights in a license.</p>
