            The Tokyo Metropolitan Government says the new arrangement, which begins in April, could give employees three days off every week.

            The shift to a four-day workweek has sparked growing interest in the West, where some companies are beginning to explore compressed hours as a way to attract talent seeking better work-life balance. Some studies have shown that it improves well-being and productivity among workers.

            And Tokyo isn’t the only place in Asia to implement more family friendly policies.

<p>This repository contains two versions of Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original <code>llama</code> codebase.</p>
<h3>
	<a rel="nofollow" href="#use-with-transformers" id="use-with-transformers">
		
	</a>
	<span>
		Use with transformers
	</span>
</h3>
<p>Starting with <code>transformers &gt;= 4.43.0</code> onward, you can run conversational inference using the Transformers <code>pipeline</code> abstraction or by leveraging the Auto classes with the <code>generate()</code> function.</p>
<p>Make sure to update your transformers installation via <code>pip install --upgrade transformers</code>.</p>
<p>See the snippet below for usage with Transformers:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> transformers
<span>import</span> torch

model_id = <span>"meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct"</span>

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    <span>"text-generation"</span>,
    model=model_id,
    model_kwargs={<span>"torch_dtype"</span>: torch.bfloat16},
    device_map=<span>"auto"</span>,
)

messages = [
    {<span>"role"</span>: <span>"system"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!"</span>},
    {<span>"role"</span>: <span>"user"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>"Who are you?"</span>},
]

outputs = pipeline(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=<span>256</span>,
)
<span>print</span>(outputs[<span>0</span>][<span>"generated_text"</span>][-<span>1</span>])

		Tool use with transformers
	</span>
</h3>
<p>LLaMA-3.3 supports multiple tool use formats. You can see a full guide to prompt formatting <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_1/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Tool use is also supported through <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating#advanced-tool-use--function-calling">chat templates</a> in Transformers. 
Here is a quick example showing a single simple tool:</p>
<pre><code><span># First, define a tool</span>
<span>def</span> <span>get_current_temperature</span>(<span>location: <span>str</span></span>) -&gt; <span>float</span>:
    <span>"""</span>
<span>    Get the current temperature at a location.</span>
<span>    </span>
<span>    Args:</span>
<span>        location: The location to get the temperature for, in the format "City, Country"</span>
<span>    Returns:</span>
<span>        The current temperature at the specified location in the specified units, as a float.</span>
<span>    """</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>22.</span>  <span># A real function should probably actually get the temperature!</span>

<span># Next, create a chat and apply the chat template</span>
messages = [
  {<span>"role"</span>: <span>"system"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>"You are a bot that responds to weather queries."</span>},
  {<span>"role"</span>: <span>"user"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>"Hey, what's the temperature in Paris right now?"</span>}
]

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=[get_current_temperature], add_generation_prompt=<span>True</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>You can then generate text from this input as normal. If the model generates a tool call, you should add it to the chat like so:</p>
<pre><code>tool_call = {<span>"name"</span>: <span>"get_current_temperature"</span>, <span>"arguments"</span>: {<span>"location"</span>: <span>"Paris, France"</span>}}
messages.append({<span>"role"</span>: <span>"assistant"</span>, <span>"tool_calls"</span>: [{<span>"type"</span>: <span>"function"</span>, <span>"function"</span>: tool_call}]})
</code></pre>
<p>and then call the tool and append the result, with the <code>tool</code> role, like so:</p>
<pre><code>messages.append({<span>"role"</span>: <span>"tool"</span>, <span>"name"</span>: <span>"get_current_temperature"</span>, <span>"content"</span>: <span>"22.0"</span>})
</code></pre>
<p>After that, you can <code>generate()</code> again to let the model use the tool result in the chat. Note that this was a very brief introduction to tool calling - for more information,
see the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama3_1/">LLaMA prompt format docs</a> and the Transformers <a rel="nofollow" href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating#advanced-tool-use--function-calling">tool use documentation</a>.</p>

</h3>
<p>The model checkpoints can be used in <code>8-bit</code> and <code>4-bit</code> for further memory optimisations using <code>bitsandbytes</code> and <code>transformers</code></p>
<p>See the snippet below for usage:</p>
<pre><code><span>import</span> torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
input_text = <span>"What are we having for dinner?"</span>
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors=<span>"pt"</span>).to(<span>"cuda"</span>)

output = quantized_model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=<span>10</span>)

<span>print</span>(tokenizer.decode(output[<span>0</span>], skip_special_tokens=<span>True</span>))
</code></pre>
<p>To load in 4-bit simply pass <code>load_in_4bit=True</code></p>

</h2>
<p>As part of our Responsible release approach, we followed a three-pronged strategy to managing trust &amp; safety risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable developers to deploy helpful, safe and flexible experiences for their target audience and for the use cases supported by Llama.   </li>
<li>Protect developers against adversarial users aiming to exploit Llama capabilities to potentially cause harm.  </li>
<li>Provide protections for the community to help prevent the misuse of our models.</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p>Llama is a foundational technology designed to be used in a variety of use cases, examples on how Meta’s Llama models have been responsibly deployed can be found in our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/community-stories/">Community Stories webpage</a>. Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for the generic use cases addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policy and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.3 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide, you can refer to the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide/">Responsible Use Guide</a> to learn more. </p>

</h4>
<p>Our main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. For more details on the safety mitigations implemented please read the Llama 3 paper. </p>
<p><strong>Fine-tuning data</strong><br>We employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control. </p>
<p><strong>Refusals and Tone</strong><br>Building on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow  tone guidelines. </p>

		Llama 3.3 systems
	</span>
</h4>
<p><strong>Large language models, including Llama 3.3, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required.</strong> Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools.<br>As part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/trust-and-safety/">safeguards</a> that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system">reference implementations</a> demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box. </p>

		New capabilities
	</span>
</h4>
<p>Note that this release introduces new capabilities, including a longer context window, multilingual inputs and outputs and possible integrations by developers with third party tools. Building with these new capabilities requires specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases.</p>
<p><strong>Tool-use</strong>: Just like in standard software development, developers are responsible for the integration of the LLM with the tools and services of their choice. They should define a clear policy for their use case and assess the integrity of the third party services they use to be aware of the safety and security limitations when using this capability. Refer to the Responsible Use Guide for best practices on the safe deployment of the third party safeguards. </p>
<p><strong>Multilinguality</strong>: Llama 3.3 supports 7 languages in addition to English: French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai. Llama may be able to output text in other languages than those that meet performance thresholds for safety and helpfulness. We strongly discourage developers from using this model to converse in non-supported languages without implementing finetuning and system controls in alignment with their policies and the best practices shared in the Responsible Use Guide. </p>
<h3>
	<a rel="nofollow" href="#evaluations" id="evaluations">
		
	</a>
	<span>
		Evaluations
	</span>
</h3>
<p>We evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, coding assistant, tool calls. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.<br>Capability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, tools calls, coding or memorization.</p>
<p><strong>Red teaming</strong><br>For both scenarios, we conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets.<br>We partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity.  The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets. . </p>

</h3>
<p><strong>1- CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulness</strong><br>To assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of the Llama 3.3 model could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons. </p>

		<strong>2. Child Safety</strong>
	</span>
</h3>
<p>Child Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.  For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences. </p>
<p><strong>3. Cyber attack enablement</strong><br>Our cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.<br>Our attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention.</p>

<p>Generative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama">Github repository</a>. </p>
<p>We also set up the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/llama-impact-grants/">Llama Impact Grants</a> program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found <a rel="nofollow" href="https://llama.meta.com/llama-impact-grants/#finalists">here</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, we put in place a set of resources including an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback">output reporting mechanism</a> and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.facebook.com/whitehat">bug bounty program</a> to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.</p>

</h2>
<p>The core values of Llama 3.3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress. </p>
<p>But Llama 3.3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.3 model, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

<h2 id="step-5-flash-postmarketos">Step 5: Flash PostmarketOS </h2><p><strong>Be aware that each device has its own specific guide for installing PostmarketOS (they are mostly similar). Make sure to carefully read and follow the instructions for your specific phone model on the postmarketOS website before flashing the system. This guide is for oneplus 6t.</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Flash PostmarketOS on Your Phone by opening a command prompt or terminal window on your PC and navigate to the folder where you saved the PostmarketOS files. Execute the following commands one by one:</p>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  <div>
  <pre id="7380c7b">  <code>fastboot flash boot boot_file_name.img</code>
  </pre>
  </div>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  <div>
  <pre id="dfa7003">  <code>fastboot flash userdata img_file_name.img</code>
  </pre>
  </div>
<p>Replace “boot_file_name” and “img_file_name” with the actual file names you saved earlier.&nbsp;<strong>Once the flashing process is complete, restart your phone.</strong></p>

<h5 id="postmarketos-ist-installed-now-on-your-phone">PostmarketOS ist installed now on your phone! </h5><h2 id="step-6-initial-setup-and-ssh-activation">Step 6: Initial Setup and SSH Activation </h2><p>When your phone restarts, you may be prompted for a PIN.</p>
<p>Use the default PIN, which is usually “<strong>147147</strong>.” Connect your phone to a Wi-Fi network. Open the Console app on your phone and activate SSH to control the phone from your PC. Run the following commands in the Console app on your phone:</p>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  
<figure><img src="https://crackoverflow.com/images/Console-postmarketos-768x1024.jpg" alt="Console-postmarketos-768x1024">
</figure>

<h2 id="step-7-connect-to-your-phone-via-ssh-on-your-pc">Step 7: Connect to Your Phone via SSH on your PC </h2><p>On your PC, open a command prompt or terminal window and connect to your phone via SSH using the following command:</p>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  <div>
  <pre id="4293b7c">  <code>ssh user@IP_Address_of_the_phone</code>
  </pre>
  </div>
<p>The default username for SSH is “<strong>user</strong>,” but you can verify this by running the “<strong>whoami</strong>” command on the Console app of your phone. The&nbsp;<strong>IP_Address_of_the_phone</strong>&nbsp;can be found by typing “<strong>ifconfig</strong>” in the Console app and looking for the IP of&nbsp;<strong>wlan0</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="step-8-install-docker-on-your-android-phone">Step 8: Install Docker on your Android Phone </h2><p>Now that you’re connected to your phone via SSH, you can easily install Docker by running the following commands:</p>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  <div>
  <pre id="1bbe708">  <code>sudo service docker start</code>
  </pre>
  </div>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  <div>
  <pre id="06a9bd2">  <code>sudo rc-update add docker default</code>
  </pre>
  </div>
<p>To verify that&nbsp;<strong>Docker</strong>&nbsp;is installed correctly, run:</p>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  
<h2 id="done-run-docker-containers">DONE! Run Docker Containers </h2><p>With Docker successfully installed on your Android phone, you can now run Docker containers and use your phone as a home server. Let’s try running the Portainer container as an example:</p>
<p>Run the following command to start the Portainer container which will download the Portainer image and start the container.:</p>



  
  
  

  
  
  
  

  

  <div>
  <pre id="1a064e2">  <code>sudo docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest</code>
  </pre>
  </div>
<figure><img src="https://crackoverflow.com/images/portainer-installed-1.jpg" alt="portainer-installed-1">
</figure>

<p>Portainer provides a web-based interface for managing Docker containers and it is easy to use.</p>
<h2 id="access-portainer-interface">Access Portainer Interface </h2><p>Open your web browser on your PC and type in the IP_Address_of_the_phone, followed by “:9443”. This will take you to the Portainer interface running on your Android phone. You can now manage and monitor your Docker containers through this interface.</p>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on your Android phone and set up a Docker container. You can now explore various Docker images and run them on your phone to expand its capabilities as a home server.</p>
<p>I am currently using several containers on my home server, and if you’re interested, in the picture below you will see the memory usage.</p>
<p>This method serves as an excellent alternative to Raspberry Pi. While I haven’t personally tried a Raspberry Pi before, I believe this phone is more capable, with the added advantage of an integrated screen and battery, which are not available with a Raspberry Pi.</p>

</figure>

<h2 id="downsides-of-oneplus-6t-as-a-home-server">Downsides of OnePlus 6T as a Home Server </h2><ul>
<li><strong>No Ethernet Support:</strong> The server relies entirely on Wi-Fi, which may lack the stability and speed of Ethernet.</li>
<li><strong>No External Drive Support:</strong> Storage is limited to internal memory (256GB), making it unsuitable for large-scale storage tasks. However, you can connect to an external NAS for additional storage.</li>
</ul>

<p>It has long been said that <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">naming things
is one of the hard things to do in computer science</a>. That may be
so, but it pales in comparison to the challenge of handling
usernames properly in applications. This is especially true when multiple
applications are involved, and they are all supposed to agree on what
characters are, and are not, allowed. The Debian project is facing
that problem right now, as two user-creation utilities disagreed about
which names are allowable. A plan is in place to sort this out
before the release of Debian&nbsp;13 ("trixie") sometime next year.</p>

<p>The <tt>useradd</tt> utility is part of the <a href="https://github.com/shadow-maint/shadow">shadow-utils</a>
project, which includes programs for managing user and group
accounts. The <tt>shadow-utils</tt> suite is included in Debian's
<tt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=passwd">passwd</a></tt>
package. For historical reasons, and to avoid confusion with the
upstream project, Debian's <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/debian/shadow">version of the
shadow-utils sources</a> are often referred to as "<tt>src:shadow</tt>".</p>

<!-- middle-ad -->

<p>Most Debian users don't work with <tt>useradd</tt>, or
<tt>groupadd</tt>, directly. Instead, Debian has long supplied its own
<tt><a href="https://manpages.debian.org/bookworm/adduser/adduser.8.en.html">adduser</a></tt>
(and <tt>addgroup</tt>)
utilities, originally written by founder Ian Murdock. These act as
simpler front ends to <tt>useradd</tt> and use Debian-supplied system
defaults for creating users' home directories and configurations. It
should be noted that <tt>useradd</tt>, et al., have become much more
full-featured since Debian's utilities were introduced, but the
project continues to maintain them nonetheless.</p>

<h4>Little Bobby Tables</h4>

<p>In June, Debian developer and <tt>src:shadow</tt> maintainer Chris
Hofstaedtler <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1074306">filed
a bug</a> against the <tt>adduser</tt> package. The
<tt>src:shadow</tt> package had dropped a <a href="https://sources.debian.org/patches/shadow/1:4.16.0-5/debian/Relax-usernames-groupnames-checking.patch/">Debian-specific
patch</a>, originally introduced in 2003 by Karl Ramm, to allow
characters far beyond what were allowed by the upstream
<tt>shadow-utils</tt> project. In the patch, Ramm wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
I can't come up with a good justification as to why characters other
than ':'s and '\0's should be disallowed in group and usernames (other
than '-' as the leading character).  Thus, the maintenance tools don't
anymore.
</blockquote>

<p>Hofstaedtler said that he had puzzled out some of the patch's
purpose from old bug reports that had been "fixed" by the patch, and
those asked for two things not allowed by the upstream
<tt>shadow-utils</tt>: usernames with upper-case characters or that
are purely numeric. Hofstaedtler said that upper-case names had been
allowed in the upstream <tt>shadow-utils</tt> project "<q>a long time
ago</q>", but it seemed like a bad idea to allow purely numeric
usernames.</p>

<p>The patch enabled much more than upper-case and purely numeric names,
though. With the patch dropped in version <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1539923/accepted-shadow-14152-2-source-into-unstable/">1:4.15.2-2</a> of the
<tt>shadow</tt> source package, one of <tt>adduser</tt>'s
<nobr>tests—which</nobr> explicitly allowed a username reminiscent of a <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/">famous xkcd comic</a>
<nobr>("<q>bob;&gt;/hacked</q>")—had failed</nobr>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For src:shadow, I would really like to not have a divergence from
upstream in this regard. I think if we have clear requirements then we
(I) can submit them upstream and I would expect upstream to accept
patches.</p>

<p>I do feel that making the case for "bob;&gt;/hacked" would be very
hard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hofstaedtler said that the patch had been reapplied for the time
being, it was included again in version <a href="https://tracker.debian.org/news/1540076/accepted-shadow-14152-3-source-into-unstable/">1:4.15.2-3</a>, but he asked if
username requirements could be sorted out in time for the Debian
"trixie" release. If the patch were dropped entirely, then
<tt>useradd</tt> would restrict usernames to the POSIX standard, with
the exception of allowing a "$" character at the end of a username </p>

<p>Debian developer and <tt>adduser</tt> maintainer Marc Haber <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=1074306#21">replied</a>
in late October that other tests were failing as well, and thought
that "<q>useradd upstream is being too picky here</q>". Since
<tt>adduser</tt> depends on <tt>useradd</tt> it could not create users
that <tt>useradd</tt> would reject, he said he would like to
synchronize on what would be allowed or not.</p>

<p>As part of the research into what should be allowed in usernames,
Haber took over Debian's <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UserAccounts">UserAccounts</a> wiki
page, which outlines Debian's username tools and policies, and started
looking into whether the project should relax its requirements around
usernames.</p>

<h4>Limits on usernames</h4>

<p>One of the questions that bubbles up when looking at usernames is
not just allowable characters, but the allowable length of the
username. The documentation for <tt>shadow-utils</tt> does not specify a
length for usernames or what encoding is being used. 

</p><p>However, the POSIX standard says that usernames should not include
non-ASCII characters to be portable between systems. The standard <a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_409">says</a>
that usernames should be "<q>composed of characters from the portable
filename character set</q>". That set is comprised of numbers 0
through 9, upper-case and lower-case "a" through "z", the period (.),
underscore (_), and hyphen (-). It also specifies that usernames
should not begin with a hyphen.</p>

<p>It is, however, possible to assign characters outside that set with
the tools at hand. But Linux distributions usually put up some
guardrails in the <tt>adduser</tt> and <tt>useradd</tt> configurations
to prevent administrators from creating usernames with non-ASCII
characters unintentionally. These configurations can be overridden with 
<tt>adduser</tt>'s <tt>--allow-bad-names</tt> option or <tt>useradd</tt>'s
<tt>--badname</tt> option.</p>  

<p>In November, Haber <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Zz9xogrnHDSFjZUn@torres.zugschlus.de/">posted</a>
a message on debian-devel that he had "<q>opened an especially nasty
can of worms</q>" and was finding that things were more complicated
than he had understood. He sought input and opinions on a number of
questions about whether Debian should allow non-ASCII characters for usernames, how
to do that if so, and if it was more appropriate to document username
guidance in Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">Policy Manual</a>
rather than its wiki. His suggestion was to allow UTF-8 for regular
user accounts, but to restrict to ASCII for system accounts created by
Debian packages.</p>

<p>Richard Lewis <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/86a5dss0n6.fsf@simplex.rtf.org.uk/">asked</a>
if enabling UTF-8 would open the door to "<q>some of the abuse
described</q>" in a 2021 LWN article about <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/874951/">flaws in Unicode handling</a>
that led to security exploits. He said that it seemed to be a bad
idea to make the change, even if it would be nicer for users to have
the option.</p>

<p>Haber <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0BQgtaAgb1LYmCt@torres.zugschlus.de/">said</a>
that he was not sure if it would be dangerous to allow UTF-8 usernames,
"<q>since we can expect other commands to gracefully handle a byte
stream, can't we?</q>" Additionally, local administrators already
can loosen restrictions to allow UTF-8 usernames, but Debian does
not test for such use cases. Debian would become "<q>more robust</q>"
if it assumed UTF-8 characters would be used in usernames.
"<q>Vulnerabilities that could be exploited by having non-ascii
user names are already here and present today, just not uncovered yet.</q>"</p>

<p>It would be reasonable, Timo Röhling <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/d4qdqpeuqkgebg5hundayqafzurk72ledcv7udwdm3nwaifnpu@3hkwinihtwp2/">said</a>,
to mitigate possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">homograph attacks</a> by disallowing mixed alphabets
"<q>such as cyrillic and latin letters in the same name</q>". Haber <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0CzbtHUtX_8YeSq@torres.zugschlus.de/">said</a>
that was not going to help if a user could directly write to
<tt>/etc/passwd</tt>, and he was unwilling to implement that himself
in <tt>adduser</tt>. He would accept code and test cases written by
others, though.</p>

<h4>Keyboards</h4>

<p>Security concerns aside, there are other practical problems with
supporting non-ASCII usernames. Étienne Mollier <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0DekqnxO9PARyrH@emlwks999.eu/">noted</a> that he had "<q>one weird
enough</q>" character in his first name that posed a problem if he had
to log in using a keyboard layout that lacked the capability to
transcribe the lower-case or upper-case 'e' acute characters ("é" or
"É"). For that reason, he said, he felt better about keeping a full
ASCII username and "<q>wouldn't feel strongly if unicode support for
login never happens</q>". But it would be good if the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecos_field">gecos field</a> of
the <tt>passwd</tt> file had proper Unicode support to properly
display users' real names.</p>

<p>Not only was it difficult to type "é" on some keyboards, it could
also be encoded in multiple ways. Gioele Barabucci <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/15f881af-2f62-494e-b6ea-a13f16eec959@svario.it/">pointed
out</a> that it could be "<q>e
with acute</q>" which is encoded in UTF as <tt>U+00E9</tt>, or it
could be "<q>e, combined with an [acute] accent</q>" which would be
<tt>U+0065</tt> plus <tt>U+0301</tt>:</p>

<blockquote>
If a keyboard input system provides the 
former sequence of bytes, but the username is stored in the login 
infrastructure using the latter sequence of [bytes], then a naive 
comparison will not find the user "émollier" in the system. Unicode 
defines in Annex 15 a few normalization forms as a way to work around 
this problem. But a correct use of these normalization forms still 
requires coordination and standardization among all programs accessing 
the data.
</blockquote>

<p>He asked if POSIX or other standards provided a normalization form
for UTF-8 encoded usernames. Peter Pentchev <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0EVkB84K5nI5vnw@straylight.m.ringlet.net/">responded</a>
that POSIX said to stick to the portable filename character set to
ensure portability. Haber <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0dLt65uVbZLxK_e@torres.zugschlus.de/">argued</a>
that it should be up to local admins to decide whether they wanted
their local user database to be portable. "<q>I don't think that we should restrict
local admins who don't need that kind of portability.</q>"</p>

<p>Simon McVittie <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0M2B4CqjmJbJ5iS@remnant.pseudorandom.co.uk/">recommended</a>
that Debian consider adopting systemd's <a href="https://systemd.io/USER_NAMES/">user name syntax</a> and
concepts of "strict mode" and "relaxed mode". The systemd tooling
adheres to a strict naming convention when creating usernames, but
it has a relaxed convention for accepting usernames created by other
tools. McVittie said that seemed like a good principle for Debian to
follow, even if its specific rules might differ from systemd's.</p>

<p>Haber seemed to agree in part, but said systemd's strict mode was
"<q>even stricter than what we currently allow for system
accounts</q>", and he did not like that systemd's policies (especially with
<tt>systemd-homed</tt>, which LWN <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/995915/">covered recently</a>) were not configurable.</p>

<h4>This time it's personal</h4>

<p>The discussion, perhaps not surprisingly, brought out some strong
feelings about how names and usernames were represented. Especially
when, as Hofstaedtler <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/n2uzj625zhxsg7ju6ox5vtx5cmbafzbecxb4lvv72sqruykk5s@qwlfypn2eo4e/">noted</a>,
usernames can be important to some users:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see and type my username hundreds times a day, people use it
to address me in written and spoken conversations with it, etc.</p>

<p>If it were my uid, which I see maybe once a week and don't have to
remember, I wouldn't care.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed, it's not uncommon in open-source communities or within
organizations to use a person's username rather than their given
name—so it is unsurprising that some people feel strongly that
usernames should be composed of a wider range of characters than POSIX
recommends. Others <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/D5UKN8ASXWNV.31KHR2M4P1Q4Z@philkern.de/">dislike
the practice</a> of conflating usernames with real-world names, and
see little reason to go to any trouble to go beyond ASCII.</p>

<p>Johannes Schauer Marin Rodrigues <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/173235075276.3934267.16369985803329427907@localhost/">supported</a>
allowing more than ASCII in usernames. He said it would be good for
Debian to put pressure on other projects to provide Unicode
support. "<q>We cannot find these kind of bugs if we accept
translating everybody's given name to the American alphabet.</q>"
Bálint Réczey, though, <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/CAK0Odpz6tXkceqimZ+Nd=GSN7bMQZOy3s25nEq6U=d40Y+M-ug@mail.gmail.com/">asked</a>
that Debian avoid opening that can of worms and imposing needless work
on upstreams. "<q>Keep what works reasonably well for decades.</q>"</p>

<h4>A plan</h4>

<p>Haber initially <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0BSfVx_GjzBOGgV@torres.zugschlus.de/">seemed
bullish</a> on allowing UTF-8 usernames in Debian "<q>as a courtesy to those people who need non-ascii user names to
write their name</q>" and as an opportunity to find "<q>bugs that are
already here</q>" in Debian's software. He acknowledged that it is late
in the development cycle for trixie. But, since it was currently
possible to create usernames with UTF-8 characters, he did not want
to tighten restrictions in trixie versus Debian&nbsp;12, only to
revisit those restrictions for Debian&nbsp;14. In a reply to Mollier
he <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z0dJo6l-CXZQFHU3@torres.zugschlus.de/">wondered</a>
about what advice to give in Debian's documentation "<q>once we have
decided to officially allow UTF-8 login names</q>".</p>

<p>On December 3, however, Haber <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z08v5ReoUOOaBi8H@torres.zugschlus.de/">said</a>
that he "<q>finally understood</q>" that UTF-8 support would require
more than the ability to create an UTF-8 encoded username and write 
it to <tt>/etc/passwd</tt>. Homograph characters, such as U+00E9 (é)
and U+0065 plus U+0301 (é), could be used with <tt>adduser</tt> to
create two separate users with lookalike usernames:</p>

<blockquote>
At the least, adduser should reject creating étienne if étienne
already exists - those are different user names but look the same, and
if you don't cut-and-paste user names instead of typing them you're
bound to hit the wrong user depending on HOW you type and what input
medium you use. Not good.
</blockquote>

<p>Haber said that he was the only active developer working on
<tt>adduser</tt> and did not have time to implement a check against
lookalike usernames in time for the trixie release. Worse, he said,
the Perl module that he would use (<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Unicode::Precis">Unicode::Precis</a>)
was not packaged for Debian and had not had a release in more than
five years.</p>

<p>The next version of <tt>adduser</tt>, Haber said, would reject
UTF-8 usernames by default. They would still be allowed when using the
<tt>--allow-bad-names</tt> option, but he said he wanted to deprecate
that option name in favor of something that doesn't use the word
"bad". The <tt>--allow-all-names</tt> option will continue to pass
everything verbatim to <tt>useradd</tt>.</p>

<p>Mollier <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z09e0lyrPtwulBbv@emlwks999.eu/">thanked</a>
Haber for his work on the problem, and suggested some
alternatives to the bad names option. Barabucci also <a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/3e2679c3-bc1a-49ab-8fe1-2fa6b8b132b8@svario.it/">thanked</a>
Haber for taking the time to research the issue, to which Haber
<a href="https://lwn.net/ml/all/Z09yAiCCsZ5Xu8bM@torres.zugschlus.de/">replied
dryly</a>, "<q>I have learned many things.</q>"</p>

<p>Haber's current course of action for <tt>adduser</tt> seems the
most prudent. There may be a day when it is more practical to expand
the allowed characters for usernames, but the work required to do so
right now is far greater than the benefits that users would gain in
the process.</p>

These teams typically:</p><ul><li><p>Start with a design or rough concept</p></li><li><p>Use AI to generate a complete initial codebase</p></li><li><p>Get a working prototype in hours or days instead of weeks</p></li><li><p>Focus on rapid validation and iteration</p></li></ul><p>The results can be impressive. I recently watched a solo developer use Bolt to turn a Figma design into a working web app in next to no time. It wasn't production-ready, but it was good enough to get very initial user feedback.</p><p>The second camp uses tools like Cursor, Cline, Copilot, and WindSurf for their daily development workflow. This is less flashy but potentially more transformative. These developers are:</p><ul><li><p>Using AI for code completion and suggestions</p></li><li><p>Leveraging AI for complex refactoring tasks</p></li><li><p>Generating tests and documentation</p></li><li><p>Using AI as a "pair programmer" for problem-solving</p></li></ul><p>But here's the catch: while both approaches can dramatically accelerate development, they come with hidden costs that aren't immediately obvious.</p><p>When you watch a senior engineer work with AI tools like Cursor or Copilot, it looks like magic. They can scaffold entire features in minutes, complete with tests and documentation. But watch carefully, and you'll notice something crucial: They're not just accepting what the AI suggests. They're constantly:</p><ul><li><p>Refactoring the generated code into smaller, focused modules</p></li><li><p>Adding edge case handling the AI missed</p></li><li><p>Strengthening type definitions and interfaces</p></li><li><p>Questioning architectural decisions</p></li><li><p>Adding comprehensive error handling</p></li></ul><p>In other words, they're applying years of hard-won engineering wisdom to shape and constrain the AI's output. The AI is accelerating their implementation, but their expertise is what keeps the code maintainable.</p><p>Junior engineers often miss these crucial steps. They accept the AI's output more readily, leading to what I call "house of cards code" – it looks complete but collapses under real-world pressure.</p><p>Here's the most counterintuitive thing I've discovered: AI tools help experienced developers more than beginners. This seems backward – shouldn't AI democratize coding?</p><p>The reality is that AI is like having a very eager junior developer on your team. They can write code quickly, but they need constant supervision and correction. The more you know, the better you can guide them.</p><p><strong>This creates what I call the "knowledge paradox":</strong></p><ul><li><p>Seniors use AI to accelerate what they already know how to do</p></li><li><p>Juniors try to use AI to learn what to do</p></li><li><p>The results differ dramatically</p></li></ul><p><strong>I've watched senior engineers use AI to:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Rapidly prototype ideas they already understand</p></li><li><p>Generate basic implementations they can then refine</p></li><li><p>Explore alternative approaches to known problems</p></li><li><p>Automate routine coding tasks</p></li></ul><p><strong>Meanwhile, juniors often:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Accept incorrect or outdated solutions</p></li><li><p>Miss critical security and performance considerations</p></li><li><p>Struggle to debug AI-generated code</p></li><li><p>Build fragile systems they don't fully understand</p></li></ul><p><span>A </span><a href="https://x.com/petergyang/status/1863058206752379255" rel="">tweet</a><span> that recently caught my eye perfectly captures what I've been observing in the field: Non-engineers using AI for coding find themselves hitting a frustrating wall.

The initial progress feels magical - you can describe what you want, and AI tools like v0 or Bolt will generate a working prototype that looks impressive. But then reality sets in.</p><p>What typically happens next follows a predictable pattern:</p><ul><li><p>You try to fix a small bug</p></li><li><p>The AI suggests a change that seems reasonable</p></li><li><p>This fix breaks something else</p></li><li><p>You ask AI to fix the new issue</p></li><li><p>This creates two more problems</p></li><li><p>Rinse and repeat</p></li></ul><p>This cycle is particularly painful for non-engineers because they lack the mental models to understand what's actually going wrong. When an experienced developer encounters a bug, they can reason about potential causes and solutions based on years of pattern recognition. Without this background, you're essentially playing whack-a-mole with code you don't fully understand.</p><p>There's a deeper issue here: The very thing that makes AI coding tools accessible to non-engineers - their ability to handle complexity on your behalf - can actually impede learning. When code just "appears" without you understanding the underlying principles:</p><ul><li><p>You don't develop debugging skills</p></li><li><p>You miss learning fundamental patterns</p></li><li><p>You can't reason about architectural decisions</p></li><li><p>You struggle to maintain and evolve the code</p></li></ul><p>This creates a dependency where you need to keep going back to AI to fix issues, rather than developing the expertise to handle them yourself.</p><p>The most successful non-engineers I've seen using AI coding tools take a hybrid approach:</p><ol><li><p>Use AI for rapid prototyping</p></li><li><p>Take time to understand how the generated code works</p></li><li><p>Learn basic programming concepts alongside AI usage</p></li><li><p>Build up a foundation of knowledge gradually</p></li><li><p>Use AI as a learning tool, not just a code generator</p></li></ol><p>But this requires patience and dedication - exactly the opposite of what many people hope to achieve by using AI tools in the first place.</p><p>This "70% problem" suggests that current AI coding tools are best viewed as:</p><ul><li><p>Prototyping accelerators for experienced developers</p></li><li><p>Learning aids for those committed to understanding development</p></li><li><p>MVP generators for validating ideas quickly</p></li></ul><p>But they're not yet the coding democratization solution many hoped for. The final 30% - the part that makes software production-ready, maintainable, and robust - still requires real engineering knowledge.</p><p>The good news? This gap will likely narrow as tools improve. But for now, the most pragmatic approach is to use AI to accelerate learning, not replace it entirely.</p><p>After observing dozens of teams, here's what I've seen work consistently:</p><ul><li><p>Let AI generate a basic implementation</p></li><li><p>Manually review and refactor for modularity</p></li><li><p>Add comprehensive error handling</p></li><li><p>Write thorough tests</p></li><li><p>Document key decisions</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Start new AI chats for each distinct task</p></li><li><p>Keep context focused and minimal</p></li><li><p>Review and commit changes frequently</p></li><li><p>Maintain tight feedback loops</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Use AI for initial code generation</p></li><li><p>Manual review of all critical paths</p></li><li><p>Automated testing of edge cases</p></li><li><p>Regular security audits</p></li></ul><p>Despite these challenges, I'm optimistic about AI's role in software development. The key is understanding what it's really good for:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Accelerating the known</strong><br><span>AI excels at helping us implement patterns we already understand.

The happy path works beautifully. Investors and social networks are wowed. But when real users start clicking around? That's when things fall apart.</p><p>I've seen this firsthand:</p><ul><li><p>Error messages that make no sense to normal users</p></li><li><p>Edge cases that crash the application</p></li><li><p>Confusing UI states that never got cleaned up</p></li><li><p>Accessibility completely overlooked</p></li><li><p>Performance issues on slower devices</p></li></ul><p>These aren't just P2 bugs - they're the difference between software people tolerate and software people love.</p><p>Creating truly self-serve software - the kind where users never need to contact support - requires a different mindset:</p><ul><li><p>Obsessing over error messages</p></li><li><p>Testing on slow connections</p></li><li><p>Handling every edge case gracefully</p></li><li><p>Making features discoverable</p></li><li><p>Testing with real, often non-technical users</p></li></ul><p>This kind of attention to detail (perhaps) can't be AI-generated. It comes from empathy, experience, and caring deeply about craft.</p><p>I believe we're going to see a renaissance of personal software development. As the market gets flooded with AI-generated MVPs, the products that will stand out are those built by developers who:</p><ul><li><p>Take pride in their craft</p></li><li><p>Care about the little details</p></li><li><p>Focus on the full user experience</p></li><li><p>Build for the edge cases</p></li><li><p>Create truly self-serve experiences</p></li></ul><p>The irony? AI tools might actually enable this renaissance. By handling the routine coding tasks, they free up developers to focus on what matters most - creating software that truly serves and delights users.</p><p>AI isn't making our software dramatically better because software quality was (perhaps) never primarily limited by coding speed. The hard parts of software development – understanding requirements, designing maintainable systems, handling edge cases, ensuring security and performance – still require human judgment.</p><p>What AI does do is let us iterate and experiment faster, potentially leading to better solutions through more rapid exploration. But only if we maintain our engineering discipline and use AI as a tool, not a replacement for good software practices. Remember: The goal isn't to write more code faster. It's to build better software. Used wisely, AI can help us do that. But it's still up to us to know what "better" means and how to achieve it.</p><p>What's your experience been with AI-assisted development?

<p>​The first journey we made with the gold picture frame sledge was to a small glacier not far from the base known as 'Sunnyside Glacier'. Me and Fergal Buckley took photographs of several toys with this picturesque backdrop including these plastic toy dogs from the 'Action man' Antarctic explorer set. I am in the distance behind the sledge. The outcrop of rock behind me is the beginning of a small range of mountains known as '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stokes_Peaks#_blank">Stokes Peaks</a>'. I found out later that this collection of peaks were affectionately named after some of the last sled dogs in Antarctica.</p>

Officially they are&nbsp; called 'man' food boxes.&nbsp; This is an anachronistic title; a left-over definition from the days of using dogs- 'Man' food differentiating them from `dog' food boxes.

In view of their genetic similarity to seals there was a fear that dog distemper might mutate and cross over into the seal population. In view of this, dogs were especially targeted for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.antarctica.ac.uk/about_antarctica/environment/wildlife/removal_of_sledge_dogs.php" target="_BLANK ">removal</a>&nbsp;and the last ones were taken from Antarctica in 1994.</p><p>Somebody I met in Antarctica, David Vaughan, had been to the U.S. base,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station" target="_BLANK ">MacMurdo station</a>&nbsp;on the other side of the continent. Very close to the base was Captain Scott's original hut at&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Evans" target="_BLANK ">Cape Evans</a>. It was from here that his expedition set out in 1911. David Vaughan showed me this photograph he had taken on his trip of a dead dog with a collar still attached. It had been one of Scott's team of dogs and been preserved in the ice.&nbsp; He went on to explain that the dead dog was well known at MacMurdo base. It was annually covered with snow every winter and exposed again each spring in the thaw. Perpetually emerging and disappearing in the snow for a hundred years.</p></div>

<p><em>There is a building on Rothera base called Old Bransfield house. It's one of the older buidings being constructed in the the 1970's. The building was semi redundant in 2009 and pinned on the walls were several old photographs of some of the last dogs in Antarctica. Biff, Elwood and Tom all had small mountains named afer them.&nbsp; </em>&nbsp;</p>

So we'd ask you to sign a simple CLA that retains your copyright, ensures that

<p dir="auto">We chose this license over more popular, similar copyleft licenses such as
AGPLv3 due to its narrower definition of derivative work that only covers
modifications to TrailBase itself. This is similar to GPL's classpath exception
or LGPL's linkage exception allowing the use of TrailBase as a framework
without inflicting licensing requirements on original work layered on top.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As part of a national “moonshot” to cure blindness, researchers at the CU Anschutz Medical Campus will receive as much as $46 million in federal funding over the next five years to pursue a first-of-its-kind full eye transplantation.</p><p>“This is no easy undertaking, but I believe we can achieve this together,” said Dr. Kia Washington, the lead researcher for the University of Colorado-led team, during a press conference Monday. “And in fact I’ve never been more hopeful that a cure for blindness is within reach.”</p><p>The CU team was one of four in the United States that received funding awards from the <a href="https://arpa-h.gov/news-and-events/arpa-h-announces-pioneering-investments-restore-vision-people-who-are-blind">federal Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health</a>, or ARPA-H. The CU-based group will focus on achieving the first-ever vision-restoring eye transplant by using “novel stem cell and bioelectronic technologies,” according to a news release announcing the funding.</p><p>The work will be interdisciplinary, Washington and others said, and will link together researchers at institutions across the country. The four teams that received the funding will work alongside each other on distinct approaches, though officials said the teams would likely collaborate and eventually may merge depending on which research avenues show the most promise toward achieving the ultimate goal of transplanting an eye and curing blindness.</p><p>Dr. Calvin Roberts, who will oversee the broader project for ARPA-H, said the agency wanted to take multiple “shots on goal” to ensure progress.</p><p>“In the broader picture, achieving this would be probably the most monumental task in medicine within the last several decades,” said Dr. Daniel Pelaez of the University of Miami’s Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, which also received ARPA-H funding. Pelaez is the lead investigator for that team, which has pursued new procedures to successfully remove and preserve eyes from donors, amid other research.</p><p>He told The Denver Post that only four organ systems have not been successfully transplanted: the inner ear, the brain, the spinal cord and the eye. All four are part of the central nervous system, which does not repair itself when damaged.</p><p>If researchers can successfully transplant the human eye and restore vision to the patient, it might help unlock deeper discoveries about repairing damage to the brain and spine, Pelaez said, as well as addressing hearing loss.</p><p>To succeed, researchers must successfully remove and preserve eyes from donors and then successfully connect and repair the optical nerve, which takes information from the eye and tells the brain what the eye sees.</p><p>A team at New York University <a href="https://nyulangone.org/news/nyu-langone-health-performs-worlds-first-whole-eye-partial-face-transplant">performed a full eye transplant</a> on a human patient in November 2023, though the procedure — while a “remarkable achievement,” Pelaez said — did not restore the patient’s vision. It was also part of a partial face transplant; other approaches pursued via the ARPA-H funding will involve eye-specific transplants.</p><p>Washington, the lead CU researcher, said she and her colleagues have already completed the eye transplant procedure — albeit without vision restoration — in rats.</p><p>The CU team will next work on large animals to advance “optic nerve regenerative strategies,” the school said, as well as to study immunosuppression, which is critical to ensuring that patients’ immune systems don’t reject a donated organ. The goal is to eventually advance to human trials.</p><p>Pelaez and his colleagues have completed their eye-removal procedure in cadavers, he said, and they’ve also studied regeneration in several animals that are capable of regenerating parts of their eyes, like salamanders or zebra fish.&nbsp;His team’s funding will focus in part on a life-support machine for the eye to keep it healthy and viable during the removal process.</p><p>InGel Therapeutics, a Massachusetts-based Harvard spinoff and the lead of a third team, will pursue research on 3-D printed technology and “micro-tunneled scaffolds” that carry certain types of stem cells as part of a focus on optical nerve regeneration and repair, <a href="https://arpa-h.gov/news-and-events/arpa-h-announces-pioneering-investments-restore-vision-people-who-are-blind">ARPA-H said.</a></p><p>ARPH-A, created two years ago, will oversee the teams’ work. Researchers at 52 institutions nationwide will also contribute to the teams.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto"><p><span>If you haven’t heard the news, </span><a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1719/intel-announces-retirement-of-ceo-pat-gelsinger" rel="">Pat Gelsinger is “retiring</a><span>.” The reality is this was not a retirement but a </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger-retire-2024-12-02/" rel="">firing of Pat</a><span>. His brief stint of 1386 days was surprising because not only was he the most technically competent CEO of the last few bad apples at Intel, but he was also among the shortest. </span></p><p>Pat has by no means been perfect, and the conference at UBS kind of showed the frustrations that the board likely had with Pat.</p><blockquote><p>I'd say, the one thing that has definitely come out of the way the Board is thinking about this is, they do recognize and have pushed us that, hey, we made a lot of investments from a capital perspective in foundry, and we need to start seeing some incremental ROIC on those investments. And so and that's what we're committed to do. That's going to be my -- one of my major focuses, definitely, while I'm CFO or as I'm CFO. But of course, in the interim period where I'm CEO, I'll obviously be focused on that as well. </p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Pat wanted to pursue the big, bold IFS bet, with 100s of thousands of wafers, when the reality is just getting 10s of thousands of wafers is a massive problem as is. Pat has a bit of an optimistic naivety that comes into play, and I am sure it was likely frustrating. But the reality is he’s the single best candidate for the company. </p><p><span>More importantly than being suited for the job, </span><em>he wants to do it</em><span>. It’s probably one of the most challenging jobs in the world, and he’s playing for the hometown. The CEOs who got Intel into this mess were much longer than Pat and a worse fit. Meanwhile, the board let most of his predecessor’s activities go unchecked as they sped through disaster. </span></p><p>This begs the question—what the hell was the board doing? Today, I will talk about Pat Gelsinger, the Intel board, and an example of when boards and short-termism fail. Yes, maybe splitting up the company would result in a better result for shareholders, but it would be much worse for America. </p><p>I would liken firing Pat in the final hour of 18A to quitting the final round of chemotherapy in cancer treatment. Instead of seeing the long and painful process through, I think the board will let Intel die and be sold for parts. It’s the correct answer to maximize relatively short-term shareholder value, but it's a nearsighted move that the Intel board specializes in. </p><p>So, what does that mean for the storied giant? Let’s dive deeper. Today, I’ll discuss the board, Pat, and where Intel is headed. There are so many clues, and I believe the saddest outcome is the most likely here. </p><p>So, it’s time to talk about the board. Remember, we have to consider each board member's key attributes. For this analysis, I’ll be looking at: </p><ul><li><p>Semiconductor experience</p></li><li><p>Other company/work experience</p></li><li><p>Tenure at Intel</p></li></ul><p>Meet the board members and committees. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png" width="1456" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:79330,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe2fbb2e0-9882-4844-80e0-feb024d3e0f3_1495x1051.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><strong>Frank Yeary (Chairman of Board &amp;

He is the Chairman of the Autodesk board, which currently has an activist investor </span><a href="https://aecmag.com/features/activist-investor-pursues-autodesk/" rel="">because it’s poorly managed</a><span>. He also is on the Wolfspeed Board (which is poorly managed). So he has experience, but his other experiences don’t look that great.</span></p><p><span>The incoming board members are both super technically skilled, but I want to focus on the backward-looking board for this analysis. </span><a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1721/intel-appoints-semiconductor-leaders-eric-meurice-and-steve" rel="">Eric Meurice and Steve Sanghi are very qualified</a><span> but just got there. </span></p><p><span>The board is pretty horrific. Most of the people have no technical expertise, and many of the people most at fault for getting Intel to where it is, are </span><em>still on the board.</em><span> </span></p><p><span>Let’s take a second to acknowledge that Boeing's&nbsp;</span><em>EVP of operations</em><span> is the audit committee head and has been on the board for the entire fiasco. That’s probably the only other American giant having as bad a time as Intel! </span></p><p><span>There are many Medtronic-related members, people with medical backgrounds, and what it looks like to be a </span><em>professional board member</em><span>. An average panel of semiconductor professionals would likely be more qualified to manage the board than the current board! </span></p><p><span>The most senior board members (responsible for the disaster) are in positions of power, and the former chairman is </span><em>still on the board</em><span>. He should be fired. The lack of semiconductor experience is staggering. Only one person with industry and semiconductor experience isn’t a professor; they joined this year. </span><strong>This is a disaster board, and the blind are leading the seeing.</strong><span> That’s why Pat got fired; the board doesn’t know what it’s doing. Pat’s faults are real, but how could he get objective feedback from this board? </span></p><p>What’s more, there’s an interesting and evident dynamic with the new chairman. My quick read on the situation is that the new Chairman got his job in 2023, only 2 years after Pat got the job. And when you’re an incoming chairman, you don’t sound smart by saying, “Let’s continue the strategy that will have to cut to the bone to save the patient.” You sound a lot smarter coming in with a change plan, and given Frank's M&amp;A background, his ideas will likely always be based on M&amp;A, so it’s time to sell the company for parts.</p><p><span>So Frank did what deal guys do: He looked for some deals. We’ve heard the rumored Qualcomm buyout and Altera sale, so we know the board is looking for options. But how does that impact Pat? I think the key is actually in a </span><a href="https://stratechery.com/2022/an-interview-with-intel-ceo-pat-gelsinger/" rel="">Stratchery Interview</a><span>. Check out this interview excerpt. </span></p><blockquote><p><strong>Pat Gelsinger:</strong><span> Let me give maybe three different answers to that question, and these become more intellectual as we go along. The first one was I wrote a strategy document for the board of directors and </span><strong>I said if you want to split the company in two, then you should hire a PE kind of guy to go do that, not me</strong><span>. My strategy is what’s become </span><strong><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership.html" rel="">IDM 2.0</a></strong><span> and I described it. So if you’re hiring me, that’s the strategy and 100% of the board asked me to be the CEO and supported the strategy I laid out, of which this is one of the pieces. So the first thing was all of that discussion happened before I took the job as the CEO, so there was no debate, no contemplation, et cetera, this is it.</span></p></blockquote><p>The strategy has changed at the top, and now the chairman thinks it’s time for a “PE kind of guy” because IDM 2.0’s grand vision has sailed, and now it’s time for a deal.  </p><p><span>There are more signs as well. Intel has an activist </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/23/intel-intc-activist-defense-sources.html" rel="">defense campaign</a><span>, meaning the board feels pressure. The Qualcomm and Altera rumors were clearly leaked, and Intel is likely looking for outside buyers. The chairman’s strategy is to sell as much as he can. What is confusing is that the recent CHIPs Act funding also has </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/intels-786-billion-subsidy-deal-restricts-sale-its-manufacturing-unit-2024-11-28/" rel="">heavy sale restrictions</a><span>. The vultures are circling, and Pat has said publically, “I’m not that CEO,” so the board decided enough is enough. </span></p><p><span>The board has decided to gut Intel. Four former board members </span><a href="https://fortune.com/2024/10/22/why-breaking-intel-in-two-is-the-only-way-to-save-americas-most-important-manufacturer-according-to-its-former-board-directors/" rel="">wrote an OpEd about splitting the company in two</a><span>. The winds of change are clearly to abandon IDM 2.0,  and Pat doesn’t fit into that picture. Now, here’s the thing - I do think that gutting Intel makes sense for shareholder value. Hell, selling Altera and accelerating the sale of Mobileye is an obvious move. A sum of the part thesis there probably works, as Intel’s stake in Mobileye, Altera, IFS, and Design all are worth something, and that’s probably higher than the share price today. </span></p><p>But the reality is that outcome also sucks and feels extremely short-term oriented. I would argue that this is the right move in the short term, “value creation,” but in the long term, there couldn’t be a worse outcome for shareholders, industry partners, and, importantly, America. </p><p>This is the board's failure, but I have to ask: who hires them exactly?  </p><p>The board isn’t qualified. Let’s contrast the above resumes with Pat’s. Pat was the CTO of Intel in its heyday, the chief architect of the i486 that saved the company, and probably one of the most decorated electrical engineers of all time. On the other hand, the board is run by a group of people with no semiconductor experience, and some are legitimate undermanagement scenarios (Boeing, Autodesk, Paypal).</p><p>The board's chairman has been involved in the entire debacle since 2009. He could have voted against Pat getting the job over Brian Krzanich in 2009. But this is where things get interesting—while boards are a way to govern boards effectively, they are not perfect.</p><p>The board has almost unanimous votes for “yes” despite royally screwing up the company year after year. And why is that? </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png" width="1059" height="634" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:634,&quot;width&quot;:1059,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:136165,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd179d4a9-5eb9-4934-9924-0b633227a0d1_1059x634.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a></figure></div><p><span>I will take another step deeper than the board, and that’s the investors. Most large investors vote alongside </span><a href="https://www.glasslewis.com/" rel="">Glass Lewis</a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.issgovernance.com/" rel="">ISS</a><span> recommendations, the two most prominent proxy solutions for investors. Most GL/ISS recommendations tend to vote with the board and don’t change much unless something drastic happens. If you’re a </span><em>passive investor</em><span>, you vote in line with the two proxy powerhouses. </span></p><p>Intel’s board has been running on autopilot for a long time. There should have been an activist sooner. The problem (and I have talked to activists) is that the ship is tough to turn around, and the odds are you don’t make money. So, the risk reward is pretty bad, and fixing the company means treading water, not a homerun in equity returns. </p><p>Ironically, most investors look at the Intel situation and rightfully say, “Wow, that is way too hard,” and that’s the problem. Why fix when you can flee to the 1000s of other company’s stock? The people who left owning the company are primarily passive investors who will vote with Glass-Lewis and ISS. The top 3 shareholders are passive, with 30% of the vote, and going down the list of shareholders, it’s clear there’s not much active ownership in the company. </p><div><figure><a target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM" rel=""><div><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png" width="1456" height="637" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:637,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:211196,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3fb8e91e-4506-4ae2-b163-d6118dc83a14_1502x657.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture></div></a><figcaption>Primecap, UBS, Capital Group could possibly considered passive.

Meanwhile, the board made voting recommendations yearly, and Glass Lewis and ISS went with the board. Intel’s board is being run on autopilot, and that’s how we got the list of supremely unqualified board members. This is an excellent example of how boards fail. No one raised their hand to stop the autopilot, and now the formerly greatest American semiconductor company is in shambles. </p><p><span>They have fired the technical leader they needed to turn around Intel. There are valid reasons, as Pat’s naive optimism can feel delusional. It never felt like he never </span><em>truly</em><span> acknowledged the problem at hand and had visions of old Intel in his head. But he wanted to do the job, and that’s hard to say for most people. Meanwhile, the transcript out today talking about “rightsizing utilization” implies that the Board didn’t like his grand plans (overly optimistic plans) for IFS and saw the product imploding. At the same time, the CEO focused on the loss-making part of the business. </span></p><p>But that’s the thing—the profitable part of the business is commoditized and will only worsen. I would argue that it’s a former monopoly that has become commoditized and will soon become worse. It makes sense to focus on the future, and IFS could have been one of two (TSMC) instead of a product group, which is one of many. The moonshot has always been IFS; now it’s time for plan B. And I frankly find Plan B to be uninspiring. </p><p><span>Things are changing fast. They just appointed two new board members, the </span><a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1721/intel-appoints-semiconductor-leaders-eric-meurice-and-steve" rel="">former CEO of ASML and the current interim CEO of Microchip</a><span>, to the board. This is an excellent step in the right direction, but it’s like hiring a surgeon and an oncologist after the cancer has moved to stage 4. It might be too late, but it sure is the right direction. </span></p><p>I think where Intel goes from here will be interesting. Read more below the paywall. </p></div></div>]]></description>

His fingers reluctantly penned a letter to sell his cherished lands to settle longstanding debts.</p><p>"A man can not have his cake and eat his cake", he wrote, the words etched with the pain of having to confront a reality that he did not want to accept.</p><p>This was the earliest written record of the proverb "you can't have your cake and eat it too". It's used in situations when we are forced to make tradeoffs that we'd rather not make.</p><p>When it comes to logging, that tradeoff is one of volume vs cost. You want the volume necessary to observe all your systems and you want to not spend most of your infra budget on logs. But you often can't have both.</p><p>The common choice companies make when logging costs are high is to log less. It lowers the cost and also reduces the volume.</p><p><span>This could be deciding that you only need </span><code>ERROR</code><span> logs in production. Or deciding that certain services can do without logs at all. Or only keeping logs on the host and hoping it doesn't crash.</span></p><p>While this can reduce costs, it's often a temporary bandage, one with very real downsides.</p><p>The reason companies log in the first place is because logs are insurance. In the happy case, no one thinks about it (besides the CFO griping about the bill). In the other case, the one where things are on fire, logs are essential for engineers to properly diagnose and recover from an incident.</p><p><span>Incidents result in downtime and downtime impacts the business's bottom line.

<p>Hell yeah, full RSS feeds are back. That said though, one thing is a big no-no:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can now pay to get fewer ads</p>

<p>The correct amount of ads for a publication that’s directly supported is zero. That’s the amount we should get. I don’t care about the rationale behind it. I’m giving you money, you decided how much money I should be giving you for your product, you don’t get to double dip and also sell my data to your advertisers and earn more on the side.

                        <p>As an alternative to concrete and other conventional composites, wood has re-emerged as a popular building material. Long thought of as too fragile and prone to damage, this natural resource has been re-engineered into a suite of fortified structural elements known as mass timber: glued, nailed doweled panels and beams able to shore-up everything from large residences to full-scale skyscrapers. The especially articulated roof of the recently expanded main terminal at <a href="https://www.flypdx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>Portland Airport (PDX)</strong></a> might be its most impressive application yet.</p>

<p>Nationwide architecture firm <a href="https://www.zgf.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener external noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external"><strong>ZGF</strong></a> implemented glulam (glue laminated) Douglas Fir for this massive nine-acre canopy, not only as an innovative and sustainable solution but also as a nod to local ecology and deeply-rooted cultural traditions. It’s a far cry from the standard glass and steel found at any other airport around the globe. The surrounding region is known for its dense old growth forests and thriving lumber trade. Most of the 3.5 million planks implemented in the project were sourced from smaller family operated and sustainably minded purveyors, as well as indigenous nations, based within a 300-mile radius; accounting for a notable reduction in the new building’s embodied carbon footprint.</p>

<p>“With the new PDX, we wanted travelers to know they were in the Pacific Northwest before they even left the airport. And for locals, we wanted it to feel like home,” says Vince Granato, Chief Projects Officer at the Port of Portland. “Creating that sense of place started with ZGF’s spectacular design, which was brought to life by thousands of local craftspeople.”</p>

<p>When it came to finding a way to expand this major hub “in place” rather than build entirely anew and cause significant distributions – the scourge of many other recent airport renovations – the Port of Portland authority called on ZGF to devise a phased construction strategy. Their solution was to create the expansive roof as a way of defining a significantly increased floor area without taking away from vital and well-utilized gates. This new single volume colossus also vastly ameliorates passenger experience; both in terms of practicality and atmosphere.</p>

<p>The curvilinear installation is defined by a “forest” of open lattice structure slats that give way to concave recesses, which allows an ample amount of natural light to filter through. Inside, passengers engage with a series of streetscape and parkland-like plazas and fully-enclosed concessions before reaching their gates in one of four concourses. <a href="https://design-milk.com/tag/biophilic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-wpel-link="internal">Biophilic</a> design cues – the bringing of nature indoors as a means of fostering a better sense of well-being – can be found throughout. Everything from the flooring to the finishing in the individual hospitality spaces was also sourced locally. The canopy anchors large glass walls that frame unobstructed tarmac views and even the forests in the distance.</p>

<p>“Everybody loves Portland International Airport,” concludes Gene Sandoval, ZGF Partner. “We had a tall order to evolve a terminal that’s essentially multiple buildings pieced together since the 1950s – and double the capacity while designing an experience passengers and employees will love as much as the original.”</p>

<p>The largest mass timber building of its kind, Portland Airport’s new main terminal raises the bar in site-responsive and sustainable airport design but also non-disruptive expansion. For the redevelopment of Chicago O’Hare Airport, noted architecture firm Studio Gang is taking a similar approach. The next phase of the PDX mass timber transportation is set for completion in 2026.</p>

                        <p>The reason for this great joy? For that, we have to go back to the start of the research. The journey began, not entirely characteristic of our university, with a painting.</p>
<h3><strong>Seeing the layers of a painting</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/2024/me/media/joris-dik-in-het-geheim-van-de-meester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Art historian and materials scientist Joris Dik</a> is affiliated with the Delft University of Technology and is well known for discovering overpainted preliminary studies by Van Gogh, Rembrandt, and Magritte.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With his work, world-famous paintings have been recovered, and he became known for the X-ray analysis of Van Gogh's painting 'Grassland', under which a possible study of the 'Potato Eaters' has been recovered.</p>
<p>With his desire to be able to look into paintings with X-rays, he came into contact with Yom Luiten through the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW).&nbsp;X-rays make it possible to look beneath the surface of paintings or other art-historical or archaeological objects.</p>
<p>This new X-ray source promises that you can study the chemistry and structure of paint layers at a much higher resolution. This offers, for example, the opportunity to make individual, hidden layers of paint in a painting visible.</p>
<p>Because it is a compact X-ray source, it can, in principle, also be used in a museum. This provides an enormous opportunity for research into museum heritage.</p>

                        <h3><strong>A pocket-sized synchrotron</strong><strong>?</strong></h3>
<p>To look into the layers of paintings, you need a different X-ray source. That's what Dik was looking for! However, equipment that can generate such precisely destemmed X-rays is not yet available anywhere in a hospital or museum.</p>
<p>In fact, at the moment, this is only possible with a synchrotron. And as the name suggests, those large round synchrotrons (such as the ESRF in Grenoble) have enormous dimensions. Moreover, they are expensive to build and, therefore, always fully booked for research. It is not suitable for scanning a new purchase in a museum and certainly not the entire collection.</p>
<p>While talking to Dik, Luiten came up with a number of good ideas for building a smaller device that can also generate tunable, close-band hard X-rays at a reasonably high intensity. And then with a setup the size of an optical lab table instead of a vast building.</p>
<p>A device of such dimensions will fit in an average-sized lab space and, in principle, even in a shipping container. So a building doesn't have to be rebuilt to get it in. The device can even hang from the ceiling to monitor production processes with that size.</p>
<p>This linear X-ray source is practically pocket-sized in the world of large synchrotrons. Luiten: “And we even have ideas on making the instrument even more compact.”</p>
                    </div>

<div id="c396506" tabindex="-1">
                        
                                
                                    
                                            
    <div>
                
                    <p>Currently, two X-ray sources are widely used: relatively weak sources (so-called X-ray tubes, used in hospitals and dentists) and potent sources (synchrotrons). Now, a mid-range car has been added with the new compact linear source from Jom Luiten and his team. The classic X-ray tube is based on 19th-century technology, over a hundred years old.</p>
<p>X-rays are generated by 'shaking' fast electrons back and forth hard. There are several tricks for this: in an X-ray tube, the electrons are abruptly slowed down in a material, while in the synchrotron, the electrons bend extremely hard in a strong magnetic field.</p>
<p>At the source at TU/e, the speeding electrons vibrate in the field with an intense laser pulse. “The physical principle with which the electrons shake back and forth is the same as with a large synchrotron, whether at a kilometer or micrometer scale,” Luiten explains.</p>
<p>Working with a compact linear source, the team accepts a lower intensity than generated by a circular synchrotron. For example, the particles in this linear source race at 99.995 percent of the speed of light, and in the large versions (such as ESRF), they race at 99.9999995 percent of the speed of light. And it is precisely the very compact particle accelerator that makes this X-ray source so unique.</p>
<p>Luiten: “This mid-range capability also makes this source suitable for looking into paintings, silicon wafers, or biological material without damaging it. In addition, this source is special because the energy of the X-rays can be very accurately adjusted to the material you want to detect. You can <em>'</em>tune<em>'</em> it to visualize any periodic table element. In addition, the light beam is reasonably coherent. Because of this, the measurements you can make with it are of great accuracy.”</p>
<p>In addition to the research of the Smart*Light 2.0 consortium, work is being done on a compact 'mid-range' X-ray source in about five other places around the world. But none of them has a particle accelerator as compact as this one, whose energy can be varied quickly and easily.</p>

                        <p>“Thanks to funding from Interreg Flanders-Netherlands and government contributions, it was a great moment when we started our research project in 2018 to build a compact machine to make these hard X-rays.”</p>
<p>“At first, I thought we could do that in three years. Unfortunately, we ran late and dealt with delays due to the COVID pandemic. The furnishing of the lab in the building in which we are now located, Qubit, was also considerably delayed. That affected our schedules.”</p>
<h3><strong>A working prototype</strong></h3>
<p>It is the first working prototype in their lab in the basement of Qubit. Or, as Luiten poetically calls it, their 'compact particle accelerator'. It is one and a half by three meters in size, and to be safe, lead bulkheads and concrete walls have been placed to allow the researchers to do their work safely.</p>
<p>This is a standard measure in particle accelerator labs against undesirable harmful forms of radiation. Thanks to an intelligent design, such extensive radiation shielding will no longer be necessary in the final implementation.</p>
<p>In their lab, the researchers built the compact prototype synchrotron, which has now succeeded in generating hard X-rays for the first time. “After all those years of research, we knew we were close,” Luiten explains. “So it was getting more and more exciting. Nevertheless, Peter (Mutsaers, ed.) went on holiday, and I went home that Friday after some office work.”</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>We really enjoyed that evening in the lab. We had a working hard X-ray source. Now for real!</em></strong></p>

<p>And the best thing about the device is that it can generate different wavelengths very easily, as hoped. “We simply use a rotary knob to vary the wavelength and precisely match it to the material or object we want to study,” Luiten explains.</p>
<p>“That is probably what surprises us the most. This device does exactly what we predicted with our models and theory. For a physicist, that makes him a bit boring, to be frank. The puzzle is solved.”</p>

                        <h3><strong>Next steps</strong></h3>
<p>No matter how beautiful the working prototype is, it is not yet the device that Dik dreamed of, and for which other interested parties from the medical world and industry have now also come forward.</p>
<p>Hessel Castricum, <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/h.l.castricum/?cHash=1e04ad338581eabe2c7dd8fded132f1a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">research partner and research fellow in Material Science and Engineering at TU Delft</a>, says: “As far as the application is concerned, it is only now that things are starting. In the coming months, we will be working with the other partners in the consortium to target the radiation to the materials to be studied precisely, to capture it with advanced detection equipment, and then to analyze the data collected in this way. TU Delft and the universities of Antwerp and Ghent are good at this.”</p>
<p>Luiten: “After all, the radiation we generate isn’t only suitable for looking inside paintings. You can also check silicon wafers to see if all the layers and lines are in the right place. Or, as partner Erasmus MC wants, you can use it to research atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries, ed.) or examine lung tissue with early-stage COVID damage. Due to the high quality of the X-rays, compared to current X-ray scanners, you can get a sharper image of smaller parts in a cell or tissues.”</p>
<p>Castricum adds: “There is still much work to be done in the coming period. In addition to the fact that we – together with the research partners from their <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/me/over/afdelingen/materials-science-and-engineering/research/research-programmes/smartlight" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Interreg project Smart*Light 2.0</a> – can carry out measurements on materials, we need to get the most out of the source, for example, by further increasing the intensity and focusing the laser and electron beam even better.</p>
<p>“The next step is to make a real <em>proof of concept</em>. So that we can look inside a painting with this source. Our work is certainly not done yet,” Luiten concludes with visible pleasure.</p>
<p>On to the next exciting chapter.</p>

      <p><span>KINSHASHA, Congo - </span></p><p>
	Public health officials in Africa urged caution Thursday as Congo's health minister said the government was on alert over a mystery flu-like disease that in recent weeks killed dozens of people.</p>
<p>
	Jean Kaseya, the head of Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters that more details about the disease should be known in the next 48 hours as experts receive results from laboratory samples of infected people.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>
	"First diagnostics are leading us to think it is a respiratory disease," Kaseya said. "But we need to wait for the laboratory results." He added that there are many things that are still unknown about the disease -- including whether it is infectious and how it is transmitted.</p>
<p>
	Authorities in Congo have so far confirmed 71 deaths, including 27 people who died in hospitals and 44 in the community in the southern Kwango province, health minister Roger Kamba said.</p>
<p>
	"The Congolese government is on general alert regarding this disease," Kamba said, without providing more details.</p>
<p>
	Of the victims at the hospitals, 10 died due to lack of blood transfusion and 17 as a result of respiratory problems, he said.</p>
<p>
	The deaths were recorded between Nov. 10 and Nov. 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. There were around 380 cases, almost half of which were children under the age of five, according to the minister.</p>
<p>
	The Africa CDC recorded slightly different numbers, with 376 cases and 79 deaths. The discrepancy was caused by problems with surveillance and case definition, Kaseya said.</p>
<p>
	Authorities have said that symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia. Epidemiological experts are in the region to take samples and investigate the disease, the minister said.</p>
<ul>
	<li>

</ul>
<p>
	The Panzi health zone, located around 435 miles (700 kilometres) from the capital Kinshasa, is a remote area of the Kwango province, making it hard to access.</p>
<p>
	The epidemiological experts took two days to arrive there, the minister said. Because of the lack of testing capacity, samples had to be taken to Kikwit, more than 500 km away, said Dieudonne Mwamba, the head of the National Institute for Public Health.</p>
<p>
	"The health system is quite weak in our rural areas, but for certain types of care, the ministry has all the provisions, and we are waiting for the first results of the sample analysis to properly calibrate things," Kaseya said.</p>
<p>
	Mwamba said that Panzi was already a "fragile" zone, with 40 per cent of its residents experiencing malnutrition. It was also hit by an epidemic of typhoid fever two years ago, and there is currently a resurgence of seasonal flu across the country.</p>
<p>
	"We need to take into account all this as context," Mwamba said.</p>
<p>
	A Panzi resident, Claude Niongo, said his wife and seven-year-old daughter died from the disease.</p>
<p>
	"We do not know the cause but I only noticed high fevers, vomiting... and then death," Niongo told The Associated Press over the phone. "Now, the authorities are talking to us about an epidemic but in the meantime, there is a problem of care (and) people are dying," he added.</p>

</ul>
<p>
	Lucien Lufutu, president of the civil society consultation framework of Kwango province, who is in Panzi, said the local hospital where patients are treated is underequipped.</p>
<p>
	"There is a lack of medicines and medical supplies, since the disease is not yet known, most of the population is treated by traditional practitioners," Lufutu told the AP.</p>
<p>
	He also said the disease affected Katenda, another nearby health zone.</p>
<p>
	When asked about a potential outbreak in other health zones, the minister said he could not tell if that was the case but that nothing was reported.</p>
<p>
	Congo is already plagued by the mpox epidemic, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and over 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease in the Central African country, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
