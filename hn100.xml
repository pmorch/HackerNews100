US-based Microsoft employees in San Francisco and New York are paid more because they live in higher cost-of-living areas and some fields, like roles within engineering, also fetch higher pay.</p><p>The highest pay package in the guidelines viewed by Insider was $361,500 in salary, $1.2 million as a hiring bonus, and about $1 million in annual stock awards. The lowest was a $42,500 salary, with no hiring bonus and no guaranteed stock award.</p><p>Microsoft uses a system of levels to denote seniority. Higher levels come with higher offers, according to the guidelines. Levels also vary by field and location, but generally, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-microsoft-pays-entry-senior-level-engineers-2021-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">"senior" starts at level 63, "principal" starts at level 65</a>, and "partner" starts at level 68, according to insiders.</p><p>Not all types of roles go up to level 70, but in engineering, an employee at this level would be considered a "distinguished engineer.'" There's also a level 80 for a "technical fellow," which is typically one of the highest-ranking executives at the company.</p><p>In 2022, when the economy was still booming, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-pay-raises-merit-increases-stock-grants-2022-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">Microsoft granted an across-the board compensation raise</a> for levels 67 and lower through larger stock grants, in response <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-considering-significant-pay-raises-employee-survey-2022-5?utmSource=twitter&amp;utmContent=referral&amp;utmTerm=topbar&amp;referrer=twitter" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel="">to growing internal dissatisfaction</a> with compensation compared to competitors, and to stop employees from leaving for better pay, especially to Amazon.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The University of Turku in Finland is developing an artificial language corpus proficient in all European languages, including Estonian, to preserve minor languages in the post-ChatGPT era. The Estonian Language Institute (EKI) supports the initiative but warns that an operational language model requires digitizing substantially more Estonian texts than is currently available.</p><div><p>"The English ChatGPT stunned the world with its ability to comprehend and respond to a person&nbsp;in a manner resembling natural speech. It wasn't a miracle technology; it was given an unprecedented amount of text to identify patterns in and learn to mimic human communication," Eleri Aedmaa, a natural language processing engineer at the Institute of the Estonian Language, said.</p><p>"In the new era of language technologies, the quantity of texts matters. To reach this critical mass with Estonian as many texts as possible must be digitized and made available: the entirety of the National Library, all of its archives, as much current and historical news as possible, including online communication. The more Estonian is readily accessible on the Internet, the more secure the language's future will be," the linguist said.</p><p>University of Turku and language technology company SiloGen <a href="https://www.silo.ai/blog/silo-ai-launches-a-consortium-to-build-the-worlds-largest-open-llm">are spearheading</a> the creation of the largest open language model in the world, covering all official European languages, on one of the pan-European supercomputers, LUMI, is located in Kajaani, Finland. It is the third largest supercomputer in the world and the largest in Europe. The quantity of distinct and original digital Estonian texts that can be made available for this and future language learning models, according to Aedmaa, is a fundamental issue for training the model in Estonian.</p><p><strong>ChatGPT only thinks in English</strong></p><p>Aedmaa said that one of the shortcomings of the increasingly prevalent large language models is that they are trained almost exclusively in English. This implies that although GPT-4 appears to comprehend Estonian, it is still limited to translation. The machine, so to say, thinks in English and translates the conversation at the last moment into Estonian. "This is really dangerous for the Estonian language in the long run," Aedmaa said.</p><p>"The value of these new tools lies in the fact that they comprehend not only individual words and sentences, but also the cultural context as a whole. If a language model is trained solely on the basis of English content, it will inevitably lack cultural knowledge of Estonia," she said.</p><p>"The situation is comparable to when the printing press was invented - what would have become of the Estonian language if books had been printed only in the major languages, but not in Estonian?" She asked. According to Aedmaa, the problem now affects nearly all of the world's languages.</p><p>The language model being developed by the Finns is a GPT-like digital&nbsp;machine that has been trained on a wide range of languages from the ground up. "The objectives are European linguistic sovereignty and the democratization of language technology. Unlike the majority of its predecessors, the new language model will be open source; its logic is transparent and can be utilized by anyone developing new language technology applications," Aedmaa said.</p><p>The Finns' project is supported by Business Finland, a body similar to the Estonian Business and Innovation Agency (EISA). It has also been supported by the EU Horizon program. LUMI provided a number of free training hours to the developers so that they could test the model.</p><p><strong>There are too few sources in Estonian to train a large language model</strong></p><p>Kadri Vare, head of the EKI's language and speech technology department, said the agency&nbsp;is presently exploring additional ways to help Finns. "We intend to work with them and have taken preliminary steps in that regard. Then we will be able to specify more precisely what and how much we can contribute to this endeavor. We have already contributed by making all of our legally permissible language data available to them," Vare told ERR.</p><p>In particular, Vare said, even more data could be digitized and made public to contribute to the success of the initiative. "The large language models use the entirety of the internet and every written word. Right now, we do not know exactly what they have taken and from where; we do not know if they have access to potentially more sensitive data. It would be important to us to find out," she said.</p><p>There is a shortage of available Estonian content for the large language model at present, however. "There are approximately three billion words of Estonian public data in the main language corpora, according to our knowledge. In contrast, English contains over 800 billion words. Three billion may seem like a lot, but in reality it is still insufficient. Training an artificial intelligence to comprehend Estonian language and culture is insufficient. It is simply too little," Vare said.</p><p>At the moment, the EKI is in the process of compiling a large Estonian language corpus. "These datasets are public, and we are pleased to share them. Participating in large open language models and collecting data for them is, in my opinion, one of the most important goals for Estonian language preservation," she concluded.</p><p>--</p><p><em>Follow ERR News on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ERRNews/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/errnews">Twitter</a> and never miss an update!</em></p>									</div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                            <p><span>Officials in a small Iowa town twice arrested a young man for criticizing the police department and saying it violates people's civil rights. Now the town is facing a lawsuit for violating <em>his</em> civil rights.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://ij.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ECF-No.-1-Complaint-and-Jury-Demand-FILE-STAMPED-10.12.23.pdf"><span>federal lawsuit</span></a><span> filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court of the Southern District of Iowa, Noah Petersen says the town of Newton violated the First, Fourth, and 14th Amendments when the police chief arrested him for speaking during the public comment period of a City Council meeting. Petersen is represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian-leaning public interest law firm.</span></p> <p>"The mayor and police chief had Noah arrested, jailed, strip-searched, and criminally prosecuted simply because they didn't like what Noah had to say," the lawsuit states. "This suit is filed to vindicate the fundamental right to criticize the government without fear of retaliation and to ensure the constitutional accountability of all government officials."</p> <p><span>Petersen was prompted to speak at an October 3, 2022, Newton City Council meeting after the release of </span><a href="https://www.kcci.com/article/watch-newton-man-says-police-wrongfully-arrested-him-at-traffic-stop/41069939"><span>body cam footage</span></a><span> showing Newton officers arresting a college football player, Tayvin Galanakis. Galanakis was arrested for driving under the influence, despite blowing a 0.00 on a Breathalyzer and passing roadside sobriety tests. He was taken to the police station for further drug tests, all of which came back negative, before eventually being released.</span></p> <p>Petersen approached the microphone and said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>Hello. This is my public comment for [the] City Council meeting, now October 3rd, 2022. Defund Newton Police Department. They are a violent, civil and human rights–violating organization who do not make your community safer. They are also pro–domestic abuse because they are currently employing a domestic abuser and choosing to not release the records about that domestic abuser.&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>At that point, the Newton mayor ordered Petersen to stop speaking, although his allotted three minutes of time had not expired. When Petersen refused, the mayor ordered the police chief to remove Petersen for violating a council rule forbidding "derogatory statements or comments about any individual."</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was handcuffed, arrested, and jailed until his parents could post bond for him<strong>.</strong> He returned to the next City Council meeting to speak during the public comment period and was once again arrested after calling the police chief and mayor fascists.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen was charged both times with disorderly conduct for disrupting a lawful assembly. However, as </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/02/06/an-iowa-town-charged-a-man-with-disorderly-conduct-because-he-called-a-cop-a-domestic-abuser/"><span>reported</span></a><span> in February, those charges did not stick:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Last Wednesday, Petersen was found not guilty of his disorderly conduct charge. Adding to his victory, the judge overturned the rule barring "derogatory" statements about individuals during city council meetings. "As applied in this particular instance, the Newton City Council rule is violative of the First Amendment," the verdict states.</span></p> <p><span>Petersen "did not act in any objectively unreasonable manner," the judge added. "He read a prepared statement relating to the basic city service of policing. While some may not agree with the content of his comments, the Court finds the statements made were not 'derogatory,' nor about an 'individual.' In the event the statements could be found 'derogatory' or a comment about an 'individual'…the Court finds these terms vague and overbroad."</span></p></blockquote> <p>Petersen says the entire mess shows why he stepped up to the podium in the first place.</p> <p><span>"Ironically, the actions of the police department have only proven my point," Petersen said in an Institute for Justice <a href="https://ij.org/press-release/lawsuit-seeks-accountability-for-unconstitutional-silencing-and-arrest-during-city-council-meeting/">press release</a>. "My initial criticism was about the way they treat citizens in our community. They arrested me for exercising my right to free speech—for standing up for what I believe is right. Their reaction to my criticism was a clear demonstration of the very issue I was trying to highlight. Their actions underscore the urgent need for the very reforms I was advocating for."</span></p> <p><span>Newton officials simply do not appear to take criticism well. As </span><i><span>Reason</span></i><span>'s Emma Camp </span><a href="https://reason.com/2023/10/06/an-iowa-man-published-body-camera-footage-from-his-arrest-the-cops-are-suing-him-for-defamation/"><span>reported</span></a><span> earlier this month, the two Newton police officers who arrested Galanakis have since filed a defamation suit against him for publishing the body cam footage of his own arrest, as well as claims he made about the officers on social media. A judge tossed out most of those defamation claims.</span></p> <p><span>The right to criticize police, even through vulgarities and rude gestures, is firmly enshrined in the First Amendment. As Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan Jr. </span><a href="https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/482/451.html"><span>wrote</span></a><span> in 1987, in a ruling striking down a Houston ordinance that made it unlawful to oppose or interrupt a police officer, "The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state."</span></p> <p><span>Peterson's lawsuit is seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a judgment declaring Newton's "derogatory comments" rule unconstitutional.</span></p> <p><span>"By ordering their opponents arrested, Newton's officials behaved like petty dictators in a banana republic, rather than democratically-elected leaders in a constitutional republic," Institute for Justice attorney Brian Morris said. "Anyone with a high school diploma should know that having your political opponents arrested is a textbook example of violating someone's First Amendment rights and we're confident that the courts will agree."</span></p> <p><span>Attorneys for the town of Newton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</span></p>                        </div></div>]]></description>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’m excited to share a 3 state, 3 symbol Turing Machine that cannot be proven to halt or not (when starting on a blank tape) without solving a Collatz-like problem. Therefore, solving the \(BB(3, 3)\) problem is at least as hard as solving this Collatz-like problem, a class of problem for which Paul Erdős famously said: “Mathematics may not be ready for such problems.”</p>

<p>Last year, in <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/04/03/mother-of-giants.html">Mother of Giants</a>, I described a family of TMs which require efficient simulation or complete solution of a Collatz-like problem in order to prove if they “quasihalt” or not. These were found in the search for <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2021/03/06/beeping-busy-beaver/">“Beeping” Busy Beavers</a>, a variant of the Busy Beavers introduced by Scott Aaronson in his 2020 <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=4916">Busy Beaver survey article</a>. Since then I have been looking for an example in the normal Busy Beaver game.</p>

<p>There have been many wonderful TMs produced by hand over the years which provide such results for the Busy Beaver game. For example, proving:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(BB(745)\) <a href="https://www.ingo-blechschmidt.eu/assets/bachelor-thesis-undecidability-bb748.pdf">requires</a> proving the consistency of ZFC</li>
  <li>\(BB(27)\) <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a64213f391339236c2fe31f8749a0df6">requires</a> proving the Goldbach Conjecture</li>
  <li>\(BB(15)\) and \(BB(5, 4)\) <a href="https://dna.hamilton.ie/2021-08-10-busy-beaver-15.html">require</a> proving an Erdős conjecture (that for all \(n &gt; 8\), the base 3 representation of \(2^n\) has at least one digit 2).</li>
</ul>

<p>However, none of these Busy Beaver values are really within reach of us mere mortals yet. In the last 60 years, we have only been able to prove values \(BB(2), BB(3), BB(4)\) and \(BB(2, 3)\) and it is known that <a href="https://www.sligocki.com/2022/06/21/bb-6-2-t15.html">\(BB(6) &gt; 10 \uparrow\uparrow 15\)</a>. Until I analyzed this TM, I thought that we might have a chance to prove \(BB(3, 3)\)!</p>

<h2 id="the-machine">The Machine</h2>

<p>I’ll call this TM “Bigfoot” (I’ll explain the name at the end of the article). It is defined by the transition table:</p>

This specific TM was first <a href="https://discord.com/channels/960643023006490684/1084047886494470185/1163168233445130270">shared and analyzed</a> by @savask on 14 Oct 2023 on that same Discord channel.</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>Consider the general configuration:</p><p>

\[A(a, b, c) = 0^\infty \; 12^a \; 11^b \; \text{ &lt;A } \; 11^c \; 0^\infty\]

</p><p>We can prove the following rules:</p><p>

\[\begin{array}{l}
  A(a, &amp; 6k,   &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+1, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c-1, &amp; 3)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; 8k+c \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+2, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a-1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   &amp; \text{if} &amp; a \ge 1 \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+3, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+1, &amp; 5)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+4, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a+1, &amp; 8k+c+3, &amp; 2)   \\
  A(a, &amp; 6k+5, &amp; c) &amp; \to &amp; A(a,   &amp; 8k+c+5, &amp; 3)   \\
\end{array}\]

\[A(0, 6k+2, c) \to \text{Halt}(16k+2c+7)\]

</p><p>In fact, these rules are exhaustive. Once Bigfoot enters such a \(A(a, b, c)\) config (with \(c \ge 1\)), these rules describe the exact behavior it will follow forever (or until it halts).</p>

<p>Looking at the rules above we can see that they are iterating a Collatz-like function on parameters \(b\) and \(c\) while \(a\) keeps a sort of running total. Every time \(b \equiv 1 \pmod{6}\) or \(b \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is incremented and every time \(b \equiv 2 \pmod{6}\), \(a\) is decremented. Bigfoot only ever halts if \(a\) would be decremented below 0.</p>

<h3 id="trajectory-from-blank-tape">Trajectory from Blank Tape</h3>

<p>Starting from a blank tape, Bigfoot reaches config \(A(2, 1, 2)\) at step 69. Simulating this forward, \(a\) appears to grow steadily over time. After 24 million iterations, we have \(a = 3\,999\,888\).</p>

<h3 id="pseudo-random-walk">Pseudo-Random Walk</h3>

<p>Let’s consider the sequence of remainders of \(b\) mod 6. If we imagine that this sequence is uniformly randomly distributed, then this process is simulating a biased random walk on the number line where (for each step) the chance of stepping right is \(\frac{2}{3}\) and the chance of stepping left is \(\frac{1}{3}\).</p>

<p>This is a famous problem in the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chains</a> and it can be proven that if you are at position \(a = n\), there is a \((\frac{1}{2})^{n+1}\) chance you will ever reach the position \(a = -1\) in the future.</p>

<p>Of course, the sequence of remainders of \(b\) are not random, they are completely deterministic. (In fact, they even follow the consistent pattern of odd, odd, even, even, …) However, on a broad scale they do appear to follow a trajectory roughly like the random Markov chain. We can see that in the trajectory listed above where after 24 million steps, the Markov chain would be expected to move to the right 8 million times and to the left 4 million leading to a value very close to the actual \(a\) around 4 million.</p>

<h3 id="probviously-not-halting">Probviously Not Halting</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, the random Markov chain would have about a \((\frac{1}{2})^{4\,000\,000}\) chance of ever reaching \(a = -1\) at this point which is a number so small that any scientist would happily declare this guaranteed to fail. Likewise, this is where I will say that Bigfoot “probviously” never halts (using the <a href="https://doi.org/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.192">words of John Conway</a>). Meaning that if it operates anything close to the Markov Chain it will never halt.</p>

<p>Of course, this sort of statement says nothing in a rigorous Mathematical sense. Instead it is sort of an experimental heuristic which I am using to guide my intuition in this case. There is always the chance that after a googolplex iterations Bigfoot will halt. In fact, Conway coined this term to describe the heuristic argument for why the Collatz conjecture should be “probviously” true and yet a proof of Collatz is nowhere in sight.</p>

<h2 id="two-worlds">Two Worlds</h2>

<p>We live in one of two worlds, either Bigfoot halts or it runs forever. If it halts, then that could be proven by accelerating iterations of this Collatz-like function enough that it is tractable to simulate it to completion. If it runs forever, then proving that requires proving that this Collatz-like function will never reach the \(a = 0\) halting transition.</p>

<p>Based on the Markov chain argument above, I believe we are living in this second world and it seems to me that this is the much harder case to prove.</p>

<h2 id="cryptids">Cryptids</h2>

<p>What do we call these sorts of machines? Ones whose behavior has been distilled into a relatively simple Mathematical rule that falls into a class of open Mathematical problems. These machines seem to be a sort of legendary creature, rumors have it that they either halt or do not, but nobody has been able to provide any concrete evidence to support either conclusion. I propose calling them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptids">“Cryptids”</a>, drawing parallels to the legendary creatures like the Loch Ness Monster or Chupacabra. And well, since this TM appears to randomly walk about, I thought Bigfoot would be an apt name.</p>

<h2 id="is-this-collatz-like-behavior-really-hard">Is This Collatz-like Behavior Really Hard?</h2>

<p>I imagine that some of you might be wondering: Is the behavior of this specific Collatz-like function really hard to analyze? Am I overselling this behavior simply by it’s association with the famously difficult Collatz problem? I think it is safe to say that nobody aside from me has ever looked at the dynamics of this specific problem. So perhaps with a little bit of number theory and elbow grease, someone will be able to find a clever Mathematical property that applies to this problem (but not to the broader set of Collatz-like problems). This is certainly possible and I am excited to hear if anyone has any ideas as to how to attack this problem. It would be lovely to know that proving \(BB(3, 3)\) remains within reach!</p>

<p>However, in my (limited) experience analyzing and reading about Collatz-like problems there seem to be only two types of questions that one can ask: (1) Ones that are relatively trivial to prove and (2) Ones which no Mathematician knows how to prove. In the first category we have patterns like the fact that \(b\) repeats consistently through the pattern (odd, odd, even, even, …) in Bigfoot’s Collatz iterations or that every time you apply the traditional \(3n+1\) Collatz rule you always end up with an even number which will then be divided by 2 on the next step. Examples of the second category include basically all other questions we might ask about the behavior of these Collatz systems.</p>

            <p>Computational approaches are emerging as powerful tools for the discovery of antibiotics. A study now uses machine learning to discover abaucin, a potent antibiotic that targets the bacterial pathogen <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>.</p>
            

                
                    
                
            
                
                <p>Traditionally, antibiotics were discovered by the screening of soil microorganisms, seeking secondary metabolites. From these initial molecules, numerous derivatives were synthesized, showing improved bioactivities and greater potential to meet clinical standards. Until recently, discovery efforts relied on the painstaking screening of large compound libraries for antibiotic activity<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Wright, G. D. Nat. Prod. Rep. 34, 694–701 (2017)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-023-01448-6#ref-CR1" id="ref-link-section-d8857608e293">1</a></sup>. Phenotypic screening approaches do not require advanced knowledge of the mechanism of action; however, the extensive and unexplored chemical space in the search for drug-like molecules poses considerable challenges, as the screening of numerous potential combinations (of both compounds and different bacterial strains) is both expensive and time-consuming. Thus, the discovery process of a new antibiotic has consistently depended on chance and serendipity. Recent advances that incorporate cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and other computational approaches have demonstrated remarkable success in accelerating the identification of new drugs with desired properties<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" title="Porto, W.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>As a reminder: <strong>Ruff is an extremely fast Python linter, written in Rust.</strong> Ruff can be used to replace Flake8 (plus dozens of plugins), isort, pydocstyle, pyupgrade, and more, all while executing tens or hundreds of times faster than any individual tool.</p>
<p>Ruff is used in production by tens of thousands of
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#whos-using-ruff">open source projects</a> and major enterprises.
In the last year, we've been working to expand Ruff's feature set and improve stability for those
that depend on Ruff in their daily workflows.</p>
<p>Today, we're excited to announce that <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff">Ruff v0.1.0</a> is out! This
release is focused on stabilization, and includes a new <a href="#introducing-preview-mode">preview mode</a>,
the introduction of <a href="#respecting-fix-safety">fix safety levels</a>, and a formal <a href="#ruffs-versioning-policy">versioning policy</a>.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Charlie looked back on
<a href="https://notes.crmarsh.com/ruff-the-first-200-releases">the first 200 releases of Ruff</a>, at which
point 376 lint rules were supported. <strong>Ruff now supports over 700 rules</strong>, with new rules being
added in every release. In case you missed it, we've released some exciting features this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.285#stabilized-support-for-jupyter-notebooks">Jupyter notebook support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.292#support-for-pep-701">Python 3.12 f-string syntax support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.283#ruff-supports-pep-695">Python 3.12 type alias and generics syntax support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://astral.sh/blog/ruff-v0.0.281#ruffs-lexer-is-2-3x-faster">2-3x performance improvements to our lexer</a></li>
<li>Improvements to the <a href="https://play.ruff.rs/">Ruff playground</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We also <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/7310">released an alpha version</a> of our
Black-compatible code formatter. Expect more news on that front soon!</p>
<h2><span id="introducing-preview-mode"></span>Introducing preview mode<!-- --> <a href="#introducing-preview-mode">#</a></h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/tag/v0.0.289">v0.0.289</a>, we added a new preview mode
to enable the use of unstable features when running Ruff.</p>
<p>Since new rules often benefit from a trial period, we want to be able to release them in a staged
manner. Previously, we used a "nursery" rule category to do this, a concept taken from Clippy,
Rust's linter.</p>
<p>However, the nursery required opt-in for each rule using their exact code, e.g., if you'd selected
<code>F</code> and we released an unstable rule <code>F999</code>, you'd need to update your selection to <code>[F, F999]</code>.
Requiring opt-in for each rule reduced exposure of new rules and could be tedious for users to
update. Furthermore, as Ruff grows, we want a global concept for use of unstable features — the
nursery concept doesn't scale beyond rule selection.</p>
<p>Preview mode will be used to enable new rules, unstable fixes, and experimental code analysis.
Releasing these features — but gating them to users who opt-in — will allow us to collect community
feedback and gain confidence that changes are a net-benefit.</p>
<p>Preview mode can be enabled per-invocation with the <code>--preview</code> flag or by updating your
configuration file:</p>

<h2><span id="respecting-fix-safety"></span>Respecting fix safety<!-- --> <a href="#respecting-fix-safety">#</a></h2>
<p>Ruff's ability to automatically fix violations is one of its most powerful features. However, given
Python's dynamic nature, it's not always possible to guarantee that a fix is "safe". Since May,
we've been labeling a subset of Ruff's fixes as unsafe. When applying safe fixes, the meaning and
intent of your code will be retained; when applying unsafe fixes, the meaning could change.</p>
<p>For example,
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element"><code>unnecessary-iterable-allocation-for-first-element</code></a>
is a rule which checks for potentially unperformant use of <code>list(...)[0]</code>. The fix replaces this
pattern with <code>next(iter(...))</code> which can result in a drastic speedup:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = list(range(99999999))[0]</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>1 </span><span>loop,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>1.69</span><span> </span><span>sec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-m</span><span> </span><span>timeit</span><span> </span><span>"</span><span>head = next(iter(range(99999999)))</span><span>"</span></span>
<span><span>5000000 </span><span>loops,</span><span> </span><span>best</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>70.8</span><span> </span><span>nsec</span><span> </span><span>per</span><span> </span><span>loop</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, when the collection is empty, this fix changes the raised exception from an <code>IndexError</code> to
<code>StopIteration</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>list(range(0))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>File </span><span>"</span><span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>modul</span><span>e</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>IndexError: </span><span>list</span><span> </span><span>index</span><span> </span><span>out</span><span> </span><span>of</span><span> </span><span>range</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span>$ </span><span>python</span><span> </span><span>-c</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>next(iter(range(0)))[0]</span><span>'</span></span>
<span><span>Traceback (most </span><span>recent</span><span> </span><span>call</span><span> </span><span>last</span><span>):</span></span>
<span><span>File </span><span>"</span><span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span>"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>line</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>in</span><span> </span><span>&lt;</span><span>modul</span><span>e</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span><span>StopIteration</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Since this could break error handling, this fix is categorized as unsafe.</p>
<p>Previously, the safety of a fix was only an internal note, but in v0.1.0, Ruff will only use safe
fixes by default to increase confidence when applying fixes and highlight fixes that need additional
review.</p>
<p>Unsafe fixes can be enabled by passing the <code>--unsafe-fixes</code> flag to <code>ruff check</code>:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="shell" data-theme="default"><span><span># Show unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span># Apply unsafe fixes</span></span>
<span><span>ruff </span><span>check</span><span> </span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>--fix</span><span> </span><span>--unsafe-fixes</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>or by setting
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#unsafe-fixes"><code>unsafe-fixes</code></a> in your configuration file:</p>
<div data-rehype-pretty-code-fragment=""><pre><code data-language="toml" data-theme="default"><span><span>[</span><span>tool</span><span>.</span><span>ruff</span><span>]</span></span>
<span><span>unsafe-fixes</span><span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>true</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>When working with Ruff in an IDE (via our LSP), we will no longer apply unsafe fixes with the "Fix
all" action. Instead, unsafe fixes can be applied individually with the "Quick fix" action allowing
review of each fix. If you opt-in to unsafe fixes, they'll be applied during "Fix all". See the
<a href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-lsp#fix-safety">LSP docs</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The safety of fixes can be adjusted per rule using the
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-safe-fixes"><code>extend-safe-fixes</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings#extend-unsafe-fixes"><code>extend-unsafe-fixes</code></a> settings, allowing
you to customize safety levels for your use-case.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/#fix-safety">docs</a> for more details on fix
safety.</p>
<h2><span id="ruffs-versioning-policy"></span>Ruff's versioning policy<!-- --> <a href="#ruffs-versioning-policy">#</a></h2>
<p>Thus far, Ruff releases have only involved incrementing the patch version number. This versioning
scheme suffers from a few core problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no documented policy and little room for a meaningful policy</li>
<li>Rules are added in most releases, resulting in significant new violations for users on upgrade</li>
<li>Users cannot get bug fix upgrades with confidence that they will not need to do other work</li>
<li>Ruff is not perceived as stable</li>
</ul>
<p>With the promotion to v0.1.0, Ruff can adopt a meaningful rules around versioning to ensure that
users know what to expect from each release. With the addition of a minor version number, we hope
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduce the frequency of large changes</li>
<li>Give rules a period for stabilization before enabling</li>
<li>Differentiate between breaking and non-breaking releases</li>
<li>Move towards stronger stability guarantees</li>
</ul>
<p>With the release of 0.1.0, Ruff includes a full versioning policy. Briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>minor</strong> version will be used for stabilization of <strong>preview</strong> features, changes to
<strong>stable</strong> behavior, and breaking changes.</li>
<li>The <strong>patch</strong> version will be used for bug fixes and <em>any</em> changes to rules or fixes in
<strong>preview.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/versioning/">docs</a> for a full description of the policy.</p>

Look south-east, towards Canada, and you see a skyline thick with cranes. New towers are shooting up, old ones being rebuilt, and the pavements below are thick with pedestrians. Cross to the other bedroom, however, and you get quite a different view. Right up to the edge of a highway entire city blocks are occupied by nothing but tarmac. At 11am an ocean of surface parking is uninterrupted by even a single car.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Just over a decade ago Detroit became the biggest American city to go bankrupt. Since then its city centre has made a remarkable recovery. The Book Tower, which was completely derelict in 2009, has been rebuilt at a cost of over $300m by Bedrock, a property firm owned by Dan Gilbert, Michigan’s richest man. Yet though downtown is humming, huge parts of the city remain blighted.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The city now has a more ambitious plan to reduce the amount of vacant land. It intends to tax it. A lot. Will it work?</p><p data-component="paragraph">The idea, proposed by Mike Duggan, the city’s pugnacious mayor, is to replace Detroit’s current property tax with a split tax. In essence, assessors will distinguish between the value of its land and of the buildings on it. This done, the city’s property tax will be reduced from 2% for every $1 of assessed value (which is less than market value) to 0.6%. To make up for the revenues lost, land will be taxed at a new rate of 11.8%, whether or not it has anything built on it. In Michigan changes to property-tax rates have to be approved by voters. A law to allow that cleared its first hurdle in the state House in late September. A referendum could happen in February.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The principle of taxing land instead of buildings has a long history. Over a century ago Henry George, a liberal economist, argued that the rich used land ownership to hoard the wealth being created by progress. His most dedicated fans adopted the slogan “Do you see the cat?” (based on a convoluted metaphor), to refer to his ideas that land ownership underpinned high inequality. Yet George’s proposal—a single tax on land value—has barely been tried. If Mr Duggan’s scheme becomes law, Detroit will be one of the first big cities anywhere in the world to implement one.</p><p data-component="paragraph">How come Detroit is able to try something so radical? One advantage, says Jay Rising, the city’s chief financial officer, is that the city now raises very little from its current system. In 1959, according to a study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, a think-tank in Massachusetts, the city’s property tax raised over $1bn, adjusted for inflation. By 2019, after decades of economic decline, the figure had fallen to just $119m. “If this was 80% of our revenues, we’d be a lot more nervous,” says Mr Rising. In fact it is just 16%. Moreover, the value of residential land is very low, which makes it an easier sell to voters.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The hope is that taxing land more will in fact spur development. Right now, says Alex Alsup of Regrid, a data firm, Detroit has “a very pure version of speculation”. As downtown booms, people who bought land nearby years ago—such as the owners of the car parks—merely have to wait for investment nearby to raise the value of their own land. Higher taxes might force them to sell up to people who will build on it. “It is entirely possible that this land tax has the ability to free up properties,” says Kofi Bonner, the <small>ceo</small> of Bedrock.</p><p data-component="paragraph">The bigger immediate benefit, though, comes from reducing taxes on most residents. The city argues that 97% of homeowners will get a tax cut. Lower tax rates on improvements ought to encourage people to invest in properties—and help some avoid falling behind on their taxes. Though they raise little, Detroit’s property taxes are punishing to poor homeowners. Between 2011 and 2015, according to a study published in 2019, one in four city properties went into tax foreclosure, their owners having fallen behind on payments.</p><p data-component="paragraph">But Bernadette Atuahene, one of the authors of that study, suggests that high rates were not the only problem. What mattered more was that after the great financial crisis, Detroit’s assessor systematically overvalued the homes of the poorest residents. When people could not pay, Wayne County, which includes the city, added interest at 18%. Homes ended up auctioned, with any excess over the tax owed banked by the county. Ms Atuahene worries that the proposed new tax does nothing to fix this problem—and if residential land ends up overvalued, may exacerbate it. “We currently have an assessment division that’s not doing its job,” she says.</p><p data-component="paragraph">Getting assessments right is one of the long-standing challenges of land-value taxes, and explains why they are so rare. Still, if the city can do that well, there will be real gains. Gabriel McNeil, a 61-year-old former chef who now lives on disability benefits, says that even a small tax cut would help him a lot. Having bought his home for just $8,000 in 2013, he struggles with tax payments of thousands of dollars each year. “The property tax is not designed for lower-income people at all,” he says. “It’s not easy to keep up.” For some, any cut is better than nothing. <span>■</span></p><p data-component="paragraph"><i>Stay on top of American politics with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.economist.com/newsletters/checks-and-balance" target="_blank">Checks and Balance</a>, our weekly subscriber-only newsletter, which&nbsp;examines the state of American democracy and the issues that matter to voters.</i></p></div><p>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline "By George!"</p><div data-tracking-id="content-well-chapter-list"><h2><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/">United States</a> <span>October 7th 2023</span></h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/04/the-sacking-of-kevin-mccarthy-will-make-supporting-ukraine-harder"><span>Kevin McCarthy’s sacking deepens the chaos in American government</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/travelling-to-and-from-america-has-become-a-waiting-game"><span>Travelling to and from America has become a waiting game</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/republican-parties-in-important-swing-states-are-falling-behind"><span>Republican parties in important swing states are falling behind</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/the-post-title-42-lull-in-border-crossings-is-over"><span>The post-Title-42 lull in border crossings is over</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/detroit-wants-to-be-the-first-big-american-city-to-tax-land-value"><span>Detroit wants to be the first big American city to tax land value</span></a></li><li><a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/10/05/what-america-should-really-learn-from-dianne-feinstein"><span>What America should really learn from Dianne Feinstein</span></a></li></ul></div><div orientation="vertical" data-test-id="vertical"><div orientation="vertical"><figure><img alt="Are free markets history?

</figure> <p>John says he pressed representatives of Tesla on whether he or Rob were at fault for the damage, to which he claims he was told that it was a weather issue.</p> <p>He continued: “They said that the battery is effectively submerged in water. How can that be our fault?</p> <p>“After finally getting to speak to a manager, he told me it had water in it due to the fact the weather in Scotland has been so bad. That was the issue. They said it’s not necessarily my fault but it’s not Tesla’s to pay under warranty. He reminded me there was a yellow weather warning in some parts of Scotland.</p> <p>“I pushed him on this and said I’ve never heard or something like this happening. He said it can happen with Range Rovers and Mercs but I’m just not buying it.</p> <p>“To date, it’s been a disaster of a service and the stress and worry of this is excruciating. I said to the manager, ‘so, my understanding is, Teslas are unfit for purpose in Scotland?.”</p> <p>I’ve been driving for 30 years and this is my most premium car to date and this is what it does when Edinburgh’s roads get puddles or a little wet!”</p> <p><i>Edinburgh Live</i> has seen correspondence between the couple and Tesla which confirms the £17,374 bill. </p> <p>Furthermore, an email from Tesla customer relations also commits to an investigation into the complaint and a response on behalf of the business.</p> <p>John added: “If I had known the customer service would be so bad I’m not sure I would have bothered buying the car. Do they know that we’re in Scotland? That weather was not abnormal for living here.</p> <p>"I can only see the number of claims on problems like this going up. The thing is, Elon Musk could buy everyone in the world a Tesla if he wanted to.”</p> <p>Tesla UK &amp; Europe have been approached for comment.</p><!-- Article End--></div><div id="bookmark-toast-article"><p><span><svg width="18" height="14" viewBox="0 0 18 14" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M6.00016 11.1698L1.83016 6.99984L0.410156 8.40984L6.00016 13.9998L18.0002 1.99984L16.5902 0.589844L6.00016 11.1698Z" fill="#D8021E"></path></svg></span><span>Story Saved</span></p><p><span>You can find this story in &nbsp;<a href="https://www.edinburghlive.co.uk/my-bookmarks">My Bookmarks.</a></span><span>Or by navigating to the user icon in the top right.</span></p></div></div>]]></description>

If 1-on-1s were your fulltime job you could at most do 80 per week (2 per hour x 40 hrs). Thats just rotating through 1x1s. That's not doing anything else.</p><p>He claimed "team leads" did 1x1s, which is fine, but its hard to call them a direct report if you're not even aware of their daily work. Theres just no way you can adequately manage 200 people. As mentioned above, you are just a glorified HR person, you're no longer in engineering.</p><p>I would never hire a manager below Director level that isn't themselves an individual contributor. I know its possible to have that but I wouldnt hire it, because we expect IC on our teams.

The typical Indian who works at an outsourcing farm makes so little, that they don't exactly care to work hard.</p><p>&gt; no chill for Indians (SWEs, PMs, etc).</p><p>I'll be honest. I occasionally run into people with very strong and vapid opinions about entire countries based on 1-2 anecdotal experiences. I haven't seen this issue with other fields. It is oddly CS specific. In no other field have I met people who are so obsessed with the productivity of their peers, when the entire organization works on making ads software 5% faster.

Is there a grain of truth to the “lazy Indian” trope?<p>Indian here. First generation, naturalized American, et cetera. I'll be honest and say that my initial response was, “Ugh! Your friend is a big old racist”.</p><p>Moving on from that reflexive thought, I'll attempt to answer your question of:</p><p>&gt; I’m asking is there a perceptual issue due to some factor that’s obvious to the typical Nth-generation American?</p><p>Well, perhaps. There are a bunch of factors:</p><p>- The H1B program is terrible in that it ties your immigration status to your current employer. Couple this with the “you can be legally fired because your boss doesn't like the color of your shoes” climate in the US and you have a pretty stressed-out bunch of people.
- A lot of consulting companies seem to pay just enough wages that attract Indian H1B employees of a average to low caliber of talent, and hire them out for random software projects. The Americans on the other side of those contractors get mad at the contractors, who happen to be all Indian.
- There is a genuine cultural gap where Indians are more deferential to someone they perceive as having higher authority. It is sometimes possible that a young Indian employee might call you “Sir”, because that was how they addressed superiors.</p><p>So...all these are perceptual issues of the sort you are looking at. But honestly, these sorts of cultural misunderstandings are not exactly uncommon among Europeans and Americans as well. Big Tech tends to have far fewer of the issues above. Salaries are high (I don't even work in Big Tech and my salary as an H1B was verifiably higher than some of my American coworkers), and IMO there isn't a huge difference between Indians and the N other cultures that make up the boiling pot of tech.</p><p>But then that brings me to the part about “friend who works big tech and he has no chill for <i>Indians</i>”. Like, Indians period? What does he think about Sanjay Ghemawat? What about Vinod Khosla? How about Amit Patel, who came up with Google's “Don't Be Evil”? What about the engineers/PMs/etc. in big tech to whom those issues don't apply?</p><p>All of this leads me to conclude (this time after some reflection) that your friend is actually just a...big old racist if he has a problem with <i>all</i> Indians in general, especially those working in Big Tech.</p><p>Take from that what you will. Hope you find better friends :)

First thing they do is rebrand middle management as “leaders” and the other thing they do is make management non technical.</p><p>This has even bled into making higher level IC engineering roles being “above” coding. “Staff engineers don’t code, they set high level architecture “.</p><p>This is toxic to an engineering org in many ways. Firstly you now have a bunch of highly paid technical employees completely removed from how things actually work. But what’s worse is you created a culture where you’re incentived to follow - a senior engineer who wants to get promoted should write less code because coding is associated with being a low level employee.</p><p>The fundamental root cause is a misunderstanding of code as low level factory work and not intrinsically tied to the design and architecture. But it’s one of many ways in which traditional business structures and software engineering do not mesh and you need an extremely strong engineering leader to keep software culture on track, which very few organizations have.

He was  also a good mentor, helping me reframe my viewpoint, when I didn't agree with one of my very senior colleagues (Later turned out the senior colleague was right.

<p>Cisco is urging customers to protect their devices following the discovery of a critical, actively exploited zero-day vulnerability that’s giving threat actors full administrative control of networks.</p>
<p>“Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to create an account on the affected device with privilege level 15 access, effectively granting them full control of the compromised device and allowing possible subsequent unauthorized activity,” members of Cisco’s Talos security team <a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/active-exploitation-of-cisco-ios-xe-software/">wrote Monday</a>. “This is a critical vulnerability, and we strongly recommend affected entities immediately implement the steps outlined in Cisco’s PSIRT advisory.”</p>
<h2>Under exploitation for 4 weeks</h2>
<p>The previously unknown vulnerability, which is tracked as CVE-2023-20198, carries the maximum severity rating of 10. It resides in the Web User Interface of Cisco IOS XE software when exposed to the Internet or untrusted networks. Any switch, router, or wireless LAN controller running IOS XE that has the HTTP or HTTPS Server feature enabled and exposed to the Internet is vulnerable. At the time this post went live, the Shodan search engine showed that as many as 80,000 Internet-connected devices could be affected.</p>
<p>Cisco said that an unknown threat actor has been exploiting the zero-day since at least September 18. After using the vulnerability to become an authorized user, the attacker creates a local user account. In most cases, the threat actor has gone on to deploy an implant that allows it to execute malicious commands at the system or iOS level, once the web server is restarted. The implant is unable to survive a reboot, but the local user accounts will remain active.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Monday’s advisory went on to say that after gaining access to a vulnerable device, the threat actor exploits a medium vulnerability, CVE-2021-1435, which Cisco patched two years ago. The Talos team members said that they have seen devices fully patched against the earlier vulnerability getting the implant installed “through an as of yet undetermined mechanism.”</p>
<p>The implant is saved in the file path “/usr/binos/conf/nginx-conf/cisco_service.conf.” It contains two variable strings composed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">hexadecimal characters</a>. The advisory continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>The implant is based on the Lua programming language and consists of 29 lines of code that facilitates the arbitrary command execution. The attacker must create an HTTP POST request to the device, which delivers the following three functions (Figure 1):</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level="1">The first function is dictated by the “menu” parameter, which must exist and must be non-empty. This returns a string of numbers surrounded by forward-slashes, which we suspect might represent the implant’s version or installation date.</li>
<li>The second function is dictated by the “logon_hash” parameter, which must be set to “1”. This returns an 18-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant.</li>
<li>The third function is also dictated by the “logon_hash” parameter, which checks to see if the parameter matches a 40-character hexadecimal string that is hardcoded into the implant. A second parameter used here is “common_type”, which must be non-empty, and whose value determines whether the code is executed at the system level or IOS level. If the code is executed at the system level, this parameter must be set to “subsystem”, and if it is executed at the IOS level, the parameter must be “iox”. The IOX commands are executed at privilege level 15.</li>
</ol>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png" data-height="638" data-width="984" alt="Implant code"><img alt="Implant code" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code-640x415.png" width="640" height="415" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png 2x"></a><figcaption><div><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cisco-implant-code.png" data-height="638" data-width="984">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Implant code</p></div><p>Cisco</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In most instances we have observed of this implant being installed, both the 18-character hexadecimal string in the second function and the 40-character hexadecimal string in the third function are unique, although in some cases, these strings were the same across different devices. This suggests there is a way for the actor to compute the value used in the third function from the value returned by the second function, acting as a form of authentication required for the arbitrary command execution provided in the third function.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Talos team members strongly urge administrators of any affected gear to immediately search their networks for signs of compromise. The most effective means is by searching for unexplained or newly created users on devices. One means of identifying if an implant has been installed is by running the following command against the device, where the "DEVICEIP” portion is a placeholder for the IP address of the device to check:</p>                                            
                                                        
<pre>curl -k -X POST "https[:]//DEVICEIP/webui/logoutconfirm.html?logon_hash=1"</pre>
<p>Admin accounts may have the names cisco_tac_admin or cisco_support. IP addresses Cisco has seen so far exploiting the zero-day are 5.149.249[.]74 and 154.53.56[.]231.<br>
Additional guidance from Cisco:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Check the system logs for the presence of any of the following log messages where “user” could be “cisco_tac_admin”, “cisco_support” or any configured, local user that is unknown to the network administrator:</li>
</ol>
<pre>%SYS-5-CONFIG_P: Configured programmatically by process&nbsp;SEP_webui_wsma_http from console as user on line</pre>
<pre>%SEC_LOGIN-5-WEBLOGIN_SUCCESS: Login Success [user:&nbsp;user] [Source: source_IP_address] at 03:42:13 UTC Wed Oct 11 2023</pre>
<p>Note: The %SYS-5-CONFIG_P message will be present for each instance that a user has accessed the web UI. The indicator to look for is new or unknown usernames present in the message.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Check the system logs for the following message where <strong>filename </strong>is an unknown filename that does not correlate with an expected file installation action:</li>
</ol>
<pre>%WEBUI-6-INSTALL_OPERATION_INFO: User: username, Install Operation: ADD filename It should go without saying but the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on internet-facing systems as is consistent with long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the guidance in Monday’s advisory.</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>It should go without saying, but the HTTP and HTTPS server feature should never be enabled on Internet-facing systems as is consistent with long-established best practices. Cisco reiterated the guidance in Monday’s advisory.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the worst tech labor years ever continues with the news that roughly half of Bandcamp employees have been laid off. Bandcamp employees are reporting the news <a href="https://x.com/modernistwitch/status/1713962311579234428?s=20">via social media</a>. </p><p>Late last month, Epic Games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/28/23894266/epic-games-layoffs-fortnite-unreal-engine">laid off 16 percent of its workforce</a>, or 830 employees, due to what CEO Tim Sweeney described as overspending. Epic also revealed that it would sell the Bandcamp business to California-based music licensing company Songtradr. In that announcement, Epic disclosed that an additional 250 people would be leaving Epic either through receiving offers from Songtradr or Epic’s divesture from its SuperAwesome ad business. Employees who did not receive offers from Songtradr were notified today and will be eligible for severance. </p><p>In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Songtradr confirmed that 50 percent of Bandcamp employees have been extended offers to join Songtradr and reaffirmed from <a href="https://x.com/songtradr/status/1709986126117630051?s=20">a previous statement</a> the company’s commitment to keeping the Bandcamp experience the same.</p></div></div>]]></description>

    </div>
<p>For the past couple of decades, tens of thousands of people living in rural Sri Lanka have been devastated by kidney failure due to unclear causes, also known as CKDu. Similar incidences of mysterious kidney diseases have emerged in tropical farming communities around the world.

										  
											        </p>
										 
										 											  
<p>A massive field study of the wells supplying drinking water to the Sri Lankan communities, conducted by researchers at Duke University, has identified a possible culprit—glyphosate, the active compound in Roundup, the most widely used herbicide in the world.
</p><p>The results of the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00504">study</a> were published in <i>Environmental Science and Technology Letters</i> on September 13, 2023.
</p><p>Roundup is a glyphosate-based herbicide used to control weeds and other pests. Because it is supposed to break down in the environment within a few days to weeks, its use is relatively under-regulated by most public health agencies. But when glyphosate encounters certain trace metal ions that make water hard—like magnesium and calcium—glyphosate-metal ion complexes can form. Those complexes can persist up to seven years in water and 22 years in soil.
</p><p>"It was always thought that this chemical would break down very quickly in the environment, but it seems to stick around a lot longer than we expected when it complexes in hard water," said Nishad Jayasundara, the Juli Plant Grainger Assistant Professor of Global Environmental Health at Duke. "We have to consider how glyphosate is interacting with these other elements, and what happens to glyphosate when you take that into your body as a complex."
</p><p>In certain agricultural areas of Sri Lanka, the high, dry climate combined with its geological formations creates the perfect conditions for hard water. It is also in these regions that CKDu has reached <a href="https://phys.org/tags/epidemic+levels/" rel="tag">epidemic levels</a>, with as many as 10% of children aged 5–11 years exhibiting signs of early onset kidney damage.
</p><p>Jayasundara, who is from Sri Lanka himself, believed that glyphosate may play a role in CKDu incidence because of the region's hard water, even though Sri Lanka has banned use of the herbicide. To test his hypothesis, Jayasundara teamed up with environmental chemist Lee Ferguson, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Duke and his Ph.D. student Jake Ulrich. In collaboration with Mangala De Silva, a professor at the University of Ruhuna, Sri Lanka, the Duke team sampled more than 200 wells across four regions in Sri Lanka.


											  													    </p>
											  
											  <p>Ferguson's lab at Duke employs high-resolution and tandem mass spectrometry to identify contaminants—even the barest trace of them—by their molecular weights. It's a highly sensitive method of identification and quantitation that allows a broad view into the pollutants present in a water system.
</p><p>Through this technique, the researchers found significantly higher levels of the herbicide in 44% of wells within the affected areas versus just 8% of those outside it.
</p><p>"We really focused on drinking water here, but it's possible there are other important routes of exposure—direct contact from <a href="https://phys.org/tags/agricultural+workers/" rel="tag">agricultural workers</a> spraying the pesticide, or perhaps food or dust," said Ferguson. "I'd like to see increased study with more emphasis looking at the links among these exposure routes. It still seems like there might be things we're missing."
</p><p>To this point, Ulrich also found elevated levels of fluoride and vanadium—both of which are linked to kidney damage—in the drinking water of most all of the communities with high incidence of CKDu. The researchers agree that more attention must be paid to the potential contributions each of these contaminants is playing, either individually or in concert with others. But given the reasoning for their glyphosate-based hypothesis going into the study and the herbicide's high levels of use worldwide, they also believe these results should serve as a serious warning when considering risk of exposure to glyphosate.
</p><p>Part of Ferguson's concern, he said, is that glyphosate's fate profile resembles a contaminant that he's studied closer to home—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, which are also called "forever chemicals" because of their persistence in the environment.
</p><p>"We think of PFAS as being a <a href="https://phys.org/tags/drinking+water/" rel="tag">drinking water</a> contaminant because it's mobile and persistent. Now we're realizing that glyphosate may also be quite persistent in hard water areas," said Ferguson. "This gives me concerns about exposures here in the United States."

<p><strong>Airplanes Africa Limited (AAL), an aircraft manufacturer based in Morogoro, has unveiled Tanzania’s first locally-assembled aircraft, the Skyleader 600.</strong></p>
<p>This unveiling took place at the Tanzania International Manufacturers Expo 2023 (TIMEXPO) in the nation’s capital at the Diamond Jubilee Hall in Dar es Salaam.</p>


<p>Skyleader 600 is designed to accommodate two passengers, including the pilot, and is very ideal for business travelers on longer journeys.</p>

<p>David Grolic, the AAL director disclosed that his organization decided to take advantage of Tanzania’s favorable business climate, and willingness to adopt new technologies, by setting up the aircraft assembling outfit in the country.</p>
<p>“We conducted thorough research to understand the requirements of business travelers who frequently undertake long-distance trips. In response to the research, we decided to present an aircraft that would enable business people to travel more conveniently and attend various meetings outside of the region before returning to the city for other activities.” He said.</p>
<p>AAL stands as the only company of its kind in the East African country. It boasts the only aircraft manufactured with commercial intent.</p>


<p><strong>What’s Next For AAL?</strong></p>
<p>According to the company, they are already working on a new aircraft called Skyleader 500, which will be a follow-up to Skyleader 600. Skyleader 500 according to the company is set to be completed by next year, 2024.</p>
<p>Unlike the Skyleader 600 which is meant for business purposes, the impending Skyleader 500 is intended for argricultural use as well as other rural commersial activities</p>
<p>According to the AAL director, a team of Tanzanian and Czech workers are working with the AAL to manufacture the Skyleader 500. It goes without saying that this business venture has provided employment opportunities for locals in the country.</p>


<p>David Grolic also noted that these aircraft are affordable and paying for one is comparable to paying for a car. They also have low operational costs, consume little energy, and are easily maintainable.</p>
<p>The director noted that the initial plan revolves around domestic sales before eventually pivoting to selling to the international market.</p>

<h2>Leaving Twitter had no effect on NPR's traffic (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/14/freedom-of-reach/#ex">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Enshittification is the process by which a platform lures in and then captures end users (stage one), who serve as bait for business customers, who are also captured (stage two), whereupon the platform rug-pulls both groups and allocates all the value they generate and exchange to itself (stage three):</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys</a></p>
<p>Enshittification isn't merely a form of rent-seeking – it is a uniquely digital phenomenon, because it relies on the inherent flexibility of digital systems. There are lots of intermediaries that want to extract surpluses from customers and suppliers – everyone from grocers to oil companies – but these can't be reconfigured in an eyeblink the way that purely digital services can.</p>
<p>A sleazy boss can hide their wage-theft with a bunch of confusing deductions to your paycheck. But when your boss is an app, it can engage in algorithmic wage discrimination, where your pay declines minutely every time you accept a job, but if you start to decline jobs, the app can raise the offer:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men">https://pluralistic.net/2023/04/12/algorithmic-wage-discrimination/#fishers-of-men</a></p>
<p>I call this process "twiddling": tech platforms are equipped with a million knobs on their back-ends, and platform operators can endlessly twiddle those knobs, altering the business logic from moment to moment, turning the system into an endlessly shifting quagmire where neither users nor business customers can ever be sure whether they're getting a fair deal:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/twiddler/</a></p>
<p>Social media platforms are compulsive twiddlers. They use endless variation to lure in – and then lock in – publishers, with the goal of converting these standalone businesses into commodity suppliers who are dependent on the platform, who can then be charged rent to reach the users who <em>asked</em> to hear from them.</p>
<p>Facebook designed this playbook. First, it lured in end-users by promising them a good deal: "Unlike Myspace, which spies on you from asshole to appetite, Facebook is a privacy-respecting site that will <em>never, ever</em> spy on you. Simply sign up, tell us everyone who matters to you, and we'll populate a feed with everything they post for public consumption":</p>
<p><a href="https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876">https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1128876</a></p>
<p>The users came, and locked themselves in: when people gather in social spaces, they inadvertently take one another hostage. You joined Facebook because you liked the people who were there, then others joined because they liked <em>you</em>. Facebook can now make life worse for all of you without losing your business. You might hate Facebook, but you like each other, and the collective action problem of deciding when and whether to go, and where you should go next, is so difficult to overcome, that you all stay in a place that's getting progressively worse.</p>
<p>Once its users were locked in, Facebook turned to advertisers and said, "Remember when we told these rubes we'd never spy on them? It was a lie. We spy on them with every hour that God sends, and we'll sell you access to that data in the form of dirt-cheap targeted ads."</p>
<p>Then Facebook went to the publishers and said, "Remember when we told these suckers that we'd only show them the things they asked to see? Total lie. Post short excerpts from your content and links back to your websites and we'll nonconsensually cram them into the eyeballs of people who never asked to see them. It's a free, high-value traffic funnel for your own site, bringing monetizable users right to your door."</p>
<p>Now, Facebook had to find a way to lock in those publishers. To do this, it had to twiddle. By tiny increments, Facebook deprioritized publishers' content, forcing them to make their excerpts grow progressively longer. As with gig workers, the digital flexibility of Facebook gave it lots of leeway here. Some publishers sensed the excerpts they were being asked to post were a substitute for visiting their sites – and not an enticement – and drew down their posting to Facebook.</p>
<p>When that happened, Facebook could twiddle in the publisher's favor, giving them broader distribution for shorter excerpts, then, once the publisher returned to the platform, Facebook drew down their traffic unless they started posting longer pieces. Twiddling lets platforms play users and business-customers like a fish on a line, giving them slack when they fight, then reeling them in when they tire.</p>
<p>Once Facebook converted a publisher to a commodity supplier to the platform, it reeled the publishers in. First, it deprioritized publishers' posts when they had links back to the publisher's site (under the pretext of policing "clickbait" and "malicious links"). Then, it stopped showing publishers' content to their own subscribers, extorting them to pay to "boost" their posts in order to reach people who had explicitly asked to hear from them.</p>
<p>For users, this meant that their feeds were increasingly populated with payola-boosted content from advertisers and pay-to-play publishers who paid Facebook's Danegeld to reach them. A user will only spend so much time on Facebook, and every post that Facebook feeds that user from someone they <em>want</em> to hear from is a missed opportunity to show them a post from someone who'll <em>pay</em> to reach them.</p>
<p>Here, too, twiddling lets Facebook fine-tune its approach. If a user starts to wean themself off Facebook, the algorithm (TM) can put more content the user has asked to see in the feed. When the user's participation returns to higher levels, Facebook can draw down the share of desirable content again, replacing it with monetizable content. This is done minutely, behind the scenes, automatically, and quickly. In any shell game, the quickness of the hand deceives the eye.</p>
<p>This is the final stage of enshittification: withdrawing surpluses from end-users and business customers, leaving behind the minimum homeopathic quantum of value for each needed to keep them locked to the platform, generating value that can be extracted and diverted to platform shareholders.</p>
<p>But this is a brittle equilibrium to maintain. The difference between "God, I hate this place but I just can't leave it" and "Holy shit, this <em>sucks</em>, I'm outta here" is razor-thin. All it takes is one privacy scandal, one livestreamed mass-shooting, one whistleblower dump, and people bolt for the exits. This kicks off a death-spiral: as users and business customers leave, the platform's shareholders demand that they squeeze the remaining population harder to make up for the loss.</p>
<p>One reason this gambit worked so well is that it was a long con. Platform operators and their investors have been willing to throw away billions convincing end-users and business customers to lock themselves in until it was time for the pig-butchering to begin. They financed expensive forays into additional features and complementary products meant to increase user lock-in, raising the switching costs for users who were tempted to leave.</p>
<p>For example, Facebook's product manager for its "photos" product wrote to Mark Zuckerberg to lay out a strategy of enticing users into uploading valuable family photos to the platform in order to "make switching costs very high for users," who would have to throw away their precious memories as the price for leaving Facebook:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/facebooks-secret-war-switching-costs</a></p>
<p>The platforms' patience paid off. Their slow ratchets operated so subtly that we barely noticed the squeeze, and when we did, they relaxed the pressure until we were lulled back into complacency. Long cons require a lot of prefrontal cortex, the executive function to exercise patience and restraint.</p>
<p>Which brings me to Elon Musk, a man who seems to have been born without a prefrontal cortex, who has repeatedly and publicly demonstrated that he lacks any restraint, patience or planning. Elon Musk's prefrontal cortical deficit resulted in his being forced to buy Twitter, and his every action since has betrayed an even graver inability to stop tripping over his own dick.</p>
<p>Where Zuckerberg played enshittification as a long game, Musk is bent on speedrunning it. He doesn't slice his users up with a subtle scalpel, he hacks away at them with a hatchet.</p>
<p>Musk inaugurated his reign by nonconsensually flipping every user to an algorithmic feed which was crammed with ads and posts from "verified" users whose blue ticks verified solely that they had $8 ($11 for iOS users). Where Facebook deployed substantial effort to enticing users who tired of eyeball-cramming feed decay by temporarily improving their feeds, Musk's Twitter actually overrode users' choice to switch back to a chronological feed by repeatedly flipping them back to more monetizable, algorithmic feeds.</p>
<p>Then came the squeeze on publishers. Musk's Twitter rolled out a bewildering array of "verification" ticks, each priced higher than the last, and publishers who refused to pay found their subscribers taken hostage, with Twitter downranking or shadowbanning their content unless they paid.</p>
<p>(Musk also squeezed advertisers, keeping the same high prices but reducing the quality of the offer by killing programs that kept advertisers' content from being published along Holocaust denial and open calls for genocide.)</p>
<p>Today, Musk continues to squeeze advertisers, publishers and users, and his hamfisted enticements to make up for these depredations are spectacularly bad, and even illegal, like offering advertisers a new kind of ad that isn't associated with any Twitter account, can't be blocked, and is not labeled as an ad:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/xs-sneaky-new-ads-might-be-illegal/">https://www.wired.com/story/xs-sneaky-new-ads-might-be-illegal/</a></p>
<p>Of course, Musk has a compulsive bullshitter's contempt for the press, so he has far fewer enticements for them to stay. Quite the reverse: first, Musk removed headlines from link previews, rendering posts by publishers that went to their own sites into stock-art enigmas that generated no traffic:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/05/x-twitter-strips-headlines-new-links-why-elon-musk">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/05/x-twitter-strips-headlines-new-links-why-elon-musk</a></p>
<p>Then he jumped straight to the end-stage of enshittification by announcing that he would shadowban any newsmedia posts with links to sites other than Twitter, "because there is less time spent if people click away." Publishers were advised to "post content in long form on this platform":</p>
<p><a href="https://mamot.fr/@pluralistic/111183068362793821">https://mamot.fr/@pluralistic/111183068362793821</a></p>
<p>Where a canny enshittifier would have gestured at a gaslighting explanation ("we're shadowbanning posts with links because they might be malicious"), Musk busts out the motto of the Darth Vader MBA: "I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further."</p>
<p>All this has the effect of highlighting just how <em>little</em> residual value there is on the platform for publishers, and tempts them to bolt for the exits. Six months ago, NPR lost all patience with Musk's shenanigans, and quit the service. Half a year later, they've revealed how low the switching cost for a major news outlet that leaves Twitter really are: NPR's traffic, post-Twitter, has declined by less than a single percentage point:</p>
<p><a href="https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/">https://niemanreports.org/articles/npr-twitter-musk/</a></p>
<p>NPR's Twitter accounts had 8.7 million followers, but even six months ago, Musk's enshittification speedrun had drawn down NPR's ability to reach those users to a negligible level. The 8.7 million number was an illusion, a shell game Musk played on publishers like NPR in a bid to get them to buy a five-figure iridium checkmark or even a six-figure titanium one.</p>
<p>On Twitter, the true number of followers you have is effectively zero – not because Twitter users haven't explicitly instructed the service to show them your posts, but because every post in their feeds that they want to see is a post that no one can be charged to show them.</p>
<p>I've experienced this myself. Three and a half years ago, I left Boing Boing and started pluralistic.net, my cross-platform, open access, surveillance-free, daily newsletter and blog:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/19/drei-drei-drei/#now-we-are-three</a></p>
<p>Boing Boing had the good fortune to have attracted a sizable audience before the advent of siloed platforms, and a large portion of that audience came to the site directly, rather than following us on social media. I knew that, starting a new platform from scratch, I wouldn't have that luxury. My audience would come from social media, and it would be up to me to convert readers into people who followed me on platforms I controlled – where neither they nor I could be held to ransom.</p>
<p>I embraced a strategy called POSSE: Post Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere. With POSSE, the permalink and native habitat for your material is a site you control (in my case, a WordPress blog with all the telemetry, logging and surveillance disabled). Then you repost that content to other platforms – mostly social media – with links back to your own site:</p>
<p><a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">https://indieweb.org/POSSE</a></p>
<p>There are a lot of automated tools to help you with this, but the platforms have gone to great lengths to break or neuter them. Musk's attack on Twitter's legendarily flexible and powerful API killed every automation tool that might help with this. I was lucky enough to have a reader – Loren Kohnfelder – who coded me some python scripts that automate much of the process, but POSSE remains a very labor-intensive and error-prone methodology:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd">https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd</a></p>
<p>And of all the feeds I produce – email, RSS, Discourse, Medium, Tumblr, Mastodon – none is as labor-intensive as Twitter's. It is an unforgiving medium to begin with, and Musk's drawdown of engineering support has made it wildly unreliable. Many's the time I've set up 20+ posts in a thread, only to have the browser tab reload itself and wipe out all my work.</p>
<p>But I stuck with Twitter, because I have a half-million followers, and to the extent that I reach them there, I can hope that they will follow the permalinks to Pluralistic proper and switch over to RSS, or email, or a daily visit to the blog.</p>
<p>But with each day, the case for using Twitter grows weaker. I get ten times as many replies and reposts on Mastodon, though my Mastodon follower count is a tenth the size of my (increasingly hypothetical) Twitter audience.</p>
<p>All this raises the question of what can or should be done about Twitter. One possible regulatory response would be to impose an "End-To-End" rule on the service, requiring that Twitter deliver posts from willing senders to willing receivers without interfering in them. End-To-end is the bedrock of the internet (one of its incarnations is Net Neutrality) and it's a proven counterenshittificatory force:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/save-news-we-need-end-end-web">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/06/save-news-we-need-end-end-web</a></p>
<p>Despite what you may have heard, "freedom of reach" <em>is</em> freedom of speech: when a platform interposes itself between willing speakers and their willing audiences, it arrogates to itself the power to control what we're allowed to say and who is allowed to hear us:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/10/e2e/#the-censors-pen</a></p>
<p>We have a wide variety of tools to make a rule like this stick. For one thing, Musk's Twitter has violated innumerable laws and consent decrees in the US, Canada and the EU, which creates a space for regulators to impose "conduct remedies" on the company.</p>
<p>But there's also existing regulatory authorities, like the FTC's Section Five powers, which enable the agency to act against companies that engage in "unfair and deceptive" acts. When Twitter asks you who you want to hear from, then refuses to deliver their posts to you unless they pay a bribe, that's both "unfair and deceptive":</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge">https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/10/the-courage-to-govern/#whos-in-charge</a></p>
<p>But that's only a stopgap. The problem with Twitter isn't that this important service is run by the wrong mercurial, mediocre billionaire: it's that hundreds of millions of people are at the mercy of <em>any</em> foolish corporate leader. While there's a short-term case for improving the platforms, our long-term strategy should be <em>evacuating</em> them:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens">https://pluralistic.net/2023/07/18/urban-wildlife-interface/#combustible-walled-gardens</a></p>
<p>To make that a reality, we could also impose a "Right To Exit" on the platforms. This would be an interoperability rule that would require Twitter to adopt Mastodon's approach to server-hopping: click a link to export the list of everyone who follows you on one server, click another link to upload that file to another server, and all your followers and followees are relocated to your new digs:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies">https://pluralistic.net/2022/12/23/semipermeable-membranes/#free-as-in-puppies</a></p>
<p>A Twitter with the Right To Exit would exert a powerful discipline even on the stunted self-regulatory centers of Elon Musk's brain. If he banned a reporter for publishing truthful coverage that cast him in a bad light, that reporter would have the legal right to move to another platform, <em>and continue to reach the people who follow them on Twitter</em>. Publishers aghast at having the headlines removed from their Twitter posts could go somewhere less slipshod and still reach the people who want to hear from them on Twitter.</p>
<p>And both Right To Exit and End-To-End satisfy the two prime tests for sound internet regulation: first, they are easy to administer. If you want to know whether Musk is permitting harassment on his platform, you have to agree on a definition of harassment, determine whether a given act meets that definition, and then investigate whether Twitter took reasonable steps to prevent it.</p>
<p>By contrast, administering End-To-End merely requires that you post something and see if your followers receive it. Administering Right To Exit is as simple as saying, "OK, Twitter, I know you say you gave Cory his follower and followee file, but he says he never got it. Just send him another copy, and this time, CC the regulator so we can verify that it arrived."</p>
<p>Beyond administration, there's the cost of compliance. Requiring Twitter to police its users' conduct also requires it to hire an army of moderators – something that Elon Musk might be able to afford, but community-supported, small federated servers couldn't. A tech regulation can easily become a barrier to entry, blocking better competitors who might replace the company whose conduct spurred the regulation in the first place.</p>
<p>End-to-End does not present this kind of barrier. The default state for a social media platform is to deliver posts from accounts to their followers. Interfering with End-To-End costs <em>more</em> than delivering the messages users want to have. Likewise, a Right To Exit is a solved problem, built into the open Mastodon protocol, itself built atop the open ActivityPub standard.</p>
<p>It's not just Twitter. Every platform is consuming itself in an orgy of enshittification. This is the Great Enshittening, a moment of universal, end-stage platform decay. As the platforms burn, calls to address the fires grow louder and harder for policymakers to resist. But not all solutions to platform decay are created equal. Some solutions will perversely <em>enshrine</em> the dominance of platforms, help make them both too big to fail and too big to jail.</p>
<p>Musk has flagrantly violated so many rules, laws and consent decrees that he has accidentally turned Twitter into the perfect starting point for a program of platform reform and platform evacuation.</p>

</p><p>Cecilia Payne began school in Wendover at a private school run by Elizabeth Edwards. When she was twelve her mother moved to London for the sake of the education of Cecilia's brother <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humfry_Payne" title="Humfry Payne">Humfry</a>, who later became an archaeologist. Cecilia attended St Mary's College, Paddington, where she was unable to study much mathematics or science, but in 1918 changed schools for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Girls%27_School" title="St Paul's Girls' School">St Paul's Girls' School</a>. There she was urged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Holst" title="Gustav Holst">Gustav Holst</a>, who taught music at the school, to pursue a career in music, but she preferred to focus on science. The following year she won a scholarship that paid all her expenses at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newnham_College" title="Newnham College">Newnham College</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge" title="University of Cambridge">Cambridge University</a>, where she initially read botany, physics, and chemistry but she dropped botany after her first year.<sup id="cite_ref-Andrews_5-2"><a href="#cite_note-Andrews-5">[5]</a></sup> 
</p><p>Her interest in astronomy began after she attended a lecture by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington" title="Arthur Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> on his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919" title="Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919">1919 expedition</a> to the island of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%ADncipe" title="Príncipe">Príncipe</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Guinea" title="Gulf of Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a> off the west coast of Africa to observe and photograph the stars near a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">solar eclipse</a> as a test of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity" title="General relativity">general theory of relativity</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-0"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup> She said of the lecture: "The result was a complete transformation of my world picture.

</p><p>Payne realized that her only career option in the U.K. was to become a teacher, so she looked for grants that would enable her to move to the United States. After being introduced to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlow_Shapley" title="Harlow Shapley">Harlow Shapley</a>, the Director of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_College_Observatory" title="Harvard College Observatory">Harvard College Observatory</a>, where he had just established a graduate program in astronomy, she left England in 1923.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-1"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup> This was made possible by a fellowship to encourage women to study at the observatory. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Ames" title="Adelaide Ames">Adelaide Ames</a> had become the first student on the fellowship in 1922; the second was Payne.

Shapley persuaded Payne to write a doctoral dissertation, and so in 1925 she became the first person to earn a PhD in astronomy from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radcliffe_College" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" title="Harvard University">Harvard University</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:0_7-2"><a href="#cite_note-:0-7">[7]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sobel_2016-203213_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sobel_2016-203213-11">[11]</a></sup> Her thesis title was <i>Stellar Atmospheres; A Contribution to the Observational Study of High Temperature in the Reversing Layers of Stars</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-thesis_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-thesis-12">[12]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-cwp-1_1-2"><a href="#cite_note-cwp-1-1">[1]</a></sup></p><figure typeof="mw:File/Thumb"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg/220px-ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg" decoding="async" width="220" height="110" srcset="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg/330px-ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg/440px-ESO_-_Milky_Way.jpg 2x" data-file-width="6000" data-file-height="3000"></a><figcaption>Ratios of hydrogen and helium measured in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy" title="Milky Way galaxy">Milky Way galaxy</a> match Payne-Gaposchkin's 1925 calculations.</figcaption></figure><p>Payne was able to accurately relate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification" title="Stellar classification">spectral classes</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star" title="Star">stars</a> to their actual temperatures by applying Indian physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meghnad_Saha" title="Meghnad Saha">Meghnad Saha</a>'s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saha_ionization_equation" title="Saha ionization equation">ionization theory</a>. She showed that the great variation in stellar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line" title="Spectral line">absorption lines</a> was due to differing amounts of ionization at different temperatures, not to different amounts of elements. She found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon" title="Silicon">silicon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon" title="Carbon">carbon</a>, and other common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" title="Metallicity">metals</a> seen in the Sun's spectrum were present in about the same relative amounts as on Earth, in agreement with the accepted belief of the time, which held that the stars had approximately the same elemental composition as the Earth. However, she found that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium" title="Helium">helium</a> and particularly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a> were vastly more abundant (for hydrogen, by a factor of about one million).<sup id="cite_ref-:1_13-0"><a href="#cite_note-:1-13">[13]</a></sup> Her thesis concluded that hydrogen was the overwhelming constituent of stars, making it the most abundant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element" title="Chemical element">element</a> in the Universe.<sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-0"><a href="#cite_note-:2-14">[14]</a></sup>
</p><p>However, when Payne's dissertation was reviewed, astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell" title="Henry Norris Russell">Henry Norris Russell</a>, who stood by the theories of American physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Augustus_Rowland" title="Henry Augustus Rowland">Henry Rowland</a>, dissuaded her from concluding that the composition of the Sun was predominantly hydrogen because it would contradict the scientific consensus of the time that the elemental composition of the Sun and the Earth were similar.<sup id="cite_ref-amnh_15-0"><a href="#cite_note-amnh-15">[15]</a></sup> In 1914, he had written in an academic article:
</p>
<blockquote><p>The agreement of the solar and terrestrial lists is such as to confirm very strongly Rowland's opinion that, if the Earth's crust should be raised to the temperature of the Sun's atmosphere, it would give a very similar absorption spectrum. The spectra of the Sun and other stars were similar, so it appeared that the relative abundance of elements in the universe was like that in Earth's crust.<sup id="cite_ref-russell-1914_16-0"><a href="#cite_note-russell-1914-16">[16]</a></sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Payne consequently described her results as "spurious".<sup id="cite_ref-thesis_12-1"><a href="#cite_note-thesis-12">[12]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 186">: 186 </span></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:2_14-1"><a href="#cite_note-:2-14">[14]</a></sup> A few years later, astronomer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Struve" title="Otto Struve">Otto Struve</a> described her work as "the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy".<sup id="cite_ref-aps_17-0"><a href="#cite_note-aps-17">[17]</a></sup> Russell also realized she was correct when he derived the same results by different means. In 1929, he published his findings in a paper that briefly acknowledged Payne's earlier work and discovery, including the mention that "[t]he most important previous determination of the abundance of the elements by astrophysical means is that by Miss Payne [...]".<sup id="cite_ref-quote_18-0"><a href="#cite_note-quote-18">[18]</a></sup> Nevertheless, he was generally credited for the conclusions she reached.<sup id="cite_ref-russell_19-0"><a href="#cite_note-russell-19">[19]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-newnham_20-0"><a href="#cite_note-newnham-20">[20]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-epigenesys_21-0"><a href="#cite_note-epigenesys-21">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>Accepted ratios for hydrogen and helium in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way_galaxy" title="Milky Way galaxy">Milky Way Galaxy</a> are ~74% hydrogen and ~24% helium, confirming the results of Payne-Gaposchkin's calculations from 1925.<sup id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[22]</a></sup>

<p>After her doctorate, Payne studied stars of high luminosity to understand the structure of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way" title="Milky Way">Milky Way</a>. Later she surveyed all stars brighter than the tenth <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnitude_(astronomy)" title="Magnitude (astronomy)">magnitude</a>. She then studied <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_star" title="Variable star">variable stars</a>, making over 1,250,000 observations with her assistants. This work later was extended to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magellanic_Clouds" title="Magellanic Clouds">Magellanic Clouds</a>, adding a further 2,000,000 observations of variable stars. These data were used to determine the paths of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution" title="Stellar evolution">stellar evolution</a>. She published her conclusions in her second book, <i>The Stars of High Luminosity</i> (1930).<sup id="cite_ref-:1_13-1"><a href="#cite_note-:1-13">[13]</a></sup> Her observations and analysis of variable stars, carried out with her husband, Sergei Gaposchkin, laid the basis for all subsequent work on such objects.<sup id="cite_ref-cwp-1_1-3"><a href="#cite_note-cwp-1-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Payne-Gaposchkin remained scientifically active throughout her life, spending her entire academic career at Harvard. When she began, women were barred from becoming professors at Harvard, so she spent years doing less prestigious, low-paid research jobs. Nevertheless, her work resulted in several published books, including <i>The Stars of High Luminosity</i> (1930), <i>Variable Stars</i> (1938) and <i>Variable Stars and Galactic Structure</i> (1954). Shapley had made efforts to improve her position, and in 1938 she was given the title of "Astronomer." On Payne's request, her title was later changed to Phillips Astronomer, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_endowment#Endowed_professorships" title="Financial endowment">endowed position</a> which would make her an "officer of the university"; in order to get approval for her title, Shapley assured the university that giving Payne-Gaposchkin this position would not make her equivalent to a professor, but privately pushed for the position to be later converted into an explicit professorship as the "Phillips Professor of Astronomy".<sup id="cite_ref-autobiography_8-1"><a href="#cite_note-autobiography-8">[8]</a></sup><sup><span title="Page: 225">: 225 </span></sup><sup id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sobel_2016-245258_24-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sobel_2016-245258-24">[24]</a></sup> She was elected a Fellow of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences" title="American Academy of Arts and Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1943.<sup id="cite_ref-AAAS_25-0"><a href="#cite_note-AAAS-25">[25]</a></sup> Her courses were not recorded in the Harvard University catalogue until 1945.<sup id="cite_ref-cwp-1_1-4"><a href="#cite_note-cwp-1-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>Payne's career marked a turning point at Harvard College Observatory. Under the direction of Harlow Shapley and Dr E. J. Sheridan (whom Payne-Gaposchkin described as a mentor<sup id="cite_ref-autobiography_8-2"><a href="#cite_note-autobiography-8">[8]</a></sup>), the observatory had already offered more opportunities in astronomy to women than did other institutions. This was evident in the achievements accomplished earlier in the century by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamina_Fleming" title="Williamina Fleming">Williamina Fleming</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonia_Maury" title="Antonia Maury">Antonia Maury</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annie_Jump_Cannon" title="Annie Jump Cannon">Annie Jump Cannon</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt" title="Henrietta Swan Leavitt">Henrietta Swan Leavitt</a>. However, with Payne's PhD, women entered the mainstream.<sup id="cite_ref-31"><a href="#cite_note-31">[31]</a></sup>
</p><p>The trail she blazed into the largely male-dominated scientific community was an inspiration to many. For example, she became a role model for astrophysicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Feynman" title="Joan Feynman">Joan Feynman</a>. Feynman's mother and grandmother had dissuaded her from pursuing science, since they believed women were not physically capable of understanding scientific concepts.<sup id="cite_ref-Hirshberg1_32-0"><a href="#cite_note-Hirshberg1-32">[32]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Ottaviani_33-0"><a href="#cite_note-Ottaviani-33">[33]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Sykes_34-0"><a href="#cite_note-Sykes-34">[34]</a></sup> Feynman was inspired by Payne-Gaposchkin when she came across her work in an astronomy textbook. Seeing Payne-Gaposchkin's published research convinced Feynman that she could, in fact, follow her scientific passions.<sup id="cite_ref-Hirshberg1_32-1"><a href="#cite_note-Hirshberg1-32">[32]</a></sup>
</p><p>While accepting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Norris_Russell_Lectureship" title="Henry Norris Russell Lectureship">Henry Norris Russell Prize</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Astronomical_Society" title="American Astronomical Society">American Astronomical Society</a>, Payne spoke of her lifelong passion for research: "The reward of the young scientist is the emotional thrill of being the first person in the history of the world to see something or understand something. Nothing can compare with that experience [...] The reward of the old scientist is the sense of having seen a vague sketch grow into a masterly landscape."<sup id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup>

<p>In her autobiography, Payne tells that while in school she created an experiment on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficacy_of_prayer" title="Efficacy of prayer">efficacy of prayer</a> by dividing her exams in two groups, praying for success only on one, the other one being a control group.

</p><p>In 1931, Payne became a United States citizen. On a tour through Europe in 1933, she met Russian-born astrophysicist Sergei I. Gaposchkin in Germany. She helped him get a visa to the United States, and they married in March 1934, settling in the historic town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexington,_Massachusetts" title="Lexington, Massachusetts">Lexington, Massachusetts</a>, a short commute from Harvard. Payne added her husband's name to her own, and the Payne-Gaposchkins had three children: Edward, Katherine and Peter. Payne's daughter remembers her as "an inspired seamstress, an inventive knitter, and a voracious reader". Payne and her family were members of the First <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Universalism" title="Unitarian Universalism">Unitarian</a> Church in Lexington, where Cecilia taught Sunday school. 
She was also active with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Friends" title="Society of Friends">Quakers</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-37"><a href="#cite_note-37">[37]</a></sup> She died at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on December 7, 1979, aged 79.

  <section> 
  <p>It was March 2020, I was in New England when covid quarantine had just begin and I found myself much more homebound. In these situations I'm not one to just do nothing. I always have some sort of project or hobby to keep me busy, be it taking and editing photos, writing detailed blog posts, or coding something.</p>

  <p>I had always wanted to learn iOS development, so this felt like the perfect opportunity. I was particularly keen to learn SwiftUI to build my designs natively. Years back I had dabbled with writing an Objective-C app, but it never quite filled me with joy, to say the least. As a designer, I've spent the last decade getting good with prototyping tools and frameworks to mimic realistic, interactive mobile prototypes. Building it myself was the natural next step to give me even more control over the experience, and <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/craft/">get even deeper into the craft.</a></p>

  <p>I started learning Swift and SwiftUI basics with courses like Design+Code, and Hacking with Swift. But I knew myself—I learn best with a project of my own. I knew exactly what I wanted to build: a better stock portfolio tracker. The stock market had taken a plunge with covid and I was doing dozens of trades per week with everything on sale. It would be fun to have a simple app of my own to track the performance of my trades instead of dealing with the subpar sites and apps from my stockbrokers.</p>

  <p>Little did I know this project would consume my nights and weekends for over two years, often spending 10-20 hours a week on it. I built a ton of functionality, sweat all the details, wrote a comprehensive node backend for it, created an LLC for it, and managed an active Testflight. I was learning Swift and SwiftUI along the way, so I was often redesigning and rebuilding as I went.</p>
  <p>Eventually, I decided to stop pursuing it. I'll get into the why a bit later. <strong>This post is for me to document <a href="https://stocketa.com/" title="Checking your stocks &amp; crypto should be easy.">Stocketa</a>.</strong> I designed and built a lot that I'm proud of and want to have somewhere to archive it before I pull the plug.</p>

  <h5 id="what-is-stocketa">What <del>is</del> was Stocketa</h5>
  <p>Stocketa was a simple portfolio tracker designed with care. It came out of my frustration of having to check the clunky apps and sites that my brokers had just to get a glimpse at how my investments were doing. I'm a casual investor and don't need much from a tool like this but I had assets in various places, and I just wanted one easy and well-designed place to check them. I wanted to see real per-transaction gain/loss info, based on my own cost basis.</p>

  <p>While there are tons of apps, brokers, and neobanks that address this, nothing quite felt like what I wanted. There were several types of solutions in this space:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>First off, there are simple stock apps like Apple Stocks that let you see stock charts, news, and more. They have good data and don't require any accounts to use. However, they offer no functionality to log your holdings and track your gains/losses.</p></li>
    <li><p>There are lots of broker apps (e.g., Robinhood) that let you trade and track your holdings, but they only let you see your holdings from them, not from any other financial services you might use.</p></li>
    <li><p>Then there's a whole category of what I'd call advanced stock services like TradingView (and several that have since died or pivoted over the years), but they're not mobile-first or as elegant as I wanted.</p></li>
    <li><p>There are broader investment advisor services like Personal Capital. While they do often have some aggregator functionality to link up your other accounts, they're not that powerful for diving into individual assets, aren't particularly well-designed, and are primarily focused on upselling you on their own investment advising services (seriously, I used to get endless 8am calls from Personal Capital).</p></li>
    <li><p>And there are lots of smaller apps on the App Store where you can track your holdings but the design and UX leaves a lot to be desired. I've tried most of them.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>From a design perspective, I generally found that financial apps bias towards density when displaying your assets. They assume you have tons of stocks and prioritize a list view where you have to tap in to a detail view to see more info. I found myself constantly tapping in, manipulating a chart or looking at some basic stats, then swiping back and repeating all that for several stocks. It was not easy or the kind of at a glance info I wanted.</p>

  <p>That left me with my challenge. I wanted a <em>simple</em> portfolio tracker aimed at the casual investor. It didn't have to do it all, but it should aim to do a few things well. An app just for me.</p>

  <h5 id="custom">Going custom</h5>
  <p>I was more than thrilled to be working on a new app from scratch. After years of working at large companies with rigid design systems and gobs of stakeholders for every little design decision, I was yearning for some creative freedom. Freedom from process, freedom from typical design constraints. I would be in full control, designing and building it myself. <strong>It was <em>my</em> <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/side-projects/">side project</a> after all</strong>.</p>

  <p>I had gotten tired of designing for traditional mobile apps. You know the type.. you add a tab bar, a typical navigation stack, page header and the app already feels significantly basic, muted, and limited out of the gate.</p>
  
  <p><strong>This was my place to have fun.</strong> I wanted to go custom and toss out whatever components the system gives you for free. And I knew that by having to figure out how to build various UI components from scratch, I'd learn a lot along the way. Almost all of Stocketa's UI is custom.</p>

  <p>I will say that <strong>going custom is almost always the absolutely <em>wrong</em> thing to do</strong> 99% of the time. The operating system you're working in—be it iOS, Android, macOS—has invested a ton in a highly-considered suite of components. They're remarkably accessible, well-tested, and work on a variety of devices.</p>

  <p>It's absolutely no small feat to consider creating a custom component for your app. However, when going custom does make sense and you're okay with the added scope and responsibility, the app becomes your canvas to do whatever you want and <em>make it yours</em>.</p>

  <p>The first area where custom made sense for me was general app navigation. When I got started, I knew I wanted this app to have minimal app chrome. I didn't want a standard tab bar and header taking up space. I wasn't going to require much navigation: most things would just live inside the stock cards from the home timeline.</p>

  <p>The app would be focused around showing more with less. Personally, I only cared about tracking a few stocks, but I hated the work of constantly having to tap in to see a detail view, or interact with the chart. As such, the main scroll view needed to be more immersive and not get occluded by unnecessary app chrome.</p>

  <p>It started with app navigation, custom stock cards, sheets, and more. Needless to say, I spent a lot of time on the details with everything being custom. Below are a few examples:</p>

  

  <h5 id="building">Designing and building</h5>

  <p>I started with the basics: getting a scroll view of stock cards working, adding charts, and hooking it up to a database for persistence (initially Core Data before moving to Firebase). Then I added the requisite network calls and polling to update the stock card from a financial data provider. I started with IEX as the data provider as they had a decent API, reasonable pricing, and allowed commercial use, which would be required for a consumer app like this to go on the App Store.</p>

  <p>One of the initial key decisions with Stocketa was that I wanted to track stock transactions in a comprehensive way. Simply logging the number of shares you had for each stock was not going to cut it. This ended up being a significant amount of work to do properly, but it was necessary:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>For each stock sale or purchase I wanted to be able to display not only the total gain/loss, but per-transaction gain/loss so you could tell if an individual transaction was a good trade.</p></li>
    <li><p>When it comes to stock sales, I needed to know the cost basis method (FIFO, LIFO, et cetera) so I could correctly calculate and display the realized and unrealized gains on a particular transaction. When selling shares, I also needed to know from which previous transaction or transactions the shares would be sold so I could get the correct cost basis and accurately calculate the gain/loss based on the cost basis method.</p></li>
    <li><p>And then there was dealing with stock splits, which seems simple at first glance but ended up being quite a bit of work to build in a robust way: not simply altering previous transactions. They should be automatically applied for new splits, but also able to be manually applied if you didn't log split-adjusted transactions.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>At some point I gave it a name: Stocketa. In Greek you might say "marketa" (Μαρκέτα, though αγορά might be a more proper word) when referring to a market, so this was like  coalescing Stock and Market with that in mind.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>When I was interviewing for a new job in 2021, I created these slides as part of my presentation after talking about my work at Twitter for the previous 9 years.

  <h5 id="swiftui">A note about SwiftUI</h5>
  <p>I kept designing, building.. and then redesigning and rebuilding. One of the side effects of learning Swift and SwiftUI as I was building this was that I was constantly redoing specific pages and parts of the app as I went. I continually found better ways to build things, and similarly I would continually refine designs. About a year or so into building Stocketa I <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-swiftui/">wrote about my experience with SwiftUI</a>. Much of that still rings true.</p>

  <p>SwiftUI has come a long way since iOS 13. It's more performant, there's more parity in available components and functionality compared with UIKit, and you get more control over things. And with iOS 17, you get some goodies like shaders, keyframes, scroll transitions, and more.</p>

  <p>There's still a gap between the types of things you can do with AppKit and UIKit, but SwiftUI is undeniably a powerful tool that's dramatically more approachable. And not just a coding tool; it's a great design tool. Designers can quickly lay things out, hook up interactions, and get a real feel for a design using a native tool. </p>
  <p>Almost all of Stocketa's UI is built with SwiftUI. There were only a few occasions when I found it necessary to use UIKit to achieve some goal.<sup><a rel="footnote" href="#footnote-1" id="r1">1</a></sup>
 None of this would have been possible, or drawn me to take a closer look into building iOS apps, if it hadn't been for SwiftUI.</p>

  <h5 id="what-i-built">What I built</h5>
  <p>I used the app daily and continued pouring time into every feature and detail to meet my high quality bar. While I initially planned for this to be a simple to build app that would not require a backend, or even any user accounts, that did not last for long. I quickly realized I needed my own backend to unlock a few things.</p>

  <p>At first, this was so I didn't have to include the API key for my financial data provider inside the app for security reasons—I wouldn't want someone to find it and start running up my bill by abusing it. I created a backend proxy for the API with rate-limiting and throttling. Then, I wanted to have it be authenticated with user accounts, so I added Sign In With Apple along with a stock data caching system so that I only had to fetch stats for a stock once with a certain time period (depending on the particular stat that was either seconds, 24 hours, or weekly) regardless of however many user accounts needed that stock info. The main goal with that was to also reduce my costs associated with financial data API usage.</p>

  <p>By this point I really started enjoying the speed at which I could update endpoints and business logic entirely on the backend. I started moving logic I had in the app to the backend. <strong>Stocketa was starting to come together.</strong></p>

  <p>Even though this was just a solo project, I used Linear to keep track of tasks, ideas, features, customer feedback, and milestones.</p>

  <div>
      <figure>
        <a href="https://turbo.paulstamatiou.com/uploads/2023/08/copyright-paulstamatiou_com-stocketa-linear.webp"><img src="https://turbo.paulstamatiou.com/uploads/2023/08/copyright-paulstamatiou_com-stocketa-linear.webp" data-ratio="1.393" loading="lazy"></a>
      </figure>
    </div>

  <p>I had prioritized lists of things to build and bugs to fix. I was using—and loving—Linear for this. Here's a list of <em>most</em> of the things I built for Stocketa:</p>

  

  <p>I ran a small TestFlight alpha with close friends, then increasingly I added more people. At one point I was up to around 1,000 people. That was the most I wanted to allow. I received lots of feedback from overall great first impressions (below), to general feature requests, and of course lots of bug reports.</p>
    
  <blockquote>
    <p>Already the app is filling a need for me in its personal approach to tracking investments: no pushing for sales, no integrations with brokers and no unnecessary permissions. Brilliant.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Simply amazed at the SwiftUI work you’ve poured into this app. So beautiful. The onboarding alone is a masterclass in attention to detail. Bravo.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>love it, this feels so polished and slick already... really great use of SwiftUI</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just got the invite, added my stocks... the animations are beautiful, design is clean and precise... it’s all around beautiful. Congrats!</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>F**k, man. This app is incredible. You’re building all of this on your own?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dude. This app is f**king beautiful. Really great job. Just imported shares - super easy.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>This NUX is insane. The particles when you add a stock. Gives me the happy brain chemicals..</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>I had thousands on a waiting list but there were API and hosting costs associated with the increased usage that I didn't want to bear yet, as well as a huge increase in support and customer feedback that took a lot of time to manage. You start to hear the same types of feedback, and it just becomes a chore to manage that many emails. That good news was that something was resonating and people cared enough to go through the work to send in bug reports and feature requests.</p>

  <h5 id="website">The website</h5>
  <p>At some point early in feature development I took a break to focus on the website. At first I wanted a simple landing page to build interest, and collect emails for a waitlist so I could keep people in the loop. And I didn't want to spend that much time on it.</p>

    <p><small><strong>Video:</strong> Initial Stocketa teaser homepage.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>There was nothing fancy or particularly special about this initial page. It was just something quick I wanted to get out the door. And now, a while later, there's a lot I hate about this early design. The background texture was too strong, the headline alignment feels odd with the phone.. but I digress.</p>
  
  <p>In that initial design I did start playing with some wave-related elements—a loose reference to stock market charts going up and down. And then to add to that, I built a few mini stock cards gently hovering in place (thanks to <code>offset-path</code> CSS along with 2 keyframe animations) in the background. Each stock card had an SVG line chart—loosely based on that stock's actual performance around the time—that would animate on page load. I ended up keeping a version of these mini stock cards on the latest version of the website, and then on an onboarding screen inside the app.</p>

  <p>The original inspiration for these random floating stock cards was from my now <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/work">out-of-date work page</a> where I highlighted projects with some large cards, each with their own intro animation based on the project. One of them was for my work on Twitter Video, where video clip thumbnails would fan out from the phone on hover (shown below).</p>

The App Store QR code was meant to be displayed on scroll but in this version I didn't have that hooked up as the app wasn't live.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>In early 2021 I ended up getting around to designing and building out the first complete homepage for Stocketa. I had enough functionality and features built that it felt worthy of investing some time into showcasing them on the site.</p>
  
  <p>Lots of app websites at the time (and still now) had the typical hero section on their homepage: some app screenshot in a phone frame off to one side, with accompanying header and subtitle text adjacent. Nothing wrong with that, but I wanted something a bit more engaging. I wasn't entirely interested in optimizing for conversion, and cramming a lot in above the page fold.</p>

  <p>I thought it would be nice to try to do something where the 3D phone frame was angled and then began to change position on scroll while a brief teaser video of the app functionality played. Apple had done something similar in recent years with product pages, such as the first-generation AirPods Pro. They used over 100 frames of the AirPods that would progress as you scrolled:</p>

    <p><small>Example of a technique used by Apple.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>There's a lot of ways to achieve an effect like this. One route route is using Lottie and essentially converting each frame of your video or animation to a base64-encoded string in a json file for the Lottie web player to manage. It's not a flawless solution, however, and can incur some large file sizes depending on what you're doing. It's best for vector micro-animations, not large devices with complex visual content. I also didn't want to incur the cost of that large initial json download blocking the very first thing you see on the site.</p>

  <p>Instead I opted to have javascript display a sequence of frames composited to <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> along with an offscreenCanvas for performance. I used <a href="https://rotato.app/" title="3D mockup images and movies in minutes">Rotato</a> to import my short Stocketa screencast, create a 3D phone video, and then create a PNG sequence of frames. I wasn't super pleased with the quality—the phone frame didn't look super realistic and had some rough pixelated edges—but it was good enough compared to doing it all by hand with other design tools.</p>

  </p></div>
  
  <p>I then exported optimized transparent webp, and jpg files (with accompanying alpha masks created in Sketch to save bandwidth) and had the javascript detect which file type to use for the animation. While I was pleased with how this effect turned out, it ended up becoming a rather huge annoyance when I wanted to update the content later—it's a pain to generate, optimize, and update the image sequence each time.</p>

</section>
<section>
  <p>And finally, as for the rest of the content on this site I went with a basic feature card approach, sometimes called a "bento box" layout; particularly when varying card sizes are used. This is a layout that I've grown to like a bit less over the years as it has become very common.</p>

    <p><small><strong>Video:</strong> New Stocketa site</small>
  </p></div>
  <p>A year later, it was time for another redesign. Stocketa had more functionality, and a lot more refinements. I had more to share, and I had grown tired of the 3D phone frame interaction. It was neat but it was just there for show; it wasn't the best way to show off parts of the app as it scrolled off screen. It was also a pain to update the frame sequences. I essentially just wanted to take screenshots of the real app from the iOS simulator and upload them.</p>

  <p>Separately, I didn't want a super long page with a lot of repetitive modules and screenshots. I wanted a skimmable feature list. I began to wonder if I could get away with just a single phone frame on the site that showed everything.</p>

  <p>I eventually landed on a two pane approach: the device frame was always in view, fixed on the right side, while the scrollable left side contained the feature list. The trade-off with this design was that it would require hovering over each feature item to be able to update the screenshot shown in the device frame. I figured an interesting compromise to that would be having the phones stack up and away on scroll. Almost like the old Apple Time Machine backup UI.</p>

  <p>I built several versions of this and found that it didn't feel great. There wasn't much scroll distance so if you scrolled at a normal or fast pace, you'd see a bunch of phones flicker by you as the animations tried to keep up. It was too busy and hectic, not to mention a lot of state management to deal with jumping between your current scroll-based position screenshot to a hover-based screenshot if you hovered over a feature list item. I ended up simplifying a bit and only having the scroll-based UI manage just a few states: the intro phone frame, the first feature screenshot, and then a final animation at the bottom of the page.</p>

    <p><small>The website's mobile layout uses a carousel of screenshots in the header.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>After sorting out the core interactions, I had to figure out how to deal with mobile and tablet interactions. The fix two-pane layout made this a bit of a challenge. I ended up turning the header into a carousel of device frames you could scroll through.</p>

  <p>And then finally, I added a few small bits of polish ✨:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Hero title text gradient changes based on scroll</p></li>
    <li><p>The icon accent color and background circle color change based on scroll</p></li>
    <li><p>When hovering over any feature list item, there is a subtle background color change created by an overlaid gradient. SVG-created noise/grain is also overlaid on top of the background.</p></li>
    <li><p>When hovering over any feature list item, or when you're reached the end of the page, there's a subtle icon particle emitter that floats up icons from the bottom. Each feature used a different icon for this.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <div>

    <p><small>Particle emitter effects: icons float up from the bottom, based on the feature list item being hovered on. There's also another very subtle emitter generating some tiny floating particles.</small>
  </p></div>

  <p>Overall I liked this design, but looking back at almost a year later, the gradient text and background colors feel a bit too much for my taste now.</p>


  <h5 id="api">API troubles</h5>
  <p>Eventually it became clear that the quality of financial data Stocketa relied on was not cutting it. The first provider I used, IEX, would sometimes have charts outdated, inaccurate prices (especially for less frequently traded assets on the IEX exchange), and lacked data for OTC markets (they required you sign a pricey license directly with OTC), as well as significantly limited data for Nasdaq-listed stocks (even basic things like pre-market and after-hours data). The last straw was when IEX dropped mutual fund data entirely, all without any advance notice.</p>
  
  <p>I later used another provider that allowed commercial use that didn't charge too much ($100/month) but I had even more problems with their data and reliability. Endpoints were even returning old and incorrect data, and even once alerted to issues, their team would not only ignore the bugs but claim they didn't exist. I couldn't ship Stocketa with unreliable financial data to people that would be paying me for a quality app.</p>
  
  <p>I also could not get certain types of data with paid APIs. I had to build a scraping engine on my backend that would visit a few sites to get the data I needed for less updated data like dividend yield, earnings dates, and even for OEF data (other providers would be more than a day delayed for this at times).</p>

  <p>Needless to say, this was all frustrating. It was a hassle, hard to maintain, and unreliable. At the same time, my backend continued getting more involved to deal with more and more of the intricacies of dealing with stocks. Things like dealing with companies merging or stock tickers renaming.</p>

It manages auth, caching, news, core business logic, cleaning up data, notifications, widgets, working with multiple API, and a bit of scraping. This was my first time doing anything of this size with node and typescript.</small>
  </section>

  <p>Starting out I thought getting access to a stock market data API would be the easy part. I quickly learned about the world of market data feeds, SIPs (Securities Information Processor), and vendor agreements.</p>

  <p>Quality market data exists, it's just not made for indie app developers. It's very expensive. Several leading U.S. market data providers have commercial use data pricing starting at $2,000 per month. And that's not for everything, if you need things like index data or options data, there's more charges ahead.</p>

  <p>I spoke with one of these providers last year, trying to get them to understand how small app developers need affordable commercial use data. They presented a startup-focused plan that they were pitching for $499/month in addition to a per-MAU fee. Even that I would still consider very expensive for my needs, and it seems like that may have fallen by the wayside and is no longer promoted on their website.</p>
    
  <p>I could spend months developing Stocketa, incurring that monthly API cost until I went live (or risk getting shutdown if I tried to use a cheaper non-commercial plan during the TestFlight phase) then not make enough money to cover costs on the App Store and have to shut it down shortly after anyways.</p>
  
  <p>Overall, it feels like no one in this cares to cater to the developer and startup crowd, or they believe there's not much money for them to pursue there. This was the same case with Plaid when I briefly looked into getting access to their investments API to automatically sync holdings data. They required some sort of minimum length contract.</p>
  
  <h5 id="stopping">Why I stopped working on Stocketa</h5>
  <p>When I started this project, I really began to wonder why where weren't any great indie apps focused on stocks like this. Just simple, well-designed apps to help the casual investor keep track of their investments. Well I think I was starting to get my answer: getting quality financial data, even just for the United States, is a nightmare. You can only get it if you have a lot of money to invest in your project. And good luck if you really want a great API with comprehensive international data.</p>
  
  <p>I can't help but draw parallels to what happened recently with the Twitter and Reddit APIs. The risk of running your project or business solely on top of another company's API, no matter how reliable you think they may be, is extremely high.</p>
  
  <p>Stocketa was always meant to be a side project—never a real business. For it to be a real business, I would need to keep adding functionality and introducing more ways to make money. I couldn't just have a simple and elegant little app tracking your stocks. It would have to do more, like dipping into financial advice services, or offering stock trading. That's a hyper-competitive space lined with massive companies. That would mean a busier, cluttered app. The exact reason why I started Stocketa was because of all those cluttered apps.</p>
  
  <p><strong>I decided to stop working on Stocketa for a few reasons:</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>Data:</strong> As mentioned above, all the expenses and challenges associated with acquiring reliable, affordable, and high-quality financial data that would make it feasible to release this as a reasonably priced subscription-based app.</p></li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Support:</strong> The associated investment in customer support. Based on how people were using my TestFlight, it was going to be a significant investment to keep up with support, emails, maintenance, and ongoing feature development. However, part of this was likely due to complexity incurred from having to fix or skirt around unreliable data. There were lots of things I wanted to keep improving and refining with the app and that wouldn't end any time soon.</p>
      <p>If I were to release and charge for Stocketa, I would feel especially on the hook to resolve issues in a timely manner and that's not something I can accomodate now because of the next point.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Time:</strong> And most importantly, I've found something more worthy of my complete focus and attention: <a href="https://rewind.ai/">Rewind AI</a>. I sunk a lot of nights and weekends into Stocketa over the years. It consumed every spare moment, even taking over my occasional time writing blog posts here when I had something to share. That was something I really missed. Now, I would much rather be focusing my creative thinking time on how I can improve and grow Rewind.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>I originally started working on Stocketa with one goal: to learn Swift and SwiftUI my way with a project that was interesting to me. At the time that was scratching my own itch of keeping track of my investments. While it turned into a much larger and unshipped project, I learned a ton about native iOS development and was able to push myself creatively.</p>

  <p>These days I'm happiest investing my design, product and development time into <a href="https://rewind.ai/">Rewind AI</a>, where my SwiftUI knowledge learned with Stocketa has been tremendously helpful.</p>

  <p id="footnote-1"><a href="#r1">1</a> I only had to go down to UIKit a few times. One time for things like custom text fields for more control over interactions, styling, text input, and formatting. Another to use a CollectionView for drag-to-reorder stocks. A third time for creating particle emitters in a few places, like confetti effects, as well as one area where I have some twinkling stars in a night illustration when the stock market is closed. And one last time to get more control over gestures. I needed to get a location when a long press <em>begins</em> and SwiftUI LongPressGesture() didn't provide that, so I used UILongPressGestureRecognizer instead.</p>

<h2>One of America's most corporate-crime-friendly bankruptcy judges forced to recuse himself (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/10/16/texas-two-step/#david-jones">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>"I’ll believe corporations are people when Texas executes one." The now-famous quip from Robert Reich cuts to the bone of corporate personhood. Corporations are people with speech rights. They are heat-shields that absorb liability on behalf of their owners and managers.</p>
<p>But the membrane separating corporations from people is selectively permeable. A corporation is separate from its owners, who are not liable for its deeds – but it can also be "closely held," and so inseparable from those owners that their religious beliefs can excuse their companies from obeying laws they don't like:</p>
<p><a href="https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2014/10/13/hobby-lobby-and-closely-held-corporations/">https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2014/10/13/hobby-lobby-and-closely-held-corporations/</a></p>
<p>Corporations – not their owners – are liable for their misdeeds (that's the "limited liability" in "limited liablity corporation"). But owners of a murderous company can hold their victims' families hostage and secure bankruptcies for their companies that wipe out their owners' culpability – without any requirement for the owners to surrender their billions to the people they killed and maimed:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/11/justice-delayed/#justice-redeemed</a></p>
<p>Corporations are, in other words, a kind of Schroedinger's Cat for impunity: when it helps the ruling class, corporations are inseparable from their owners; when that would hinder the rich and powerful, corporations are wholly distinct entities. They exist in a state of convenient superposition that collapses only when a plutocrat opens the box and decides what is inside it. Heads they win, tails we lose.</p>
<p>Key to corporate impunity is the rigged bankruptcy system. "Debts that can't be paid, won't be paid," so every successful civilization has some system for discharging debt, or it risks collapse:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/bankruptcy-protects-fake-people-brutalizes-real-ones/">https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/09/bankruptcy-protects-fake-people-brutalizes-real-ones/</a></p>
<p>When you or I declare bankruptcy, we have to give up virtually everything and endure years (or a lifetime) of punitive retaliation based on our stained credit records, and even then, our student debts continue to haunt us, as do lawless scumbag debt-collectors:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act">https://pluralistic.net/2023/08/12/do-not-pay/#fair-debt-collection-practices-act</a></p>
<p>When a giant corporation declares bankruptcy, by contrast, it emerges shorn of its union pension obligations and liabilities owed to workers and customers it abused or killed, and continues merrily on its way, re-offending at will. Big companies have mastered the Texas Two-Step, whereby a company creates a subsidiary that inherits all its liabilities, but not its assets. The liability-burdened company is declared bankrupt, and the company's sins are shriven at the bang of a judge's gavel:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit">https://pluralistic.net/2023/02/01/j-and-j-jk/#risible-gambit</a></p>
<p>Three US judges oversee the majority of large corporate bankruptcies, and they are so reliable in their deference to this scheme that an entire industry of high-priced lawyers exists solely to game the system to ensure that their clients end up before one of these judges. When the Sacklers were seeking to abscond with their billions in opioid blood-money and stiff their victims' families, they set their sights on Judge Robert Drain in the Southern District of New York:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/23/a-bankrupt-process/#sacklers">https://pluralistic.net/2021/05/23/a-bankrupt-process/#sacklers</a></p>
<p>To get in front of Drain, the Sacklers opened an office in White Plains, NY, then waited 192 days to file bankruptcy papers there (it takes six months to establish jurisdiction). Their papers including invisible metadata that identified the case as destined for Judge Drain's court, in a bid to trick the court's Case Management/Electronic Case Files system to assign the case to him.</p>
<p>The case was even pre-captioned "RDD" ("Robert D Drain"), to nudge clerks into getting their case into a friendly forum.</p>
<p>If the Sacklers hadn't opted for Judge Drain, they might have set their sights on the Houston courthouse presided over by Judge David Jones, the second of of the three most corporate-friendly large bankruptcy judges. Judge Jones is a Texas judge – as in "Texas Two-Step" – and he has a long history of allowing corporate murderers and thieves to escape with their fortunes intact and their victims penniless:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice">https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/07/hr-4193/#shoppers-choice</a></p>
<p>But David Jones's reign of error is now in limbo. It turns out that he was secretly romantically involved with Elizabeth Freeman, a leading Texas corporate bankruptcy lawyer who argues Texas Two-Step cases in front of her boyfriend, Judge David Jones.</p>
<p>Judge Jones doesn't deny that he and Freeman are romantically involved, but said that he didn't think this fact warranted disclosure – let alone recusal – because they aren't married and "he didn't benefit economically from her legal work." He said that he'd only have to disclose if the two owned communal property, but the deed for their house lists them as co-owners:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24032507-general-warranty-deed">https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24032507-general-warranty-deed</a></p>
<p>(Jones claims they don't live together – rather, he owns the house and pays the utility bills but lets Freeman live there.)</p>
<p>Even if they didn't own communal property, judges should not hear cases where one of the parties is represented by their long term romantic partner. I mean, that is a weird sentence to have to type, but I stand by it.</p>
<p>The case that led to the revelation and Jones's stepping away from his cases while the Fifth Circuit investigates is a ghastly – but typical – corporate murder trial. Corizon is a prison healthcare provider that killed prisoners with neglect, in the most cruel and awful ways imaginable. Their families sued, so Corizon budded off two new companies: YesCare got all the contracts and other assets, while Tehum Care Services got all the liabilities:</p>
<p><a href="https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/prominent-bankruptcy-judge-david-jones-033801325.html">https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/prominent-bankruptcy-judge-david-jones-033801325.html</a></p>
<p>Then, Tehum paid Freeman to tell her boyfriend, Judge Jones, to let it declare bankruptcy, leaving $173m for YesCare and allocating $37m for the victims suing Tehum. Corizon owes more than $1.2b, "including tens of millions of dollars in unpaid invoices and hundreds of malpractice suits filed by prisoners and their families who have alleged negligent care":</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kccllc.net/tehum/document/2390086230522000000000041">https://www.kccllc.net/tehum/document/2390086230522000000000041</a></p>
<p>Under the deal, if Corizon murdered your family member, you would get $5,000 in compensation. Corizon gets to continue operating, using that $173m to prolong its yearslong murder spree.</p>
<p>The revelation that Jones and Freeman are lovers has derailed this deal. Jones is under investigation and has recused himself from his cases. The US Trustee – who represents creditors in bankruptcy cases – has intervened to block the deal, calling Tehum "a barren estate, one that was stripped of all of its valuable assets as a result of the combination and divisional mergers that occurred prior to the bankruptcy filing."</p>
<p>This is the third high-profile sleazy corporate bankruptcy that had victory snatched from the jaws of defeat this year: there was Johnson and Johnson's attempt to escape from liability from tricking women into powdering their vulvas with asbestos (no, really), the Sacklers' attempt to abscond with billions after kicking off the opioid epidemic that's killed 800,000+ Americans and counting, and now this one.</p>
<p>This one might be the most consequential, though – it has the potential to eliminate <em>one third</em> of the major crime-enabling bankruptcy judges serving today.</p>
<p>One down.</p>
<p>Two to go.</p>

<p>When film director <a title="Innocence" href="https://randomwire.com/innocence">Mamoru Oshii</a> was looking for a model of the city of the future for his seminal 1995 animated film adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell">Ghost in the Shell</a> (based on the manga&nbsp;by <a title="Ghost in the Shell Live Action" href="https://randomwire.com/ghost-in-the-shell-live-action">Masamune Shirow</a>), he turned to the cityscape of Hong Kong for his&nbsp;inspiration. Actual spots in the city were recreated for use in this cinematic representation of a near-future city (set in 2029) characterised by decadence, anarchy, and fantastical high-tech hyper-reality. One <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_sc%C3%A8ne">mise-en-scène</a> in particular captures the essence of the city in beautiful, almost dreamlike, detail which intrigued me long before I had the chance to explore the real Hong Kong for myself:</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost in the shell the film" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wYVbQ-GQTxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>
<p>When asked why Hong Kong was&nbsp;chosen&nbsp;as the backdrop for the film&nbsp;Mamoru Oshii and his art designer, Takeuchi Atsushi, had the <a href="http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/80/wong80art.htm">following explanation</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>[Oshii]</strong> When I was in search of an image of the future, the first thing that came to my mind was an Asian city. At first I did not think it was possible to create a perfect cityscape for the future; and what was done in the past seems unconvincing to me now…. The only way, if one is to be true to the methodology of animation, is to use real streets as models, so I thought of Hong Kong. It is like the Los Angeles of <em><a title="10pm in Shenzhen" href="https://randomwire.com/10pm-in-shenzhen">Blade Runner</a></em>; what has been achieved in that city set will be of use to later films.</p></blockquote>
<div><figure><a href="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-01.png"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="706" src="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-01-640x706.png" alt="" title="Recreating 'Ghost in the Shell' in Hong Kong" srcset="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-01-640x706.png 640w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-01-620x684.png 620w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-01.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-mwl-img-id="6320"></a></figure></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>[Atsushi]</strong> <em>Ghost in the Shell </em>does not have a definite chosen set, but in terms of street scenes and general atmosphere, it is obvious that Hong Kong is the model. Such a choice has, of course, something to do with the theme: on the streets there flows an excess or a flood of information, along with everything this excess brings out. The modern city is swamped with billboards, neon lights and symbols…. As people live in this information deluge, the streets will have to be depicted accordingly as being flooded…. There is a sharp contrast between old streets and new ones on which skyscrapers are built. My feeling is that these two, originally very different, are now in a situation where one is invading the other. Maybe it is the tension or pressure that is brought about by so-called modernization! It’s a situation in which two entities are kept in a strange neighboring relationship. Perhaps it is what the future is.</p></blockquote>
<div><figure><a href="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-03.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="706" src="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-03-640x706.png" alt="" title="Recreating 'Ghost in the Shell' in Hong Kong" srcset="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-03-640x706.png 640w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-03-620x684.png 620w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-03.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-mwl-img-id="6322"></a></figure></div>
<blockquote><p><strong>[Atsushi]</strong> In the midst of the profusion of signs and the heat of the messy urban space, the streets are remarkably chaotic. Passers-by, shouts, cars, all kinds of mechanical noises and human “sound pollution,” all merging into one, forcing itself into humans’ central nervous systems through their ears. But why do people succumb to this “destructive” environment? Now that the artificial has replaced the natural, humans are like animals in the past, deprived of the characteristics of being human as a whole. Pulled directly into the whirlpool of information through the stimulation of visual and auditory senses, their feelings are henceforth numbed. On the other hand, countless mutually interfering and uncertain data pass through cables at light speed. This is the way informatics continues to expand its domain.</p></blockquote>
<div><figure><a href="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-09.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="640" height="706" src="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-09-640x706.png" alt="" title="Recreating 'Ghost in the Shell' in Hong Kong" srcset="https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-09-640x706.png 640w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-09-620x684.png 620w, https://randomwire.com/wp-content/uploads/gits-hk-09.png 720w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-mwl-img-id="6328"></a></figure></div>
<p>While the real Hong Kong may not be literally submerged&nbsp;in water (despite being surrounded by it), in nearly every other respect both the imagery and soulful mood depicted in the film mirror reality very closely – especially when contrasting the modern skyscrapers of <a title="Hong Kong Moments IV" href="https://randomwire.com/hong-kong-moments-iv">Central</a> with some of the older neighbourhoods in <a title="Sheung Wan" href="https://randomwire.com/sheung-wan">Sheung Wan</a> and <a title="One Night in Hong Kong" href="https://randomwire.com/one-night-in-hong-kong">Kowloon</a>. There is simply no other city like it.</p>

<p>After getting my <a title="Panasonic Lumix GF 2 Video Test" href="https://randomwire.com/panasonic-lumix-gf-2-video-test">new Lumix GF2</a>&nbsp;earlier in the year I went out on a number of evenings (spanning March – June 2011) to shoot various scenes of everyday life in Hong Kong (mostly around <a title="Tiny HK Hotels" href="https://randomwire.com/tiny-hk-hotels">Mong Kok</a>) and have tried to assemble them in as a simple homage to Ghost in the Shell. Bear in mind that I’m not a professional&nbsp;videographer but I hope it evokes a similar atmosphere…</p>
<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Ghost in Hong Kong" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/27110129?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe>
</p></figure>
<p>In many ways, I feel that the <a title="Future Living Inspired by Past Extremes" href="https://randomwire.com/future-living-inspired-by-past-extremes">intensity</a> of living in Hong Kong has a numbing effect on its residents who try to insulate themselves from both the physical and mental demands of a city where money rules and personal space comes at a high premium. It’s no wonder that young people here struggle to get a foothold on <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/hong-kong/2011/08/03/how-to-be-happy-in-hong-kong/?mod=wsj_share_twitter">happiness</a> despite economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Hong Kong is the ultimate abstraction whereby our lives are no longer dependant on mother nature but on artificial life-support systems which feed off mass-produced assemblies of raw materials processed out-of-sight and out-of-mind.&nbsp;As a vision or model of a future city, it’s both&nbsp;enthralling&nbsp;and frightening.</p>

<p dir="auto">Memory-GPT (or MemGPT in short) is a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in LLMs in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window. For example, MemGPT knows when to push critical information to a vector database and when to retrieve it later in the chat, enabling perpetual conversations. Learn more about MemGPT in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08560" rel="nofollow">paper</a>.</p>

    <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><div><p>Hey, HN! We're James and Cyriel, co-founders of Radical. We're making an autonomous solar-powered aircraft designed for continuous flight in the stratosphere. Our 20 ft. prototype recently flew nonstop for over 24 hours, which you can see in this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/E6oDxQYEksc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://youtu.be/E6oDxQYEksc</a>. Our website is at <a href="https://www.radicalaero.com/">https://www.radicalaero.com/</a>, but it's pretty bare. If you use LinkedIn, we have a few more posts at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/radicalaero" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://www.linkedin.com/company/radicalaero</a>.</p><p>Our aircraft is designed to fly over specific areas for months, carrying various payloads for tasks like imagery, sensing, and telecommunications. What we’re building behaves like a drone in some ways, and like a satellite in other ways. Much like satellites, we’re able to provide service for long periods of time, but we’re also much closer to users (we fly at around 20 km altitude) and able to maneuver or remain over an area of interest. This makes what we’re building really well suited to applications that require continuous coverage or high-resolution/bandwidth data.</p><p>Examples of this include continuous real-time monitoring (such as in wildfire management or illegal fishing), high-resolution mapping and imagery (we’re able to collect sub-10 cm resolution imagery), and high-speed direct-to-device internet. The ability to permanently host sensors and devices in the sky in this way opens the door to lots of new opportunities. In truth, we still don’t know all the new applications that will arise from this (we’re really interested to hear your thoughts on potential applications!).</p><p>As for the technical details: Our aircraft is battery electric and driven by propellers. It has a large wing for high aerodynamic efficiency and to generate the necessary lift required to fly in the thin air of the stratosphere. The wing is covered in solar cells, during the day, these power the aircraft and charge its batteries. Through the night, battery energy is deployed to continue flight. We repeat this process daily, enabling us to fly for up to a year without needing to land. Ultimately, battery cycle life is what limits our aircraft’s flight endurance - and we can land, carry out simple maintenance tasks and then re-launch to continue flying. Our aircraft has multiple tails which help to stabilize the ultra-lightweight structure (our 20 ft. prototype weighs just 13 lbs.). We also use these tails to control the aircraft, they provide roll control by twisting the main wing of the aircraft, increasing or decreasing lift as needed.</p><p>The aircraft is fully autonomous; it has a full autopilot system onboard and various sensors for position, airspeed, and other key data streams (much like a typical drone or UAS). The aircraft flies at high altitudes of around 70,000 ft. (20 km) avoiding cloud cover, civil air traffic, and the turbulent winds of the troposphere.</p><p>Long endurance flight has been the goal of many past projects. NASA’s Helios and the DARPA Vulture program tried to develop long endurance aircraft. Helios’s crash led to an overhaul of aircraft structural analysis codes, and DARPA Vulture led to advancements in battery and solar tech. More recently, both Facebook’s Aquila and Google’s Loon were discontinued. Recent advancements in battery and solar tech, and miniaturization of electronics mean long endurance flight is now feasible - but we are aware we need to do things differently to succeed. Unlike those before us, we’re not tying ourselves to a single application and are focused on bringing a cost-effective solution to market. That means avoiding research-grade components and moving quickly. Additionally, we firmly believe that iterating to a solution will allow us to continue making progress where others have stalled and lost momentum. We’ve seen this before in hard tech where companies like SpaceX and Helion Energy have made rapid progress against difficult problems.</p><p>We approach our technology with an iterative design philosophy - we’ll keep building and learning as we go. We use-off-the-shelf components, iterate quickly, and design for easy assembly to keep costs low. For example, from clean sheet to flight, we designed, built, and flew our 20 ft. aircraft in less than two months. After our first flights, we prepared our 24-hour-capable prototype in two weeks, which successfully completed its non-stop 24-hour flight on first launch. Having proved our core technologies at a smaller scale, we’re now moving onto bigger things. Our next goal is to fly a full-scale 110 ft. wingspan aircraft in the stratosphere next year!</p><p>Both of us have Masters degrees in Aerospace Engineering and we then spent 6 years working together on delivery drones at Amazon Prime Air. Whilst the application is very different - we’ve found our knowledge of drone and robotics hardware to be invaluable so far with Radical. By using readily available components, learning through iteration, and designing an aircraft that is easy to assemble, we can keep the cost of our aircraft low and address many markets that weren’t feasible before.</p><p>We’re really excited about the technology we’re developing, it's a challenging physics problem that pushes the boundaries of what is possible. Super excited to share this with you and to hear your thoughts and comments!</p></div></td></tr>        <tr></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td><form action="comment" method="post"></form></td></tr>  </tbody></table>

<p>A Goldman Sachs exec reportedly responded to the announcement of the <a href="https://9to5mac.com/guides/apple-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple Card</a> savings account by immediately declaring it a mistake.</p>



<p>According to the report, the unnamed Goldman partner said: “We should have never done this f—ing thing” … </p>



<h2 id="h-goldman-has-lost-big-on-the-apple-card">Goldman has lost big on the Apple Card</h2>



<p>Goldman has long been reported to regret the entire Apple Card partnership, after notching up <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/01/13/apple-card-billion-dollars-plus-loss/">more than a billion dollars in losses</a> by January of this year, and more recently <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/19/apple-card-contributes-667-million-loss-for-goldman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headed toward losing its second billion</a>.</p>



<p>The bank has historically made its money through serving the financial needs of corporations, financial institutions, and governments. Its move into consumer lending is a relatively recent development, and a massively unsuccessful one. Goldman has spent much of this year <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-ceo-says-firm-is-considering-strategic-alternatives-for-consumer-platforms-5775e5e9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to exit the consumer finance business</a>.</p>



<p>The bank sold most of its personal loans, along with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-passed-on-a-higher-offer-for-greensky-23f3699?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its main consumer lending business</a>, GreenSky – taking a big financial hit in the process.</p>



<p>It has for some time been trying to offload the Apple Card partnership, so far without success. It has reportedly <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/30/amex-apple-card-goldman-sachs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been in discussions with Amex</a> for some time, but it’s unclear why the card company would be interested in picking up a loss-making business. Amex also has a strong brand of its own, so is likely to kick back on an Apple branded product.</p>







<p>A new <em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/goldman-sachs-wants-out-of-consumer-lending-employees-say-it-cant-happen-fast-enough-17e98a30?mod=followamazon&amp;ns=prod/accounts-wsj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WSJ</a></em> report says that one exec was unimpressed by the bank deepening its relationship with Apple through the launch of an Apple Card savings account.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>When Goldman Sachs and Apple launched their joint savings account in April, Goldman held a town hall at its headquarters, where bank executives talked it up. One executive had a different message shortly afterward. “We should have never done this f—ing thing,” the Goldman partner told colleagues.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The likely reason for this is that the many millions of dollars in savings accounts make it much harder to Goldman to offload the Apple Card business – as that money will have been invested, and the bank would have to raise it in cash in order to hand over the deal to someone else.</p>



<h2 id="h-some-at-goldman-want-apple-to-lend-its-own-money">Some at Goldman want Apple to lend its own money</h2>




	<p>Another potential exit plan put forward by some within Goldman is that Apple could lend its own money in future.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Goldman employees working on the Apple partnership have floated other options, including letting Apple take over a bigger piece of the partnership, according to people familiar with the matter. For example, one idea proposed that Apple could become the lender for new credit-card spending and issuance, with Goldman continuing to manage the existing loans. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, that idea doesn’t seem to have gained any traction in either company, the report saying that it’s not under active consideration, and hasn’t been discussed at a senior level within either Goldman or Apple.</p>



<p>Adding to the bank’s headaches with the Apple Card is that it’s under investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for failing to promptly address errors and refund cardholders.</p>



<p>In what seems like something straight out of a farce, Goldman apparently blames Apple, as all cardholders get their bills on the same date, giving customer service reps a huge peak in workload. Why the bank agreed this arrangement in the first place – instead of the usual practice of having different dates for different customers, to even out the support requirement – is unclear, but points to another sign of the bank having too little experience in consumer lending to know what it is doing.</p>

That presents clear challenges for a personal coding help forum, as developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759101/stack-overflow-developers-survey-ai-coding-tools-moderators-strike">get comfortable with AI coding assistance</a> and the very tools that do that are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882605/github-copilot-chat-ai-chatbot-individuals">blended into products they use</a>. </p></div></div>]]></description>

Time was of the essence. The day was September 27, and they had only two days before they would have to pack up and hand over the site to Ivry Confluences, one of the largest urban development projects in Paris' inner suburbs (145 hectares), near the junction of the Seine and the Marne rivers on the territory of Ivry-sur-Seine (Paris region), which has been underway for over ten years. These archaeological excavations are being carried out on the orders of the French state.</p>          <p>What makes this latest campaign exceptional is the richness, density and quality of its finds. In recent years, 11 campaigns have been organized on several plots of land, three of them on the former site of the BHV department stores' warehouses, closed in 2012: In 2014, 2017, and this year from April to September.</p>               <p>According to INRAP archaeologist Fabrice Marti in charge of the dig, 2023 is shaping up to be a<strong> </strong>vintage year. "We came across portions of Middle Megalithic 1 walls, more specifically from the Cerny culture. A diagnosis usually enables us to more or less know what to expect, but this has been a very big surprise. We're inside a village. It's a first for this period. There's no equivalent." The Cerny, named after a town in Essonne (south of Paris), spread across much of northern France and especially the Paris basin from the second half of the fifth millennium BC. It was characterized by the construction of walls, the rearing of cattle, and the production of ceramics with round pots adorned with geometric motifs hallmarked in bands. It also marked the beginning of megalithism in France.</p>                                          <h2>5,500 artifacts discovered</h2>          <p>The first Ivry residents settled here around 4,200 BC. They built a wall, the full length of which has not been found, but it is estimated that several thousand large trees (around 30&nbsp;centimeters in diameter) had to be felled to erect it. Because the site was a wet meadow, the trees had to be brought in from another location – a monumental task.</p>          <p>Around 5,500 artifacts have been discovered, including shards of Cerny ceramics, flint, arrowheads, broken stone axes and two small pieces of jewelry made from elongated shells from the Atlantic Ocean... On the flip side, very few skeletal remains have been found. They were probably used to make glue or various objects, such as needles. This would imply that the meat they ate mainly came from livestock, with the overwhelming majority being beef and the remainder divided between mutton, goat and pork. As for game, which very much provided a<strong> </strong>minority of their meat supplies, it consisted of deer and wild boar.</p>            <p><strong>You have 59.63% of this article left to read.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article>
<p>Hi!  I'm <a href="http://was.tl/">Eric Wastl</a>. I make Advent of Code.  I hope you like it!  I also made <a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a>, <a href="http://phpsadness.com/">PHP Sadness</a>, and <a href="http://was.tl/projects/">lots of other things</a>.  You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/ericwastl">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@ericwastl" target="_blank">Mastodon</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/topaz">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p><em>Advent of Code</em> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar">Advent calendar</a> of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=advent+of+code">any</a> programming language you like. People use them as <a href="https://y3l2n.com/2018/05/09/interview-prep-advent-of-code/">interview</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/dznqbit/status/1037607793144938497">prep</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pgoultiaev/status/950805811583963137">company training</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/imhoffman/fa19b4-mat3006/wikis/home">university</a> <a href="https://gribblelab.org/teaching/scicomp2021/index.html">coursework</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrdanielklein/status/936267621468483584">practice</a> <a href="https://comp215.blogs.rice.edu/">problems</a>, a <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard">speed contest</a>, or to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/search?q=flair%3Aupping&amp;restrict_sr=on">challenge each other</a>.</p>
<p>You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/what_would_you_say_are_the_minimal_skills_for/dre0uu3/">problem solving skills</a> will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.</p>
<p>If you'd like to support Advent of Code, you can do so indirectly by helping to  it with others, or directly via <a href="https://adventofcode.com/support">PayPal or Coinbase</a>.</p>
<h2>--- General Tips ---</h2>
<p>If you get stuck, try your solution against the <em>examples</em> given in the puzzle; you should get the same answers.  If not, re-read the description.  Did you misunderstand something?  Is your program doing something you don't expect?  After the examples work, if your answer still isn't correct, <em>build some test cases</em> for which you can verify the answer by hand and see if those work with your program.  Make sure you have the entire puzzle input.  If you're still stuck, maybe <em>ask a friend</em> for help, or come back to the puzzle later.  You can also ask for hints in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<h2>--- Frequently Asked Questions ---</h2>
<p id="faq_codeselect"><em>Is there an easy way to select entire code blocks?</em> You should be able to triple-click code blocks to select them. You'll need JavaScript enabled. <code>You can test it out by triple-clicking this sentence.</code></p>
<p id="faq_auth"><em>How does authentication work?</em> Advent of Code uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth" target="_blank">OAuth</a> to confirm your identity through other services.  When you log in, you only ever give your credentials to that service - never to Advent of Code.  Then, the service you use tells the Advent of Code servers that you're really you.  In general, this reveals no information about you beyond what is already public; here are examples from <a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/reddit/about" target="_blank">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://api.github.com/users/octocat" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Advent of Code will remember your unique ID, names, URL, and image from the service you use to authenticate.</p>
<p id="faq_compete"><em>Should I compete on the global leaderboard?</em> Maybe. Solving puzzles is hard enough on its own, but competing for a spot on the global leaderboard also requires <a href="https://blog.vero.site/post/advent-leaderboard">many</a> <a href="https://kevinyap.ca/2019/12/going-fast-in-advent-of-code/">additional</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/mcpower/87427528b9ba5cac6f0c679370789661">skills</a> and a lot of practice. Depending on the puzzle, that day's leaderboard usually fills up anywhere between two minutes and an hour. If that sounds interesting, go for it! However, you should do Advent of Code in a way that is useful to you, and so it is completely fine to choose <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/e2wjhf/comment/f90ksek/">an approach that meets your goals</a> and ignore the leaderboard entirely.</p>
<p id="faq_difficulty"><em>Why was this puzzle so easy / hard?</em> The difficulty and subject matter varies throughout each event. Very generally, the puzzles get more difficult over time, but your specific skillset will make each puzzle significantly easier or harder for you than someone else. Making puzzles is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7idn6k/question_why_does_the_difficulty_vary_so_much/dqy08tk/">tricky</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_unlocktime"><em>Why do the puzzles unlock at midnight EST/UTC-5?</em> Because that's when I can consistently be available to make sure everything is working. I also have a family, a day job, and even need sleep occasionally. If you can't participate at midnight, that's not a problem; many people use <a href="https://adventofcode.com/leaderboard/private">private leaderboards</a> to compete with people in their area.</p>
<p id="faq_highcontrast"><em>I find the text on the site hard to read. Is there a high contrast mode?</em> There is a high contrast alternate stylesheet. Firefox supports these by default (View -&gt; Page Style -&gt; High Contrast).</p>
<p id="faq_puzzleideas"><em>I have a puzzle idea! Can I send it to you?</em> Please don't. Because of legal issues like copyright and attribution, I don't accept puzzle ideas, and I won't even read your email if it looks like one just in case I use parts of it by accident.</p>
<p id="faq_puzzlebugs"><em>Did I find a bug with a puzzle?</em> Once a puzzle has been out for even an hour, many people have already solved it; after that point, bugs are very unlikely. Start by asking on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/" target="_blank">subreddit</a>.</p>
<p id="faq_streaming"><em>Can I stream my solution?</em> Please try to avoid giving away the solution while people are competing. If a puzzle's global daily leaderboard isn't full yet and you're likely to get points, please wait to stream/post your solution until after that leaderboard is full. If you are unlikely to get points or the daily leaderboard is already full for the puzzle you're working on, streaming is fine.</p>
<p id="ai_leaderboard"><em>Can I use AI to get on the global leaderboard?</em> Please don't use AI / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="_blank">LLMs</a> (like GPT) to automatically solve a day's puzzles until that day's global leaderboards are full. By "automatically", I mean using AI to do most or all of the puzzle solving, like handing the puzzle text directly to an LLM. The leaderboards are for human competitors; if you want to compare the speed of your AI solver with others, please do so elsewhere. (If you want to use AI to <em>help</em> you solve puzzles, I can't really stop you, but I feel like it's harder to get better at programming if you ask an AI to do the programming for you.)</p>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 7.4.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/plus74.html">changelog</a> leading
to 7.4.

</p><ul>

<!--
<li>New/extended platforms:
  <ul>
  <li>...
  </ul>
-->

<li>Various kernel improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>On arm64, show BTI and SBSS features in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg.8">dmesg(8)</a>.
  </li><li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue1">kqueue1(2)</a>
      system call supporting the <code>O_CLOEXEC</code> flag.
  </li><li>Map device tree read/write to unbreak root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Correctly recognize <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/umass.4">umass(4)</a>
      floppy disk devices as floppy disks.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wscons.4">wscons(4)</a>,
	catch up with box drawing characters which have
	been standardized in unicode after the original wscons code was
	written and chose placeholder values.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wscons.4">wscons(4)</a>,
	make sure we do not increase the escape sequence argument count beyond
	usable bounds.
  </li><li>Implement <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/utrace.2">utrace(2)</a>
	support on amd64 and i386.
  </li><li>Correct undefined behavior when using MS-DOS filesystems, fixes imported from FreeBSD.
  </li><li>Make the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fstab.5">softdep</a>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a> option a no-op.
	Softdep was a significant impediment to improving the vfs layer.
  </li><li>Allow <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a>ed
	programs to dump <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/core.5">core(5)</a>
	into the current working directory.
  </li><li>Address incomplete validation of ELF program headers in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>.
  </li><li>On arm64, use the deep idle state available on Apple M1/M2 cores
	in the idle loop and for suspend, resulting in power savings.
  </li><li>Update AMD CPU microcode if a newer patch is available.
  </li><li>Enable a workaround for the 'Zenbleed' AMD CPU bug.
  </li><li>Report speculation control bits in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg.8">dmesg(8)</a> CPU lines.
  </li><li>To give the primary CPU an opportunity to perform clock interrupt
	preparation in a machine-independent manner we need to separate the
	"initialization" parts of cpu_initclocks() from the "start the clock
	interrupt" parts. Separate cpu_initclocks() from cpu_startclock().
  </li><li>Fix a problem where CPU time accounting and RLIMIT_CPU was
	unreliable on idle systems.
  </li><li>Improve the output of the "show proc" command of the kernel
	debugger <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> and show
	both the PID and TID of the proc.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>SMP Improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Rewrite <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a>,
	in particular to improve locking and to help with unlocking more
	of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> and with
	parallelisation of the network stack in the future.
	The protocol remains compatible with the older version.
  </li><li>Remove kernel locks from the ARP input path.
  </li><li>Pull MP-safe arprequest() out of kernel lock.
  </li><li>Remove the kernel lock from IPv6 neighbor discovery.

	stack.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Direct Rendering Manager and graphics drivers
  <ul>
  <li>Update <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">drm(4)</a>
      to Linux 6.1.55.
  </li><li>Don't change end marker in sg_set_page().  Caused bad memory accesses
      when using page flipping on Alder Lake and Raptor Lake.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>VMM/VMD improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> guests to 
	enable and use supervisor IBT.
  </li><li>Suppressed AMD hardware p-state visibility to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> guests. 
  </li><li>Avoid use of uninitialised memory in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>.
  </li><li>Migrate vmd_vm.vm_ttyname to char array allowing a vmd_vm
        object to be transmitted over an ipc channel.
  </li><li>Cleaned up file descriptor closing in
	 <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> vmm process.

  </li><li>No longer generate an error in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> if
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf.5">vm.conf(5)</a> is absent.
  </li><li>Split <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> into MI/MD
	parts.
  </li><li>Introduced multi-process model for 
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> virtio block and
	network devices.
  </li><li>Allowed vm owners to override boot kernel when using
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a> to start a
	vm.
  </li><li>Changed staggered start of vms to number of online CPUs.
  </li><li>Fixed a segfault on vm creation.
  </li><li>Switched to anonymous shared memory mappings for
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> vm processes,
	introducing a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a>.
  </li><li>Relaxed absolute path requirements for 
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> configtest mode (-n).

  </li><li>Changed to logging <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>
	vm ids in the vcpu run loop on error and not the ids used by
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Fixed a vm pause deadlock.
  </li><li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> logging format
	to disambiguate vm and device process by names and indices.
  </li><li>Fixed dynamically toggling verbose logging mode with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmctl.8">vmctl(8)</a>.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>
  <li>New ISO C11 header <code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code> declaring the
      types <code>char32_t</code> and <code>char16_t</code> and the
      functions <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/c32rtomb.3">c32rtomb(3)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mbrtoc32.3">mbrtoc32(3)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/c16rtomb.3">c16rtomb(3)</a>, and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mbrtoc16.3">mbrtoc16(3)</a>.
  </li><li>Introduce a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	option <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3#D">D</a>
	for memory leak detection with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ktrace.1">ktrace(1)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kdump.1">kdump(1)</a>.
  </li><li>Support <code>${.VARIABLES}</code> in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make.1">make(1)</a>,
      listing the names of all global variables that have been set.
  </li><li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kdump.1">kdump(1)</a>
      <code>-u</code> option to select
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/utrace.2">utrace(2)</a>
      tracepoints by label.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">openrsync(1)</a>,
      support the options <code>--size-only</code> and
      <code>--ignore-times</code>.
  </li><li>Update <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tzset.3">zoneinfo</a>
      to tzdata2023c.
  </li><li>Accept the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ucom.4">ucom(4)</a> fixed
      name format as a valid format for the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cu.1">cu(1)</a> -l option.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cron.8">cron(8)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a>,
	add support for random offsets when
	using ranges with a step value in cron.  This extends the random range
	syntax to support step values.  Instead of choosing a random number
	between the high and low values, the field is treated as a range with
	a random offset less than the step value.  This can be used to avoid
	thundering herd problems where multiple machines contact a server all
	at the same time via cron jobs.
  </li><li>Extend and improve the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ibuf_add.3">ibuf</a> API in libutil
	and add functions for more specific data types,
	for modifying data at specific
	offsets, for getting and setting the file descriptor stored on the ibuf
	and for efficient wrapping of ibufs into imsgs. The ibuf API is
	mostly used in network daemons.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl.8">wsconsctl(8)</a>,
	add button mappings for two- and three-finger clicks on clickpads.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Various bugfixes and tweaks in userland:
  <ul>
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pax.1">pax(1)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>,
      do not open files that will be skipped,
      speeding up archive creation when many files are skipped.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pax.1">pax(1)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>, and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cpio.1">cpio(1)</a> terminal
      output, escape non-printable characters in messages that may
      include file names, and truncate times to the correct maximum value.
  </li><li>Better diagnostics from
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make.1">make(1)</a>
      when a makefile exists but cannot be opened.
  </li><li>Prevent a buffer underflow in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
      that could occur with lines longer than 32kB.
  </li><li>Prevent a segmentation fault in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
      that occurred when a patch specified a file name so long that
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/basename.3">basename(3)</a> failed.
  </li><li>Prevent a read buffer overrun in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
      that could occur when a patch specified a file name ending in a slash.
  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/stat.1">stat(1)</a>
      correctly print mtimes after 2038.
  </li><li>Refactoring and documenting of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> code,
      to make it easier to maintain.
  </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
       no longer adds extra blanks at the end of lines, eliminating
       spurious line wrapping.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>,
      allow out-of-class defaulting of comparison operators,
	by ways of backporting an upstream commit.

  </li><li>Many changes in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg(1)</a>:
    <ul>
    <li>New command
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#set-tab-width">set-tab-width</a>
        to change the tabulator width on a per-buffer basis.
    </li><li>Let the <code>space-to-tabstop</code> command move to the right
        position even if the line contains tabs, control characters,
        or non-ASCII bytes.
    </li><li>Fall back to <code>/bin/sh</code> if <code>$SHELL</code> is undefined.
    </li><li>Fix parsing of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#TAGS">tag
        files</a> with duplicate entries.
        Instead of erroring out, ignore duplicates. Fixes using
        <code>/var/db/libc.tags</code> again.
    </li><li>Change the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#visit-tags-table">visit-tags-table</a> command to immediately
	load the tag file, and drop the lazy mechanics.
    </li><li>Do not leak memory in
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#pop-tag-mark">pop-tag-mark</a>
        if it fails to switch buffers.
    </li><li>Fix a read buffer overrun caused by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#u">-u</a> arguments
        longer than 1023 bytes.
    </li><li>Fix a write buffer overrun on the stack caused by

      regress tests to work on sparc64.
  </li><li>Fix <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
      initialization of CHS/LBA fields in an MBR, allowing machines with
      a BIOS that uses CHS to boot from disks &gt;8G.
  </li><li>Retire <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>
      -E expert mode.
  </li><li>When displaying GPT partition attributes
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> prefixes
      Microsoft partition attribute names with 'MS'.
  </li><li>In the absence of the 'disktype' command line parameter
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>
      always uses the current media type provided by the kernel.
  </li><li>Ensure <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> handles
      the case where a GPT partition name is not a valid C string.

      command <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/atactl.8#readattr">readattr</a>
      to succeed even for disks where <code>ATA_SMART_READ</code> and
      <code>ATA_SMART_THRESHOLD</code> revisions mismatch, as long as
      checksums are OK.

  </li><li>Remove broken special handling of <code>test -t</code> in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>.
  </li><li>The caching mechanism used by
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add.1">pkg_add(1)</a>
	to speed up <tt>pkg_add -u</tt> now also works if -stable packages
	are available.
  </li><li>Significantly increase the speed of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pkg-config.1">pkg-config(1)</a>.

  </li></ul>

</li><li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements and bugfixes:

      driver when userland attempts to inject frames via bpf in monitor mode.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Installer, upgrade and bootloader improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>In the arm64 ramdisk, simplify apple firmware copying to make it
	easier to add new firmware.
  </li><li>On armv7 and arm64, silence informational messages from
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dd.1">dd(1)</a>
	when zeroing a disk's first 1MB. Use character not block devices with
	dd(1) like on other architectures.
  </li><li>Refactor the code of md_installboot() on armv7 and arm64 to be
	more in line with other architectures.
  </li><li>Improve the dialogue of the installer without affecting
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/autoinstall.8">autoinstall(8)</a>
       files.
  </li><li>Enable <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ufshci.4">ufshci(4)</a>
      on arm64 install media.
  </li><li>On arm64 pine64 boards, stop writing pine64 firmware to disk.
  </li><li>When media has neither a GPT nor an MBR
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a>,
      assume OpenBSD occupies the entire disk starting at sector 0.
  </li><li>Attempt to not overflow the ramdisk when extracting firmware on
	Apple arm64 systems.
  </li><li>Add support for loading files from the EFI System Partition.
  </li><li>Fix a bug in the handling of SCSI drives in the bootloader on the luna88k architecture.
  </li><li>On luna88k, implement the chmod() signaling mechanism for
	<code>/bsd.upgrade</code> to prevent re-upgrade, like other
	architectures.


  </li><li>Support for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> disks in the
	installer was improved:
    <ul>
    <li>Make root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      installations boot out of the box on Raspberry Pis (arm64).
    </li><li>Support installations with root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      on arm64, tested on Pinebook Pro, Raspberry Pi 4b, and SolidRun CEX7.
    </li><li>On riscv64, enable softraid(4) in the ramdisk kernel and support
	installations with root on  
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
    </li><li>When installing on encrypted
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>, determine
	the disk for placing the root device automatically and make it default
	as it is the only legit choice.
    </li><li>Add arm64 to the list of architectures with support for guided disk
        encryption.
    </li><li>Retain existing EFI System partitions on systems with APFSISC
      partitions (arm64 Apple M1/M2) during installation with root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>.
    </li><li>Enable <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> in ramdisk
	on the powerpc64 architecture.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Enable indirect branch tracking (IBT) on amd64 and branch target
      identification (BTI) on arm64 in both the kernel and in userland.
      On hardware that supports this feature, it helps enforcing
      control flow integrity by making sure malicious code
      cannot jump into the middle of a function. 
  </li><li>On the arm64 architecture, enable pointer authentication (PAC)
      in userland on those machines where it works correctly.
      It helps enforcing control flow integrity by making sure
      malicious code cannot manipulate a function's return address.
  </li><li>Together with retguard these two features protect against ROP attacks.
      Compiler defaults for base clang, ports clang and ports gcc (as well
      as some other non-C language family compilers in ports) have been
      changed to enable these features by default.  As a result the vast
      majority of programs on OpenBSD (and all programs in the base system)
      run with these security features enabled.
  </li><li>Change <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
      chunk sizes to be fine grained: chunk sizes are closer to the
      requested allocation size.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>,
      check all chunks in the delayed free list for write-after-free.
  </li><li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/shutdown.8">shutdown(8)</a>
      program can now only be executed by members of the new
      <code>_shutdown</code> group.  The idea is that system
      administrators can now remove most users from the excessively
      powerful <code>operator</code> group, which in particular
      provides read access to disk device nodes.
  </li><li>Using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a>,
	restrict <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
	filesystem access to the current directory including subdirectories,
	TMPDIR, and file names given on the command line.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>, consistently
      escape control characters when displaying file name completions,
      even when there are multiple matches.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Changes in the network stack:
  <ul>
 <li>Sync the use of
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getuptime.9">getuptime(9)</a>
     in the Neighbour Discovery (ND) code with ARP.
 </li><li>In the IPv6 forwarding code, call
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getuptime.9">getuptime(9)</a>
     once for consistency with IPv4.
 </li><li>ARP has a queue of packets that should be sent after name
	resolution. Neighbor discovery (ND6) did only hold a single packet.
	Unified the code, added a queue to ND6 and made the code MP safe.
 </li><li>Implement a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a>
     <code>net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_queued</code> to show the number of packets
     waiting for an ND6 response, analogous to ARP.
 </li><li>When configuring a new IPv6 address on an interface, an upstream router
	doesn't know where to send traffic.  Send an unsolicited
	neighbor advertisement, as described in RFC9131, to the all-routers
	multicast address so all routers on the same link will learn the path
	back to the address.
 </li><li>Implement the inbound portion of RFC9131.  Let routers create new
	neighbor cache entries when receiving valid neighbor advertisements.

 </li><li>Initial support for TCP segmentation offload (TSO) and TCP large receive offload (LRO) was implemented:
   <ul>
   <li>If the driver of a network interface supports TSO,
	do not chop the packet in the network stack,
	but pass it down to the interface layer for TSO.
   </li><li>Provide a software TSO implementation, to be used as a fallback
	if network hardware does not support TSO.
   </li><li>Provide a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a>
	node <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2#tcp.tso">net.inet.tcp.tso</a> such that TSO can be globally disabled.
	By default, it is enabled on all interfaces supporting it.
   </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>,
	display separate
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#hwfeatures">hwfeatures</a>
	for TSOv4, TSOv6, and LRO and provide a
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#tcplro">-tcplro</a>
	parameter to disable LRO on a per-interface basis.
   </li><li>Enable TSO and forwarding of LRO packets via TSO in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a>.
   </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a>, allocate
	less memory for tx buffers.
   </li><li>Speed up TCP transfer on
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a>
	interfaces by using TSO and LRO.
   </li><li>Enable LRO per default in network
	drivers. LRO allows to receive aggregated packets larger than the MTU.
	Receiving TCP streams becomes much faster. Currently only <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a> devices support LRO, and
	ix(4) is limited to IPv4 and hardware newer than the old 82598 model.
   </li></ul>

 </li><li>The following changes were made to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:
   <ul>
   <li>Speed up the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a> request
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4#DIOCGETRULE">DIOCGETRULE</a>
	such that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>
	can retrieve all <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
	rules from the kernel in linear rather than in quadratic time.
	To protect the kernel from memory exhaustion,
	userland processes now have to release tickets obtained with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4#DIOCGETRULES">DIOCGETRULES</a>
	by issuing the new
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a> request
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4#DIOCXEND">DIOCXEND</a>.
	In particular, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>
	and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a>
	now do that.
   </li><li>Relax the implementation of the <code>pass all</code> rule so all
	forms of neighbor advertisements are allowed in either direction.
   </li><li>When redirecting locally generated IP packets to userland with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5#divert-packet">divert-packet</a> rules, the packets may have no checksum
	due to hardware offloading.  Calculate the checksum in that case.
   </li><li>Fix a bug where
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5#nat-to">nat-to</a>
	could fail to insert a state
	due to conflict on chosen source port number.
   </li><li>No longer ignore <code>keep state</code> and <code>nat-to</code>
	actions for unsolicited ICMP error responses. 
	Tighten the rule matching logic so ICMP error responses
	no longer match <code>keep state</code> rule.
	In typical scenarios, ICMP errors (if solicited) should match
	existing state.  The change is going to bite firewalls which deal
	with asymmetric routes. In those cases the <code>keep state</code>
	action should be relaxed to sloppy or new <code>no state</code>
	rule to explicitly match ICMP errors should be added.
   </li></ul>
 </li><li>Do not calculate IP, TCP, and UDP checksums on
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a> interfaces.
 </li><li>Convert the tcp_now() time counter to 64 bits to avoid 32 bits
	wrap around after changing tcp_now() ticks to milliseconds.
 </li><li>Add initial support for route-based IPsec VPNs.<br>
	Rather than use IPsec flows (aka, entries in the IPsec security
	policy database) to decide which traffic should be encapsulated in
	IPsec and sent to a peer, this changes security associations (SAs)
	so they can also refer to a tunnel interface. When traffic is routed
	over that tunnel interface, an IPsec SA is looked up and used to
	encapsulate traffic before being sent to the peer on the SA. When
	traffic is received from a peer using an interface SA, the specified
	interface is looked up and the packet is handed to it so it looks
	like packets come out of the tunnel.
 </li><li>Add <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a> to support
	route-based IPsec VPNs.
 </li><li>Introduce reference counting for TCP syn cache entries.
 </li><li>Have <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> copy the
	priority from the inner packet to the outer encrypted packet, so that
	higher priority packets are picked from hfsc queues for earlier
	transmission.
 </li></ul>

</li><li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
	<li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    support route-based
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a> tunnels.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    add support to verify X.509 chain from CERT payloads.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    do not leak memory when receiving a CERT payload for pubkey auth
	    or for an invalid CERT Encoding.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    do not leak a file descriptor if
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/open_memstream.3">open_memstream(3)</a> fails while trying to enable a child SA.

  </li></ul>

  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Add first version of flowspec support. Right now only announcement
	    of flowspec rules is possible.
	</li><li>Update ASPA support to follow draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-16

  </li></ul>

  </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw some changes:
  <ul>
	<li>A 30%-50% performance improvement was achieved through libcrypto's
	    partial chains certificate validation feature. Already validated
	    non-inheriting CA certificates are now marked as trusted roots. This
	    way it can be ensured that a leaf's delegated resources are properly
	    covered, and at the same time most validation paths are
	    significantly shortened.
	</li><li>Support for gzip and deflate HTTP Content-Encoding compression was
	    added. This allows web servers to send RRDP XML in compressed form,
	    saving around 50% of bandwidth.
	</li><li>ASPA support was updated to draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile-16.
	    As part of supporting AFI-agnostic ASPAs, the JSON syntax for
	    Validated ASPA Payloads changed in both filemode and normal output.
	</li><li>In filemode (-f option) the applicable manifests are now shown as
	    part of the signature path.
	</li><li>A new -P option was added to manually specify a moment in time
	    to use when parsing the validity window of certificates. Useful
	    for regression testing. Default is invocation time of rpki-client.
	</li><li>The -A option will now also exclude ASPA data from the JSON output.
	</li><li>The synchronisation protocol used to sync the repository is now
	    included in the OpenMetrics output.
	</li><li>Improved accounting by tracking objects both by repo and tal.
	</li><li>Check whether products listed on a manifest were issued by the same
	    authority as the manifest itself.
	</li><li>File modification timestamps of objects retrieved via RRDP are now
	    deterministically set to prepare the on-disk cache for seamless
	    failovers from RRDP to RSYNC.
	</li><li>Improved detection of RRDP session desynchronization: a check was
	    added to compare whether the delta hashes associated to previously
	    seen serials are different in newly fetched notification files.
	</li><li>Improved handling of RRDP deltas in which objects are published,
	    withdrawn, and published again.
	</li><li>Disallow X.509 v2 issuer and subject unique identifiers in certs.
	    RPKI CAs will never issue certificates with V2 unique identifiers.
	</li><li>A check to disallow duplicate X.509 certificate extensions was
	    added.
	</li><li>A check to disallow empty sets of IP Addresses or AS numbers in RFC
	    3779 extensions was added.
	</li><li>A warning is printed when the CMS signing-time attribute in a Signed
	    Object is missing.
	</li><li>Warnings about unrecoverable message digest mismatches now include
	    the manifestNumber to aid debugging the cause.
	</li><li>A check was added to disallow multiple RRDP publish elements for the
	    same file in RRDP snapshots. If this error condition is encountered,
	    the RRDP transfer is failed and the RP falls back to rsync.
	</li><li>A compliance check for the proper X.509 Certificate version and CRL
	    version was added.
	</li><li>A compliance check was added to ensure CMS Signed Objects contain
	    SignedData, in accordance to RFC 6488 section 3 checklist item 1a.
	</li><li>Compliance checks were added for the version, KeyUsage, and
	    ExtendedKeyUsage of EE certificates in Manifest, TAK, and GBR Signed
	    Objects.
	</li><li>A CMS signing-time value being after the X.509 notAfter timestamp
	    was downgraded from an error to a warning.
	</li><li>A bug was fixed in the handling of CA certificates which inherit IP
	    resources.
	</li><li>A compliance check was added to ensure the X.509 Subject only
	    contains commonName and optionally serialNumber.
	</li><li>A compliance check was added to ensure the CMS SignedData and
	    SignerInfo versions to be 3.
	</li><li>Fisher-Yates shuffle the order in which Manifest entries are
	    processed. Previously, work items were enqueued in the order the CA
	    intended them to appear on a Manifest. However, there is no obvious
	    benefit to third parties deciding the order in which things are
	    processed.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Swapped link-auth filter arguments to avoid ambiguities with user
	    names containing a "|" character.
	</li><li>Bumped <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd-filters.7">smtpd-filters(7)</a>
	    protocol version.
	</li><li>Fixed potential truncation of filtered data lines.
	</li><li>Allowed arguments on NOOP.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>Many other changes in various network programs and libraries:
  <ul>
	<li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pcap_fopen_offline.3">pcap_fopen_offline(3)</a> correctly interpret some
	      <code>LINKTYPE_*</code> values in pcap headers written
	      on foreign operating systems.
	  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>
	      use less deprecated LibreSSL API.

	  </li><li>Remove stylistic differences between
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arp.8">arp(8)</a> and
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a> delete()
		function.  This makes it easier to spot real changes in behavior.
	  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a>
	      not remove cloning routes when no neighbor entry is
		found with <code>ndp -d</code>.


	  </li><li>Improved error handling in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/asr_run.3">asr</a> resolver.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>,
		handle SERVFAIL results on name resolution better.
	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>,
		fix a use-after-free bug triggered by fatal write errors
		while sending TCP responses.

	  </li><li>In the router advertisement daemon
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rad.8">rad(8)</a>, update the default
		timers for prefix preferred and valid lifetimes to use the values from
		RFC 9096.
	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a>,
		remove artificial limit of 2 hours on a PIO lifetime.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>,
	      reduce memory usage when updating larger directories.
	  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>
		more resilient when some servers are
		misbehaving: keep trying LDAP servers until full results arrive
		rather than just until one accepts the TCP connection.

	  </li><li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#wgdescription">wgdescription</a> parameter to
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
	      to set a string describing the
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> peer.

	  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
	      prefix the interface name to many error and warning messages.

	  </li><li>Make the <code>tlsv1.0</code> and <code>tlsv1.1</code> options
		in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>
		do nothing, as one should use the default <code>tlsv1.2</code>
		instead.
	  </li><li>Fix IPv6 routes being changed by
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>
		with Routers configuration.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay6.8">dhcrelay6(8)</a>, do not
		ignore the AF_LINK entries of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/carp.4">carp(4)</a> interfaces.

	  </li><li>Improve the config parser of
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>
		to better handle
		comments, improve error messages and plug a memory leak.
	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>,
		add request or response decoration feature which is used through the
		radiusd module interface.  This makes additional modules can modify
		RADIUS request or response messages.  Also add new "radius_standard"
		module which uses this new feature, provides some generic features
		like "strip-atmark-realm" which removes the realm part from the
		User-Name attribute.

	  </li><li>Allow UDP for built-in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/inetd.8">inetd(8)</a> services on
		127.0.0.1. This restriction was added in year 2000 due to IPv6 compatible and
		mapped addresses.  Nowadays our kernel does not support these IPv6
		features and blocks localhost addresses on non-loopback interfaces.
		Make IPv4 127.0.0.1/8 and IPv6 ::1 behave identically and provide
		local services if configured.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd.8">spamd(8)</a>, log a
		dummy "<unknown>" IP address in the unlikely event that getnameinfo(3)
		fails.
  </unknown></li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>For passthrough, don't write to clients attached to different sessions.
  </li><li>Add a format to show if there are unseen changes while in a mode.
  </li><li>Discard mouse sequences that have the right form but actually
	are invalid.
  </li><li>Invalidate cached tty state after changing features since they may
	change what the terminal can do and need mouse sequences or similar to
	be sent again.
  </li><li>Add options to change the confirm key and default behaviour of
	confirm-before.
  </li><li>Add an option menu-selected-style to configure the currently
	selected menu item.
  </li><li>Add -c to run-shell to set working directory.
  </li><li>Add detach-on-destroy previous and next,
  </li><li>Set visited flag on last windows when linking session.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>LibreSSL version 3.8.2
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Disabled TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 in libssl so that they may no longer
      be selected for use.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_is_prime_ex.3">BN_is_prime_ex(3)</a>
      and BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex(3) refuse to check numbers larger than
      32 kbits for primality. This mitigates various DoS vectors.
    </li><li>Restricted the RFC 3779 code to IPv4 and IPv6. It was not written
      to be able to deal with anything else.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Portable changes
    <ul>
    <li>Extended the endian.h compat header with hto* and *toh macros.
    </li><li>Adapted more tests to the portable framework.
    </li><li>Internal tools are now statically linked.
    </li><li>Applications bundled as part of the LibreSSL package internally,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a>,
      now are linked statically if static libraries are built.
    </li><li>Internal compatibility function symbols are no longer exported from
      libcrypto. Instead, the libcompat library is linked to libcrypto,
      libssl, and libtls separately. This increases size a little, but
      ensures that the libraries are not exporting symbols to programs
      unintentionally.
    </li><li>Selective removal of CET implementation on platforms where it is
      not supported (macOS).
    </li><li>Integrated four more tests.
    </li><li>Added Windows ARM64 architecture to tested platforms.
    </li><li>Removed Solaris 10 support, fixed Solaris 11.
    </li><li>libtls no longer links statically to libcrypto / libssl unless
	    <code>--enable-libtls-only</code> is specified at configure time.
    </li><li>Improved Windows compatibility library, namely handling of files vs
      sockets, correcting an exception when operating on a closed socket.
    </li><li>CMake builds no longer hardcode <code>-O2</code> into the compiler flags,
      instead using flags from the CMake build type instead.
    </li><li>Set the CMake default build type to <code>Release</code>. This can be overridden
      during configuration.
    </li><li>Fixed broken ASM support with MinGW builds.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>Added support for
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_sha512_224.3">truncated SHA-2</a>
      and for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_sha3_224.3">SHA-3</a>.
    </li><li>The BPSW primality test performs additional Miller-Rabin rounds
      with random bases to reduce the likelihood of composites passing.
    </li><li>Allow testing of ciphers and digests using badly aligned buffers
      in openssl speed using -unalign.
    </li><li>Ed25519 certificates are now supported in openssl(1)
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1#ca">ca</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1#req">req</a>.
      Prepared Ed25519 support in libssl.
    </li><li>Add branch target information (BTI) support to amd64 and arm64
      assembly.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Compatibility changes
    <ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for a poorly thought-out change in OpenSSL 3 that
      broke privilege separation support in libtls.
    </li><li>Moved libtls from ECDSA_METHOD to EC_KEY_METHOD.
    </li><li>Removed GF2m support: BIGNUM no longer supports binary extension
      field arithmetic and all binary elliptic builtin curves were removed.
    </li><li>Removed dangerous, "fast" NIST prime and elliptic curve implementations.
      In particular, EC_GFp_nist_method() is no longer available.
    </li><li>Removed most public symbols that were deprecated in OpenSSL 0.9.8.
    </li><li>Removed the public X9.31 API (RSA_X931_PADDING is still available).
    </li><li>Removed Cipher Text Stealing mode.
    </li><li>Removed ENGINE support, including ECDH_METHOD and ECDSA_METHOD.
    </li><li>Removed COMP, DSO, dynamic loading of conf modules and support for
      custom ex_data and error stacks.
    </li><li>Removed proxy certificate (RFC 3820) support.
    </li><li>Removed SXNET and NETSCAPE_CERT_SEQUENCE support including the
      openssl(1) nseq command.
    </li><li>ENGINE support was removed and OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE is set. In spite
      of this, some stub functions are provided to avoid patching some
      applications that do not honor OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE.
    </li><li>The POLICY_TREE and its related structures and API were removed.
    </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_inherit.3">X509_VERIFY_PARAM_inherit(3)</a>, copy hostflags independently of the
      host list.
    </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index.3">CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index(3)</a> not return 0 to allow applications
      to use *_{get,set}_app_data() and *_{get,set}_ex_data() alongside
      each other.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID.3">X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_NAME_get_text_by_OBJ.3">X509_NAME_get_text_by_OBJ(3)</a> now only succeed if they contain
      valid UTF-8 without embedded NUL.
    </li><li>The explicitText user notice uses UTF8String instead of VisibleString
      to reduce the risk of emitting certificates with invalid DER-encoding.
    </li><li>Initial fixes for RSA-PSS support to make the TLSv1.3 stack more
      compliant with RFC 8446.
    </li><li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv_length.3">EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv_length(3)</a> to return what was set with
      EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IVLEN or one of its aliases.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Internal improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Improved sieve of Eratosthenes script used for generating a table
      of small primes.
    </li><li>Removed incomplete and dangerous BN_RECURSION code.
    </li><li>Imported RFC 5280 policy checking code from BoringSSL and used it
      to replace the old exponential time code.
    </li><li>Converted more of libcrypto to use CBB/CBS.
    </li><li>Started cleaning up and rewriting SHA internals.
    </li><li>Reduced the dependency of hash implementations on many layers of
      macros. This results in significant speedups since modern compilers
      are now less confused.
    </li><li>Improved BIGNUM internals and performance.
    </li><li>Significantly simplified the BN_BLINDING internals used in RSA.
    </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_num_bits.3">BN_num_bits(3)</a>
      independent of bn-&gt;top.
    </li><li>Rewrote and simplified bn_sqr().
    </li><li>Significantly improved Montgomery multiplication performance.
    </li><li>Rewrote and improved
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_exp.3">BN_exp(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_copy.3">BN_copy(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_item_sign_ctx.3">ASN1_item_sign_ctx(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_item_verify.3">ASN1_item_verify(3)</a> to work with
      Ed25519 and fixed a few bugs in there.
    </li><li>Lots of cleanup for DH, DSA, EC, RSA internals.  Plugged numerous
      memory leaks, fixed logic errors and inconsistencies.
    </li><li>Cleaned up and simplified various ECDH and ECDSA internals.
    </li><li>Removed EC_GROUP precomp machinery.
    </li><li>Fixed various issues with
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_PKEY_CTX_new.3">EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(3)</a> and EVP_PKEY_CTX_dup(3).

    </li><li>Improved X.509 certificate version checks.
    </li><li>Ensure no X.509v3 extensions appear more than once in certificates.
    </li><li>Replaced ASN1_bn_print with a cleaner internal implementation.
    </li><li>Fix OPENSSL_cpuid_setup() invocations on arm/aarch64.
    </li><li>Improved checks for commonName in libtls.
    </li><li>Fixed error check for
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_get_ext_d2i.3">X509_get_ext_d2i(3)</a> failure in libtls.
    </li><li>Removed code guarded by #ifdef ZLIB.
    </li><li>Plug a potential memory leak in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_TIME_normalize.3">ASN1_TIME_normalize(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Fixed a use of uninitialized in i2r_IPAddrBlocks().
    </li><li>Rewrote <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/CMS_SignerInfo_sign.3">CMS_SignerInfo_sign(3)</a> and CMS_SignerInfo_verify(3).
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Bug fixes

    </li><li>Fixed aliasing issue in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_mod_inverse.3">BN_mod_inverse(3)</a>.  Disallowed aliasing of result
      and modulus in various BN_mod_* functions.
    </li><li>Fixed detection of extended operations (XOP) on AMD hardware.
    </li><li>Ensure Montgomery exponentiation is used for the initial RSA blinding.
    </li><li>Policy is always checked in X509 validation. Critical policy extensions

    </li><li>On socket errors in the poll loop, netcat could issue system calls
      on invalidated file descriptors.
    </li><li>Allow IP addresses to be specified in a URI.
    </li><li>Fixed a copy-paste error in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_TIME_compare.3">ASN1_TIME_compare(3)</a> that could lead to two UTCTimes
      or two GeneralizedTimes incorrectly being compared as equal.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Documentation improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Improved documentation of BIO_ctrl(3), BIO_set_info_callback(3),
      BIO_get_info_callback(3), BIO_method_type(3), and BIO_method_name(3).
    </li><li>Marked BIO_CB_return(), BIO_cb_pre(), and BIO_cb_post() as intentionally
      undocumented.
    </li><li>Made it very explicit that the verify callback should not be used.
    </li><li>Called out that the CRL lastUpdate is standardized as thisUpdate.
    </li><li>Documented the RFC 3779 API and its shortcomings.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Testing and Proactive Security
    <ul>
    <li>Significantly improved test coverage of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_mod_sqrt.3">BN_mod_sqrt(3)</a>
      and GCD.
    </li><li>As always, new test coverage is added as bugs are fixed and subsystems
      are cleaned up.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li>OpenSSH 9.5 and OpenSSH 9.4
  <ul>
  <li>Potentially incompatible changes
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
        are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
        specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
        (January 2014).
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
        subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
        configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
        (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>:
        PKCS#11 modules must now be specified by their full
        paths. Previously dlopen(3) could search for them in system
        library directories.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>New features
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
        to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
        fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
        amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes for
        a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
        controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
        a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
        implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the "local
        extensions" number space and are advertised using a "ping@openssh.com"
        ext-info message with a string version number of "0".
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        allow override of Subsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        allow forwarding Unix Domain sockets via ssh -W.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        add support for configuration tags to ssh(1).
        This adds a ssh_config(5) "Tag" directive and corresponding
        "Match tag" predicate that may be used to select blocks of
        configuration similar to the pf.conf(5) keywords of the same
        name.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
         add a "match localnetwork" predicate. This allows matching
         on the addresses of available network interfaces and may be used to
         vary the effective client configuration based on network location.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        infrastructure support for KRL
        extensions.  This defines wire formats for optional KRL extensions
        and implements parsing of the new submessages. No actual extensions
        are supported at this point.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand and AuthorizedKeysCommand now
        accept two additional %-expansion sequences: %D which expands to
        the routing domain of the connected session and %C which expands
        to the addresses and port numbers for the source and destination
        of the connection.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        increase the default work factor (rounds) for the
        bcrypt KDF used to derive symmetric encryption keys for passphrase
        protected key files by 50%.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>:
        fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
        directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
        the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
        sshsig signature files.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
        originally requested a tty.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
        and don't delay at all for the "none" authentication mechanism.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
        verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
        get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
        to be sent less frequently than configured.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>:
        improve isolation between loaded PKCS#11 modules
        by running separate ssh-pkcs11-helpers for each loaded provider.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        make -f (fork after authentication) work correctly with
        multiplexed connections, including ControlPersist.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        make ConnectTimeout apply to multiplexing sockets and not
        just to network connections.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        improve defences against invalid PKCS#11
        modules being loaded by checking that the requested module
        contains the required symbol before loading it.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        fix AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand when AuthorizedKeysCommand
        appears before it in sshd_config. Since OpenSSH 8.7 the
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand directive was incorrectly ignored in
        this situation.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        remove vestigial support for KRL
        signatures When the KRL format was originally defined, it included
        support for signing of KRL objects. However, the code to sign KRLs
        and verify KRL signatures was never completed in OpenSSH. This
        release removes the partially-implemented code to verify KRLs.
        All OpenSSH tools now ignore KRL_SECTION_SIGNATURE sections in
        KRL files.
     </li><li>All: fix a number of memory leaks and unreachable/harmless integer
        overflows.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        don't truncate strings logged from PKCS#11 modules
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        better validate CASignatureAlgorithms in
        ssh_config and sshd_config. Previously this directive would accept
        certificate algorithm names, but these were unusable in practice as
        OpenSSH does not support CA chains.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        make <code>ssh -Q CASignatureAlgorithms</code> only list signature
        algorithms that are valid for CA signing. Previous behaviour was
        to list all signing algorithms, including certificate algorithms.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1">ssh-keyscan(1)</a>:
        gracefully handle systems where rlimits or the
        maximum number of open files is larger than INT_MAX
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        fix "no comment" not showing on when running
        <code>ssh-keygen -l</code> on multiple keys where one has a comment
        and other following keys do not.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>:
        adjust ftruncate() logic to handle servers that
        reorder requests. Previously, if the server reordered requests then
        the resultant file would be erroneously truncated.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        don't incorrectly disable hostname canonicalization when
        CanonicalizeHostname=yes and ProxyJump was explicitly set to
        "none".
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>:
        when copying local to remote, check that the source file
        exists before opening an SFTP connection to the server.

INSTALL.* file as listed above!

</p><h3>OpenBSD/alpha:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install74.iso</i> or
<i>cd74.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
Refer to INSTALL.alpha for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/amd64:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install74.iso</i> or
<i>cd74.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

</p><p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install74.img</i> or
<i>miniroot74.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

</p><p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in the included
INSTALL.amd64 document.

</p><p>
If you are planning to dual boot OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.amd64.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/arm64:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a disk and boot from it
after connecting to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.arm64 for more
details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/armv7:</h3>

<p>
Write a system specific miniroot to an SD card and boot from it after connecting
to the serial console.  Refer to INSTALL.armv7 for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/hppa:</h3>

<p>
Boot over the network by following the instructions in INSTALL.hppa or the
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/hppa.html#install">hppa platform page</a>.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/i386:</h3>

<p>
If your machine can boot from CD, you can write <i>install74.iso</i> or
<i>cd74.iso</i> to a CD and boot from it.
You may need to adjust your BIOS options first.

</p><p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install74.img</i> or
<i>miniroot74.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

</p><p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

</p><p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, and power on your machine
while holding down the <i>C</i> key until the display turns on and
shows <i>OpenBSD/macppc boot</i>.

</p><p>
Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.4/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

</p><h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

</p><p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy74.img</i> or <i>floppyB74.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

</p><p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

</p><p>
You can also write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

</p><p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
</p><p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_4</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
</p><p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.4 release will be made available if problems arise.
</p><p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.

<h3>What's New</h3>
<p>
This is a partial list of new features and systems included in OpenBSD 7.4.
For a comprehensive list, see the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/plus74.html">changelog</a> leading
to 7.4.

</p><ul>

<!--
<li>New/extended platforms:
  <ul>
  <li>...
  </ul>
-->

<li>Various kernel improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>On arm64, show BTI and SBSS features in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg.8">dmesg(8)</a>.
  </li><li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kqueue1">kqueue1(2)</a>
      system call supporting the <code>O_CLOEXEC</code> flag.
  </li><li>Map device tree read/write to unbreak root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Correctly recognize <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/umass.4">umass(4)</a>
      floppy disk devices as floppy disks.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wscons.4">wscons(4)</a>,
	catch up with box drawing characters which have
	been standardized in unicode after the original wscons code was
	written and chose placeholder values.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wscons.4">wscons(4)</a>,
	make sure we do not increase the escape sequence argument count beyond
	usable bounds.
  </li><li>Implement <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dt.4">dt(4)</a>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/utrace.2">utrace(2)</a>
	support on amd64 and i386.
  </li><li>Correct undefined behavior when using MS-DOS filesystems, fixes imported from FreeBSD.
  </li><li>Make the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fstab.5">softdep</a>
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mount.8">mount(8)</a> option a no-op.
	Softdep was a significant impediment to improving the vfs layer.
  </li><li>Allow <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a>ed
	programs to dump <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/core.5">core(5)</a>
	into the current working directory.
  </li><li>Address incomplete validation of ELF program headers in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/execve.2">execve(2)</a>.
  </li><li>On arm64, use the deep idle state available on Apple M1/M2 cores
	in the idle loop and for suspend, resulting in power savings.
  </li><li>Update AMD CPU microcode if a newer patch is available.
  </li><li>Enable a workaround for the 'Zenbleed' AMD CPU bug.
  </li><li>Report speculation control bits in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dmesg.8">dmesg(8)</a> CPU lines.
  </li><li>To give the primary CPU an opportunity to perform clock interrupt
	preparation in a machine-independent manner we need to separate the
	"initialization" parts of cpu_initclocks() from the "start the clock
	interrupt" parts. Separate cpu_initclocks() from cpu_startclock().
  </li><li>Fix a problem where CPU time accounting and RLIMIT_CPU was
	unreliable on idle systems.
  </li><li>Improve the output of the "show proc" command of the kernel
	debugger <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ddb.4">ddb(4)</a> and show
	both the PID and TID of the proc.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>SMP Improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Rewrite <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfsync.4">pfsync(4)</a>,
	in particular to improve locking and to help with unlocking more
	of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> and with
	parallelisation of the network stack in the future.
	The protocol remains compatible with the older version.
  </li><li>Remove kernel locks from the ARP input path.
  </li><li>Pull MP-safe arprequest() out of kernel lock.
  </li><li>Remove the kernel lock from IPv6 neighbor discovery.

</li><li>Direct Rendering Manager and graphics drivers
  <ul>
  <li>Update <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/drm.4">drm(4)</a>
      to Linux 6.1.55.
  </li><li>Don't change end marker in sg_set_page().  Caused bad memory accesses
      when using page flipping on Alder Lake and Raptor Lake.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>VMM/VMD improvements
  <ul>
  <li>Allowed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> guests to 
	enable and use supervisor IBT.
  </li><li>Suppressed AMD hardware p-state visibility to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> guests. 
  </li><li>Avoid use of uninitialised memory in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a>.
  </li><li>Migrate vmd_vm.vm_ttyname to char array allowing a vmd_vm
        object to be transmitted over an ipc channel.
  </li><li>Cleaned up file descriptor closing in
	 <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> vmm process.

      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vm.conf.5">vm.conf(5)</a> is absent.
  </li><li>Split <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmm.4">vmm(4)</a> into MI/MD
	parts.
  </li><li>Introduced multi-process model for 
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/vmd.8">vmd(8)</a> virtio block and
	network devices.
  </li><li>Allowed vm owners to override boot kernel when using

  </li></ul>

</li><li>Various new userland features:
  <ul>
  <li>New ISO C11 header <code>&lt;uchar.h&gt;</code> declaring the
      types <code>char32_t</code> and <code>char16_t</code> and the
      functions <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/c32rtomb.3">c32rtomb(3)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mbrtoc32.3">mbrtoc32(3)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/c16rtomb.3">c16rtomb(3)</a>, and

  </li><li>Introduce a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
	option <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3#D">D</a>
	for memory leak detection with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ktrace.1">ktrace(1)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kdump.1">kdump(1)</a>.
  </li><li>Support <code>${.VARIABLES}</code> in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make.1">make(1)</a>,
      listing the names of all global variables that have been set.
  </li><li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/kdump.1">kdump(1)</a>
      <code>-u</code> option to select
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/utrace.2">utrace(2)</a>
      tracepoints by label.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openrsync.1">openrsync(1)</a>,
      support the options <code>--size-only</code> and
      <code>--ignore-times</code>.
  </li><li>Update <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tzset.3">zoneinfo</a>
      to tzdata2023c.
  </li><li>Accept the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ucom.4">ucom(4)</a> fixed
      name format as a valid format for the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cu.1">cu(1)</a> -l option.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cron.8">cron(8)</a> and
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/crontab.5">crontab(5)</a>,
	add support for random offsets when
	using ranges with a step value in cron.  This extends the random range
	syntax to support step values.  Instead of choosing a random number
	between the high and low values, the field is treated as a range with
	a random offset less than the step value.  This can be used to avoid
	thundering herd problems where multiple machines contact a server all
	at the same time via cron jobs.
  </li><li>Extend and improve the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ibuf_add.3">ibuf</a> API in libutil
	and add functions for more specific data types,
	for modifying data at specific
	offsets, for getting and setting the file descriptor stored on the ibuf
	and for efficient wrapping of ibufs into imsgs. The ibuf API is
	mostly used in network daemons.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wsconsctl.8">wsconsctl(8)</a>,
	add button mappings for two- and three-finger clicks on clickpads.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Various bugfixes and tweaks in userland:
  <ul>
  <li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pax.1">pax(1)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>,
      do not open files that will be skipped,
      speeding up archive creation when many files are skipped.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pax.1">pax(1)</a>,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tar.1">tar(1)</a>, and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/cpio.1">cpio(1)</a> terminal
      output, escape non-printable characters in messages that may
      include file names, and truncate times to the correct maximum value.
  </li><li>Better diagnostics from
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/make.1">make(1)</a>
      when a makefile exists but cannot be opened.
  </li><li>Prevent a buffer underflow in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
      that could occur with lines longer than 32kB.
  </li><li>Prevent a segmentation fault in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
      that occurred when a patch specified a file name so long that
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/basename.3">basename(3)</a> failed.
  </li><li>Prevent a read buffer overrun in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
      that could occur when a patch specified a file name ending in a slash.
  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/stat.1">stat(1)</a>
      correctly print mtimes after 2038.
  </li><li>Refactoring and documenting of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> code,
      to make it easier to maintain.
  </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
       no longer adds extra blanks at the end of lines, eliminating
       spurious line wrapping.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/clang.1">clang(1)</a>,
      allow out-of-class defaulting of comparison operators,
	by ways of backporting an upstream commit.

  </li><li>Many changes in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1">mg(1)</a>:
    <ul>
    <li>New command
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#set-tab-width">set-tab-width</a>
        to change the tabulator width on a per-buffer basis.
    </li><li>Let the <code>space-to-tabstop</code> command move to the right
        position even if the line contains tabs, control characters,
        or non-ASCII bytes.
    </li><li>Fall back to <code>/bin/sh</code> if <code>$SHELL</code> is undefined.
    </li><li>Fix parsing of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#TAGS">tag
        files</a> with duplicate entries.
        Instead of erroring out, ignore duplicates. Fixes using
        <code>/var/db/libc.tags</code> again.
    </li><li>Change the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#visit-tags-table">visit-tags-table</a> command to immediately
	load the tag file, and drop the lazy mechanics.
    </li><li>Do not leak memory in
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#pop-tag-mark">pop-tag-mark</a>
        if it fails to switch buffers.
    </li><li>Fix a read buffer overrun caused by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#u">-u</a> arguments
        longer than 1023 bytes.
    </li><li>Fix a write buffer overrun on the stack caused by
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#blink-and-insert">blink-and-insert</a> matching a very long line
        that is not currently visible in the window.
    </li><li>Skip checking permissions of conffile with
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/access.2">access(2)</a>.
    </li><li>Resurrect
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#no-tab-mode">no-tab-mode</a>
	and add it to the list of modes that can
	be set with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/mg.1#set-default-mode">set-default-mode</a>.
    </li></ul>

  </li><li>Fix a segfault when the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>
	    simple editor encounters an incomplete partition line.
  </li><li>Fix <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>
      handling of templates with partitions after a "N-* 100" entry.

      regress tests to work on sparc64.
  </li><li>Fix <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a>
      initialization of CHS/LBA fields in an MBR, allowing machines with
      a BIOS that uses CHS to boot from disks &gt;8G.
  </li><li>Retire <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>
      -E expert mode.
  </li><li>When displaying GPT partition attributes
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> prefixes
      Microsoft partition attribute names with 'MS'.
  </li><li>In the absence of the 'disktype' command line parameter
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/disklabel.8">disklabel(8)</a>
      always uses the current media type provided by the kernel.
  </li><li>Ensure <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/fdisk.8">fdisk(8)</a> handles
      the case where a GPT partition name is not a valid C string.

  </li><li>When creating new crypto volumes with
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a>,
      by default use a hardware based number of KDF rounds for passphrases.
  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a>
      gracefully prompt again during interactive creation and
      passphrase change on CRYPTO and 1C volumes.
  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bioctl.8">bioctl(8)</a>
      read passphrases without prompts or confirmation
      in <code>-s</code> mode, allowing non-interactive use.

  </li><li>Allow the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/atactl.8">atactl(8)</a>
      command <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/atactl.8#readattr">readattr</a>
      to succeed even for disks where <code>ATA_SMART_READ</code> and
      <code>ATA_SMART_THRESHOLD</code> revisions mismatch, as long as
      checksums are OK.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so(1)</a>, treat
	symlinks in $ORIGIN determination the same way as other OS linkers do.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ld.so.1">ld.so(1)</a>,
	avoid an overflow in the ELF SYSV ABI hash function.
  </li><li>Make sure <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/modf.3">modf(3)</a> and

  </li><li>Add support for JH7110 to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dwmmc.4">dwmmc(4)</a>,
	making eMMC and microSD mostly work on the Starfive VisionFive 2.
  </li><li>Add support for the RK3588 PCIe3 PHY to

	The PHY controls 4 lanes that can be routed to 4 of 5 PCIe controllers.
  </li><li>Add mute control to
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sncodec.4">sncodec(4)</a>.
	This makes the mute button work on laptops using this driver.

	the mute button on laptops that use tascodec(4) work.
  </li><li>Improve the suspend/resume behavior of several drivers, reducing
	power consumption during suspend.
  </li><li>Add support for the Synopsys DesignWare I2C controller

      a driver for WangXun WX1860 PCI Express 10/100/1Gb Ethernet devices.
      Also support it on amd64 install media.
  </li><li>Add support for the RTL8211F-VD PHY in

  </li><li>Add initial support for Atlantic 2 hardware in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/aq.4">aq(4)</a>.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Added or improved wireless network drivers:
  <ul>
  <li>Improve how Quectel LTE&amp;5G devices attach to
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/umb.4">umb(4)</a>.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>IEEE 802.11 wireless stack improvements and bugfixes:
  <ul>
  <li> Add support for RTL8188FTV devices to the
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/urtwn.4">urtwn(4)</a> driver.
  </li><li>Attach Intel wireless devices with PCI product ID 0x51f1 to
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a>.
  </li><li>Fix a bug where <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwx.4">iwx(4)</a> background
      scan tasks were added to the wrong task queue.
  </li><li>Fix a firmware error that occurred when an

  </li><li>Fix a crash in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iwm.4">iwm(4)</a>
      driver when userland attempts to inject frames via bpf in monitor mode.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Installer, upgrade and bootloader improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>In the arm64 ramdisk, simplify apple firmware copying to make it
	easier to add new firmware.
  </li><li>On armv7 and arm64, silence informational messages from
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dd.1">dd(1)</a>
	when zeroing a disk's first 1MB. Use character not block devices with
	dd(1) like on other architectures.
  </li><li>Refactor the code of md_installboot() on armv7 and arm64 to be
	more in line with other architectures.
  </li><li>Improve the dialogue of the installer without affecting
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/autoinstall.8">autoinstall(8)</a>
       files.
  </li><li>Enable <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ufshci.4">ufshci(4)</a>
      on arm64 install media.
  </li><li>On arm64 pine64 boards, stop writing pine64 firmware to disk.
  </li><li>When media has neither a GPT nor an MBR
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/installboot.8">installboot(8)</a>,
      assume OpenBSD occupies the entire disk starting at sector 0.
  </li><li>Attempt to not overflow the ramdisk when extracting firmware on
	Apple arm64 systems.
  </li><li>Add support for loading files from the EFI System Partition.
  </li><li>Fix a bug in the handling of SCSI drives in the bootloader on the luna88k architecture.
  </li><li>On luna88k, implement the chmod() signaling mechanism for
	<code>/bsd.upgrade</code> to prevent re-upgrade, like other
	architectures.


  </li><li>Support for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> disks in the
	installer was improved:
    <ul>
    <li>Make root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      installations boot out of the box on Raspberry Pis (arm64).
    </li><li>Support installations with root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
      on arm64, tested on Pinebook Pro, Raspberry Pi 4b, and SolidRun CEX7.
    </li><li>On riscv64, enable softraid(4) in the ramdisk kernel and support
	installations with root on  
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>
    </li><li>When installing on encrypted
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>, determine
	the disk for placing the root device automatically and make it default
	as it is the only legit choice.
    </li><li>Add arm64 to the list of architectures with support for guided disk
        encryption.
    </li><li>Retain existing EFI System partitions on systems with APFSISC
      partitions (arm64 Apple M1/M2) during installation with root on
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a>.
    </li><li>Enable <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/softraid.4">softraid(4)</a> in ramdisk
	on the powerpc64 architecture.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Security improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>Enable indirect branch tracking (IBT) on amd64 and branch target
      identification (BTI) on arm64 in both the kernel and in userland.
      On hardware that supports this feature, it helps enforcing
      control flow integrity by making sure malicious code
      cannot jump into the middle of a function. 
  </li><li>On the arm64 architecture, enable pointer authentication (PAC)
      in userland on those machines where it works correctly.
      It helps enforcing control flow integrity by making sure
      malicious code cannot manipulate a function's return address.
  </li><li>Together with retguard these two features protect against ROP attacks.
      Compiler defaults for base clang, ports clang and ports gcc (as well
      as some other non-C language family compilers in ports) have been
      changed to enable these features by default.  As a result the vast
      majority of programs on OpenBSD (and all programs in the base system)
      run with these security features enabled.
  </li><li>Change <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>
      chunk sizes to be fine grained: chunk sizes are closer to the
      requested allocation size.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/malloc.3">malloc(3)</a>,
      check all chunks in the delayed free list for write-after-free.
  </li><li>The <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/shutdown.8">shutdown(8)</a>
      program can now only be executed by members of the new
      <code>_shutdown</code> group.  The idea is that system
      administrators can now remove most users from the excessively
      powerful <code>operator</code> group, which in particular
      provides read access to disk device nodes.
  </li><li>Using <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unveil.2">unveil(2)</a>,
	restrict <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/patch.1">patch(1)</a>
	filesystem access to the current directory including subdirectories,
	TMPDIR, and file names given on the command line.
  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ksh.1">ksh(1)</a>, consistently
      escape control characters when displaying file name completions,
      even when there are multiple matches.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>Changes in the network stack:
  <ul>
 <li>Sync the use of
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getuptime.9">getuptime(9)</a>
     in the Neighbour Discovery (ND) code with ARP.
 </li><li>In the IPv6 forwarding code, call
     <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/getuptime.9">getuptime(9)</a>
     once for consistency with IPv4.
 </li><li>ARP has a queue of packets that should be sent after name
	resolution. Neighbor discovery (ND6) did only hold a single packet.
	Unified the code, added a queue to ND6 and made the code MP safe.
 </li><li>Implement a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a>
     <code>net.inet6.icmp6.nd6_queued</code> to show the number of packets
     waiting for an ND6 response, analogous to ARP.
 </li><li>When configuring a new IPv6 address on an interface, an upstream router
	doesn't know where to send traffic.  Send an unsolicited
	neighbor advertisement, as described in RFC9131, to the all-routers
	multicast address so all routers on the same link will learn the path
	back to the address.
 </li><li>Implement the inbound portion of RFC9131.  Let routers create new
	neighbor cache entries when receiving valid neighbor advertisements.

 </li><li>Initial support for TCP segmentation offload (TSO) and TCP large receive offload (LRO) was implemented:
   <ul>
   <li>If the driver of a network interface supports TSO,
	do not chop the packet in the network stack,
	but pass it down to the interface layer for TSO.
   </li><li>Provide a software TSO implementation, to be used as a fallback
	if network hardware does not support TSO.
   </li><li>Provide a new <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2">sysctl(2)</a>
	node <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sysctl.2#tcp.tso">net.inet.tcp.tso</a> such that TSO can be globally disabled.
	By default, it is enabled on all interfaces supporting it.
   </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>,
	display separate
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#hwfeatures">hwfeatures</a>
	for TSOv4, TSOv6, and LRO and provide a
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#tcplro">-tcplro</a>
	parameter to disable LRO on a per-interface basis.
   </li><li>Enable TSO and forwarding of LRO packets via TSO in
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a>.
   </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a>, allocate
	less memory for tx buffers.
   </li><li>Speed up TCP transfer on
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a>
	interfaces by using TSO and LRO.
   </li><li>Enable LRO per default in network
	drivers. LRO allows to receive aggregated packets larger than the MTU.
	Receiving TCP streams becomes much faster. Currently only <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ix.4">ix(4)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a> devices support LRO, and
	ix(4) is limited to IPv4 and hardware newer than the old 82598 model.
   </li></ul>

 </li><li>The following changes were made to the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> firewall:
   <ul>
   <li>Speed up the
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a> request
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4#DIOCGETRULE">DIOCGETRULE</a>
	such that <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pfctl.8">pfctl(8)</a>
	can retrieve all <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a>
	rules from the kernel in linear rather than in quadratic time.
	To protect the kernel from memory exhaustion,
	userland processes now have to release tickets obtained with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4#DIOCGETRULES">DIOCGETRULES</a>
	by issuing the new
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ioctl.2">ioctl(2)</a> request
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4#DIOCXEND">DIOCXEND</a>.
	In particular, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/snmpd.8">snmpd(8)</a>
	and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/systat.1">systat(1)</a>
	now do that.
   </li><li>Relax the implementation of the <code>pass all</code> rule so all
	forms of neighbor advertisements are allowed in either direction.
   </li><li>When redirecting locally generated IP packets to userland with
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5#divert-packet">divert-packet</a> rules, the packets may have no checksum
	due to hardware offloading.  Calculate the checksum in that case.
   </li><li>Fix a bug where
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.conf.5#nat-to">nat-to</a>
	could fail to insert a state
	due to conflict on chosen source port number.
   </li><li>No longer ignore <code>keep state</code> and <code>nat-to</code>
	actions for unsolicited ICMP error responses. 
	Tighten the rule matching logic so ICMP error responses
	no longer match <code>keep state</code> rule.
	In typical scenarios, ICMP errors (if solicited) should match
	existing state.  The change is going to bite firewalls which deal
	with asymmetric routes. In those cases the <code>keep state</code>
	action should be relaxed to sloppy or new <code>no state</code>
	rule to explicitly match ICMP errors should be added.
   </li></ul>
 </li><li>Do not calculate IP, TCP, and UDP checksums on
	<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/lo.4">lo(4)</a> interfaces.
 </li><li>Convert the tcp_now() time counter to 64 bits to avoid 32 bits
	wrap around after changing tcp_now() ticks to milliseconds.
 </li><li>Add initial support for route-based IPsec VPNs.<br>
	Rather than use IPsec flows (aka, entries in the IPsec security
	policy database) to decide which traffic should be encapsulated in
	IPsec and sent to a peer, this changes security associations (SAs)
	so they can also refer to a tunnel interface. When traffic is routed
	over that tunnel interface, an IPsec SA is looked up and used to
	encapsulate traffic before being sent to the peer on the SA. When
	traffic is received from a peer using an interface SA, the specified
	interface is looked up and the packet is handed to it so it looks
	like packets come out of the tunnel.
 </li><li>Add <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a> to support
	route-based IPsec VPNs.
 </li><li>Introduce reference counting for TCP syn cache entries.
 </li><li>Have <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> copy the
	priority from the inner packet to the outer encrypted packet, so that
	higher priority packets are picked from hfsc queues for earlier
	transmission.
 </li></ul>

</li><li>Routing daemons and other userland network improvements:
  <ul>
  <li>IPsec support was improved:
  <ul>
	<li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    support route-based
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a> tunnels.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    add support to verify X.509 chain from CERT payloads.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    do not leak memory when receiving a CERT payload for pubkey auth
	    or for an invalid CERT Encoding.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    do not leak a file descriptor if
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/open_memstream.3">open_memstream(3)</a> fails while trying to enable a child SA.
	</li><li>While trying to verify an ECDSA signature in
            <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/iked.8">iked(8)</a>,
	    correctly detect failure of DER encoding with
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/i2d_ECDSA_SIG.3">i2d_ECDSA_SIG(3)</a>.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ipsecctl.8">ipsecctl(8)</a>,
	    support route-based IPsec VPN negotiation with
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sec.4">sec(4)</a>.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>,
	    support configuring interface SAs for route-based IPsec VPNs.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>
	    quick mode, do not crash with a <code>NULL</code> pointer
	    access when a group description is specified but it is invalid,
	    unsupported, or memory allocation or key generation fails.
	</li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>,
	    avoid a double free in the unlikely event that
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EC_KEY_check_key.3">EC_KEY_check_key(3)</a> fails right after generating
	    a new key pair.
	</li><li>Allow building
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/isakmpd.8">isakmpd(8)</a>
	    with a libcrypto library that has
	    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OpenBSD-7.3/EC_GROUP_new.3">binary field support</a> ("GF2m") removed.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/bgpd.8">bgpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Add first version of flowspec support. Right now only announcement
	    of flowspec rules is possible.
	</li><li>Update ASPA support to follow draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification-16
	    and draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile-16 by making the ASPA lookup
	    tables AFI-agnostic.
	</li><li>Rework UPDATE message generation to use the new ibuf API instead
	    of the hand-rolled solution before.
	</li><li>Fix <code>ext-community * *</code> matching which also affects
	    filters removing all ext-communities.
	</li><li>Improve and extend the bgpctl parser to handle commands like
	    <code>bgpctl show rib 192.0.2.0/24 detail</code>.
	    Also add various flowspec specific commands.
	</li><li>Introduce a semaphore to protect intermittent RTR session data
	    from being published to the RDE.
	</li><li>Limit the socket buffer size to 64k for all sessions.
	    Limiting the buffer size to a reasonable size ensures that not
	    too many updates end up queued in the TCP stack.
	</li><li>Adjust example <code>GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN</code> filter rule in
	    the example config to only match on ebgp sessions.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rpki-client.8">rpki-client(8)</a> saw some changes:
  <ul>
	<li>A 30%-50% performance improvement was achieved through libcrypto's
	    partial chains certificate validation feature. Already validated
	    non-inheriting CA certificates are now marked as trusted roots. This
	    way it can be ensured that a leaf's delegated resources are properly
	    covered, and at the same time most validation paths are
	    significantly shortened.
	</li><li>Support for gzip and deflate HTTP Content-Encoding compression was
	    added. This allows web servers to send RRDP XML in compressed form,
	    saving around 50% of bandwidth.
	</li><li>ASPA support was updated to draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile-16.
	    As part of supporting AFI-agnostic ASPAs, the JSON syntax for
	    Validated ASPA Payloads changed in both filemode and normal output.
	</li><li>In filemode (-f option) the applicable manifests are now shown as
	    part of the signature path.
	</li><li>A new -P option was added to manually specify a moment in time
	    to use when parsing the validity window of certificates. Useful
	    for regression testing. Default is invocation time of rpki-client.
	</li><li>The -A option will now also exclude ASPA data from the JSON output.
	</li><li>The synchronisation protocol used to sync the repository is now
	    included in the OpenMetrics output.
	</li><li>Improved accounting by tracking objects both by repo and tal.
	</li><li>Check whether products listed on a manifest were issued by the same
	    authority as the manifest itself.
	</li><li>File modification timestamps of objects retrieved via RRDP are now
	    deterministically set to prepare the on-disk cache for seamless
	    failovers from RRDP to RSYNC.
	</li><li>Improved detection of RRDP session desynchronization: a check was
	    added to compare whether the delta hashes associated to previously
	    seen serials are different in newly fetched notification files.
	</li><li>Improved handling of RRDP deltas in which objects are published,
	    withdrawn, and published again.
	</li><li>Disallow X.509 v2 issuer and subject unique identifiers in certs.
	    RPKI CAs will never issue certificates with V2 unique identifiers.
	</li><li>A check to disallow duplicate X.509 certificate extensions was
	    added.
	</li><li>A check to disallow empty sets of IP Addresses or AS numbers in RFC
	    3779 extensions was added.
	</li><li>A warning is printed when the CMS signing-time attribute in a Signed
	    Object is missing.
	</li><li>Warnings about unrecoverable message digest mismatches now include
	    the manifestNumber to aid debugging the cause.
	</li><li>A check was added to disallow multiple RRDP publish elements for the
	    same file in RRDP snapshots. If this error condition is encountered,
	    the RRDP transfer is failed and the RP falls back to rsync.
	</li><li>A compliance check for the proper X.509 Certificate version and CRL
	    version was added.
	</li><li>A compliance check was added to ensure CMS Signed Objects contain
	    SignedData, in accordance to RFC 6488 section 3 checklist item 1a.
	</li><li>Compliance checks were added for the version, KeyUsage, and
	    ExtendedKeyUsage of EE certificates in Manifest, TAK, and GBR Signed
	    Objects.
	</li><li>A CMS signing-time value being after the X.509 notAfter timestamp
	    was downgraded from an error to a warning.
	</li><li>A bug was fixed in the handling of CA certificates which inherit IP
	    resources.
	</li><li>A compliance check was added to ensure the X.509 Subject only
	    contains commonName and optionally serialNumber.
	</li><li>A compliance check was added to ensure the CMS SignedData and
	    SignerInfo versions to be 3.
	</li><li>Fisher-Yates shuffle the order in which Manifest entries are
	    processed. Previously, work items were enqueued in the order the CA
	    intended them to appear on a Manifest. However, there is no obvious
	    benefit to third parties deciding the order in which things are
	    processed.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd.8">smtpd(8)</a>,
  <ul>
	<li>Swapped link-auth filter arguments to avoid ambiguities with user
	    names containing a "|" character.
	</li><li>Bumped <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/smtpd-filters.7">smtpd-filters(7)</a>
	    protocol version.
	</li><li>Fixed potential truncation of filtered data lines.
	</li><li>Allowed arguments on NOOP.
  </li></ul>

  </li><li>Many other changes in various network programs and libraries:
  <ul>
	<li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pcap_fopen_offline.3">pcap_fopen_offline(3)</a> correctly interpret some
	      <code>LINKTYPE_*</code> values in pcap headers written
	      on foreign operating systems.
	  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dig.1">dig(1)</a>
	      use less deprecated LibreSSL API.

	  </li><li>Remove stylistic differences between
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/arp.8">arp(8)</a> and
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a> delete()
		function.  This makes it easier to spot real changes in behavior.
	  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ndp.8">ndp(8)</a>
	      not remove cloning routes when no neighbor entry is
		found with <code>ndp -d</code>.


	  </li><li>Improved error handling in the <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/asr_run.3">asr</a> resolver.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>,
		handle SERVFAIL results on name resolution better.
	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/unwind.8">unwind(8)</a>,
		fix a use-after-free bug triggered by fatal write errors
		while sending TCP responses.

	  </li><li>In the router advertisement daemon
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/rad.8">rad(8)</a>, update the default
		timers for prefix preferred and valid lifetimes to use the values from
		RFC 9096.
	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/slaacd.8">slaacd(8)</a>,
		remove artificial limit of 2 hours on a PIO lifetime.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>,
	      reduce memory usage when updating larger directories.
	  </li><li>Make <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ypldap.8">ypldap(8)</a>
		more resilient when some servers are
		misbehaving: keep trying LDAP servers until full results arrive
		rather than just until one accepts the TCP connection.

	  </li><li>New <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8#wgdescription">wgdescription</a> parameter to
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
	      to set a string describing the
	      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/wg.4">wg(4)</a> peer.

	  </li><li>Let <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig.8">ifconfig(8)</a>
	      prefix the interface name to many error and warning messages.

	  </li><li>Make the <code>tlsv1.0</code> and <code>tlsv1.1</code> options
		in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>
		do nothing, as one should use the default <code>tlsv1.2</code>
		instead.
	  </li><li>Fix IPv6 routes being changed by
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>
		with Routers configuration.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/dhcrelay6.8">dhcrelay6(8)</a>, do not
		ignore the AF_LINK entries of <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/carp.4">carp(4)</a> interfaces.

	  </li><li>Improve the config parser of
		<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>
		to better handle
		comments, improve error messages and plug a memory leak.
	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/radiusd.8">radiusd(8)</a>,
		add request or response decoration feature which is used through the
		radiusd module interface.  This makes additional modules can modify
		RADIUS request or response messages.  Also add new "radius_standard"
		module which uses this new feature, provides some generic features
		like "strip-atmark-realm" which removes the realm part from the
		User-Name attribute.

	  </li><li>Allow UDP for built-in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/inetd.8">inetd(8)</a> services on
		127.0.0.1. This restriction was added in year 2000 due to IPv6 compatible and
		mapped addresses.  Nowadays our kernel does not support these IPv6
		features and blocks localhost addresses on non-loopback interfaces.
		Make IPv4 127.0.0.1/8 and IPv6 ::1 behave identically and provide
		local services if configured.

	  </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/spamd.8">spamd(8)</a>, log a
		dummy "<unknown>" IP address in the unlikely event that getnameinfo(3)
		fails.
  </unknown></li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/tmux.1">tmux(1)</a> improvements and bug fixes:
  <ul>
  <li>For passthrough, don't write to clients attached to different sessions.
  </li><li>Add a format to show if there are unseen changes while in a mode.
  </li><li>Discard mouse sequences that have the right form but actually
	are invalid.
  </li><li>Invalidate cached tty state after changing features since they may
	change what the terminal can do and need mouse sequences or similar to
	be sent again.
  </li><li>Add options to change the confirm key and default behaviour of
	confirm-before.
  </li><li>Add an option menu-selected-style to configure the currently
	selected menu item.
  </li><li>Add -c to run-shell to set working directory.
  </li><li>Add detach-on-destroy previous and next,
  </li><li>Set visited flag on last windows when linking session.
  </li></ul>

</li><li>LibreSSL version 3.8.2
  <ul>
  <li>Security fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Disabled TLSv1.0 and TLSv1.1 in libssl so that they may no longer
      be selected for use.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_is_prime_ex.3">BN_is_prime_ex(3)</a>
      and BN_is_prime_fasttest_ex(3) refuse to check numbers larger than
      32 kbits for primality. This mitigates various DoS vectors.
    </li><li>Restricted the RFC 3779 code to IPv4 and IPv6. It was not written
      to be able to deal with anything else.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Portable changes
    <ul>
    <li>Extended the endian.h compat header with hto* and *toh macros.
    </li><li>Adapted more tests to the portable framework.
    </li><li>Internal tools are now statically linked.
    </li><li>Applications bundled as part of the LibreSSL package internally,
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/nc.1">nc(1)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1">openssl(1)</a>,
      now are linked statically if static libraries are built.
    </li><li>Internal compatibility function symbols are no longer exported from
      libcrypto. Instead, the libcompat library is linked to libcrypto,
      libssl, and libtls separately. This increases size a little, but
      ensures that the libraries are not exporting symbols to programs
      unintentionally.
    </li><li>Selective removal of CET implementation on platforms where it is
      not supported (macOS).
    </li><li>Integrated four more tests.
    </li><li>Added Windows ARM64 architecture to tested platforms.
    </li><li>Removed Solaris 10 support, fixed Solaris 11.
    </li><li>libtls no longer links statically to libcrypto / libssl unless
	    <code>--enable-libtls-only</code> is specified at configure time.
    </li><li>Improved Windows compatibility library, namely handling of files vs
      sockets, correcting an exception when operating on a closed socket.
    </li><li>CMake builds no longer hardcode <code>-O2</code> into the compiler flags,
      instead using flags from the CMake build type instead.
    </li><li>Set the CMake default build type to <code>Release</code>. This can be overridden
      during configuration.
    </li><li>Fixed broken ASM support with MinGW builds.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>New features
    <ul>
    <li>Added support for
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_sha512_224.3">truncated SHA-2</a>
      and for <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_sha3_224.3">SHA-3</a>.
    </li><li>The BPSW primality test performs additional Miller-Rabin rounds
      with random bases to reduce the likelihood of composites passing.
    </li><li>Allow testing of ciphers and digests using badly aligned buffers
      in openssl speed using -unalign.
    </li><li>Ed25519 certificates are now supported in openssl(1)
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1#ca">ca</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/openssl.1#req">req</a>.
      Prepared Ed25519 support in libssl.
    </li><li>Add branch target information (BTI) support to amd64 and arm64
      assembly.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Compatibility changes
    <ul>
    <li>Added a workaround for a poorly thought-out change in OpenSSL 3 that
      broke privilege separation support in libtls.
    </li><li>Moved libtls from ECDSA_METHOD to EC_KEY_METHOD.
    </li><li>Removed GF2m support: BIGNUM no longer supports binary extension
      field arithmetic and all binary elliptic builtin curves were removed.
    </li><li>Removed dangerous, "fast" NIST prime and elliptic curve implementations.
      In particular, EC_GFp_nist_method() is no longer available.
    </li><li>Removed most public symbols that were deprecated in OpenSSL 0.9.8.
    </li><li>Removed the public X9.31 API (RSA_X931_PADDING is still available).
    </li><li>Removed Cipher Text Stealing mode.
    </li><li>Removed ENGINE support, including ECDH_METHOD and ECDSA_METHOD.
    </li><li>Removed COMP, DSO, dynamic loading of conf modules and support for
      custom ex_data and error stacks.
    </li><li>Removed proxy certificate (RFC 3820) support.
    </li><li>Removed SXNET and NETSCAPE_CERT_SEQUENCE support including the
      openssl(1) nseq command.
    </li><li>ENGINE support was removed and OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE is set. In spite
      of this, some stub functions are provided to avoid patching some
      applications that do not honor OPENSSL_NO_ENGINE.
    </li><li>The POLICY_TREE and its related structures and API were removed.
    </li><li>In <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_VERIFY_PARAM_inherit.3">X509_VERIFY_PARAM_inherit(3)</a>, copy hostflags independently of the
      host list.
    </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index.3">CRYPTO_get_ex_new_index(3)</a> not return 0 to allow applications
      to use *_{get,set}_app_data() and *_{get,set}_ex_data() alongside
      each other.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID.3">X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_NAME_get_text_by_OBJ.3">X509_NAME_get_text_by_OBJ(3)</a> now only succeed if they contain
      valid UTF-8 without embedded NUL.
    </li><li>The explicitText user notice uses UTF8String instead of VisibleString
      to reduce the risk of emitting certificates with invalid DER-encoding.
    </li><li>Initial fixes for RSA-PSS support to make the TLSv1.3 stack more
      compliant with RFC 8446.
    </li><li>Fixed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv_length.3">EVP_CIPHER_CTX_iv_length(3)</a> to return what was set with
      EVP_CTRL_AEAD_SET_IVLEN or one of its aliases.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Internal improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Improved sieve of Eratosthenes script used for generating a table
      of small primes.
    </li><li>Removed incomplete and dangerous BN_RECURSION code.
    </li><li>Imported RFC 5280 policy checking code from BoringSSL and used it
      to replace the old exponential time code.
    </li><li>Converted more of libcrypto to use CBB/CBS.
    </li><li>Started cleaning up and rewriting SHA internals.
    </li><li>Reduced the dependency of hash implementations on many layers of
      macros. This results in significant speedups since modern compilers
      are now less confused.
    </li><li>Improved BIGNUM internals and performance.
    </li><li>Significantly simplified the BN_BLINDING internals used in RSA.
    </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_num_bits.3">BN_num_bits(3)</a>
      independent of bn-&gt;top.
    </li><li>Rewrote and simplified bn_sqr().
    </li><li>Significantly improved Montgomery multiplication performance.
    </li><li>Rewrote and improved
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_exp.3">BN_exp(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_copy.3">BN_copy(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Changed <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_item_sign_ctx.3">ASN1_item_sign_ctx(3)</a> and
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_item_verify.3">ASN1_item_verify(3)</a> to work with
      Ed25519 and fixed a few bugs in there.
    </li><li>Lots of cleanup for DH, DSA, EC, RSA internals.  Plugged numerous
      memory leaks, fixed logic errors and inconsistencies.
    </li><li>Cleaned up and simplified various ECDH and ECDSA internals.
    </li><li>Removed EC_GROUP precomp machinery.
    </li><li>Fixed various issues with
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_PKEY_CTX_new.3">EVP_PKEY_CTX_new(3)</a> and EVP_PKEY_CTX_dup(3).
    </li><li>Rewrote <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OBJ_find_sigid_algs">OBJ_find_sigid_algs(3)</a> and OBJ_find_sigid_by_algs(3).
    </li><li>Improved X.509 certificate version checks.
    </li><li>Ensure no X.509v3 extensions appear more than once in certificates.
    </li><li>Replaced ASN1_bn_print with a cleaner internal implementation.
    </li><li>Fix OPENSSL_cpuid_setup() invocations on arm/aarch64.
    </li><li>Improved checks for commonName in libtls.
    </li><li>Fixed error check for
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/X509_get_ext_d2i.3">X509_get_ext_d2i(3)</a> failure in libtls.
    </li><li>Removed code guarded by #ifdef ZLIB.
    </li><li>Plug a potential memory leak in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_TIME_normalize.3">ASN1_TIME_normalize(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Fixed a use of uninitialized in i2r_IPAddrBlocks().
    </li><li>Rewrote <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/CMS_SignerInfo_sign.3">CMS_SignerInfo_sign(3)</a> and CMS_SignerInfo_verify(3).
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Bug fixes
    <ul>
    <li>Correctly handle negative input to various BIGNUM functions.
    </li><li>Ensure ERR_load_ERR_strings() does not set errno unexpectedly.

      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/i2d_ECDSA_SIG.3">i2d_ECDSA_SIG(3)</a>
      in ossl_ecdsa_sign().
    </li><li>Fixed aliasing issue in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_mod_inverse.3">BN_mod_inverse(3)</a>.  Disallowed aliasing of result

    </li><li>Add missing pointer invalidation in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/SSL_free.3">SSL_free(3)</a>.
    </li><li>Fixed X509err() and X509V3err() and their internal versions.
    </li><li>Ensure that
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/OBJ_obj2txt.3">OBJ_obj2txt(3)</a>
      always returns a C string again.
    </li><li>Made <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_hkdf_key">EVP_PKEY_CTX_set1_hkdf_key(3)</a> fail on a NULL key.

    </li><li>Allow IP addresses to be specified in a URI.
    </li><li>Fixed a copy-paste error in
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ASN1_TIME_compare.3">ASN1_TIME_compare(3)</a> that could lead to two UTCTimes
      or two GeneralizedTimes incorrectly being compared as equal.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Documentation improvements
    <ul>
    <li>Improved documentation of BIO_ctrl(3), BIO_set_info_callback(3),
      BIO_get_info_callback(3), BIO_method_type(3), and BIO_method_name(3).
    </li><li>Marked BIO_CB_return(), BIO_cb_pre(), and BIO_cb_post() as intentionally
      undocumented.
    </li><li>Made it very explicit that the verify callback should not be used.
    </li><li>Called out that the CRL lastUpdate is standardized as thisUpdate.
    </li><li>Documented the RFC 3779 API and its shortcomings.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Testing and Proactive Security
    <ul>
    <li>Significantly improved test coverage of
      <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/BN_mod_sqrt.3">BN_mod_sqrt(3)</a>
      and GCD.
    </li><li>As always, new test coverage is added as bugs are fixed and subsystems
      are cleaned up.
    </li></ul>
  </li></ul>

</li><li>OpenSSH 9.5 and OpenSSH 9.4
  <ul>
  <li>Potentially incompatible changes
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        generate Ed25519 keys by default. Ed25519 public keys
        are very convenient due to their small size. Ed25519 keys are
        specified in RFC 8709 and OpenSSH has supported them since version 6.5
        (January 2014).
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        the Subsystem directive now accurately preserves quoting of
        subsystem commands and arguments. This may change behaviour for exotic
        configurations, but the most common subsystem configuration
        (sftp-server) is unlikely to be affected.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>:
        PKCS#11 modules must now be specified by their full
        paths. Previously dlopen(3) could search for them in system
        library directories.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>New features
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        add keystroke timing obfuscation to the client. This attempts
        to hide inter-keystroke timings by sending interactive traffic at
        fixed intervals (default: every 20ms) when there is only a small
        amount of data being sent. It also sends fake "chaff" keystrokes for
        a random interval after the last real keystroke. These are
        controlled by a new ssh_config ObscureKeystrokeTiming keyword.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        Introduce a transport-level ping facility. This adds
        a pair of SSH transport protocol messages SSH2_MSG_PING/PONG to
        implement a ping capability. These messages use numbers in the "local
        extensions" number space and are advertised using a "ping@openssh.com"
        ext-info message with a string version number of "0".
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        allow override of Subsystem directives in sshd Match blocks.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        allow forwarding Unix Domain sockets via ssh -W.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        add support for configuration tags to ssh(1).
        This adds a ssh_config(5) "Tag" directive and corresponding
        "Match tag" predicate that may be used to select blocks of
        configuration similar to the pf.conf(5) keywords of the same
        name.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
         add a "match localnetwork" predicate. This allows matching
         on the addresses of available network interfaces and may be used to
         vary the effective client configuration based on network location.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        infrastructure support for KRL
        extensions.  This defines wire formats for optional KRL extensions
        and implements parsing of the new submessages. No actual extensions
        are supported at this point.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand and AuthorizedKeysCommand now
        accept two additional %-expansion sequences: %D which expands to
        the routing domain of the connected session and %C which expands
        to the addresses and port numbers for the source and destination
        of the connection.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        increase the default work factor (rounds) for the
        bcrypt KDF used to derive symmetric encryption keys for passphrase
        protected key files by 50%.
    </li></ul>
  </li><li>Bugfixes
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>:
        fix scp in SFTP mode recursive upload and download of
        directories that contain symlinks to other directories. In scp mode,
        the links would be followed, but in SFTP mode they were not.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        handle cr+lf (instead of just cr) line endings in
        sshsig signature files.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        interactive mode for ControlPersist sessions if they
        originally requested a tty.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        make PerSourceMaxStartups first-match-wins
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        limit artificial login delay to a reasonable maximum (5s)
        and don't delay at all for the "none" authentication mechanism.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        Log errors in kex_exchange_identification() with level
        verbose instead of error to reduce preauth log spam. All of those
        get logged with a more generic error message by sshpkt_fatal().
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        correct math for ClientAliveInterval that caused the probes
        to be sent less frequently than configured.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>:
        improve isolation between loaded PKCS#11 modules
        by running separate ssh-pkcs11-helpers for each loaded provider.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        make -f (fork after authentication) work correctly with
        multiplexed connections, including ControlPersist.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        make ConnectTimeout apply to multiplexing sockets and not
        just to network connections.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        improve defences against invalid PKCS#11
        modules being loaded by checking that the requested module
        contains the required symbol before loading it.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>:
        fix AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand when AuthorizedKeysCommand
        appears before it in sshd_config. Since OpenSSH 8.7 the
        AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand directive was incorrectly ignored in
        this situation.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        remove vestigial support for KRL
        signatures When the KRL format was originally defined, it included
        support for signing of KRL objects. However, the code to sign KRLs
        and verify KRL signatures was never completed in OpenSSH. This
        release removes the partially-implemented code to verify KRLs.
        All OpenSSH tools now ignore KRL_SECTION_SIGNATURE sections in
        KRL files.
     </li><li>All: fix a number of memory leaks and unreachable/harmless integer
        overflows.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1">ssh-agent(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        don't truncate strings logged from PKCS#11 modules
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8">sshd(8)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        better validate CASignatureAlgorithms in
        ssh_config and sshd_config. Previously this directive would accept
        certificate algorithm names, but these were unusable in practice as
        OpenSSH does not support CA chains.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        make <code>ssh -Q CASignatureAlgorithms</code> only list signature
        algorithms that are valid for CA signing. Previous behaviour was
        to list all signing algorithms, including certificate algorithms.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1">ssh-keyscan(1)</a>:
        gracefully handle systems where rlimits or the
        maximum number of open files is larger than INT_MAX
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1">ssh-keygen(1)</a>:
        fix "no comment" not showing on when running
        <code>ssh-keygen -l</code> on multiple keys where one has a comment
        and other following keys do not.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>,
        <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1">sftp(1)</a>:
        adjust ftruncate() logic to handle servers that
        reorder requests. Previously, if the server reordered requests then
        the resultant file would be erroneously truncated.
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1">ssh(1)</a>:
        don't incorrectly disable hostname canonicalization when
        CanonicalizeHostname=yes and ProxyJump was explicitly set to
        "none".
    </li><li><a href="https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1">scp(1)</a>:
        when copying local to remote, check that the source file
        exists before opening an SFTP connection to the server.

</p><p>
If your machine can boot from USB, you can write <i>install74.img</i> or
<i>miniroot74.img</i> to a USB stick and boot from it.

</p><p>
If you can't boot from a CD, floppy disk, or USB,
you can install across the network using PXE as described in
the included INSTALL.i386 document.

</p><p>
If you are planning on dual booting OpenBSD with another OS, you will need to
read INSTALL.i386.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/landisk:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to the start of the CF
or disk, and boot normally.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/loongson:</h3>

<p>
Write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a USB stick and boot bsd.rd from it
or boot bsd.rd via tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.loongson for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/luna88k:</h3>

<p>
Copy 'boot' and 'bsd.rd' to a Mach or UniOS partition, and boot the bootloader
from the PROM, and then bsd.rd from the bootloader.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.luna88k for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/macppc:</h3>

<p>

Alternatively, at the Open Firmware prompt, enter <i>boot cd:,ofwboot
/7.4/macppc/bsd.rd</i>

</p><h3>OpenBSD/octeon:</h3>

<p>
After connecting a serial port, boot bsd.rd over the network via DHCP/tftp.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.octeon for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/powerpc64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a
USB stick, plug it into the machine and choose the <i>OpenBSD
install</i> menu item in Petitboot.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.powerpc64 for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/riscv64:</h3>

<p>
To install, write <i>install74.img</i> or <i>miniroot74.img</i> to a
USB stick, and boot with that drive plugged in.
Make sure you also have the microSD card plugged in that shipped with the
HiFive Unmatched board.
Refer to the instructions in INSTALL.riscv64 for more details.

</p><h3>OpenBSD/sparc64:</h3>

<p>
Burn the image from a mirror site to a CDROM, boot from it, and type
<i>boot cdrom</i>.

</p><p>
If this doesn't work, or if you don't have a CDROM drive, you can write
<i>floppy74.img</i> or <i>floppyB74.img</i>
(depending on your machine) to a floppy and boot it with <i>boot
floppy</i>. Refer to INSTALL.sparc64 for details.

</p><p>
Make sure you use a properly formatted floppy with NO BAD BLOCKS or your install
will most likely fail.

</p><p>
You can also write <i>miniroot74.img</i> to the swap partition on
the disk and boot with <i>boot disk:b</i>.

</p><p>
If nothing works, you can boot over the network as described in INSTALL.sparc64.

<h3>How to upgrade</h3>
<p>
If you already have an OpenBSD 7.3 system, and do not want to reinstall,
upgrade instructions and advice can be found in the
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/upgrade74.html">Upgrade Guide</a>.

<h3>Notes about the source code</h3>
<p>
<code>src.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src</code>.
This file contains everything you need except for the kernel sources,
which are in a separate archive.
To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/src.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<code>sys.tar.gz</code> contains a source archive starting at <code>/usr/src/sys</code>.
This file contains all the kernel sources you need to rebuild kernels.
To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>mkdir -p /usr/src/sys</kbd>
# <kbd>cd /usr/src</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/sys.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both of these trees are a regular CVS checkout.  Using these trees it
is possible to get a head-start on using the anoncvs servers as
described <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">here</a>.
Using these files
results in a much faster initial CVS update than you could expect from
a fresh checkout of the full OpenBSD source tree.

<h3>Ports Tree</h3>
<p>
A ports tree archive is also provided.  To extract:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>cd /usr</kbd>
# <kbd>tar xvfz /tmp/ports.tar.gz</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Go read the <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/ports/index.html">ports</a> page
if you know nothing about ports
at this point.  This text is not a manual of how to use ports.
Rather, it is a set of notes meant to kickstart the user on the
OpenBSD ports system.
</p><p>
The <i>ports/</i> directory represents a CVS checkout of our ports.
As with our complete source tree, our ports tree is available via
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/anoncvs.html">AnonCVS</a>.
So, in order to keep up to date with the -stable branch, you must make
the <i>ports/</i> tree available on a read-write medium and update the tree
with a command like:
</p><blockquote><pre># <kbd>cd /usr/ports</kbd>
# <kbd>cvs -d anoncvs@server.openbsd.org:/cvs update -Pd -rOPENBSD_7_4</kbd>
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
[Of course, you must replace the server name here with a nearby anoncvs
server.]
</p><p>
Note that most ports are available as packages on our mirrors. Updated
ports for the 7.4 release will be made available if problems arise.
</p><p>
If you're interested in seeing a port added, would like to help out, or just
would like to know more, the mailing list
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org/mail.html">ports@openbsd.org</a> is a good place to know.
