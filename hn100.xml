    <blockquote>
  <p>This is a part of a blog post series about “useless” (or: controversial) syntax elements that emerged in recent Ruby version. The goal of the series is not to defend (or criticize) the features, but to share a “thought framework” for analysis of their reasons, design, and effect the new syntax has on a code that uses it. See also <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-02-syntax-sugar.html">intro/ToC post</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Today’s post covers the feature that, unlike most of the others in the series, caused very little pushback: a set of shortcuts for <strong>argument forwarding</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what">What</h2>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/2.7.html#keyword-argument-related-changes">Ruby 2.7</a>, this is possible (please note that <code>...</code> in the code below is the exact valid syntax, not “code omitted for a blog post”):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>foo</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># bar receives all positional, named and block arguments</span>
  <span># that foo received</span>
  <span>bar</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument">Ruby 3.1</a>, an anonymous block argument can be “forwarded” separately:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>iterate_through_data</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span>
  <span>data</span><span>.</span><span>each</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Since <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements">Ruby 3.2</a>, one can also “forward” positional and named (keyword) arguments separately:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>split_arguments</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>pass_positional</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span># passes all positional arguments</span>
  <span>pass_keywords</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span> <span># passes all keyword arguments</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>split_arguments</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a: </span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span># after this call, those methods would be called:</span>
<span>#   pass_positional(1, 2, 3)</span>
<span>#   pass_keywords(a: 4, b: 5)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="why--how">Why &amp; How</h2>

<p>…are inseparable here!</p>

<p>The introduction of <code>...</code> was not something discussed for years (at least, I am unaware of such discussions). It was rather an impromptu invention on the wave of the Big Changes in Ruby 2.7.</p>

<p>Version 2.7 was the last preparatory version before 3.0, and it introduced some of the “big oh” changes so everybody had time to prepare. One of such changes was a <em>final separation</em> of positional and keyword arguments: making some rules of treating arguments stricter and less cumbersome than they historically were.</p>

<p>This is a complicated topic, well covered by the <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2019/12/12/separation-of-positional-and-keyword-arguments-in-ruby-3-0/">official explanation</a>. In the context of the shorthand invention, we need to know that one of the side effects of the separation was that writing a method that just passes all of its arguments to another method became complicated. The pre-2.7 way of doing so was this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>reader</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>mode</span><span>:)</span>
  <span># does some reading</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>writer</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>)</span>
  <span># does some writing</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
  <span># a typical wrapper method, which might, say, log execution,</span>
  <span># catch extra errors, do a more complicated dispatching and so on.</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>:reader</span><span>,</span> <span>"file.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>mode: </span><span>'wb'</span><span>)</span>
<span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>:writer</span><span>,</span> <span>"file.txt"</span><span>,</span> <span>'some content'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>*args</code> in the method signature and the method call was enough to pass all positional and keyword arguments around. In Ruby 2.7, the separation would become more formal<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, so to handle every kind of method, one needed to write:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a generic situation, the third type of the argument should’ve been considered: a block (Ruby’s special “tail lambda”). So for a truly universal delegator, one needed to write this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>wrap</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>block</span><span>)</span>
  <span>send</span><span>(</span><span>method</span><span>,</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>block</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>That’s a whole lot of syntax <em>and</em> naming to do a thing that is so simple by its idea!</p>

<p>So the practical solution for a shortcut “just pass whatever arguments you have” was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16253">proposed</a> and quickly accepted in the form of <code>...</code>.</p>

<p>A few technicalities and edge cases were discussed and settled, some immediately, some in the next version. Say, <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.0.html#arguments-forwarding--supports-leading-arguments">support for passing a leading argument before forwarding syntax</a> was introduced in 3.0 but considered so useful it was then backported to the 2.7 branch and has been available there since around 2.7.3.</p>

<p>It was kind of a big deal because “delegate everything” is a very widespread phraseology in Ruby, used for all kinds of effects:</p>

<div><pre><code><span># hide the real call sequence complexity:</span>
<span>def</span> <span>log</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>:,</span> <span>**</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Loggers</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>:http_logger</span><span>).</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>text</span><span>,</span> <span>level: </span><span>level</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>payload</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># dynamically choose an implementation</span>
<span>def</span> <span>make_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EVENT_CLASSES</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>].</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># make a nice DSL with dynamically defined methods:</span>
<span>class</span> <span>HTML</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>method_missing</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>attributes</span><span>)</span>
    <span># construct tag string from tag name, content and attrs</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>HTML</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>.</span><span>a</span><span>(</span><span>'Ruby'</span><span>,</span> <span>href: </span><span>'https://ruby-lang.org'</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; "&lt;a href='https://ruby-lang.org'&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>All of those cases can be made much shorter with <code>...</code>, without losing the <em>real</em> meaning of “just pass everything”!</p>

<p>This syntax change was a rare case when many groups with frequently conflicting views directly saw an immediate gain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>those who are usually curious about syntax changes and shortcuts found it pretty;</li>
  <li>those more cautious and frequently asking “what’s the use case”, in this case, immediately knew plenty of them (especially considering that after ruby 2.7, a lot of delegating code should’ve been rewritten anyway, either to <code>...</code> or to <code>*args, **kwargs</code>, so making peace with a shortcut seemed acceptable);</li>
  <li>finally, those with an emphasis on language as a pragmatic engineering tool saw a gain of the improved performance.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter has a simple explanation: what you don’t name, you don’t need to put in the object. E.g., this allocates an intermediate array and hash to put positional and keyword arguments into:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegator</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
  <span># `args` is Array, and `kwargs` is Hash here</span>
  <span># ...but we needed them only to immediately unpack</span>
  <span>delegatee</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>kwargs</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>While this code doesn’t make additional local variables available, and therefore no need to allocate an array/hash:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>delegator</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span># no extra local vars here</span>
  <span>delegatee</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, it wasn’t a surprise or a scandal when, a couple of versions later, separate shortcuts to pass only positional and only keyword args were proposed.</p>

<p>Moreover, the change was small; those signatures were already valid syntax:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>ignore_my_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>ignore_keyword_args</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>positional</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…to say, “the method accepts any numbers of positional or keyword args (maybe for compatibility with the same method in neighbor classes), but ignores them.” So the only change <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.2.html#anonymous-arguments-passing-improvements">in Ruby 3.2</a> was to additionally allow to say “…and passes them further”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>pass_my_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
  <span>other_method</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>def</span> <span>pass_keyword_args</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>positional</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>other_method</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Considering the intuitive feeling of “no new syntax” and that <code>...</code> was already there, and with the same “no unnecessary allocations” argument, the change was quickly accepted. The fact that it was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/18351">proposed</a> (and the high-quality implementation supplied) by Jeremy Evans, author of prominent libraries like Sequel and Roda and a member of Ruby core helped, too.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, the new syntax is acceptable not only for delegation to another method but almost everywhere where unpacking of named variables was supported:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>with_anonymous_args</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>ary</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>*</span><span>]</span>
  <span>hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>**</span><span>}</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>ary</span><span>,</span> <span>hash</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>with_anonymous_args</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>a: </span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>b: </span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span># Prints:</span>
<span>#   [1, 2, 3]</span>
<span>#   {:a=&gt;4, :b=&gt;5}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This can be considered more of a curiosity (at least the “don’t instantiate an array/hash” gain is lost here), but might be at least useful for temporary debugging statements in the pass-everything methods:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>make_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>)</span>
  <span>puts</span> <span>"DEBUG!"</span> <span>if</span> <span>{</span><span>**</span><span>}.</span><span>key?</span><span>(</span><span>:password</span><span>)</span>  <span># temp</span>
  <span>EVENT_CLASSES</span><span>[</span><span>type</span><span>].</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>**</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Or, as the slightly-over-the-top example at the end of the “<a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-03-syntax-sugar2-pattern-matching-fin.html#taking-it-further">Pattern Matching / Taking it further</a>” shows, the “we don’t care about the name” can be repurposed to further pattern match the argument list as several possible signatures with different meanings (and, therefore, names) for parts of the argument list.</p>

<hr>

<p>The story with <code>&amp;</code> for anonymous block forwarding is a bit more complicated.</p>

<p>Unlike <code>*</code> or <code>**</code>, there was no <code>&amp;</code> for “just ignore this block” because block arguments in Ruby are always optional, and there is no way neither to demonstrate in the method signature “we require it” nor that we don’t. (It is sometimes a problem when blocks are erroneously passed—and ignored—to methods that never expected them, but it is quite <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19979">hard</a> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/15554">to solve</a>.)</p>

<p>So, when the standalone forwarding with <code>&amp;</code> <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11256">was proposed</a>—long before the 2.7’s “argument forwarding” work—mainly as an optimization for block allocation, it was met with great caution. At that time, the optimization part was <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/14045">implemented</a> on its own as just optimization of passing the block around even if it was named. Later, though, when the basic argument forwarding with <code>...</code> was already in the language, the six-year-long discussion about the acceptability and readability of <code>&amp;</code> was ended with its introduction in <a href="https://rubyreferences.github.io/rubychanges/3.1.html#anonymous-block-argument">Ruby 3.1</a>.</p>

<p>That’s the same effect we saw <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-10-syntax-sugar3-hash-values-omission.html#how">while discussing</a> keyword argument omission (which became acceptable after we got used to other cases of value-less <code>key:</code> syntax). Once a “bigger” feature takes its mindshare, the smaller ones might follow more easily.</p>

<h2 id="irks-and-quirks">Irks and quirks</h2>

<p>A small irk around ellipsis-based delegation is related to parentheses. The nature of the problem is similar to what we saw in the keyword omission case:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_method</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>p</span> <span>...</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Is actually</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_meth</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>(</span><span>p</span><span>()</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span># empty method call + a range from its result to infinity</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This affects only ellipsis (not other forms of anonymous forwarding) and is remedied, as usual, by adding parentheses:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>my_method</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>p</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The worse problem is that anonymous forwarding is not supported in blocks/procs. This is especially confusing considering that an old syntax of “anonymous splat” <em>is</em> supported, and therefore one might potentially write code with a very confusing effect:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>process</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span>
  <span># ...a lot of code...</span>
  <span>[</span><span>'test'</span><span>,</span> <span>'me'</span><span>].</span><span>each</span> <span>{</span> <span>|*|</span> <span>puts</span><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>process</span><span>(</span><span>'input'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This looks as if it will print “test” and “me” (inside of proc, <code>*</code> accepts its arguments and passes them to <code>puts</code>), but <em>actually</em>, it prints:</p>


<p>What happens here is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>each { |*|</code> is treated in old logic “accept all arguments and discard them;”</li>
  <li><code>puts(*)</code> is treated in the new logic “see if the context has anonymous forwardable arguments”—and consider <em>the method’s arguments</em> as such.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/19370">open discussion</a> on the matter, with a confusing (for me, at least) outcome: the Ruby developers’ meeting seems to be leaning toward an idea of just prohibiting the case like above (<code>*</code>-forwarding inside of a block with <code>*</code> arguments) while allowing more unambiguous cases.</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>What happens on a (mindful) usage of argument forwarding shortcuts is the <strong>onset of explicitness</strong>.</p>

<p>This might sound confusing because the “explicitness” is frequently associated with adding more names to the code or more steps to construct the value. Like splitting the formula into a few named local variables or, instead of passing the result of some method to another, first attaching it to some name. (In pathological cases, it is “every non-trivial call/check/calculation should be its own method with the name explaining its usage.”)</p>

<p>But here, I am talking about <em>the explicitness of the intention</em> of some sizeable chunk of code, a “page” or a “chapter” of it. (In the same way in the intro article <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-02-syntax-sugar.html#how-i-think-about-the-programming-language">I underlined</a> we’ll be talking about the reader’s comfort in comprehension of the narrative instead of the “readability” of a single line.)</p>

<p>Imagine a code like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender: </span><span>sender</span><span>,</span> <span>content: </span><span>content</span><span>,</span> <span>details: </span><span>details</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Such “intermediaries” are frequent in layered systems: the params are already checked and defaults assigned by the layer above; the handling itself would be performed by the layer below; and this current method is just a shortcut in the current module (that probably invokes it many times, so repeating the verbose call of the underlying layer is tiresome).</p>

<p>There are several ways to make this definition shorter, like using <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-11-10-syntax-sugar3-hash-values-omission.html">values omission</a></p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>sender</span><span>:,</span> <span>content</span><span>:,</span> <span>details</span><span>:)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…or “keyword-rest” splatting:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>event_data</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>type</span><span>,</span> <span>**</span><span>event_data</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>But the real intention of this method is just to “pass everything further,” what the author thinks about its argument names is closer to “like, <em>you know,</em> everything” or “yeah, <em>whatever,</em> just pass it” (and frequently would just call the rest arguments <code>**kwrest</code>, or, <code>**options</code>—the latter is a long yet frequently misleading tradition of naming the last hash/keyword argument).</p>

<p>So, eventually, we can be just <strong>explicit</strong> in expressing these “you know” or “whatever”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or, with one-line method definitions (a topic of the next article), just</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>EventBus</span><span>::</span><span>Registry</span><span>.</span><span>instance</span><span>.</span><span>push_event</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Such simplifications might appear in various stages of design. Sometimes, “just pass everything through” is an early-prototype version that allows to quickly assemble the reasonable stack of layers; and later clarify on each step what are the particular responsibilities besides pass-through.</p>

<p>Other times, after a long period of design and clarification, it becomes obvious that a bit of meaningful realignment of layers with each other’s capabilities and expectations allows dripping the trivial things in favor of the literal embodiment of “you know”,  <code>...</code>. The intention to do so sometimes would uncover an unjustified signature change through the layers and, as a <em>consequence</em>, might lead to useful cleanups.</p>

<p>In any case, an ability to designate “what’s obvious/doesn’t matter here” allows the reader to focus better on the other parts: those that <em>are</em> non-trivial and important. Or: if everything is important (and underlined by language means like long explanatory names), then nothing is.</p>

<p>That’s why I am talking about explicitness: akin to the case of <a href="https://zverok.space/blog/2023-10-11-syntax-sugar1-numeric-block-args.html">numbered block parameters</a>, sometimes giving a name to a value is just <strong>pretending</strong> to explain something. In these cases, it is good to have a syntax that allows to be <strong>clear and explicit</strong> about “nothing more to explain here.”</p>

<h2 id="how-others-do-it">How others do it</h2>

<p>Like last time (with “value omission syntax”), I actually struggled to find the <em>exact</em> correspondence of the “pass every argument” syntax: partially, maybe because there is no other languages to arrive to <code>(*args, **kwargs, &amp;block)</code> as the shortest <em>normative</em> way to say “everything that can be passed to a function.”</p>

<p>The design space here is related to accepting to the function a variable number of arguments—the concept is frequently called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varargs">varargs</a>” (frequently demonstrated by formatted-printing functions such as <code>printf</code>). It seems that languages that have them (some, like Rust, consciously do not; Zig had them in the early versions but then decided <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/208#issuecomment-393777148">against</a>), there are a few groups:</p>

<p><strong>Group 1, “The old school”:</strong> make a declaration “variable number of arguments is accepted here” in the function signature, and provide some special name (of variable/function/macro) to access them. Say, in C:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>count</span><span>,</span> <span>...)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>va_list</span> <span>args</span><span>;</span>
  <span>va_start</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>count</span><span>);</span>
  <span>// handle `count` of `args`, calling `va_arg(args, int);` each time</span>
  <span>va_end</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Group 2, “The old school, but dynamic”:</strong> in the old JS and old PHP any function, regardless of its signature, could accept<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> any number of arguments and exposed them with <code>arguments</code> (JS) or <code>func_get_args()</code> (PHP):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>variadic</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>arguments</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>variadic</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span><span>})</span>
<span>// Prints</span>
<span>//   Arguments(4) [1, 2, 3, {foo: 'bar'}]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In a radical variant of this, Perl’s <code>sub</code> doesn’t have a syntax for arguments declaration at all, and all arguments are accessible inside the subroutine in a list variable <code>@_</code>, and the way to designate their names is to assign them to local variables:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>sub </span><span>test</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>my</span><span>(</span><span>$x</span><span>,</span> <span>$y</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>@_</span><span>;</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>"</span><span>x=</span><span>$x</span><span> y=</span><span>$y</span><span>\n</span><span>"</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>test</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>)</span>
<span># prints x=1, y=2</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Group 3, “New school”:</strong> Many languages have a special syntax for a function signature to declare a named parameter that would “catch” the variable list of parameters. Like in modern JS:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>new_variadic</span><span>(...</span><span>myargs</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>myargs</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span>

<span>new_variadic</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span><span>foo</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>bar</span><span>'</span><span>})</span>
<span>// Prints</span>
<span>//   [1, 2, 3, {foo: 'bar'}] -- note no special "Arguments" object wrapper</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The designation used is frequently <code>...</code> or <code>*</code>, though C# uses <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/method-parameters#params-modifier"><code>param</code></a> keyword for such cases, and Kotlin uses <a href="https://kotlin-quick-reference.com/130-R-vararg-parameters.html"><code>vararg</code></a>.</p>

<p>It seems to be a generally agreed-upon practice nowadays.</p>

<p>The symmetric question is also more or less agreed upon<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>: if you have a list/array/tuple of values and want to pass them as separate arguments to some function, there is an operator for that (usually looking the same as “rest arguments” declaration, and frequently called “splat” or “spread”):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>function_with_3_args</span><span>(</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>,</span> <span>arg3</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>arg1</span><span>,</span> <span>arg2</span><span>,</span> <span>arg3</span><span>})</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>args_in_array</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span>
<span>function_with_3_args</span><span>(...</span><span>args_in_array</span><span>)</span>
<span>// Prints: {arg1: 1, arg2: 2, arg3: 3}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>…which provides a way to perform pass-through (accept in one function “whatever arguments passed” and pass them to another function).</p>

<p>It wasn’t a given in old times! In <code>arguments</code> days of JS, “pass all arguments further” was as cumbersome as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>b</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>arguments</span><span>);</span> <span>//arguments[0] = 1, etc</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>function</span> <span>a</span><span>(){</span>
    <span>b</span><span>.</span><span>apply</span><span>(</span><span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>);</span> <span>// pass them through, first `null` is for `this`</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>a</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>2</span><span>,</span><span>3</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So today’s situation (with, usually, just one named “splat” argument to be “splat” further down the layers) is enough for most pass-through situations.</p>

<p>Though, wait!</p>

<p>The interesting thing happened to Lua (as I discovered while writing the article).</p>

<p>As of <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.0/manual.html#2.5.8">version 5.0</a>, it belonged to “group 1”: <code>...</code> in signature to designate “accepts any number of arguments,” a special variable <code>arg</code> with a table of all arguments inside of a function.</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>arg</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>-- prints  1  2  3</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And yet, in <a href="https://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1">Lua 5.1</a>, <code>...</code> <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.5.9">replaced</a> the <code>arg</code>, so now it looks the closest to Ruby’s shortcuts:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>)</span>
<span>-- prints  1  2  3</span>

<span>-- even can be used as a simple variable:</span>
<span>function</span> <span>f</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>...+</span><span>5</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>f</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>-- prints 6</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The world of programming languages evolution is full of wonders!</p>

<hr>

<p>An aside note: the temptation to use the <code>...</code> as a syntax construct along the lines of “and so on” is tempting not only for Ruby and Lua: it is present at least in Python, where bare <code>...</code> produces an object <code>Ellipsis</code>, which can be passed around as a regular value and has various uses:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>method</span><span>():</span>
  <span>...</span> <span># do-nothing method
</span>
<span># specify type of fun as a callable with any input arguments and str result
</span><span>fun</span><span>:</span> <span>Callable</span><span>[...,</span> <span>str</span><span>]</span>

<span>matrix</span> <span>=</span> <span>np</span><span>.</span><span>matrix</span><span>([[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>],</span> <span>[</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>4</span><span>]])</span>
<span># take all data by all dimensions, but only 0th column
</span><span>matrix</span><span>[...,</span> <span>0</span><span>]</span> <span>#=&gt; matrix([[1], [3]])
</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="taking-it-further">Taking it further</h2>

<p>There is one idea that is unlikely to be implemented yet still tempting: can we sometimes shift the place where “well, you know” can be said?</p>

<p>Imagine this code: a frequent idiom for a “callable class” (which might encapsulate a complicated multi-step algorithm that is split into multiple private methods):</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>MyOperation</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>arguments</span><span>,</span> <span>of</span><span>:,</span> <span>various: </span><span>"kinds"</span><span>)</span>
    <span># arguments assignment</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>call</span>
    <span># ... implementation ...</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span># public interface:</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>).</span><span>call</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Its intended usage is simple:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>MyOperation</span><span>.</span><span>call</span><span>(</span><span>with</span><span>,</span> <span>some</span><span>,</span> <span>of: :arguments</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>…which just creates an instance with all arguments passed and immediately invokes its <code>#call</code> (the meat of the implementation) method.</p>

<p>The problem here is that the only public method of this class doesn’t give any information in its signature: neither to render into autogenerated documentation nor to extract via introspection:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>m</span> <span>=</span> <span>MyOperation</span><span>.</span><span>method</span><span>(</span><span>:call</span><span>)</span>
<span>#=&gt; #&lt;Method: MyOperation.call(...)&gt; -- not informative!</span>
<span>m</span><span>.</span><span>parameters</span>
<span>#=&gt; [[:rest, :*], [:keyrest, :**], [:block, :&amp;]] -- not informative either!</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The “callable wrapper” is not the only situation demonstrating this problem: a typical HTTP client implementation might have something like this (if it is written in a modern Ruby):</p>
<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>...</span><span>)</span>
  <span>make_request</span><span>(</span><span>method: :get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here, again, “public interface” method <code>get</code> doesn’t demonstrate any information about its signature (which “private implementation” method <code>make_request</code> knows).</p>

<p>So, maybe it would be possible to still support the “pass everything” syntax in the presence of explicit arguments declaration? As a compromise between “say it the shortest way possible” and “spell everything like a beginner exercise”:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>get</span><span>(</span><span>endpoint</span><span>,</span> <span>params: </span><span>{},</span> <span>headers: </span><span>{},</span> <span>redirect: </span><span>false</span><span>)</span> <span># spell it here</span>
  <span>make_request</span><span>(</span><span>method: :get</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>)</span> <span># "just pass it further" here</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The ticket, describing the idea, <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/16296">exists</a>, but it never received much attention.</p>

<p>BTW, there is place in Ruby where something like this works! Calling <code>super</code> (“parent class’ version of this method”) implicitly passes all arguments of the current method<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, which allows for some very nice shortcuts. Say, here is everything you need to do to add some defaults to a <code>Data</code> initialization:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Measurement</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>Data</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>(</span><span>:amount</span><span>,</span> <span>:unit</span><span>)</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>amount</span><span>:,</span> <span>unit: </span><span>'-none-'</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>super</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>Measurement</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>,</span> <span>'m'</span><span>)</span> <span>#=&gt; #&lt;data Measurement amount=100, unit="m"&gt;</span>
<span>Measurement</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>100</span><span>)</span>      <span>#=&gt; #&lt;data Measurement amount=100, unit="-none-"&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>So, the idea of “accept params declared explicitly, then just pass everything” is not <em>unimaginable</em>, at least!</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>So, here are some things to round up today’s entry:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Not all things should be named</strong>—we already talked about this while discussing numbered block parameters.</li>
  <li><strong>Being explicit about the absence of additional meaning</strong> is a useful kind of explicitness that should be considered to underline the meaningfulness of important parts.</li>
  <li><strong>Sometimes, performance optimization and clarity optimization align like stars</strong>, producing a feature that (while <em>still</em> meeting its haters) might be explained and defended from several points of view at once!</li>
</ol>

<p>The next part will be dedicated to the <strong>one-line (endless) methods</strong>, the syntax feature that was born out of April Fools’ joke.</p>

<p><i><b>I am sitting in a room</b></i> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_art" title="Sound art">sound art</a> piece composed in 1969 and one of composer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_Lucier" title="Alvin Lucier">Alvin Lucier</a>'s best known works.
</p><p>The piece features Lucier recording himself narrating a text, and then playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_tape" title="Magnetic tape">tape recording</a> back into the room, re-recording it. The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Due to the room's particular size and geometry, certain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency" title="Frequency">frequencies</a> of the recording are emphasized while others are attenuated. Eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the characteristic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resonance" title="Resonance">resonant</a> frequencies of the room itself.<sup id="cite_ref-Strickland1993_1-0"><a href="#cite_note-Strickland1993-1">[1]</a></sup>

<p>Lucier states that he was originally inspired to create <i>I Am Sitting in a Room</i> after a colleague mentioned attending a lecture at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</a> in which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amar_Bose" title="Amar Bose">Amar Bose</a> described how he tested characteristics of the loudspeakers he was developing by feeding back audio into them that they had produced in the first place and then was picked up via microphones.<sup id="cite_ref-MIT-YouTube_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-MIT-YouTube-2">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Lucier1995_3-0"><a href="#cite_note-Lucier1995-3">[3]</a></sup>

<blockquote><p>I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now.

What you will hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>In November 2021, former US Representative from Georgia Bob Barr wrote a little-noticed political column claiming that buried inside President Joe Biden’s $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure legislation was a dangerous provision that would go into effect in five years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Marketed to Congress as a benign tool to help prevent drunk driving, the measure will mandate that automobile manufacturers build into every car what amounts to a ‘vehicle kill switch,’”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dailycaller.com/2021/11/29/barr-bidens-infrastructure-bill-contains-backdoor-kill-switch-for-cars/">wrote</a><span>&nbsp;</span>Barr, who was the Libertarian Party’s nominee for president in 2008.</p>
<p>Like most Americans, I had never heard of this alleged “kill switch” until a few days ago when Representative Thomas Massie, a libertarian-leaning Republican, proposed to strip the mandate’s funding.</p>
<p>“The right to travel is fundamental, but the government has mandated a kill-switch in new vehicles sold after 2026,” said Massie. “The kill-switch will monitor driver performance and disable cars based on the information gathered.”</p>
<p>Nineteen Republicans joined all but one Democrat in opposing Massie’s amendment, which failed.</p>
<h3><strong>True or False?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The claim that the feds would mandate that every new motor vehicle include technology that could disable the vehicle seemed ludicrous. So I started Googling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my relief, I saw several fact-checkers at legacy institutions had determined the “kill switch” mandate was not true.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our rating: False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/01/19/fact-check-false-claim-bill-mandates-kill-switch-cars-police-drunk-driving/11066287002/">said</a><span>&nbsp;</span><em>USA Today</em>.</p>
<p>“ASSESSMENT: False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497">said</a><span>&nbsp;</span>the Associated Press.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We rate it Mostly False,”<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2022/dec/05/instagram-posts/-vehicle-technology-coming-stop-impaired-drivers-i/">concluded</a><span>&nbsp;</span>PolitiFact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Snopes, a reliably left-leaning fact check group, was a little less conclusive, saying the claim was a “<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/infrastructure-bill-track-drivers/">mixture</a>” of true and false.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my relief evaporated once I looked at<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text">the bill itself</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sec. 24220 of the law explicitly states: “[T]o ensure the prevention of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, advanced drunk and impaired driving prevention technology must be standard equipment in all new passenger motor vehicles.”</p>
<p>The legislation then goes on to define the technology as a computer system that can<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>“passively monitor the performance</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>of a driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>of a motor vehicle” and can “<strong>prevent or limit motor vehicle operation</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>if an impairment is detected” (emphasis added).&nbsp;</p>
<p>How the system will make this determination is unclear, as is the government’s potential role in apprehending suspected drunk drivers (more on that later).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the law’s language could not be more clear: New motor vehicles must have a computer system to “monitor” drivers, and the system must be able to<span>&nbsp;</span><em>prevent<span>&nbsp;</span></em>vehicle operation if it detects impairment.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr"><p>Fact-checkers at <a href="https://twitter.com/AP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AP</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/USATODAY?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@USATODAY</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/PolitiFact?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PolitiFact</a> are gaslighting you when they say there's no vehicle "kill switch" in Biden's infrastructure law.</p><p>It's true the words "kill switch" are not used.</p><p>But there IS a mandate for a computer that can disable vehicles. <a href="https://t.co/IlbQfed1wQ">pic.twitter.com/IlbQfed1wQ</a></p></div>
— Jon Miltimore (@miltimore79) <a href="https://twitter.com/miltimore79/status/1725562941833908607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2023</a></blockquote>
<h3><strong>“No Mention in the Bill of a ‘Kill Switch’”</strong></h3>
<p>How fact-checkers determined the “kill switch” narrative to be false is odd, especially since the articles don’t deny Barr’s central claim: The legislation mandates a computer system that will monitor driving performance and be able to disable motor vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Associated Press conceded the law would “prevent or limit motor vehicle operation” if the system suspects the driver is impaired, even “disable a vehicle from being operated.” So did<span>&nbsp;</span><em>USA Today</em><span>&nbsp;</span>and PolitiFact.</p>
<p>To arrive at their conclusion that this car-killing mechanism is just a fantasy, fact-checkers resorted to sleight of hand. A common tactic was to debunk social media posts that were actually false or unfounded, like the popular claim that the systems would be required to alert law enforcement if the drivers were deemed impaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“None of the technologies currently in development would notify law enforcement,” the Associated Press assured readers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an odd bit of uniformity, each of the fact-checkers said spokespeople for groups who support the system, such as MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving), told them they would never support giving law enforcement access to the system.</p>
<p>My personal favorite, however, was PolitiFact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[We] found no mention in the bill of a ‘kill switch,’” PolitiFact concluded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea that the absence of the words “kill switch” in the bill is evidence that a disabling mechanism doesn’t actually exist in the legislation is nothing short of gaslighting.</p>
<h3><strong>‘Secure in Persons and Effects’?&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>The unpleasant truth is that lawmakers slipped into a massive spending bill a mandate that stands to require all new vehicles to have AI-driven technology that can disable your vehicle if the technology determines you’ve had one beer too many. And fact-checkers are using headlines to make it sound as if the legislation does no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s true there is currently no mechanism in the legislation that would require law enforcement to be notified if drivers are suspected of inebriation. But the Associated Press<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-402773429497">notes</a><span>&nbsp;</span>that the law “leaves most of the details up to NHTSA” (the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) to determine at a future date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my reading of the bill, there is nothing in the legislation that would prevent NHTSA from requesting or receiving this data. Does anyone believe that in 2027, if the NHTSA requested that system manufacturers turn over the information they collect, it would be told no? Don’t bet on it. The Twitter Files show how quick companies comply when the feds come knocking on their door to retrieve their data, and just how little they care about the privacy of Americans.</p>
<p>And that word — privacy — barely appears in any of the three “fact-checks.” (The single instance is when a MADD spokesman assured readers that the organization remains committed to driver privacy, even though it was supporting a computer system that spies on drivers.) The notion that a system that “passively monitors” drivers might infringe the privacy of Americans doesn’t even seem to have crossed their minds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this shouldn’t be surprising. In a world where traffic cameras, license plate readers, NSA mass surveillance, intelligence-gathering “<a href="https://reason.com/2023/01/06/government-snoops-in-maine-caught-spying-on-peaceful-americans/">fusion centers</a>,” and widespread<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.hopelefeber.com/rise-in-warrantless-searches-at-the-fbi/#:~:text=The%20report%20indicated%20that%20the,the%20same%20kind%20of%20searches.">warrantless searches</a><span>&nbsp;</span>are ubiquitous, privacy might seem like a quaint idea. But it’s one the Framers of the American system took seriously.</p>
<p>“The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated,” the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution reads.</p>
<p>I’m not a constitutional scholar, but it seems to me that the federal government’s requiring automobile manufacturers to install a system that spies on its driver — and disables his car if transgressions are suspected — hardly meets this constitutional standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also suspect mandating the installation of this technology is something Americans of all political stripes would overwhelmingly oppose on principle — put aside for now the immense<span>&nbsp;</span><em>cost<span>&nbsp;</span></em>on new vehicle purchases it will add — if they knew about it, which is no doubt why the provision was surreptitiously slipped into a $1 trillion spending bill.</p>
<h3><strong>The True Purpose of the Surveillance State</strong></h3>
<p>Then again, maybe Americans wouldn’t care if they knew about federal legislation that mandates tech to disable their cars if it suspects that last glass of wine — which you may or may not have had — put you over the limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Robert E. Wright<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.aier.org/article/government-surveillance-injures-the-innocent/">has pointed out</a>, once upon a time, Americans considered spying an invasion of privacy, but those days are mostly gone. Increasingly, many take an “I have nothing to hide” approach. Few seem to realize they are almost certainly breaking laws each day unknowingly, and I’m not talking about driving 65 in a 55 mph zone.</p>
<p>In his popular book<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229"><em>Three Felonies a Day</em></a>, author Harvey A. Silverglate noted that the typical American commits just that: three felonies<span>&nbsp;</span><em>per day</em><span>&nbsp;</span>(four, if you see a felony and don’t report it, which is also a crime).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last century, the Land of the Free has slowly transformed into a land governed by endless laws, largely by<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/vices-are-not-crimes-lysander-spooners-timeless-lesson/?utm_source=aier&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jon-op-ed&amp;utm_content=kill-switch-vices">cracking down on vices</a><span>&nbsp;</span>instead of actual crimes, creating a society that would render us all criminals if our behavior were constantly observed. Meanwhile, the state has steadily expanded its use of mass surveillance, largely under the pretext of fighting “terror.”</p>
<p>This is a toxic mixture, yet most people seem largely oblivious to the danger it poses. Americans love citing<span>&nbsp;</span><em>1984</em>, but it seems few have actually read it. If they had, they’d realize that the terror of living under a surveillance state was the primary theme of George Orwell’s masterpiece, which was<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/3-real-life-inspirations-for-george-orwell-s-1984/?utm_source=aier&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=jon-op-ed&amp;utm_content=kill-switch-orwell">inspired by</a><span>&nbsp;</span>actual totalitarian states.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple glimpse into the history books reveals few things are quite as terrifying as a surveillance state. (To experience a taste, I recommend Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck’s fantastic 2006 German film<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://amzn.to/3G2xmsI"><em>The Lives of Others</em></a>.) It’s chilling even to imagine what the<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://fee.org/articles/10-terrifying-facts-about-the-east-german-secret-police/">Stasi</a><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/NKVD">NKVD</a><span>&nbsp;</span>could do with modern surveillance technology.</p>
<p>The United States is not a totalitarian state, but its<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://nypost.com/2022/12/16/fbi-treated-twitter-as-subsidiary-flagged-tweets-for-misinformation/">growing efforts</a><span>&nbsp;</span>to control information — which have grown more obvious and ambitious — show that it’s not a neutral bystander, either. Those in government have their agendas, and they are not known for playing nice with those who cross them (just ask Edward Snowden and Julian Assange).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which brings us to the raison d’être of mass surveillance.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>“The asymmetry of the surveillance state belies its true purpose: to protect the government, not the people,” writes Wright.&nbsp;</p><p>Once one understands this, it becomes clear why many see grand potential in a law that requires every single new motor vehicle in the country to be monitored and potentially disabled by a computer — and why<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/invasion-fact-checkers">rent-a-cop fact-checkers</a><span>&nbsp;</span>would go through such contortions to downplay this dystopian mandate.</p></div>

        <div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>The most talented data engineer I know, and my first manager, is a man that loves cooking. I mean, you might <em>think</em> you love cooking, but this guy <em>loves</em> cooking. The most excited text message I received this year was from him, proudly <a href="https://combustion.inc/">sharing the goddamn analytics on the heat distribution of chicken in his oven with his newly imported thermometer</a>. We're talking about a culinary madman, capable of anything. The first book he gave me was not remotely related to any technical stack we ran, but was instead a <a href="https://modernistcuisine.com/">2,438 page <em>manifesto</em></a> on cooking. My current relationship is built on the back of a meal he advised me to prepare on the third date.</p>
<p>Every day, we would step out of the office to get some coffee, and on at least three separate occasions we ended up talking about the difficulty of running a top-tier kitchen. And, most shockingly, on all of those occasions, he professed an admiration for the complexity required for McDonald's to run.</p>
<p>At first, this startled me - McDonald's! I enjoy myself a mediocre burger as much as the next guy fresh out of university, but the man that graphs the cooking of his chicken is impressed by the place that hungover college students go for their nutrition? Well, it turns out that even if you don't hold the quality of the output in particularly high regard, the optimizations and discipline required to ensure that two different acne-ridden teens with wildly varied education levels, separated by oceans, are capable of producing the same burger are <em>non-trivial</em> to say the least.</p>
<p>The man in question catches up on this blog every few weeks, and will be horrified to discover that when you tell a young, impressionable engineer anything, they're going to think about it for three years and then write their own manifesto.</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-glimpse-into-the-c-suite-mindset">A Brief Glimpse Into The C-Suite Mindset</h2>
<p>Many years ago, trying to figure out what the goddamn hell is going on in the tech industry, I ended up reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/17255186">The Phoenix Project</a>. This isn't the main point of bringing the book up, but let's take a brief detour to appreciate how bizarre some parts of it are. Here's the blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO.</p>
<p>The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced.</p>
<p>With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's right, there's a whole genre of corporate fanfiction out there. Was it useful to read? Yes. Does it miss some of the <em>real</em> barriers to organizations improving? Yes, which I should talk about in another article. Was it cringe-inducing at points? <em>Hell yes</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’d use that information to drive our production schedule, so we can manage our supply and demand curves. We’d keep the right products on the right store shelves and keep them stocked. Our revenue per customer would go through the roof. Our average order sizes would go up. We’d finally increase our market share and start beating the competition again.”</p>
<p>As she’s telling us this, she looks animated and excited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh <em>baby</em>, average order size would go up?  I couldn't <em>be</em> more animated and excited. It should not surprise anyone that it <a href="https://itrevolution.com/author/gene-kim/">required a CTO</a> to unironically write the prose above. It's almost surprising that the next page doesn't talk about how the newfound synergies between the infrastructure team and the developers have made the protagonist positively <em>turgid</em>. But I digress.</p>
<p>The general thrust of the book describes how I.T operations work a lot like a factory floor, and that this has implications for how the flow of work through the organization should be thought about and managed. In fact, the entire book consists of a strange man appearing periodically and giving the protagonist cryptic hints on how to be DevOps-pilled, like if Gandalf knew the only way to defeat Sauron was to help Bilbo fulfill all of his organizational commitments in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Some interesting ideas there, but then I realized that there are a <em>few</em> books that express this kind of sentiment. Quite a few. For one thing, the author has <em>another</em> very popular book out called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/44333183">The Unicorn Project</a>. Then there's <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/60872200">Investments Unlimited</a>. And they're all inspired by another book called <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113934.The_Goal">The Goal</a>, which is almost the same plot but instead involves a character changing the operations on an actual factory floor, with slightly less cringe-worthy dialogue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Written in a fast-paced thriller style, The Goal is the gripping novel which is transforming management thinking throughout the Western world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ooh, a fast-paced story about improving factory throughput? Fuck yes, I'm getting shivers just thinking about it. These all sound like novels that aliens wrote because they've only been able to decrypt the traffic from LinkedIn.</p>
<p>And then I read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/324750">High Output Management</a> which really <em>was</em> good without having as many caveats around the tepid style. It's straightforward and gives good advice for the effective operation of the soulless corporate machine, and it does not aspire to be anything else. And <em>even that</em> starts with an example of how works flows through a restaurant, complete with a description of how putting eggs on to boil at the wrong time is going to result in cold toast by the time it reaches the customer. A <em>very</em> large component to all this thinking is about economies of scale and the flow of work - these themes come up over and over again.</p>
<h2 id="mcdata">McData</h2>
<p>Many months later, and I was walking around the floor <a href="https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/an-empty-hall-of-smiling-assassins/">of a vendor conference</a> and something began to strike me in the offerings. On this particular day, I happened to be wearing a white shirt with a nice coat, and I suspect many of the salespeople mistook me for management, because they started to pitch me <em>aggressively</em> on their products.</p>
<p>As a rough rule, I knew the products were not particularly good. I've been burned too many times by seeing organizations purchase shitty enterprise software which promises to fix all of the organization's woes. Just buy Salesforce, or Workday, or Informatica, or whatever! Your staff said $CURRENT_SYSTEM is bad, so buy $NEW_SYSTEM. I'd heard it all before, usually in the context of deprecating $NEW_SYSTEM for $NEW_NEW_SYSTEM because $NEW_SYSTEM fucking suuuuucks. I currently believe that there's only one way to buy yourself out of technical issues and bad data models, and that's buying a really talented engineer whose sole focus is fixing the problem.</p>
<p>But what interested me is that they did not spend any time selling me on the technical details of the product. The pitches were <em>entirely</em> focused on something I wouldn't have noticed prior to reading all those books - they were focused on the reproducible delivery of work that was <em>good enough</em> to accomplish business objectives, without having to rely on all those pesky technicians to be good enough to do the job correctly. </p>
<p>For example, one pitch in particular was for a product which promised to remove the need for me to write SQL in exchange for being able to set up all my dependencies from a drag-and-drop editor, with the sales pitch consisting of "You can get rid of thousands of lines of all that SQL you hate!" - no I can't, fucko, because your application is still connecting to Postgres so it's just writing the SQL for me with another layer of licensed abstraction on top of it. Why would I <em>pay</em> to have more abstractions designed for <em>you</em> to sell software to multiple clients, you blue-suited dementor? Eight times out of ten, I want to pay you to <em>remove</em> them from my codebase.</p>
<p>Well, <em>you and I</em> understand that. But I suspect that what an <em>almost</em> savvy executive hears is a little bit closer to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You know that slow, painful SQL that you keep hearing is causing problems? We've got a drag-and-drop interface, so that you can now hire replaceable cogs to do the dragging-and-dropping at a consistent rate. And there's a consistent interface, and a bunch of specialists in this tool on the market, so you can easily ensure the smooth, consistent delivery of data through the organization! Consistent!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or in another context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you buy a BurgerMaster 5000, you can just drop any teenager behind this thing with thirty minutes of training, and they're going to be able to turn out a burger that's good enough to sell! It's going to be the same burger every time, wherever you ship it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They might not be thinking in <em>exactly</em> these terms, because I genuinely have good reason to believe that the median executive has trouble reading anything that isn't printed in a font so large that it feels like the writer is screaming affirmations at them, but I think this is the <em>gist</em> of the sales pitch. It is the promise that you can do away with the pesky implementation details of hiring correctly, or addressing all the bad decisions your predecessors made, or even telling your stakeholders that you've over-promised. Nah, you just buy the increased throughput widget, and now all the story points will be done on time.</p>
<p>Heck, even the way Agile is typically implemented at your average (read: dysfunctional and ineffective) workplace reflects this mindset. You count up how many units (story points) of parts (deliverables) that your machines (engineers) can produce, and then you let 'em rip, only to return next week and wonder why the machines only ever hit 50% of their target.</p>
<h2 id="its-fucking-raw">It's Fucking Raw</h2>
<p>And here's where it all falls apart. All of that sounds great - economies of scale, reproducibility, robustness, blah, blah, blah. McDonald's almost never fails to produce fries of approximately the correct quality, within five minutes, every single time I've asked for them, and some of the absolute sons of bitches that I've worked for have <em>clearly never shipped something that delivered value in their whole careers</em>. They just buy a license for bad software, say that they've successfully implemented it since no one can really check, then leave before the ambient hatred radiating off the people forced to work with the system reaches a level that they can't tolerate.</p>
<p>Let me repeat that again more bluntly - <em>we haven't figured out how to commodify a lot of this work</em>. Despite my adoration and vested financial interested in computing being something companies need to pay me for, it would actually be <em>really nice</em> if we could do this successfully. I would adore it if the doctors and nurses in my life didn't constantly lament the stream of indignities that their single-neuron administrators heap upon them with each new proprietary system, even if it forced me to find a new career. Some of these things are just important, but we <em>can't do it yet</em>. There might be the <em>appearance</em> that many of these things can be neatly commodified, but the majority of these seem to simply be companies that shouldn't exist selling a product that doesn't work to <em>other</em> companies that have oblivious decision-makers.</p>
<p>(And sometimes, an evil decision-maker that has realized you can just man the phone lines from the third world for pennies because it technically means you're legally compliant, and you don't care about customers that are cancelling anyway. Whenever I need to talk to support staff, I try call the <em>sales</em> line first and see if they'll fast-track me, because I will get a local with the authority to <em>do things</em> in 30 seconds.)</p>
<p>Rich Hickey has a delightful talk titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock Driven Development</a>, which I highly recommend. On the topic of innovation, Rich Hickey is the creator (or at least, the most prominent creator) of Clojure, so he <em>probably</em> has more innovation points than the lower half of the world's managers <em>combined</em>. My man is out here advocating of a workflow that consists of feeding your subconscious mind research for four hours, then meditating on it for another two, then <em>sleeping</em> and praying that the Gods of Design simply bless you with an answer in the morning - a strange workflow that I experienced when I was writing my Master's thesis, where I solved problems that feel <em>well</em> beyond my ability now, or even in old stories I've heard about the legendary <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/imagination-and-the-imagi_b_8178538">Poincaré</a>.</p>
<p>In fact, <em>all programmers</em> seem to have experienced the strange phenomena where they walk away and the answer comes to them.</p>
<p>There's plenty of work that consists of simply churning out widgets faster, and I'm happy to see that work disappear (so long as we find a way for people to continue living healthily without it), but it must be acknowledged that many of the things we value in society come from an ill-defined, more vital place, and there is an intersection of that spark with the realities of production.</p>
<p>You can pay people to churn out bad self-help all day, but none of those are going to be worth a damn without allowing the human element to flourish. But you still need a factory which can print the things, and as clinical as a mass bookbinding operations sounds, I really believe that you're only going to get a beautiful binding when that factory is run by people who have the connection to the work necessary to exercise taste.</p>
<p>Maybe you can refine the delivery of a beautiful meal at a restaurant, but the meal itself is born from a person's creativity and aesthetic sense, trying to weigh itself against the realities of financial constraints. You can streamline it, and you can deliver the same meal every day, but I've <em>seen</em> the meticulous care of a professional chef running a restaurant in my home country, and successful commodification <em>still requires</em> intense caring.</p>
<p>You can try all you want to reduce the delivery of features to a Jira board and mumbling about Agile, but you're not going to get anything worthwhile out of people if you can't connect with them. You think an engineer good enough to have opinions on the relative elegance of cryptic symbols in an IDE can work without an element of soul, because it would be <em>convenient</em> if he was more like a widget-producing machine? Hah.</p>
<p>Heck, I know someone that designs some of the chips that go into iPhones, and you'd <em>think</em> that would be commodified to hell and back, but at the end of the day it's actually my uncle staying up to 3 AM, calling me from the U.S because he'd like to keep in touch despite the workload - and if that guy gets sick, they're probably <em>actually going to have to delay the next release</em>. There's crazy infrastructure to allow them to test and mass produce those chips, but <em>individual people</em> make that machine run.</p>
<p>There are harsh realities to grapple with, and society runs on commodification, but anyone that thinks that you can run on <em>pure</em> commodification, without any understanding of their specific craft, or the human complexities, needs, and frailties of the people around them, who think that you can just buy more enterprise licenses and that giving someone a salary is enough reason for them to subjugate the entirety of themselves as they turn up to work every day...</p>
<p>Well, you're wrong, and you can fucking bite me.</p>

            <p>
                By adding the <code>#[\Override]</code> attribute to a method, PHP will ensure that a method with the same name exists in a parent class or in an implemented interface. Adding the attribute makes it clear that overriding a parent method is intentional and simplifies refactoring, because the removal of an overridden parent method will be detected.            </p>

<p>How Apple's Pro Display XDR takes Thunderbolt 3 to its limit</p><hr>
<p>I like Thunderbolt a lot. Mostly because USB's land of optional features is a mess which makes choosing a cable/peripheral difficult. With thunderbolt you have a single number to get right. And then you are supposed to be golden. However the idyll with Intel's interface took a hit
  when I tried to make sense of Apple's Pro Display XDR requirements.
</p>


<img loading="lazy" src="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/xdr5.webp" width="1308" height="438">
<span><i><small>Apple's Pro Display XDR (2019)</small></i></span>

<p>If we take a look at the monitor's <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/Pro_Display_White_Paper_Feb_2020.pdf">Technology Overview</a> we find an impressive list of features.
  On top of its gorgeous design is listed 1600 nits brightness, 6K (6,144 x 3,456) resolution, 60fps, P3 wide gamut, 32", one Thunderbolt-3 port, and three USB ports. USB-2 ports.
</p>

<p>Wait, what? USB-2? From the year 2000? As in 480 Mbps? And what are the small prints at the bottom?

</p><blockquote>7. For the 16-inch
MacBook Pro, USB-C ports have USB 3.1 Gen 1 data transfer speeds<a name="back_1" href="#footnote_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</blockquote>

<p>What is going on?</p>



<p>Let's do the math</p><hr><p>According to Intel's Thunderbolt-3 <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/tb3_brief.pdf">technology brief</a>, the interface has a bandwidth of 40 Gbps. Let's remove 20% due to 8b/10 encoding. This leaves 32 Gbps of actual bandwidth. With the 6,144 x 3,456 @ 60Hz / 10bpc plugged into a <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/729232-guide-to-display-cables-adapters-v2/?section=calc&amp;H=6016&amp;V=3384&amp;F=60&amp;calculations=show&amp;formulas=show">calculator</a>, the display requires roughly 31 Gbps.</p>

<p>This means Thunderbolt 3 bandwidth is nearly maxed out with only 32-31 = 1Gbps left. This can only fit USB 2 traffic. The math adds up.</p>


<p>But why is the 16-inch MacBook Pro able to run USB 3.1 (10Gbps)? Because it is able to compress the display stream!</p>

  

<p>Thunderbolt 3</p><hr><p>If you are a thunderbolt connoisseur, you will argue that there is no support for Display Stream Compression (DSC) in Thunderbolt 3. Intel's brief only mentions support up to DisplayPort 1.2a and there is no compression in that protocol.</p>

<p>But things get interesting when we look at the controllers. The brief of the first generation of Thunderbol3 controllers, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/18-241_ThunderboltController_Brief_HI.pdf">Alpine Ridge Brief (series 6000)</a>, mentions no DSC. But the brief of the second generation of controllers, <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/18-241_Thunder7000Controller_Brief_FIN_HI.pdf">Titan Ridge (series 7000)</a>, does (via DisplayPort 1.4 support).</p>

<p>What is likely, is that there is something in the XDR which supports DisplayPort 1.4 (Titan Ridge?). And macs before the 16-inch MacBook Pro 2019 did not support it (Alpine Ridge?).</p>

<p>I am unsure it was a good idea to allow Thunderbolt 3 capabilities to differ based on the controller. On one side it allowed things like the XDR to exist. On the other, it fragmented Thunderbolt which used to be a selling point versus USB.</p>

<p>The result is that consumers have a hard time knowing if they will have USB 2 or USB 3.1 on their XDR. For a piece of hardware of that price that is rather annoying.</p>

<p>Thunderbolt 4</p><hr><p>What future for 6K+ displays? Thunderbolt 4 was released in 2020 along with Intel's 8000-series controllers called <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16333/intel-maple-ridge-thunderbolt-4-controller-now-shipping">Maple Ridge</a>. It did not increase the bandwidth, which stayed at 40 Gbps, but it made support for DisplayPort 1.4 (and therefore DSC) mandatory.</p>

<p>This version allows supporting display configuration such as 8K@60Hz.
</p>


<p>Thunderbolt 5</p><hr><p>Thunderbolt 5 was <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/TBT5%20Press%20Deck%20v3%20Final.pdf">announced</a> in September 2023. We should start seeing Barlow Ridge (series-9000) controllers in 2024.</p>

<p> The combination of 120 Gbps "Bandwidth Boost", DisplayPort 2.1, and PCIe Gen4x4 will allows multiple 8K display, up to 540Hz refresh rates, and up to three 4K@144Hz if you want to replicate Al Gore's <a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/xdr/al.webp">2007 legendary setup</a> (although he only got triple 2560 x 1600 @ 60Hz).

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                        <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Appearing in the biggest antitrust trial in a quarter century, DuckDuckGo founder Gabriel Weinberg testified Thursday that it was hard for his small search engine company to compete with Google because the powerhouse has deals with phone companies and equipment manufacturers to make its product the default search option on so many devices.</p><p>“We hit an obstacle with Google’s contracts,’' Weinberg said in U.S. District Court in Washington.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice argues that Google has smothered competition by paying companies such as Apple and Verizon to lock in its search engine as the default choice — the first one users see — on many laptops and smartphones. Google counters that it dominates the internet search market because its product is better than the competition. </p>
    

<p>Even when it holds the default spot on smartphones and other devices, Google argues, users can switch to rival search engines with a couple of clicks.</p>



<p>But Weinberg testified that getting users to switch from Google was complicated, requiring as many as 30 to 50 steps to change defaults on all their devices, whereas the process could be shortened to just one click on each device.</p>
<p>“The search defaults are the primary barrier,’' he said. “It’s too many steps.’'</p><p>The MIT graduate started DuckDuckGo in his basement in Pennsylvania in 2008, plucking its name from a children’s game. After a couple years, the company began positioning itself as a search engine that respects people’s privacy by promising not to track what users search for or where they have been. Such tracking results can be used to create detailed user profiles and “creepy ads,’' Weinberg said.</p><p>“People don’t like ads that follow them around,’' he said. DuckDuckGo’s internal surveys, he said, show privacy is the biggest concern among users, beating their desire for the best search results.</p>
    

<p>DuckDuckGo still sells ads, but bases them on what people are asking its search engine in the moment, a technique known as “contextual advertising.” That focus on privacy helped the company attract more users after the Edward Snowden saga raised awareness about the pervasiveness of online surveillance. It gained even more customers after Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal opened a window into how personal information extracted from digital services can be passed around to other data brokers.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is privately held, so doesn’t disclose its finances. But it has said that it’s been profitable for several years and brings in more than $100 million in annual revenue. That’s loose change for Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which generated $283 billion in revenue last year. </p><p>DuckDuckGo still handles only 2.5% of U.S. search queries, Weinberg testified Thursday.</p><p>Under questioning from Google, Weinberg said much of DuckDuckGo’s search capability originated with Microsoft’s Bing search engine and was not homegrown. The company had allowed Microsoft to track some DuckDuckGo users until a security researcher flagged the practice in 2022.</p><p>Weinberg apologized at the time and DuckDuckGo tightened its tracker blocking to include Microsoft.</p>
    

<p>In earlier testimony, Eric Lehman, a former Google software engineer, seemed to question one of the Justice Department’s key arguments: that Google’s dominance is entrenched because of the massive amount of data it collects from user clicks, which the company in turn leverages to improve future searches faster than competitors can.</p><p>But Lehman said machine learning has improved rapidly in recent years, to the point that computers can evaluate text on their own without needing to analyze data from user clicks.</p><p>In a 2018 email produced in court, Lehman wrote that Google rivals such as Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, China’s Baidu, Russia’s Yandex or even startups could use machine learning to improve internet searches and challenge Google’s lead in the industry.</p><p>“Huge amounts of user feedback can be largely replaced by unsupervised learning of raw text,’’ he wrote.</p><p>In court Thursday, Lehman said his best guess is that search engines will shift largely from relying on user data to relying on machine learning.</p><p>During the exchange, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta drew a laugh by asking how internet searches would answer one of pop culture’s most pressing questions this week: whether superstar singer Taylor Swift is dating NFL tight end Travis Kelce.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

        
        



	    

	    





<p>Jehan Pages who is the lead developer and maintainer of GIMP made an announcement on Patreon yesterday. GIMP 3.0 is tentatively scheduled for release in May 2024. The plan is to announce the release at the next Libre Graphics Meeting conference in France. There is a page that details the roadmap.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the paint points: stopping development of new features while trying to get non-destructive editing into 3.0, making more API changes, fixing a load of bugs.</p>

<p>
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WOTj0TvZkzU" allowfullscreen="" title="YouTube Video" loading="lazy"></iframe>
</p>

<p>Below goes edited transcript of the video.</p>
<h2 id="feature-freeze">
    <a href="#feature-freeze">
	Feature freeze
    </a>
</h2>
<p>Right off the bat, the proposal is to start with a feature freeze in the middle of December. A feature freeze basically means this. Every new line of code that you write has the potential to introduce a new bug or even many bugs. So if you expect to release software that doesn’t crash much and doesn’t throw too many error messages at users, at some point you have to stop writing new features and focus on fixing bugs.</p>
<p>Today is the 22nd of November, the tentative release date is around May 9 of the next year, that makes nearly 5 months between now and the release and closer to 4 months between the feature freeze and the release.</p>
<p>There are three major topics here to unpack.</p>
<h2 id="non-destructive-editing">
    <a href="#non-destructive-editing">
	Non-destructive editing
    </a>
</h2>
<p>First of all, development of new features has been decelerating over the past few years, with focus shifted towards completing the port to GTK3. But most recently CmykStudent resumed his Google Summer of Code project where he hacked on non-destructive filters attached to layers.</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/gimp-3-0-roadmap/layer-properties.webp" alt="Filters in Layer Properties" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>The interface you see here (the bottom part of the screenshot above) is pretty much a slight evolution of the non-destructive embryo that has already been there for many years. The real deal will look nothing like this. It’s just that the public branch doesn’t yet have the latest work that CmykStudent demonstrated on Twitter recently:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://librearts.org/2023/11/gimp-3-0-roadmap/layer-effects-drop-out.webp" alt="Layer Effects slide-out" loading="lazy">
</p>


<p>If you have a look at the <a href="https://developer.gimp.org/core/specifications/layer-effects-ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full proposal</a> on the GIMP developers website, you’ll see that it should be possible to stack effects and edit their masks. They thought about a lot of things, which is great.</p>
<p>But it also looks like completing the full proposal is not something you can do in 3 to 4 weeks before the feature freeze. So there is a strong possibility that we will either end up with a basic implementation for 3.0 and then see more in the next updates. Or the developers will postpone this patch till version 3.0.2 that is expected to be released soon after 3.0.</p>
<p>In other words, the worst case scenario here is that GIMP 3.0 loses that bit of numerology where a release with a fancy number gets a fancy new feature. Personally, I’m okay with that idea. We’ve been waiting for non-destructive editing for frigging 23 years since the beginning of the work on GEGL, two or three more months — it’s not too bad. But judging by the response on Twitter the first possibility is more likely to happen which means a basic implementation in 3.0:</p>

    <blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah, the GUI can be improved iteratively (as long as it's not *horrible*; i.e. not perfect yet in releasable state). Though the file format side will have to be stable (this can't change version after version for compatibility).<br>I think it is feasible for <a href="https://twitter.com/CmykStudent?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CmykStudent</a> ! :-)</p>— @ZeMarmot@fosstodon.org (@zemarmot) <a href="https://twitter.com/zemarmot/status/1727066806282842537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2023</a></blockquote>




<p>So let’s wait and see.</p>
<h2 id="api-changes">
    <a href="#api-changes">
	API changes
    </a>
</h2>
<p>The second important topic is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API</a> changes. This is something I’m actually more concerned about. Historically, this has been the number one reason for long, long development cycles in GIMP. Jehan specifically says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not including API features on purpose in the freeze, because I think an additional month for the last little tweaks may be worth it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the ongoing changes here is the new API that helps make GIMP more omnivore in terms of color spaces and color models. So instead of functions like GimpRGB and GimpCMYK built right inside GIMP you get an exposure to all the color models available in <a href="https://gegl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GEGL</a> and <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">babl</a>, and that’s a lot.</p>
<p>babl <a href="https://gegl.org/babl/Reference.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports</a> the entire CIE family of color models — LAB, LCH, YUV, XYZ — as well as newer things like <a href="https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OKlab</a>. Not to mention CMYK, HSV, HSL, and friends. Most recently, GEGL itself <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gegl/-/commit/3c4479f6511f1fc6f7f31a33fd938f5427286bfa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got functions</a> for getting and setting CMYK colors.</p>
<p>My primary concern here is that getting and setting colors is something that happens in GIMP all the time, even if you don’t see it in the user interface. Just searching for ‘GimpRGB’ reveals almost 800 instances in the part related to user interface and over 400 instances in the backend code. That’s a lot.</p>
<p>Which means that attempting to complete this API rewrite in time for the release will keep Jehan away from bug fixing. And that is the third important topic here.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixing">
    <a href="#bug-fixing">
	Bug fixing
    </a>
</h2>
<p>The situation with bugs in GIMP — and I’m sorry I have no other words for this — is getting out of hand. They recently <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passed the 4K mark</a>, which is, like, a 30% increase in just about a year. Of those 4K+ bug reports and feature requests a whopping <a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gimp/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=1.%20Crash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">624 bugs</a> are crashers. And that is just crazy.</p>
<p>One possibility here is to declare amnesty for all bug reports filed against the current stable series and then reopen the ones that will be reproduced by users in the new release. That would be a quite horrible policy of dealing with bug reports. But given the bug reporting dynamics and the availability of developers, I just don’t see any other way to handle this. It’s that or never getting to actually do the release.</p>
<p>There are many more things I’m still concerned about. The incorrect scale at which the canvas is rendered on HiDPI displays, the insane controls in tool settings, and other things.</p>
<p>Look, I’m just being realistic here. Completing this release is going to take a huge toll on the team. If you are in a position to help them with stabilizing the program, please consider doing so.</p>
<p>Once 3.0 is released, we can have a long conversation about the way the team plans their work, which is not great, and the way they finance it, which is even worse. But right now the community needs to finish off this SOB of a release.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As neural systems such as the brain organise themselves and make connections, they have to balance competing demands. For example, energy and resources are needed to grow and sustain the network in physical space, while at the same time optimising the network for information processing. This trade-off shapes all brains within and across species, which may help explain why many brains converge on similar organisational solutions.</p>

<p>Jascha Achterberg, a Gates Scholar from the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit (MRC CBU) at the University of Cambridge said: “Not only is the brain great at solving complex problems, it does so while using very little energy. In our new work we show that considering the brain’s problem solving abilities alongside its goal of spending as few resources as possible can help us understand why brains look like they do.”</p>

<p>Co-lead author Dr Danyal Akarca, also from the MRC CBU, added: “This stems from a broad principle, which is that biological systems commonly evolve to make the most of what energetic resources they have available to them. The solutions they come to are often very elegant and reflect the trade-offs between various forces imposed on them.”</p>

<p>In a study published today in <em>Nature Machine Intelligence</em>, Achterberg, Akarca and colleagues created an artificial system intended to model a very simplified version of the brain and applied physical constraints. They found that their system went on to develop certain key characteristics and tactics similar to those found in human brains.</p>

<p>Instead of real neurons, the system used computational nodes. Neurons and nodes are similar in function, in that each takes an input, transforms it, and produces an output, and a single node or neuron might connect to multiple others, all inputting information to be computed.</p>

<p>In their system, however, the researchers applied a ‘physical’ constraint on the system. Each node was given a specific location in a virtual space, and the further away two nodes were, the more difficult it was for them to communicate. This is similar to how neurons in the human brain are organised.</p>

<p>The researchers gave the system a simple task to complete – in this case a simplified version of a maze navigation task typically given to animals such as rats and macaques when studying the brain, where it has to combine multiple pieces of information to decide on the shortest route to get to the end point.</p>

<p>One of the reasons the team chose this particular task is because to complete it, the system needs to maintain a number of elements – start location, end location and intermediate steps – and once it has learned to do the task reliably, it is possible to observe, at different moments in a trial, which nodes are important. For example, one particular cluster of nodes may encode the finish locations, while others encode the available routes, and it is possible to track which nodes are active at different stages of the task.</p>

<p>Initially, the system does not know how to complete the task and makes mistakes. But when it is given feedback it gradually learns to get better at the task. It learns by changing the strength of the connections between its nodes, similar to how the strength of connections between brain cells changes as we learn. The system then repeats the task over and over again, until eventually it learns to perform it correctly.</p>

<p>With their system, however, the physical constraint meant that the further away two nodes were, the more difficult it was to build a connection between the two nodes in response to the feedback. In the human brain, connections that span a large physical distance are expensive to form and maintain.</p>

<p>When the system was asked to perform the task under these constraints, it used some of the same tricks used by real human brains to solve the task. For example, to get around the constraints, the artificial systems started to develop hubs – highly connected nodes that act as conduits for passing information across the network.</p>

<p>More surprising, however, was that the response profiles of individual nodes themselves began to change: in other words, rather than having a system where each node codes for one particular property of the maze task, like the goal location or the next choice, nodes developed a flexible coding scheme. This means that at different moments in time nodes might be firing for a mix of the properties of the maze. For instance, the same node might be able to encode multiple locations of a maze, rather than needing specialised nodes for encoding specific locations. This is another feature seen in the brains of complex organisms.</p>

<p>Co-author Professor Duncan Astle, from Cambridge’s Department of Psychiatry, said: “This simple constraint – it’s harder to wire nodes that are far apart – forces artificial systems to produce some quite complicated characteristics. Interestingly, they are characteristics shared by biological systems like the human brain. I think that tells us something fundamental about why our brains are organised the way they are.”</p>

<h2>Understanding the human brain</h2>

<p>The team are hopeful that their AI system could begin to shed light on how these constraints, shape differences between people’s brains, and contribute to differences seen in those that experience cognitive or mental health difficulties.</p>

<p>Co-author Professor John Duncan from the MRC CBU said: “These artificial brains give us a way to understand the rich and bewildering data we see when the activity of real neurons is recorded in real brains.”</p>

<p>Achterberg added: “Artificial ‘brains’ allow us to ask questions that it would be impossible to look at in an actual biological system. We can train the system to perform tasks and then play around experimentally with the constraints we impose, to see if it begins to look more like the brains of particular individuals.”</p>

<h2>Implications for designing future AI systems</h2>

<p>The findings are likely to be of interest to the AI community, too, where they could allow for the development of more efficient systems, particularly in situations where there are likely to be physical constraints.</p>

<p>Dr Akarca said: “AI researchers are constantly trying to work out how to make complex, neural systems that can encode and perform in a flexible way that is efficient. To achieve this, we think that neurobiology will give us a lot of inspiration. For example, the overall wiring cost of the system we've created is much lower than you would find in a typical AI system.”</p>

<p>Many modern AI solutions involve using architectures that only superficially resemble a brain. The researchers say their works shows that the type of problem the AI is solving will influence which architecture is the most powerful to use.</p>

<p>Achterberg said: “If you want to build an artificially-intelligent system that solves similar problems to humans, then ultimately the system will end up looking much closer to an actual brain than systems running on large compute cluster that specialise in very different tasks to those carried out by humans. The architecture and structure we see in our artificial ‘brain’ is there because it is beneficial for handling the specific brain-like challenges it faces.”</p>

<p>This means that robots that have to process a large amount of constantly changing information with finite energetic resources could benefit from having brain structures not dissimilar to ours.</p>

<p>Achterberg added: “Brains of robots that are deployed in the real physical world are probably going to look more like our brains because they might face the same challenges as us. They need to constantly process new information coming in through their sensors while controlling their bodies to move through space towards a goal. Many systems will need to run all their computations with a limited supply of electric energy and so, to balance these energetic constraints with the amount of information it needs to process, it will probably need a brain structure similar to ours.”</p>

<p>The research was funded by the Medical Research Council, Gates Cambridge, the James S McDonnell Foundation, Templeton World Charity Foundation and Google DeepMind.</p>

Moreover, it is understood that non-senescent cells within the elderly tissue still proliferate. However, the reason for the decline in organic function in the elderly as they age remains unclear.

Here, we propose the existence of intermediate stage cells that are neither youthful nor senescent. We termed these cells as “mid-old cells.” Moreover, these cells would likely accumulate in the stromal region of the tissues for the following reasons.

These findings suggest that SAA1 directly affected mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, but not epithelial cells.

Maintaining the integrity of the BM is crucial for proper epithelial cell function, and remnants of degraded ECM components, known as ‘Matrikines<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Sivaraman, K. &amp; Shanthi, C.

Therefore, we evaluated epithelial cell function based on BM stability. Although the mRNA levels of type IV collagen, a major component of the BM, did not show significant difference between elderly and young-aged tissues (GSE178341<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 34" title="Pelka, K. et al.

Hence, it is considered that the downregulation of type IV collagen in the BM of elderly organs is likely due to its degradation by MMP9 rather than reduced production of type IV collagen. To test this hypothesis in vitro, we cultured young or mid-old fibroblasts in Matrigel containing type IV collagen and found that collagen IV degradation was more pronounced in the presence of mid-old fibroblasts (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig3">3i</a>).

To address this question, we proposed that young cells may prevent the onset of senescence in adjacent mid-old cells. However, if the senescence-driving factors outweigh the inhibitory ability of young cells, a large population of mid-old cells would rapidly enter the senescence program (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig5">5a</a>).

These data indicate that increased proliferative ability alone is not sufficient for reversal of aging phenotype, suggesting the involvement of other primary mechanisms. Previously, we proposed CXCL12 as a juvenile factor, demonstrating its anti-inflammatory effect by inhibiting T-cell infiltration<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 25" title="Choi, Y.

However, CXCL12 itself did not affect the expression of inflammatory genes in mid-old fibroblasts (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">16</a>). In contrast, SLIT2, identified as a representative young cell secretory factor in our in vitro studies, is a known anti-inflammatory protein that progressively decreases as cells become senescent. To assess the impact of young cell driven SLIT2 on mid-old cells, we treated mid-old fibroblasts with recombinant human SLIT2 protein (rhSLIT2). Treatment with rhSLIT2 resulted in decreased expression of inflammatory genes and proteins, including SAA1 and IL1β, through inhibition of Pyk2-NFκB signaling<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 18" title="Zhao, H., Anand, A.

SLIT2 overexpression also showed similar effects (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6c</a>). Surprisingly, long-term treatment with rhSLIT2 protein restored the morphology of mid-old fibroblasts, causing them to revert to a small and spindle-shaped morphology reminiscent of young cells. To exclude the possibility of proliferation in young cells within the mid-old cell population in response to rhSLIT2, we treated young cells with rhSLIT2 and observed that young cells did not undergo increased proliferation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17a</a>). Additionally, the proliferative capacity of mid-old fibroblasts was recovered, accompanied by decreased levels of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> mRNA and protein in a p53-independent manner (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6d, e</a>).

Treatment with rhSLIT2 in mid-old cells resulted in upregulated expression of <i>SOX2</i> and <i>OCT4</i> (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6f</a>). The expression of known SLIT2 receptors, including <i>ROBO2</i> and <i>ROBO4</i>, was not significantly downregulated in mid-old cells (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">17b</a>), suggesting that the effect of SLIT2 is not solely due to decreased receptor activity. To further investigate the role of SLIT2, we downregulated SLIT2 expression using shRNA in young fibroblasts. SLIT2 downregulation induced the expression of inflammation-related genes and proteins, including IL1β and SAA1, and decreased the proliferation ability of the cells (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6g, h</a>). These findings suggest that a decrease in SLIT2 itself could promote senescence process. We further confirmed the effect of SLIT2 by adding back rhSLIT2 protein to shRNA-infected young cells, which resulted in the downregulation of the expression of upregulated inflammatory genes (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6i</a>).

Thus, we hypothesized that SLIT2 could be an anti-aging factor in both species. We conducted two independent experiments using aged mice.

In the in vitro experiments (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig6">6</a>), rhSLIT2 treatment showed effects when applied for a long period. Therefore, in the second round of animal experiments, we treated 23-month-old male C57BL/6 N male mice (<i>n</i> = 5 PBS and <i>n</i> = 5 rmSLIT2-treated) with rmSLIT2 10 times over a duration of several weeks. In this second experiment, we analyzed additional indices including activity, muscle weight, the number of mid-old cells in tissues, and blood analysis. Activity in the cage and hanging ability were measured before and after rmSLIT2 treatment to reduce animal to animal bias. During the experiment, body weight showed decreasing tendency in the rmSLIT2-treated groups. After 10 rounds of treatment, mouse aging-related characteristics significantly improved. Specifically, activity in the cage and hanging ability increased (Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#Fig7">7a, b</a>, and Supplementary Movie&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM8">3</a>).

Multiple studies employing various senescence models have consistently demonstrated an increase in p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-positive cells, which are believed to be senescent, in aged mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Omori and colleagues revealed that the proportion of tdTomato (p16<sup>INK4A</sup>)-positive cells increased in aged mice; in the lung, skin, liver and kidney tissues of 12-month-old mice compared to 2-month-old mice using p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-CreERT2-tdTomato mice<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

While senescent cells can exert a significant impact on their surrounding environment through the expression of SASPs, we have conjectured that this phenomenon, which is associated with the accumulation of senescent cells, may not be the sole explanation for the functional decline observed in aged organs. This is because p16<sup>INK4A</sup>-negative cells still make up the majority of the organ’s population according to the abovementioned studies<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1" title="Omori, S. et al.

Instead, we put forth a hypothesis that the accumulation of cells in an intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process, referred to as ‘mid-old’ cells in the current study, might be another relevant factor in understanding this decline in organ function. Interestingly, our current data show that a considerable number of mesenchymal cells in aged organs exhibit the intermediate stage of the cellular senescence process rather than epithelial cells. This might be related to the relatively rapid turnover of epithelial cells, which predominately undergo apoptosis or are phagocytized by macrophages prior to induction of the senescence process<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 8" title="Park, J.

The full extent of the effects of senescent and mid-old cells on the functional decline observed in aged organs remains uncertain. However, there is a strong indication that these cells may have a synergistic effect, meaning that their combined presence and activities could play a significant role in contributing to this decline. Further research is needed to better understand the interplay between senescent and mid-old cells and their collective impact on organ function during the aging process, and this interaction will be another interesting future studies.</p><p>Our in vitro transcriptomic studies showed that mid-old cells are functionally impaired compared to young cells; ECM formation, proliferation capacity, and tissue regeneration ability are significantly decreased. Nevertheless, it was observed that mid-old cells undergo a certain degree of functional recovery through the paracrine effect of substances released by young cells. Our study revealed that SLIT2 had a positive impact on the functional capacity of mid-old cells, although it remains uncertain whether it increased their maximum functional limit or enhanced their remaining functional potential. This is consistent with a prior study which demonstrated that <i>Slit2</i>-transgenic mice had improved organ function during aging<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 46" title="Li, G. et al. Overexpression of Slit2 improves function of the paravascular pathway in the aging mouse brain. Int. J. Mol. Med. 42, 1935–1944 (2018)." href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#ref-CR46" id="ref-link-section-d1247026e2274">46</a></sup>. Surprisingly, SLIT2 decreased inflammatory response and improved proliferative capacity only in mid-old, but not in old fibroblasts. Moreover, SAA1 expression was regulated by SLIT2, but SAA1 is not related to cell proliferation (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">22</a>). Therefore, SLIT2 is a potential cell cycle regulator, and this could be attributed to the upregulation of stem cell factors, including SOX2 and OCT4. Previous reports demonstrated that SOX2 and OCT4 regulate the downregulation of p21<sup>Waf1</sup> expression via direct binding to its promoter or DNA methyltransferase<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 47" title="Yamamizu, K., Schlessinger, D. &amp; Ko, M.

Based on our cautious interpretation, we suggest that SLIT2 may enhance cell proliferation by upregulating stem cell factors, particularly SOX2. However, it is important to note that effects of SLIT2 are not universally applicable. Specifically, senescent fibroblasts did not exhibit a response to SLIT2, and mid-old fibroblasts showed diminished effectiveness when DT exceeded 8 days (Supplementary Fig.&nbsp;<a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-43491-w#MOESM1">23</a>). Here, another important question arises: Can SLIT2 extend lifespan? Although our mouse sample size was small (<i>n</i> = 4, each), we administered PBS or rmSLIT2 injections once a week to 23-month-old mice and measured longevity. However, we did not observe evidence that SLIT2 extends lifespan, which is a major drawback of this study. Nonetheless, we believe that further investigation using a larger sample size of aged mice is necessary to draw conclusive results.</p><p>Regarding the changes in colon function with aging, we observed alterations in gene expression related to water absorption and the smooth muscle function involved in bowel movements in the large intestine. Specifically, we observed that the muscular mucosa layer became thinner in elderly colon tissue, and this was associated with increased expression of SAA1. Additionally, the expression of ‘Atrogenes’ was heightened in smooth muscle cells due to the presence of SAA1. Our findings suggest that SAA1 can induce atrophy in smooth muscle cells and may contribute to systematic muscle atrophy as circulating SAA1 levels increase with age. These results imply that targeting the master regulators of SAA1 directly could potentially prevent muscle mass loss in elderly individuals. Furthermore, we noted an increase in the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>, genes related to water absorption, in colon and lung epithelial cells in aged tissues. Notably, this increase in <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> expression was not attributed to SAA1 but rather appeared to be induced by the effects of degraded ECM on the stromal microenvironment. These degraded ECM fragments were found to function as ‘Matrikines,’ which upregulated signaling pathways such as Erk1/2, JNK, and NFκB. It is through these pathways that the expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i> is regulated. Therefore, collagen degradation by MMPs could serve as ‘Matrikines,’ potentially leading to increased expression of <i>NHE3</i> and <i>SCNN1A</i>.</p><p>This study offers new insights into the heterogeneous nature of the senescence ecosystem. The current concept and definition of senescence can be somewhat broad and vague. While the term ‘cellular senescence’ is often used interchangeably with ‘irreversible cell cycle arrest<sup><a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 49" title="Gorgoulis, V. et al.

Furthermore, the ‘mid-old cells’ identified in our study could represent an intermediate state of cellular senescence, as they are positive for the conventional markers, such as p21<sup>Waf1</sup> and IL1β. We demonstrated that the reduced or halted proliferation capacity of these mid-old cells can be reversed with appropriate stimulation. However, the borderline of cellular traits and the definition between ‘mid-old’ and ‘early senescence’ is still vague, and the additional study is needed to elucidate this question. Moreover, previously mentioned facts suggest that there could be various subtypes within the cellular senescence which makes us hard to understand the overall senescence ecosystem. Senescence encompasses various stages in cellular development, including early phases where proliferation ability can be restored, as well as later stages where cells take on specialized roles in molecule secretion or play a role in either promoting or inhibiting immune clearance processes. Furthermore, the trait of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions can be different from those in normal tissues, and the role of mid-old cells in pathologic conditions, such as age-related diseases will be another interesting future study.</p><p>Conclusively, our results demonstrated that most fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in the organs of elderly subjects were in the mid-old status. Furthermore, SLIT2 protein originating from young cells could act as an anti-aging protein for mid-old cells. Collectively, the study proposes a new strategy for anti-aging, including targeting mid-old cells and restoring young cell factors to improve quality of life in elderly persons.</p></div></div><div id="Sec9-section" data-title="Methods"><h2 id="Sec9">Methods</h2><div id="Sec9-content"><h3 id="Sec10">Human tissue experiments</h3><p>This study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Ajou University Hospital (AJIRB-BMR-OBS-20-552, Suwon, Korea), and informed consent was obtained from all patients, parents, or legal guardians as appropriate.

An epifluorescence illuminator (Nikon, Intensilight C-HFGI, 130 W) was used as a light source for fluorescence. Temperature (37 °C), CO<sub>2</sub> (5%), and humidity (80%) were maintained during the live cell imaging by using stage top incubator (UNO-T-H-PREMIXED, Okolab, Ottaviano, Italy).</p><h3 id="Sec23">In vitro Matrigel degradation assay</h3><p>SPLInsert™ (SPL Life Sciences Co., Ltd, Pocheon, Korea) with 6.5-mm polycarbonate membrane filters of 0.4 μm pore size were used to form dual compartments. Young or mid-old cells were seeded onto the lower chamber of the SPLInsert™ and the upper chamber of the SPLInsert™ was coated with Matrigel™ (Becton Dickinson) to mimic the conditions of the BM, individually. The upper chamber was transferred into the lower chamber and maintained for 2 days. Two experiments were then individually performed using a Matrigel-coated upper chamber, as follows; for the in vitro Matrigel degradation assay, Matrigel-coated membrane in the upper chamber was cut and boiled with 2× sample buffer (24 mM Tris-HCl,pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.8% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.04% bromophenol blue). The supernatant was used for Western blotting to detect type IV collagen (1:1000, ab6586, Abcam) using standard procedures. To analyze the epithelial cell functional marker, HCoEpiC (5 × 10<sup>4</sup>) or SW480 (5 × 10<sup>4</sup>) or HPAEpiC (1.5 × 10<sup>4</sup>) cells were seeded on the Matrigel-coated upper chamber for 2 days and, two experiments were then performed. First, real-time PCR was performed to measure mRNA levels of functional marker genes. Second, immunocytochemistry staining was performed with F-actin staining to compare cell morphology. Cells were&nbsp;fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 mins and treated with TRITC- phalloidin (1:500, P1951, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for 1 h and DAPI was counterstained (1:10000, D3571, Invitrogen) for 10 min. Stained cells were visualized with a Lionheart FX automated microscope (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT).</p><h3 id="Sec24">Metabolomics analysis</h3><p>Young (DT1) and mid-old (DT4) fibroblasts (<i>n</i> = 3, each) were cultured in 150 mm culture dishes (353025, Corning Inc., Corning, NY). Both cell types were seeded with the aim of reaching a final cell count of 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> at the time of harvest, which occurred 2 days later. The conditioned media (CM) was harvested and then centrifuged at 200 × <i>g</i> for 5 min. The supernatant was gently collected, and the subsequent analysis was performed by Basil Biotech (Incheon, Korea). The samples were added with 80% methanol. After vortexing for 1 min and centrifugation at 2000 × <i>g</i> for 10 min, supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube and completely dried using a HyperVAC-MAX VC2200 centrifugal vacuum concentrator (Hanil Scientific Inc., Gimpo, Korea). Dried metabolite contents were reconstituted in 100 µL of 0.1% formic acid in water and then subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. LC-MS analysis for metabolomics was performed using a Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled with a 1290 Infinity ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) (Agilent Technology). Metabolite mixtures were loaded using a ZORBAX Eclipse Plus C18 Rapid Resolution High Definition (RRHD) column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 µm particles). The mobile phase solvents consisted of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile, and the flow rate was fixed at 0.2 mL/min.

Identification of compounds was performed using mzCloud<sup>TM</sup> and ChemSpider.</p><h3 id="Sec25">Lipidomics analysis</h3><p>The analysis was performed by Basil Biotech. CM was harvested in a same method with the metabolomics analysis (see above). For lipid extraction from the harvest CM samples (young and mid-old, <i>n</i> = 3 each), a two-step method involving neutral and acidic extraction were used. At first, in neutral extraction, lipids from the samples were extracted according to the Folch method using a mixture of chloroform and methanol (2:1, v/v). The samples were vortexed and incubated on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 13,800 × <i>g</i> for 2 min at 4 °C, supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 mL tube. Next, in Acidic extraction, 750 μL of chloroform:methanol:HCl (1 N, 37%) (40:80:1, v/v/v) was added to the remaining samples. After incubating for 15 min at room temperature, 250 μL of cold chloroform and 450 μL of cold 0.1 M HCl were added to the sample. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 6500 × <i>g</i> for 2 min at 4 °C. The lower organic phase was collected and combined with the prior extract. The sample was then dried using HyperVAC-MAX VC2200 centrifugal vacuum concentrator (Hanil Scientific Inc.). Dried lipid contents were reconstituted in 50 µL of mobile phase solvent A:solvent B (2:1, v/v) and then subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. LC-MS analysis for lipidomics was performed using a Q Exactive™ Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a 1290 Infinity UHPLC (Agilent Technology) with heated electrospray ionization (HESI). Lipids mixtures were loaded using a e Hypersil GOLD™ C18 HPLC column (2.1 × 100 mm; 1.9 μm particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific).

<article>
    <p>This is a list of things you’re allowed to do that you thought you couldn’t, or didn’t even know you could.</p>
<p>I haven’t tried everything on this list, mainly due to cost.
But you’d be surprised how cheap most of the things on this list are (especially the free ones).</p>
<p><strong>Note that you can replace “hire” or “buy” with “barter for” or “find a DIY guide to” nearly everywhere below.</strong>
E.g. you can clean the bathroom in exchange for your housemate doing a couple hours research for you.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-decision-making">Learning and decision making</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hire a researcher or expert consultant
<ul>
<li>I hired a researcher (<a href="https://acesounderglass.com/">Elizabeth Van Nostrand</a>, whom you can and should <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/hire-me/">hire</a> too) to help write this very post, which is largely about how to hire people to do things!</li>
<li>They can:
<ul>
<li>Help validate whether a crazy idea is possible</li>
<li>Do <a href="https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/">epistemic spot checks</a> of your work</li>
<li>Map the landscape of opinions on a topic</li>
<li>Write literature surveys</li>
<li>Find people worth talking to about a potential topic and writing briefs about them</li>
<li>Opposition or market research</li>
<li>Find options for big purchases like houses or insurance</li>
<li>Compile datasets</li>
<li>Find un-Googleable things</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To find one:
<ul>
<li>Look for books or scholarly articles on the topic, and email the author
<ul>
<li>Graduate students are especially good, and often know more than the “experts”</li>
<li>If you find someone genuinely interested in what you’re working on, you might be able to collaborate and not pay</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look for interested individuals in the long tail of blogs
<ul>
<li>E.g. by Google searching with <code>"site: medium.com"</code> and finding the authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use a matchmaking service (see <a href="#appendix-sources-of-experts">Appendix</a>)</li>
<li>Search through professional organizations directories (e.g. Bar Association, American Academy of Pediatrics)</li>
<li>Google the topic +
<ul>
<li>“blog”</li>
<li>“podcast”</li>
<li>“expert witness”</li>
<li>“book”</li>
<li>“consultant”</li>
<li>“reddit”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What do I pay them?
<ul>
<li>Some post their prices online</li>
<li>If you’re hiring a grad student you can pay them at or above their school’s graduate student stipend, which you can Google.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/evyBmPw9ZnzmoFmP6/experiment-a-good-researcher-is-hard-to-find">Make sure they get something out of the project</a> (and other tips)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/">Ask obvious questions</a></li>
<li>Ask questions online
<ul>
<li>You know those answers you enjoy reading on Stack Exchange, Reddit, Quora, etc.?  Someone had to ask those questions. It can be you.</li>
<li>If you’re embarrassed by the question, it’s easy to be anonymous</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run surveys
<ul>
<li>Twitter
<ul>
<li>Or ask someone with a larger following to do it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Google Surveys</li>
<li>Amazon Mechanical Turk</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Buy advertisements, <a href="https://www.news10.com/news/national/90-year-old-man-spends-10k-on-ads-to-tell-att-ceo-about-his-slow-internet-service/">especially in legacy media</a></li>
<li>Run <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Nootropics#blinding-yourself">genuine randomized control trials on yourself</a></li>
<li>Buy research or data

<li>Or find it on <a href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub">SciHub</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/libgen_project">Libgen</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire someone to pentest/doxx you
<ul>
<li>Or put out a bounty for it, like <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Blackmail#pseudonymity-bounty">Gwern used to</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a graphic designer to turn your appalling sketches into beautiful diagrams or slides</li>
<li>Host small gatherings or conferences on topics you care about
<ul>
<li>These are much easier to set up than you’d think, especially in the age of Zoom</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hire a tutor
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.italki.com/">Language tutors</a> are surprisingly cheap and better than any app</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wyzant.com/">Wyzant</a> and many other sites exist for general tutoring</li>
<li>For niche tutoring you can try general freelance sites like <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/">Fiverr</a> or <a href="https://www.upwork.com/">Upwork</a></li>
<li>Services like <a href="https://www.sharpestminds.com/">Sharpest Minds</a> exist for professional training</li>

<li>Pick a spot on the map that simply seems strange and just go there.  (HT Michael Nielsen)</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpersonal">Interpersonal</h3>
<ul>
<li>Say “I don’t know” or “I don’t have an opinion” when you don’t</li>

<li>Buy goods/services from your friends
<ul>

<li>Move close to friends</li>
<li>Live in multiple places with multiple people

</ul>

<li>Start a blog or substack so you can say “I’m a writer” without lying. Then start conversations with strangers by saying “Hi, I’m a writer doing a piece about &lt;location/circumstance you’re in&gt;. Can I ask you a few questions?”
<ul>

		<h2>In brief</h2>
		<p>ESA’s new Ariane 6 rocket passed a major full-scale rehearsal today in preparation for its first flight, when teams on the ground went through a complete launch countdown followed by a seven-minute full firing of the core stage’s engine, as it would fire on a launch into space.</p>
	</div>
	<h2>In-depth</h2>
</div>


			
    
						
			<p>For this rehearsal, the boosters were not ignited so Ariane 6 stayed firmly on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, as planned.</p>

		<p>The engine-fire trial reenacts how the Ariane 6 core stage will fire during a normal flight into space. Once complete the main engine would shut down and the core stage would separate from the upper stage, which would then take over propulsion and complete its mission.</p><p>The trial, conducted with a test model on the launch pad at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, was the longest ‘full-stack' run yet for Ariane 6’s lower liquid propulsion module with a Vulcain 2.1 engine.</p>	</div>	
    
						
			<div>
				<p>“The teams from ArianeGroup, CNES and ESA have now run through every step of the rocket's flight without it leaving Earth,” says ESA’s Director General Josef Aschbacher.</p><p>“This milestone rehearsal comes after years of designing, planning, preparing, building and hard work from some of the finest space engineers in Europe. We are back on track towards resecuring Europe’s autonomous access to space. Well done to all involved!”</p>	</div>

		<p>The Vulcain 2.1 engine burnt through almost 150 tonnes of propellant in the Ariane 6 core stage tanks – liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen, the latter supercooled to temperatures below -250°C. Vulcain 2.1 is an evolution of the Vulcain 2 engine which made Ariane 5 Europe's most successful launch system to date. The upgrade has a simplified and cheaper design, and new technology in the engine nozzle and ignition system has been moved from the engine to the launch pad structure, to make the stage perform better and cost less.</p>	</div>

		<p>It took just over two hours and required teams of people and delicate operations to load the rocket’s central core with fuel. The filling operations were performed during a long countdown that included other qualification tests, similar to the previous rehearsals this year. For fidelity and to guarantee launcher stability, the upper stage tanks were also fueled – even though the upper stage engine only kicks in once in orbit after separation from the main stage and so was not fired during this ground test.</p><p>The launch pad – operated by France’s space agency CNES – used its water deluge system to temper the heat from the engine.</p><p>ESA’s Director of Space Transportation, Toni Tolker-Nielsen, added his vote of confidence in the teams across Europe working to bring Ariane 6 to service: "A huge thanks to all of our dedicated colleagues who are committed and working tirelessly to see this rocket fly.”</p><p>The test <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/Fuelled-up_dress_rehearsal_for_Ariane_6">followed a shorter burn in September</a> (known as CTLO1) when Ariane 6's tanks were filled and its Vulcain 2.1 engine briefly ignited and switched off, and the filling and <a href="https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Transportation/Ariane/Nighttime_rehearsal_for_Ariane_6_towards_first_flight">draining test executed in October</a> (known as CTLO2.1) to check the launch system functions such as draining fuel in the presence of multiple simulated failures.</p><p>A last hot-fire test of the upper stage is being prepared and planned for December 2023 at the Lampoldshausen test centre from Germany's DLR aerospace agency.</p>	</div>

	    This etext was produced from <cite>Science Fiction Stories</cite> 1953.
        Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S.
        copyright on this publication was renewed.

	<div id="frontmatter"><blockquote id="editors_note">
			<p>A little whimsy, now and then, makes for good balance. Theoretically,
	        you could find this type of humor anywhere. But only
	        a topflight science-fictionist, we thought, could have written this
	        story, in just this way….</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		
	</div>
	<div id="story">
		<p><span>It was</span> quite by accident I discovered this incredible invasion of
		Earth by lifeforms from another planet. As yet, I haven’t done anything
		about it; I can’t think of anything to do. I wrote to the
		Government, and they sent back a pamphlet on the repair and maintenance
		of frame houses. Anyhow, the whole thing is known; I’m not
		the first to discover it. Maybe it’s even under control.</p>

		<p>I was sitting in my easy-chair, idly turning the pages of a paperbacked
		book someone had left on the bus, when I came across the reference that
		first put me on the trail. For a moment I didn’t respond. It took some
		time for the full import to sink in. After I’d comprehended, it seemed
		odd I hadn’t noticed it right away.</p>

		<p>The reference was clearly to a nonhuman species of incredible properties,
		not indigenous to Earth. A species, I hasten to point out, customarily
		masquerading as ordinary human beings. Their disguise, however,
		became transparent in the face of the following observations by the
		author. It was at once obvious the author knew everything. Knew
		everything — and was taking it in his stride. The line (and I tremble
		remembering it even now) read:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes slowly roved about the room.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Vague chills assailed me. I tried to picture the eyes. Did they roll
		like dimes? The passage indicated not; they seemed to move through
		the air, not over the surface. Rather rapidly, apparently. No one in the
		story was surprised. That’s what tipped me off. No sign of amazement
		at such an outrageous thing. Later the matter was amplified.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… his eyes moved from person to person.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>There it was in a nutshell. The eyes had clearly come apart from
		the rest of him and were on their own. My heart pounded and my
		breath choked in my windpipe. I had stumbled on an accidental mention
		<a id="page129" title="129">&nbsp;</a>of a totally unfamiliar race. Obviously non-Terrestrial. Yet, to the
		characters in the book, it was perfectly natural — which suggested they
		belonged to the same species.</p>

		<p>And the author? A slow suspicion burned in my mind. The author
		was taking it rather <em>too easily</em> in his stride. Evidently, he felt this was
		quite a usual thing. He made absolutely no attempt to conceal this
		knowledge. The story continued:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… presently his eyes fastened on Julia.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Julia, being a lady, had at least the breeding to feel indignant. She
		is described as blushing and knitting her brows angrily. At this, I sighed
		with relief. They weren’t <em>all</em> non-Terrestrials. The narrative continues:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… slowly, calmly, his eyes examined every inch of her.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Great Scott! But here the girl turned and stomped off and the matter
		ended. I lay back in my chair gasping with horror. My wife and family
		regarded me in wonder.</p>

		<p>“What’s wrong, dear?” my wife asked.</p>

		<p>I couldn’t tell her. Knowledge like this was too much for the ordinary
		run-of-the-mill person. I had to keep it to myself. “Nothing,” I gasped.
		I leaped up, snatched the book, and hurried out of the room.</p>

		<hr>

		<p><span>In the</span> garage, I continued reading. There was more. Trembling, I
		read the next revealing passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he put his arm around Julia. Presently she asked him if
	        he would remove his arm. He immediately did so, with a
	        smile.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It’s not said what was done with the arm after the fellow had removed
		it. Maybe it was left standing upright in the corner. Maybe it
		was thrown away. I don’t care. In any case, the full meaning was there,
		staring me right in the face.</p>

		<p>Here was a race of creatures capable of removing portions of their
		anatomy at will. Eyes, arms — and maybe more. Without batting an eyelash.
		My knowledge of biology came in handy, at this point. Obviously
		they were simple beings, uni-cellular, some sort of primitive single-celled
		things. Beings no more developed than starfish. Starfish can do
		the same thing, you know.</p>

		<p>I read on. And came to this incredible revelation, tossed off coolly by
		the author without the faintest tremor:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… outside the movie theater we split up. Part of us went
			inside, part over to the cafe for dinner.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Binary fission, obviously. Splitting in half and forming two entities.
		<a id="page130" title="130">&nbsp;</a>Probably each lower half went to the cafe, it being farther, and the
		upper halves to the movies. I read on, hands shaking. I had really stumbled
		onto something here. My mind reeled as I made out this passage:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… I’m afraid there’s no doubt about it. Poor Bibney has lost
			his head again.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Which was followed by:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… and Bob says he has utterly no guts.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Yet Bibney got around as well as the next person. The next person,
		however, was just as strange. He was soon described as:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… totally lacking in brains.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<hr>

		<p><span>There</span> was no doubt of the thing in the next passage. Julia, whom I
		had thought to be the one normal person, reveals herself as also
		being an alien life form, similar to the rest:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… quite deliberately, Julia had given her heart to the young
			man.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>It didn’t relate what the final disposition of the organ was, but I didn’t
		really care. It was evident Julia had gone right on living in her usual
		manner, like all the others in the book. Without heart, arms, eyes, brains,
		viscera, dividing up in two when the occasion demanded. Without a
		qualm.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… thereupon she gave him her hand.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I sickened. The rascal now had her hand, as well as her heart. I shudder
		to think what he’s done with them, by this time.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… he took her arm.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>Not content to wait, he had to start dismantling her on his own. Flushing
		crimson, I slammed the book shut and leaped to my feet. But not
		in time to escape one last reference to those carefree bits of anatomy
		whose travels had originally thrown me on the track:</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>… her eyes followed him all the way down the road and
			across the meadow.</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>I rushed from the garage and back inside the warm house, as if the
		accursed things were following me. My wife and children were playing
		Monopoly in the kitchen. I joined them and played with frantic fervor,
		brow feverish, teeth chattering.</p>

		<p>I had had enough of the thing. I want to hear no more about it. Let
		them come on. Let them invade Earth. I don’t want to get mixed up
		in it.</p>

		<p>I have absolutely no stomach for it.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
