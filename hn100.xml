            <span>Abstract:</span>For nearly two decades, CAPTCHAs have been widely used as a means of protection against bots. Throughout the years, as their use grew, techniques to defeat or bypass CAPTCHAs have continued to improve. Meanwhile, CAPTCHAs have also evolved in terms of sophistication and diversity, becoming increasingly difficult to solve for both bots (machines) and humans. Given this long-standing and still-ongoing arms race, it is critical to investigate how long it takes legitimate users to solve modern CAPTCHAs, and how they are perceived by those users.
<br>In this work, we explore CAPTCHAs in the wild by evaluating users' solving performance and perceptions of unmodified currently-deployed CAPTCHAs. We obtain this data through manual inspection of popular websites and user studies in which 1,400 participants collectively solved 14,000 CAPTCHAs. Results show significant differences between the most popular types of CAPTCHAs: surprisingly, solving time and user perception are not always correlated. We performed a comparative study to investigate the effect of experimental context -- specifically the difference between solving CAPTCHAs directly versus solving them as part of a more natural task, such as account creation. Whilst there were several potential confounding factors, our results show that experimental context could have an impact on this task, and must be taken into account in future CAPTCHA studies. Finally, we investigate CAPTCHA-induced user task abandonment by analyzing participants who start and do not complete the task.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div lang="en" data-v-2fa8b348="" id="sec0" data-v-0f2322a2=""><h2>Abstract</h2>  <div><p>If an industrial civilization had existed on Earth many millions of years prior to our own era, what traces would it have left and would they be detectable today? We summarize the likely geological fingerprint of the Anthropocene, and demonstrate that while clear, it will not differ greatly in many respects from other known events in the geological record. We then propose tests that could plausibly distinguish an industrial cause from an otherwise naturally occurring climate event.</p></div> </div><div id="content-container" data-v-0f2322a2=""><div><div><div data-magellan-destination="sec1" id="sec1"><h2> Introduction</h2><p> The search for life elsewhere in the universe is a central occupation of astrobiology and scientists have often looked to Earth analogues for extremophile bacteria, life under varying climate states and the genesis of life itself. A subset of this search is the prospect for intelligent life, and then a further subset is the search for civilizations that have the potential to communicate with us. A common assumption is that any such civilization must have developed industry of some sort. In particular, the ability to harness those industrial processes to develop radio technologies capable of sending or receiving messages. In what follows, however, we will define industrial civilizations here as the ability to harness external energy sources at global scales.</p><p> One of the key questions in assessing the likelihood of finding such a civilization is an understanding of how often, given that life has arisen and that some species are intelligent, does an industrial civilization develop? Humans are the only example we know of, and our industrial civilization has lasted (so far) roughly 300 years (since, for example, the beginning of mass production methods). This is a small fraction of the time we have existed as a species, and a tiny fraction of the time that complex life has existed on the Earth's land surface (~400 million years ago, Ma). This short time period raises the obvious question as to whether this could have happened before. We term this the ‘Silurian hypothesis’<a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><p> While much idle speculation and late night chatter has been devoted to this question, we are unaware of previous serious treatments of the problem of detectability of prior terrestrial industrial civilizations in the geologic past. Given the vast increase in work surrounding exoplanets and questions related to detection of life, it is worth addressing the question more formally and in its astrobiological setting. We note also the recent work of Wright (<a href="#ref121"><span>Reference Wright</span>2017</a>) which addressed aspects of the problem and previous attempts to assess the likelihood of solar system non-terrestrial civilization such as Haqq-Misra &amp; Kopparapu (<a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Haqq-Misra and Kopparapu</span>2012</a>). This paper is an attempt to remedy the gap in a way that also puts our current impact on the planet into a broader perspective. We first note the importance of this question to the well-known Drake equation. Then we address the likely geologic consequences of human industrial civilization and then compare that fingerprint to potentially similar events in the geologic record. Finally, we address some possible research directions that might improve the constraints on this question.</p><div data-magellan-destination="sec1-1" id="sec1-1"><h3> Relevance to the Drake equation</h3><p> The Drake equation is the well-known framework for estimating of the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy (Drake, <a href="#ref28"><span>Reference Drake</span>1961</a>, <a href="#ref29"><span>Reference Drake, Mamikunian and Briggs</span>1965</a>). The number of such civilizations, <em>N</em>, is assumed to be equal to the product of; the average rate of star formation, <em>R</em>*, in our Galaxy; the fraction of formed stars, <em>f</em> <sub>p</sub>, that have planets; the average number of planets per star, <em>n</em> <sub><em>e</em></sub>, that can potentially support life; the fraction of those planets, <em>f</em> <sub>l</sub>, that actually develop life; the fraction of planets bearing life on which intelligent, civilized life, <em>f</em> <sub>i</sub>, has developed; the fraction of these civilizations that have developed communications, <em>f</em> <sub>c</sub>, i.e., technologies that release detectable signs into space, and the length of time, <em>L</em>, over which such civilizations release detectable signals.

It is now apparent that most stars harbour families of planets (Seager, <a href="#ref97"><span>Reference Seager</span>2013</a>). Indeed, many of those planets will be in the star's habitable zones (Dressing &amp; Charbonneau, <a href="#ref30"><span>Reference Dressing and Charbonneau</span>2013</a>; Howard, <a href="#ref47"><span>Reference Howard</span>2013</a>). These results allow the next three terms to be bracketed in a way that uses the exoplanet data to establish a constraint on exo-civilization pessimism. In Frank &amp; Sullivan (<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Frank and Sullivan</span>2016</a>) such a ‘pessimism line’ was defined as the maximum ‘biotechnological’ probability (per habitable zone planets) <em>f</em> <sub>bt</sub> for humans to be the only time a technological civilization has evolved in cosmic history. Frank &amp; Sullivan (<a href="#ref34"><span>Reference Frank and Sullivan</span>2016</a>) found <em>f</em> <sub>bt</sub> in the range ~10<sup>−24</sup>–10<sup>−22</sup>.</p><p> Determination of the ‘pessimism line’ emphasizes the importance of three Drake equation terms <em>f</em> <sub>l</sub>, <em>f</em> <sub>i</sub> and <em>f</em> <sub>c</sub>. Earth's history often serves as a template for discussions of possible values for these probabilities. For example, there has been considerable discussion of how many times life began on Earth during the early Archean given the ease of abiogenisis (Patel et al., <a href="#ref83"><span>Reference Patel</span>2015</a>) including the possibility of a ‘shadow biosphere’ composed of descendants of a different origin event from the one which led to our Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) (Cleland &amp; Copley, <a href="#ref19"><span>Reference Cleland and Copley</span>2006</a>). In addition, there is a long-standing debate concerning the number of times intelligence has evolved in terms of dolphins and other species (Marino, <a href="#ref69"><span>Reference Marino, Vakoch and Dowd</span>2015</a>). Thus, only the term <em>f</em> <sub>c</sub> has been commonly accepted to have a value on Earth of strictly 1.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec1-2" id="sec1-2"><h3> Relevance to other solar system planets</h3><p> Consideration of previous civilizations on other solar system worlds has been taken on by Wright (<a href="#ref121"><span>Reference Wright</span>2017</a>) and Haqq-Misra &amp; Kopparapu (<a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Haqq-Misra and Kopparapu</span>2012</a>). We note here that abundant evidence exists of surface water in ancient Martian climates (3.8&nbsp;Ga) (e.g. Achille &amp; Hynek, <a href="#ref1"><span>Reference Achille and Hynek</span>2010</a>; Arvidson et al., <a href="#ref5"><span>Reference Arvidson</span>2014</a>), and speculation that early Venus (2&nbsp;Ga to 0.7&nbsp;Ga) was habitable (due to a dimmer sun and lower CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere) has been supported by recent modelling studies (Way et al., <a href="#ref118"><span>Reference Way</span>2016</a>). Conceivably, deep drilling operations could be carried out on either planet in future to assess their geological history. This would constrain consideration of what the fingerprint might be of life, and even organized civilization (Haqq-Misra &amp; Kopparapu, <a href="#ref42"><span>Reference Haqq-Misra and Kopparapu</span>2012</a>). Assessments of prior Earth events and consideration of Anthropocene markers such as those we carry out below will likely provide a key context for those explorations.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec1-3" id="sec1-3"><h3> Limitations of the geological record</h3><p> That this paper's title question is worth posing is a function of the incompleteness of the geological record. For the Quaternary (the last 2.5 million years), there is widespread extant physical evidence of, for instance, climate changes, soil horizons and archaeological evidence of non-<em>Homo Sapiens</em> cultures (Denisovians, Neanderthals, etc.) with occasional evidence of bipedal hominids dating back to at least 3.7&nbsp;Ma (e.g. the Laetoli footprints) (Leakey &amp; Hay, <a href="#ref63"><span>Reference Leakey and Hay</span>1979</a>). The oldest extant large-scale surface is in the Negev Desert and is&nbsp;~1.8&nbsp;Ma old (Matmon et al., <a href="#ref70"><span>Reference Matmon</span>2009</a>). However, pre-Quaternary land-evidence is far sparser, existing mainly in exposed sections, drilling and mining operations. In the ocean sediments, due to the recycling of ocean crust, there only exists sediment evidence for periods that post-date the Jurassic (~170&nbsp;Ma) (ODP Leg 801 Team, <a href="#ref79">2000</a>).</p><p> The fraction of life that gets fossilized is always extremely small and varies widely as a function of time, habitat and degree of soft tissue versus hard shells or bones (Behrensmeyer et al., <a href="#ref7"><span>Reference Behrensmeyer, Kidwell and Gastaldo</span>2000</a>). Fossilization rates are very low in tropical, forested environments but are higher in arid environments and fluvial systems. As an example, for all the dinosaurs that ever lived, there are only a few thousand near-complete specimens, or equivalently only a handful of individual animals across thousands of taxa per 100,000 years. Given the rate of new discovery of taxa of this age, it is clear that species as short-lived as <em>Homo sapiens</em> (so far) might not be represented in the existing fossil record at all.</p><p> The likelihood of objects surviving and being discovered is similarly unlikely. Zalasiewicz (<a href="#ref123"><span>Reference Zalasiewicz</span>2009</a>) speculates about preservation of objects or their forms, but the current area of urbanization is &lt;1% of the Earth's surface (Schneider et al., <a href="#ref96"><span>Reference Schneider, Friedl and Potere</span>2009</a>), and exposed sections and drilling sites for pre-Quaternary surfaces are orders of magnitude less as fractions of the original surface. Note that even for early human technology, complex objects are very rarely found. For instance, the Antikythera Mechanism (ca. 205 BCE) is a unique object until the Renaissance. Despite impressive recent gains in the ability to detect the wider impacts of civilization on landscapes and ecosystems (Kidwell, <a href="#ref53"><span>Reference Kidwell</span>2015</a>), we conclude that for potential civilizations older than about 4&nbsp;Ma, the chances of finding direct evidence of their existence via objects or fossilized examples of their population is small. We note, however, that one might ask the indirect question related to antecedents in the fossil record indicating species that might <em>lead</em> downstream to the evolution of later civilization-building species. Such arguments, for or against, the Silurian hypothesis would rest on evidence concerning highly social behaviour or high intelligence based on brain size. The claim would then be that there are other species in the fossil record which could, or could not, have evolved into civilization-builders. In this paper, however, we focus on physicochemical tracers for previous industrial civilizations. In this way, there is an opportunity to widen the search to tracers that are more widespread, even though they may be subject to more varied interpretations.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec1-4" id="sec1-4"><h3> Scope of this paper</h3><p> We will restrict the scope of this paper to geochemical constraints on the existence of pre-Quaternary industrial civilizations, that may have existed since the rise of complex life on land. This rules out societies that might have been highly organized and potentially sophisticated but that did not develop industry and probably any purely ocean-based lifeforms. The focus is thus on the period between the emergence of complex life on land in the Devonian (~400&nbsp;Ma) in the Paleozoic era and the mid-Pliocene (~4&nbsp;Ma).</p></div></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec2" id="sec2"><h2> The geological footprint of the Anthropocene</h2><p> While an official declaration of the Anthropocene as a unique geological era is still pending (Crutzen, <a href="#ref24"><span>Reference Crutzen</span>2002</a>; Zalasiewicz et al., <a href="#ref125"><span>Reference Zalasiewicz</span>2017</a>), it is already clear that our human efforts will impact the geologic record being laid down today (Waters et al., <a href="#ref117"><span>Reference Waters</span>2014</a>). Some of the discussion of the specific boundary that will define this new period is not relevant for our purposes because the markers proposed (ice core gas concentrations, short-half-lived radioactivity, the Columbian exchange) (e.g. Lewis &amp; Maslin, <a href="#ref64"><span>Reference Lewis and Maslin</span>2015</a>; Hamilton, <a href="#ref40"><span>Reference Hamilton</span>2016</a>) are not going to be geologically stable or distinguishable on multi-million year timescales. However, there are multiple changes that have already occurred that will persist. We discuss a number of these below.</p><p> There is an interesting paradox in considering the Anthropogenic footprint on a geological timescale. The longer human civilization lasts, the larger the signal one would expect in the record. However, the longer a civilization lasts, the more sustainable its practices would need to have become in order to survive. The more sustainable a society (e.g. in energy generation, manufacturing or agriculture) the smaller the footprint on the rest of the planet. But the smaller the footprint, the less of a signal will be embedded in the geological record. Thus, the footprint of civilization might be self-limiting on a relatively short timescale. To avoid speculating about the ultimate fate of humanity, we will consider impacts that are already clear, or that are foreseeable under plausible trajectories for the next century (e.g. Nazarenko et al., <a href="#ref78"><span>Reference Nazarenko</span>2015</a>; Köhler, <a href="#ref56"><span>Reference Köhler</span>2016</a>).</p><p> We note that effective sedimentation rates in ocean sediment for cores with multi-million-year-old sediment are of the order of a few cm/1000 years at best, and while the degree of bioturbation may smear a short-period signal, the Anthropocene will likely only appear as a section a few cm thick, and appear almost instantaneously in the record.</p><div data-magellan-destination="sec2-1" id="sec2-1"><h3> Stable isotope anomalies of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen</h3><p> Since the mid-18th century, humans have released over 0.5 trillion tonnes of fossil carbon via the burning of coal, oil and natural gas (Le Quéré et al., <a href="#ref62"><span>Reference Le Quéré</span>2016</a>), at a rate orders of magnitude faster than natural long-term sources or sinks. In addition, there has been widespread deforestation and addition of carbon dioxide into the air via biomass burning. All of this carbon is biological in origin and is thus depleted in<sup>13</sup>C compared with the much larger pool of inorganic carbon (Revelle &amp; Suess, <a href="#ref90"><span>Reference Revelle and Suess</span>1957</a>). Thus, the ratio of <sup>13</sup>C to <sup>12</sup>C in the atmosphere, ocean and soils is decreasing (an impact known as the ‘Suess Effect’ Quay et al., <a href="#ref88"><span>Reference Quay, Tilbrook and Wong</span>1992</a>) with a current change of around −&nbsp;1‰ <em>δ</em> <sup>13</sup>C since the pre-industrial (Böhm et al., <a href="#ref11"><span>Reference Böhm</span>2002</a>; Eide et al., <a href="#ref31"><span>Reference Eide</span>2017</a>) in the surface ocean and atmosphere (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1(a)</a>).

(b) The Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (55.5&nbsp;Ma). Data from two DSDP cores (589 and 1209B) (Tripati &amp; Elderfield, <a href="#ref109"><span>Reference Tripati and Elderfield</span>2004</a>) are used to estimate anomalous isotopic changes and a loess smooth with a span of 200&nbsp;kya is applied to make the trends clearer.

The advent of agriculture and associated deforestation have lead to large increases in soil erosion (Goudie, <a href="#ref39"><span>Reference Goudie</span>2000</a>; National Research Council, <a href="#ref20">2010</a>). Furthermore, canalization of rivers (such as the Mississippi) have led to much greater oceanic deposition of sediment than would otherwise have occurred. This tendency is mitigated somewhat by concurrent increases in river dams which reduce sediment flow downstream. Additionally, increasing temperatures and atmospheric water vapour content have led to greater intensity of precipitation (Kunkel et al., <a href="#ref60"><span>Reference Kunkel</span>2013</a>) which, on its own, would also lead to greater erosion, at least regionally. Coastal erosion is also on the increase as a function of the rising sea level, and in polar regions is being enhanced by reductions in sea ice and thawing permafrost (Overeem et al., <a href="#ref81"><span>Reference Overeem</span>2011</a>).</p><p> In addition to changes in the flux of sediment from land to ocean, the composition of the sediment will also change. Due to the increased dissolution of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean as a function of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the upper ocean is acidifying (a 26% increase in H<sup>+</sup> or 0.1&nbsp;pH decrease since the 19th century) (Orr et al., <a href="#ref80"><span>Reference Orr</span>2005</a>). This will lead to an increase in CaCO<sub>3</sub> dissolution within the sediment that will last until the ocean can neutralize the increase. There will also be important changes in mineralogy (Zalasiewicz et al., <a href="#ref124"><span>Reference Zalasiewicz, Kryza and Williams</span>2013</a>; Hazen et al., <a href="#ref43"><span>Reference Hazen</span>2017</a>). Increases in continental weathering are also likely to change ratios of strontium and osmium (e.g.<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>187</sup>Os/<sup>188</sup>Os ratios) (Jenkyns, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Jenkyns</span>2010</a>).</p><p> As discussed above, nitrogen load in rivers is increasing as a function of agricultural practices. This in turn is leading to more microbial activity in the coastal ocean which can deplete dissolved oxygen in the water column (Diaz &amp; Rosenberg, <a href="#ref26"><span>Reference Diaz and Rosenberg</span>2008</a>), and recent syntheses suggests a global decline already of about 2% (Ito et al., <a href="#ref48"><span>Reference Ito</span>2017</a>; Schmidtko et al., <a href="#ref94"><span>Reference Schmidtko, Stramma and Visbeck</span>2017</a>). This in turn is leading to an expansion of the oxygen minimum zones, greater ocean anoxia and the creation of so-called ‘dead-zones’ (Breitburg et al., <a href="#ref15"><span>Reference Breitburg</span>2018</a>). Sediment within these areas will thus have greater organic content and less bioturbation (Tyrrell, <a href="#ref112"><span>Reference Tyrrell</span>2011</a>). The ultimate extent of these dead zones is unknown.</p><p> Furthermore, anthropogenic fluxes of lead, chromium, antimony, rhenium, platinum group metals, rare earths and gold, are now much larger than their natural sources (Sen &amp; Peucker-Ehrenbrink, <a href="#ref98"><span>Reference Sen and Peucker-Ehrenbrink</span>2012</a>; Gałuszka et al., <a href="#ref36"><span>Reference Gałuszka, Migaszewski and Zalasiewicz</span>2013</a>), implying that there will be a spike in fluxes in these metals in river outflow and hence higher concentrations in coastal sediments.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec2-3" id="sec2-3"><h3> Faunal radiation and extinctions</h3><p> The last few centuries have seen significant changes in the abundance and spread of small animals, particularly rats, mice and cats, etc. that are associated with human exploration and biotic exchanges. Isolated populations almost everywhere have now been superseded in many respects by these invasive species. The fossil record will likely indicate a large faunal radiation of these indicator species at this point. Concurrently, many other species have already, or are likely to become, extinct, and their disappearance from the fossil record will be noticeable. Given the perspective from many million years ahead, large mammal extinctions that occurred at the end of the last ice age will also associated with the onset of the Anthropocene.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec2-4" id="sec2-4"><h3> Non-naturally occurring synthetics</h3><p> There are many chemicals that have been (or were) manufactured industrially that for various reasons can spread and persist in the environment for a long time (Bernhardt et al., <a href="#ref8"><span>Reference Bernhardt, Rosi and Gessner</span>2017</a>). Most notably, persistent organic pollutants (organic molecules that are resistant to degradation by chemical, photo-chemical or biological processes), are known to have spread across the world (even to otherwise pristine environments) (Beyer et al., <a href="#ref9"><span>Reference Beyer</span>2000</a>). Their persistence is often tied to being halogenated organics since the bond strength of C–Cl (for instance) is much stronger than C–C. For instance, polychlorinated biphenyls are known to have lifetimes of many hundreds of years in river sediment (Bopp, <a href="#ref12"><span>Reference Bopp</span>1979</a>). How long a detectable signal would persist in ocean sediment is, however, unclear.</p><p> Other chlorinated compounds may also have the potential for long-term preservation, specifically CFCs and related compounds. While there are natural sources for the most stable compound (CF<sub>4</sub>), there are only anthropogenic sources for C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub>, the next most stable compounds. In the atmosphere, their sink via photolytic destruction in the stratosphere limits their lifetimes to a few thousand years (Ravishankara et al., <a href="#ref89"><span>Reference Ravishankara</span>1993</a>). The compounds do dissolve in the the ocean and can be used as tracers of ocean circulation, but we are unaware of studies indicating how long these chemicals might survive and/or be detectable in ocean sediment given some limited evidence for microbial degradation in anaerobic environments (Denovan &amp; Strand, <a href="#ref25"><span>Reference Denovan and Strand</span>1992</a>).</p><p> Other classes of synthetic biomarkers may also persist in sediments. For instance, steroids, leaf waxes, alkenones and lipids can be preserved in sediment for many millions of years (i.e. Pagani et al., <a href="#ref82"><span>Reference Pagani</span>2006</a>). What might distinguish naturally occurring biomarkers from synthetics might be the chirality of the molecules. Most total synthesis pathways do not discriminate between D- and L-chirality, while biological processes are almost exclusively monochiral (Meierhenrich, <a href="#ref73"><span>Reference Meierhenrich</span>2008</a>) (for instance, naturally occurring amino acids are all L-forms, and almost all sugars are D-forms). Synthetic steroids that do not have natural counterparts are also now ubiquitous in water bodies.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec2-5" id="sec2-5"><h3> Plastics</h3><p> Since 1950, there has been a huge increase in plastics being delivered into the ocean (Moore, <a href="#ref75"><span>Reference Moore</span>2008</a>; Eriksen et al., <a href="#ref33"><span>Reference Eriksen</span>2014</a>). Although many common forms of plastic (such as polyethylene and polypropylene) are buoyant in sea water, and even those that are nominally heavier than water may be incorporated into flotsam that remains at the surface, it is already clear that mechanical erosional processes will lead to the production of large amounts of plastic micro- and nano-particles (Cozar et al., <a href="#ref22"><span>Reference Cozar</span>2014</a>; Andrady, <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Andrady</span>2015</a>). Surveys have shown increasing amounts of plastic ‘marine litter’ on the seafloor from coastal areas to deep basins and the Arctic (Pham et al., <a href="#ref87"><span>Reference Pham</span>2014</a>; Tekman et al., <a href="#ref108"><span>Reference Tekman, Krumpen and Bergmann</span>2017</a>). On beaches, novel aggregates ‘plastiglomerates’ have been found where plastic-containing debris comes into contact with high temperatures (Corcoran et al., <a href="#ref21"><span>Reference Corcoran, Moore and Jazvac</span>2014</a>).</p><p> The degradation of plastics is mostly by solar ultraviolet radiation and in the oceans occurs mostly in the photic zone (Andrady, <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Andrady</span>2015</a>) and is notably temperature dependent (Andrady et al., <a href="#ref3"><span>Reference Andrady</span>1998</a>) (other mechanisms such as thermo-oxidation or hydrolysis do not readily occur in the ocean). The densification of small plastic particles by fouling organisms, ingestion and incorporation into organic ‘rains’ that sink to the sea floor is an effective delivery mechanism to the seafloor, leading to increasing accumulation in ocean sediment where degradation rates are much slower (Andrady, <a href="#ref4"><span>Reference Andrady</span>2015</a>). Once in the sediment, microbial activity is a possible degradation pathway (Shah et al., <a href="#ref99"><span>Reference Shah</span>2008</a>) but rates are sensitive to oxygen availability and suitable microbial communities.</p><p> As above, the ultimate long-term fate of these plastics in sediment is unclear, but the potential for very long-term persistence and detectability is high.</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec2-6" id="sec2-6"><h3> Transuranic elements</h3><p> Many radioactive isotopes that are related to anthropogenic fission or nuclear arms, have half-lives that are long, but not long enough to be relevant here. However, there are two isotopes that are potentially long-lived enough. Specifically, Plutonium-244 (half-life 80.8 million years) and Curium-247 (half-life 15 million years) would be detectable for a large fraction of the relevant time period if they were deposited in sufficient quantities, say, as a result of a nuclear weapon exchange. There are no known natural sources of <sup>244</sup>Pu outside of supernovae.</p><p> Attempts have been made to detect primordial <sup>244</sup>Pu on Earth with mixed success (Hoffman et al., <a href="#ref44"><span>Reference Hoffman</span>1971</a>; Lachner et al., <a href="#ref61"><span>Reference Lachner</span>2012</a>), indicating the rate of actinide meteorite accretion is small enough (Wallner et al., <a href="#ref116"><span>Reference Wallner</span>2015</a>) for this to be a valid marker in the event of a sufficiently large nuclear exchange. Similarly, <sup>247</sup>Cm is present in nuclear fuel waste and as a consequence of a nuclear explosion.</p><p> Anomalous isotopic ratios in elements with long-lived radioactive isotopes are also possible signatures, for instance, lower than usual <sup>235</sup>U ratios, and the presence of expected daughter products, in uranium ores in the Franceville Basin in the Gabon have been traced to naturally occurring nuclear fission in oxygenated, hydrated rocks&nbsp;~2&nbsp;Ga (Gauthier-Lafaye et al., <a href="#ref37"><span>Reference Gauthier-Lafaye, Holliger and Blanc</span>1996</a>).</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec2-7" id="sec2-7"><h3> Summary</h3><p> The Anthropocene layer in ocean sediment will be abrupt and multi-variate, consisting of seemingly concurrent-specific peaks in multiple geochemical proxies, biomarkers, elemental composition and mineralogy. It will likely demarcate a clear transition of faunal taxa prior to the event compared with afterwards. Most of the individual markers will not be unique in the context of Earth history as we demonstrate below, but the combination of tracers may be. However, we speculate that some specific tracers that would be unique, specifically persistent synthetic molecules, plastics and (potentially) very long-lived radioactive fallout in the event of nuclear catastrophe. Absent those markers, the uniqueness of the event may well be seen in the multitude of relatively independent fingerprints as opposed to a coherent set of changes associated with a single geophysical cause.</p></div></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec3" id="sec3"><h2> Abrupt paleozoic, mesozoic and cenozoic events</h2><p> The summary for the Anthropocene fingerprint above suggests that similarities might be found in (geologically) abrupt events with a multi-variate signature. In this section, we review a partial selection of known events in the paleo-record that have some similarities to the hypothesized eventual anthropogenic signature. The clearest class of event with such similarities are the hyperthermals, most notably the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (56&nbsp;Ma) (McInerney &amp; Wing, <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference McInerney and Wing</span>2011</a>), but this also includes smaller hyperthermal events, ocean anoxic events in the Cretaceous and Jurassic and significant (if less well characterized) events of the Paleozoic. We do not consider of events (such as the K–T extinction event or the Eocene–Oligocene boundary) where there are very clear and distinct causes (asteroid impact combined with massive volcanism(Vellekoop et al., <a href="#ref114"><span>Reference Vellekoop</span>2014</a>), and the onset of Antarctic glaciation(Zachos et al., <a href="#ref122"><span>Reference Zachos</span>2001</a>) (likely linked to the opening of Drake Passage Cristini et al., <a href="#ref23"><span>Reference Cristini</span>2012</a>, respectively). There may be more such events in the record but that are not included here simply because they may not have been examined in detail, particularly in the pre-Cenozoic.</p><div data-magellan-destination="sec3-1" id="sec3-1"><h3> The Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum (PETM)</h3><p> The existence of an abrupt spike in carbon and oxygen isotopes near the Paleocene/Eocene transition (56&nbsp;Ma) was first noted by Kennett &amp; Stott (<a href="#ref51"><span>Reference Kennett and Stott</span>1991</a>) and demonstrated to be global by Koch et al. (<a href="#ref55"><span>Reference Koch, Zachos and Gingerich</span>1992</a>). Since then, more detailed and high-resolution analyses on land and in the ocean have revealed a fascinating sequence of events lasting 100–200 kyr and involving a rapid input (in perhaps &lt;5 kyr Kirtland Turner et al., <a href="#ref111"><span>Reference Kirtland Turner</span>2017</a>) of exogenous carbon into the system (see review by McInerney &amp; Wing, <a href="#ref72"><span>Reference McInerney and Wing</span>2011</a>), possibly related to the intrusion of the North American Igneous Province into organic sediments (Storey et al., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Storey, Duncan and Swisher</span>2007</a>). Temperatures rose 5–7°C (derived from multiple proxies Tripati &amp; Elderfield, <a href="#ref109"><span>Reference Tripati and Elderfield</span>2004</a>), and there was a negative spike in carbon isotopes (&gt;3‰), and decreased ocean carbonate preservation in the upper ocean. There was an increase in kaolinite (clay) in many sediments (Schmitz et al., <a href="#ref95"><span>Reference Schmitz, Pujalte and Nú nez-Betelu</span>2001</a>), indicating greater erosion, though evidence for a global increase is mixed. During the PETM 30–50% of benthic foraminiferal taxa became extinct, and it marked the time of an important mammalian (Aubry et al., <a href="#ref6"><span>Reference Aubry, Lucas and Berggren</span>1998</a>) and lizard (Smith, <a href="#ref103"><span>Reference Smith</span>2009</a>) expansion across North America. Additionally, many metal abundances (including V, Zn, Mo, Cr) spiked during the event (Soliman et al., <a href="#ref104"><span>Reference Soliman</span>2011</a>).</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec3-2" id="sec3-2"><h3> Eocene events</h3><p> In the 6 million years following the PETM, there are a number of smaller, though qualitatively similar, hyperthermal events seen in the record (Slotnick et al., <a href="#ref101"><span>Reference Slotnick</span>2012</a>). Notably, the Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 event (ETM-2), and at least four other peaks are characterized by significant negative carbon isotope excursions, warming and relatively high sedimentation rates driven by increases in terrigenous input (D'Onofrio et al., <a href="#ref27"><span>Reference D'Onofrio</span>2016</a>). Arctic conditions during ETM-2 show evidence of warming, lower salinity and greater anoxia (Sluijs et al., <a href="#ref102"><span>Reference Sluijs</span>2009</a>). Collectively these events have been denoted Eocene Layers of Mysterious Origin (ELMOs)<a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span><sup>2</sup></a>.</p><p> Around 40&nbsp;Ma, another abrupt warming event occurs (the mid-Eocene Climate Optimum (MECO)), again with an accompanying carbon isotope anomaly (Galazzo et al., <a href="#ref35"><span>Reference Galazzo</span>2014</a>).</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec3-3" id="sec3-3"><h3> Cretaceous and Jurassic ocean anoxic events</h3><p> First identified by Schlanger &amp; Jenkyns (<a href="#ref93"><span>Reference Schlanger and Jenkyns</span>1976</a>), ocean anoxic events (OAEs), identified by periods of greatly increased organic carbon deposition and laminated black shale deposits, are times when significant portions of the ocean (either regionally or globally) became depleted in dissolved oxygen, greatly reducing aerobic bacterial activity. There is partial (though not ubiquitous) evidence during the larger OAEs for euxinia (when the ocean column becomes filled with hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)) (Meyer &amp; Kump, <a href="#ref74"><span>Reference Meyer and Kump</span>2008</a>).</p><p> There were three major OAEs in the Cretaceous, the Weissert event (132&nbsp;Ma) (Erba et al., <a href="#ref32"><span>Reference Erba, Bartolini and Larson</span>2004</a>), OAE-1a around 120&nbsp;Ma lasting about 1&nbsp;Myr and another OAE-2 around 93&nbsp;Ma lasting around 0.8&nbsp;Myr (Kerr, <a href="#ref52"><span>Reference Kerr</span>1998</a>; Li et al., <a href="#ref65"><span>Reference Li</span>2008</a>; Malinverno et al., <a href="#ref67"><span>Reference Malinverno, Erba and Herbert</span>2010</a>; Li et al., <a href="#ref66"><span>Reference Li</span>2017</a>). At least four other minor episodes of organic black shale production are noted in the Cretaceous (the Faraoni event, OAE-1b, 1d and OAE-3) but seem to be restricted to the proto-Atlantic region (Takashima et al., <a href="#ref107"><span>Reference Takashima</span>2006</a>; Jenkyns, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Jenkyns</span>2010</a>). At least one similar event occurred in the Jurassic (183&nbsp;Ma) (Pearce et al., <a href="#ref84"><span>Reference Pearce</span>2008</a>).</p><p> The sequence of events during these events have two distinct fingerprints possibly associated with the two differing theoretical mechanisms for the events. For example, during OAE-1b, there is evidence of strong stratification and a stagnant deep ocean, while for OAE-2, the evidence suggests an decrease in stratification, increased upper ocean productivity and an expansion of the oxygen minimum zones (Takashima et al., <a href="#ref107"><span>Reference Takashima</span>2006</a>).</p><p> At the onset of the events (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1(c)</a>), there is often a significant negative excursion in <em>δ</em> <sup>13</sup>C (as in the PETM), followed by a positive recovery during the events themselves as the burial of (light) organic carbon increased and compensated for the initial release (Jenkyns, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Jenkyns</span>2010</a>; Kuhnt et al., <a href="#ref59"><span>Reference Kuhnt, Holbourn and Moullade</span>2011</a>; Mutterlose et al., <a href="#ref76"><span>Reference Mutterlose</span>2014</a>; Naafs et al., <a href="#ref77"><span>Reference Naafs</span>2016</a>). Causes have been linked to the crustal formation/tectonic activity and enhanced CO<sub>2</sub> (or possibly CH<sub>4</sub>) release, causing global warmth (Jenkyns, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Jenkyns</span>2010</a>). Increased seawater values of <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr and <sup>187</sup>Os/<sup>188</sup>Os suggest increased runoff, greater nutrient supply and consequently higher upper ocean productivity (Jones, <a href="#ref50"><span>Reference Jones</span>2001</a>). Possible hiatuses in some OAE 1a sections are suggestive of an upper ocean dissolution event (Bottini et al., <a href="#ref13"><span>Reference Bottini</span>2015</a>).</p><p> Other important shifts in geochemical tracers during the OAEs include much lower nitrogen isotope ratios (<em>δ</em> <sup>15</sup>N), increases in metal concentrations (including As, Bi, Cd, Co, Cr, Ni, V) (Jenkyns, <a href="#ref49"><span>Reference Jenkyns</span>2010</a>). Positive shifts in sulphur isotopes are seen in most OAEs, with a curious exception in OAE-1a where the shift is negative (Turchyn et al., <a href="#ref110"><span>Reference Turchyn</span>2009</a>).</p></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec3-4" id="sec3-4"><h3> Early Mesozoic and Late Paleozoic events</h3><p> Starting from the Devonian period, there have been several major abrupt events registered in terrestrial sections. The sequences of changes and the comprehensiveness of geochemical analyses are less well known than for later events, partly due to the lack of existing ocean sediment, but these have been identified in multiple locations and are presumed to be global in extent.</p><p> The Late Devonian extinction around 380–360&nbsp;Ma, was one of the big five mass extinctions. It is associated with black shales and ocean anoxia (Algeo &amp; Scheckler, <a href="#ref2"><span>Reference Algeo and Scheckler</span>1998</a>), stretching from the Kellwasser events (~378&nbsp;Ma) to the Hangenberg event at the Devonian–Carboniferous boundary (359&nbsp;Ma) (Brezinski et al., <a href="#ref16"><span>Reference Brezinski</span>2009</a>; Vleeschouwer et al., <a href="#ref115"><span>Reference Vleeschouwer</span>2013</a>).</p><p> In the late Carboniferous, around 305&nbsp;Ma the Pangaean tropical rainforests collapsed (Sahney et al., <a href="#ref92"><span>Reference Sahney, Benton and Falcon-Lang</span>2010</a>). This was associated with a shift towards drier and cooler climate, and possibly a reduction in atmospheric oxygen, leading to extinctions of some mega-fauna.</p><p> Lastly, the end-Permian extinction event (252&nbsp;Ma) lasted about 60 kyr was accompanied by an initial decrease in carbon isotopes (−&nbsp;5–7‰), significant global warming and extensive deforestation and wildfires (Krull &amp; Retallack, <a href="#ref58"><span>Reference Krull and Retallack</span>2000</a>; Shen et al., <a href="#ref100"><span>Reference Shen</span>2011</a>; Burgess et al., <a href="#ref17"><span>Reference Burgess, Bowring and zhong Shen</span>2014</a>) associated with widespread ocean anoxia and euxinia (Wignall &amp; Twitchett, <a href="#ref119"><span>Reference Wignall and Twitchett</span>1996</a>). Pre-event spikes in nickel (Ni) have also been reported (Rothman et al., <a href="#ref91"><span>Reference Rothman</span>2014</a>).</p></div></div><div data-magellan-destination="sec4" id="sec4"><h2> Discussion and testable hypotheses</h2><p> There are undoubted similarities between previous abrupt events in the geological record and the likely Anthropocene signature in the geological record to come. Negative, abrupt <em>δ</em> <sup>13</sup>C excursions, warmings and disruptions of the nitrogen cycle are ubiquitous. More complex changes in biota, sedimentation and mineralogy are also common. Specifically, compared with the hypothesized Anthropocene signature, almost all changes found so far for the PETM are of the same sign and comparable magnitude. Some similarities would be expected if the main effect during any event was a significant global warming, however caused. Furthermore, there is evidence at many of these events that warming was driven by a massive input of exogeneous (biogenic) carbon, either as CO<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub>. At least since the Carboniferous (300–350&nbsp;Ma), there has been sufficient fossil carbon to fuel an industrial civilization comparable with our own and any of these sources could provide the light carbon input. However, in many cases this input is contemporaneous to significant episodes of tectonic and/or volcanic activity, for instance, the coincidence of crustal formation events with the climate changes suggest that the intrusion of basaltic magmas into organic-rich shales and/or petroleum-bearing evaporites (Storey et al., <a href="#ref105"><span>Reference Storey, Duncan and Swisher</span>2007</a>; Svensen et al., <a href="#ref106"><span>Reference Svensen</span>2009</a>; Kravchinsky, <a href="#ref57"><span>Reference Kravchinsky</span>2012</a>) may have released large quantities of CO<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>4</sub> to the atmosphere. Impacts to warming and/or carbon influx (such as increased runoff, erosion, etc.) appear to be qualitatively similar whenever in the geological period they occur. These changes are thus not sufficient evidence for prior industrial civilizations.</p><p> Current changes appear to be significantly faster than the paleoclimatic events (<a href="#fig01">Fig. 1</a>), but this may be partly due to limitations of chronology in the geological record. Attempts to time the length of prior events have used constant sedimentation estimates, or constant-flux markers (e.g.<sup>3</sup>He McGee &amp; Mukhopadhyay, <a href="#ref71"><span>Reference McGee and Mukhopadhyay</span>2012</a>), or orbital chronologies, or supposed annual or seasonal banding in the sediment (Wright &amp; Schaller, <a href="#ref120"><span>Reference Wright and Schaller</span>2013</a>). The accuracy of these methods suffer when there are large changes in sedimentation or hiatuses across these events (which is common), or rely on the imperfect identification of regularities with specific astronomical features (Pearson &amp; Nicholas, <a href="#ref85"><span>Reference Pearson and Nicholas</span>2014</a>; Pearson &amp; Thomas, <a href="#ref86"><span>Reference Pearson and Thomas</span>2015</a>). Additionally, bioturbation will often smooth an abrupt event even in a perfectly preserved sedimentary setting. Thus, the ability to detect an event onset of a few centuries (or less) in the record is questionable, and so direct isolation of an industrial cause based only on apparent timing is also not conclusive.</p><p> The specific markers of human industrial activity discussed above (plastics, synthetic pollutants, increased metal concentrations, etc.) are however a consequence of the specific path human society and technology has taken, and the generality of that pathway for other industrial species is totally unknown. Large-scale energy harnessing is potentially a more universal indicator, and given the large energy density in carbon-based fossil fuel, one might postulate that a light <em>δ</em> <sup>13</sup>C signal might be a common signal. Conceivably, solar, hydro or geothermal energy sources could have been tapped preferentially, and that would greatly reduce any geological footprint (as it would ours). However, any large release of biogenic carbon whether from methane hydrate pools or volcanic intrusions into organic-rich sediments, will have a similar signal. We therefore have a situation where the known unique markers might not be indicative, while the (perhaps) more expected markers are not sufficient.</p><p> We are aware that raising the possibility of a prior industrial civilization as a driver for events in the geological record might lead to rather unconstrained speculation. One would be able to fit any observations to an imagined civilization in ways that would be basically unfalsifiable. Thus, care must be taken not to postulate such a cause until actually positive evidence is available. The Silurian hypothesis cannot be regarded as likely merely because no other valid idea presents itself.</p><p> We nonetheless find the above analyses intriguing enough to motivate some additional research. Firstly, despite copious existing work on the likely Anthropocene signature, we recommend further synthesis and study on the persistence of uniquely industrial byproducts in ocean sediment environments. Are there other classes of compounds that will leave unique traces in the sediment geochemistry on multi-million year timescales? In particular, will the byproducts of common plastics, or organic long-chain synthetics, be detectable?</p><p> Secondly, and this is indeed more speculative, we propose that a deeper exploration of elemental and compositional anomalies in extant sediments spanning previous events be performed (although we expect that far more information has been obtained about these sections than has been referenced here). Oddities in these sections have been looked for previously as potential signals of impact events (successfully for the K–T boundary event, not so for any of the events mentioned above), ranging from iridium layers, shocked quartz, micro-tectites, magnetites, etc. But it may be that a new search and new analyses with the Silurian hypothesis in mind might reveal more. Anomalous behaviour in the past might be more clearly detectable in proxies normalized by weathering fluxes or other constant flux proxies in order to highlight times when productivity or metal production might have been artificially enhanced. Thirdly, should any unexplained anomalies be found, the question of whether there are candidate species in the fossil record may become more relevant, as might questions about their ultimate fate.</p><p> An intriguing hypothesis presents itself should any of the initial releases of light carbon described above indeed be related to a prior industrial civilization. As discussed in the section ‘Cretaceous and Jurassic ocean anoxic events’, these releases often triggered episodes of ocean anoxia (via increased nutrient supply) causing a massive burial of organic matter, which eventually became source strata for further fossil fuels. Thus, the prior industrial activity would have actually given rise to the potential for future industry via their own demise. Large-scale anoxia, in effect, might provide a self-limiting but self-perpetuating feedback of industry on the planet. Alternatively, it may be just be a part of a long-term episodic natural carbon cycle feedback on tectonically active planets.</p><p> Perhaps unusually, the authors of this paper are not convinced of the correctness of their proposed hypothesis. Were it to be true it would have profound implications and not just for astrobiology. However, most readers do not need to be told that it is always a bad idea to decide on the truth or falsity of an idea based on the consequences of it being true. While we strongly doubt that any previous industrial civilization existed before our own, asking the question in a formal way that articulates explicitly what evidence for such a civilization might look like raises its own useful questions related both to astrobiology and to Anthropocene studies. Thus, we hope that this paper will serve as motivation to improve the constraints on the hypothesis so that in future we may be better placed to answer our title question.</p></div></div><div data-magellan-destination="ack" id="ack"><h2> Acknowledgments</h2><p> No funding has been provided nor sought for this study.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-headline="Intel, Samsung, and TSMC Demo 3D-Stacked Transistors" data-elid="2666591700" data-post-url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/cfet-intel-samsung-tsmc" data-authors="Samuel K. Moore" data-page-title="Intel, Samsung, and TSMC Demo 3D-Stacked Transistors - IEEE Spectrum"><p>A vision for future processors with nearly double the density of transistors is beginning to take shape, now that all three  advanced chipmakers have demonstrated <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos" target="_blank">CFETS, or complementary field-effect transistors</a>. CFETs are a single structure that stacks both the types of transistors needed for CMOS logic. At the <a href="https://www.ieee-iedm.org/" target="_blank">IEEE International Electron Devices Meeting</a> this week in San Francisco, <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/where-tomorrow-begins-intels-components-research-labs.html" target="_blank">Intel</a>, <a href="https://research.samsung.com/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>, and <a href="https://research.tsmc.com/english/index.html" target="_blank">TSMC</a> showed what progress they’ve made toward the next evolution in transistors.<br></p><p>Chip companies are transitioning from the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-the-father-of-finfets-helped-save-moores-law" target="_blank">FinFET</a> device structure in use since 2011 to <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-nanosheet-transistor-is-the-next-and-maybe-last-step-in-moores-law" target="_blank">nanosheet</a>, or gate-all-around, transistors. The names reflect the basic structure of the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/transistor">transistor</a>. In the FinFET, the gate controls the flow of current through a vertical silicon fin. In the nanosheet device, that fin is cut into a set of ribbons, each of which is surrounded by the gate. The CFET essentially takes a taller stack of ribbons and uses half for one device and half for the other. This device, as <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/intel">Intel</a> engineers explained in the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/3d-cmos" target="_self">December 2022 issue of <em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a>, builds the two types of transistor—nFETs and pFETs—on top of each other in a single, integrated process.</p><p>Experts estimate CFETs to roll out commercially seven to ten years from now, but there is still a lot of work before they are ready.</p><h2>Intel’s inverter</h2><p>Intel was earliest of the three to demonstrate the CFET, <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/intels-stacked-nanosheet-transistors-could-be-the-next-step-in-moores-law" target="_self">unveiling an early version at IEDM back in 2020</a>. This time around, Intel is reporting several improvements surrounding the simplest circuit that the CFET makes, an inverter. A CMOS inverter sends the same input voltage to the gates of both devices in the stack and produces an output that is the logical inverse of the input.</p><p>“The inverter is done on a single fin,” Marko Radosavljevic, principal engineer at Intel’s components research group, told reporters ahead of the conference. “At maximum scaling, it would be 50 percent” of the size of an ordinary CMOS inverter, he said.</p><p data-rm-resized-container="25%"><img alt="A graph with three colored lines beside a colorful 3D figure of rectangular blocks." data-rm-shortcode-id="9f68c791dbc4059c0b3bfdeb15f30e90" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-graph-with-three-colored-lines-beside-a-colorful-3d-figure-of-rectangular-blocks.jpg?id=50817352&amp;width=980" height="451" id="d43dd" lazy-loadable="true" src="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/a-graph-with-three-colored-lines-beside-a-colorful-3d-figure-of-rectangular-blocks.jpg?id=50817352&amp;width=980" width="452"><small placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Intel’s inverter circuits depend on a new way of connecting the top and bottom transistors [yellow] and on contacting one of them from beneath the silicon [grey]</small><small placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Intel</small></p><p>The hitch is that squeezing in all the interconnects needed to make that two-transistor stack into an inverter circuit eats away at the area advantage. To keep things tight, Intel tried to remove some of the congestion involved in connecting to the stacked device. In today’s transistors, all the connections come from above the device itself. But later this year, Intel is deploying a technology called <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/backside-power-delivery" target="_blank">backside power delivery</a> that allows interconnects to exist both above and below the surface of the silicon. Using that technology to contact the bottom transistor from below instead of from above significantly simplified the circuit. The resulting inverter had a density quality called contacted poly pitch (CPP, essentially the minimum distance from one transistor gate to the next) of 60 nanometers. Today’s 5 nm node chips have a CPP of about 50 nm.</p><p>Additionally, Intel improved the CFET stack’s electrical characteristics by increasing the number of nanosheets per device from two to three, decreasing the separation between the two devices from 50 nm to 30 nm, and using an improved geometry for connecting parts of the device.</p><h2>Samsung’s secret sauce</h2><p>Samsung went even smaller than Intel, showing results for 48-nm and 45-nm contacted poly pitch (CPP), compared to Intel’s 60 nm, though these were for individual devices, not complete inverters. Although there was some performance degradation in the smaller of Samsung’s two prototype CFETs, it wasn’t much, and the company’s researchers believe manufacturing process optimization will take care of it.</p><p>Crucial to Samsung’s success was the ability to electrically isolate the sources and drains of the stacked pFET and nFET devices. Without adequate isolation, the device, which Samsung calls a 3D stacked FET (3DSFET), will leak current. A key step to achieving that isolation was swapping an etching step involving wet chemicals with a new kind of dry etch. That led to an 80 percent boost in the yield of good devices.</p><p>Like Intel, Samsung contacted the bottom of the device from beneath the silicon to save space. However, the Korean chipmaker differed from the American one by using a single nanosheet in each of the paired devices, instead of Intel’s three. According to its researchers, increasing the number of nanosheets will enhance the CFET’s performance.</p><h2>TSMC takes its shot</h2><p>Like Samsung, TSMC too managed to get to an industrially-relevant pitch of 48 nm. Its device’s distinctions included a new way to form a dielectric layer between the top and bottom devices to keep them isolated. Nanosheets are generally formed from alternating layers of silicon and silicon germanium. At the appropriate step in the process, a silicon-germanium specific etching method removes that material, releasing the silicon nanowires. For the layer destined to isolate the two device from each other, TSMC used silicon germanium with an unusually high fraction of germanium, knowing that it would etch away faster than the other SiGe layers. That way the isolation layer could be built several steps before releasing the silicon nanowires.</p></div></div>]]></description>

							<em>Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong speaks to a reporter at Gimpo International Airport upon returning from his trip to the Netherlands, on Friday. (Yonhap)</em>
						</p><div><p>Samsung Electronics Chairman Lee Jae-yong hinted at his satisfaction over his trip to the Netherlands with President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday, saying that most of the achievements made there were focused on semiconductors.</p><p>"About 90 percent of the achievements made in the trip to the Netherlands are on semiconductors,” Lee told reporters when asked about the achievements of the trip, at Gimpo International Airport on Friday, with a satisfied smile on his face.</p><p>Lee returned from the trip to the European country in the early morning. He had accompanied the president during the four-day state visit to meet with Dutch leaders as well as the heads of prominent Dutch chip equipment firms, including ASML, to forge a number of deals.</p><p>ASML is the sole manufacturer of EUV equipment -- a key system for producing the world's most advanced semiconductor chips with nodes at 7 nanometers and below -- with unrivaled technology.</p><p>Securing an order of the ASML's EUV machines, of which only 40 to 50 units per year are produced, has become a mission for global chip suppliers, as the equipment is deemed a crucial factor that can sway chipmakers' survival in the market.</p><p>Samsung, the world's top memory chipmaker by revenue, inked a 1-trillion-won ($762 million) deal with the Dutch equipment supplier to build a research facility for developing highly advanced EUV technology in Korea.</p><p>Samsung Electronics Vice Chairman Kyung Kye-hyun, head of the Device Solutions Division, which oversees the company’s chip business, also underscored that the latest agreements will support Samsung's priority to secure the Dutch firm's next-generation high-numerical aperture EUV lithography scanner equipment.</p><p>"Samsung has secured a priority over the High-NA equipment technology," Kyung said, as he arrived in the airport with Lee.</p><p>"(From the trip), I believe we created an opportunity for us to optimize the usage of High-NA technology for our production of DRAM memory chips and logic chips, in the long term," he said.</p><p>According to Kyung, Samsung and ASML will build a joint research facility in Dongtan, Gyeonggi Province and bring the High-NA EUV equipment into the facility. There, the engineers of the two companies will work together to enhance the chipmaking process, Kyung said.</p><p>"Rather than focusing on how fast we bring the High-NA EUV machine into Korea, it is more important for us to build the partnership (with ASML) so that Samsung can better use the next-generation equipment," Kyung said, adding that Samsung did forge a strong partnership with a very "sturdy ally."</p><p>The high-NA EUV equipment raises the lens' numerical aperture -- indicating its light-collecting ability -- from 0.33 to 0.55, allowing chip manufacturers to utilize ultrafine patterning technology to produce 2nm-node chips.</p><p>ASML is preparing to launch the product for the first time in the industry in the coming months.</p><p>ASML is expected to supply 10 units of the High-NA EUV equipment to the market next year, and Intel has reportedly secured six of them. The Dutch firm said it aims to increase annual production of the new product to 20 in the coming years.</p><p>With the goal to catch up to market leader TSMC in the foundry business, Samsung's foundry division announced it will start production of chips with 2nm nodes in late 2025.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Public key cryptography uses two keys: a private key and a public key. The nature of these keys depends on the encryption scheme, such as whether one is using RSA, ECC, or some other method, but you can think of a key as a long number. A key may be a short list of numbers, but let’s just say a key is a number.</p>
<p>When you generate a public key, you get a pair of numbers, one that you keep secret and one that you publicize. Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message that only you can decrypt, assuming only you have your private key.</p>
<p>If I give you my public key, say I post it on my web site, how can you be sure that it’s really my key? Maybe my site has been hacked and I don’t even know it. Or maybe someone tampers with the site content between the time it leaves my server and arrives at your browser (though TLS is supposed to address that).</p>
<p>We could get on a phone call and I you could read the key back to me. The problem with this approach is that keys are <em>long</em>. A 4096-bit RSA key, for example, encoded in hexadecimal, is 1024 characters long.</p>
<p>You could read off the last so many characters of the key, maybe telling me that what you recieved ends in 9F0D 38FA. That would probably be sufficient to tell one key from another—it’s very unlike you’d have two keys in a keychain that share the same last 32 bits—but that doesn’t mean the previous part of the key hasn’t been tampered with.</p>
<p>What you’d really like is a cryptographic hash of the public key, short enough to conveniently compare, but long enough that it would be infeasible for someone to alter the public key in such a way as to produce the same hash. And that’s exactly what a fingerprint is.</p>
<p>In GnuPG, the GNU implementation of PGP, a fingerprint is an 160-bit hash, which means 40 hexadecimal characters. Manually verifying 40 characters is feasible; manually verifying 1024 characters is not.</p>

On X, one fan said the victory “will go down as a historical American sports moment on par with Babe Ruth calling his home run shot in the 1932 World Series”.</p><ul>

</ul><p>Microsoft Excel is officially an esport. In each round, eight players are given a big ream of data, plus a set of instructions. Contestants need to create formulas and subsets to process the data, working against the clock to solve stages of the case and earn bonus points. Every seven and a half minutes the lowest scorer is eliminated.</p><p>“We have to decide, do we go for the bonus questions and get them in before others, or do you solve levels and progress further along?” says Ngai, who was given his nickname by “another Excel guru” on TikTok.</p><p>When he’s not inputting cell values on a stage in Vegas, Ngai is a senior actuary in central Sydney. He says he is “not bad” at maths – by which he means he came top in the state of New South Wales in his year 12 maths exams. Since graduating from university, where he was awarded a degree in actuarial studies, he has used Excel every day for work.</p><p>He started competing in the Excel championships in 2018 after hearing about the series. He won the title in 2019 when the competition was still in its infancy. Since then, the game has evolved.</p><p>With entertainment in mind, the organisers shortened rounds to 30 minutes and livened up the cases. For example, Ngai had to calculate the market value of a fleet of spaceships using real data from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jun/03/welcome-to-eve-online-the-spaceship-game-where-high-flyers-live-out-their-imperial-fantasies" data-link-name="in body link">video game Eve Online</a> – with the action televised live on ESPN.</p><figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement"><a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-13">skip past newsletter promotion</a><p id="EmailSignup-skip-link-13" tabindex="0" aria-label="after newsletter promotion" role="note">after newsletter promotion</p></figure><p>The drama on the night made his win feel “crazy”, he says – not unlike last year, when he beat Brittany Deaton by just five points. If the game format sounds surprisingly gripping, it is also helped by the setting. Luxor hotel’s HyperX <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/esports" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag">esports</a> arena is complete with big screens, gaming seats and two enthusiastic commentators. Alongside the $15,000 prize money is an oversized boxing-style leather belt.</p><p>Saturday’s 16 semi-finalists came from all over the world, including Poland, Brazil, Canada, Australia, the US and the UK. The community is tight-knit and the championships coincided with the Active Cell conference, where fans can join Excel masterclasses and finesse their skills in the spreadsheet’s new functions. Nowadays the spreadsheet is bulging with action, with computer programming and links to other software built into its design.</p><p>If there’s one thing Ngai has learned from his three wins it is that sometimes simple is best.</p><p>“The nature of this competition is you don’t necessarily have to know everything about Excel to be successful,” he says. “Keeping it simple can be quite effective.”</p><p>But the last word goes to Brandon Moyer, who was eliminated in the final. In his post-game interview, the US competitor thanked his wife, who “never made fun of me, even once, for competing in the Microsoft Excel world championship”.</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-target="readme-toc.content">
            <article itemprop="text"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Apter Trees in C++</h2>
<p dir="auto">Apter Trees are a simpler representation of trees using just two vectors: <code>[nodevalues, parentindices]</code>.</p>
<p dir="auto">This repo contains a tree-like data type implemented in C++17, in the style of Stevan Apter in
<a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10500340" rel="nofollow">Treetable: a case-study in q</a>.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Who cares?</h2>
<p dir="auto">A tree is a data structure in which values have parent-child relationships to
each other. They come in many forms.</p>
<p dir="auto">In most software, trees are implemented like a typical binary tree, where each
node contains its own data and a pointer to each of its children, nominally just
left and right, which are also nodes. The cycle continues.</p>
<p dir="auto">Using such a data structure can be challenging due to recursion and slow due to
cache behavior in modern systems and frequent malloc()s. The concept of who
"owns" a tree node in such a system can become complex in multi-layered
software.</p>
<p dir="auto">Apter Trees are much faster, easier to reason about, and easier to implement.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">How it works</h2>
<p dir="auto">An Apter tree is implemented as two same-sized arrays.</p>
<p dir="auto">One is a vector (array) of data (we'll call it <code>d</code>). These correspond to the
values, or things that each node contains.</p>
<p dir="auto">The other is a vector of parent indices (<code>p</code>). The index of an item in the <code>d</code>
vector is used as its key, which we will call <code>c</code> in the examples below.</p>
<p dir="auto">Often, the key/index <code>c</code> will just be an int.</p>
<p dir="auto">So, if we had a dog family tree in which Coco was the father of Molly and Arca,
and Arca had a son named Cricket, you might have a data structure like:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="	tree.d = [&quot;Coco&quot;, &quot;Molly&quot;, &quot;Arca&quot;,&quot;Cricket&quot;]
	tree.p = [0,0,0,2]"><pre><code>	tree.d = ["Coco", "Molly", "Arca","Cricket"]
	tree.p = [0,0,0,2]
</code></pre></div>
<p dir="auto">A node with a key of <code>0</code> whose parent is zero is the root node. Apter trees
require a root node, or the use of <code>-1</code> to mean "no parent", which is slightly
less elegant so I'll ignore it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Computers are very, very fast at manipulating vectors. They're so much faster
than pointer operations that comparisons of big-O notation for an algorithm
don't play out in practice.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Operations in psuedocode</h2>
<p dir="auto">The technique is applicable in all languages.  This library is written in C++
but I will use psuedocode to explain how it works.</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Empty tree</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="tree() = { {d:[], p:[]} }       # some sort of [data,parentidxs] vector"><pre><code>tree() = { {d:[], p:[]} }       # some sort of [data,parentidxs] vector
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Number of nodes</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="nodecnt(t) = { len(t.p) }"><pre><code>nodecnt(t) = { len(t.p) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Keys of all nodes</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="join(x,y) = { flatten(x,y) }    # append to vec. i.e., x.push_back(y), x[]=y, etc.
range(x,y) = { # Q til, APL/C++ iota; return [x, x+1, x+2, ...y-1]
	i=x; ret=[]; while(i++<y) ret=join(ret,i); return ret
}
keys(t) = { range(0, nodecnt(t)) }"><pre><code>join(x,y) = { flatten(x,y) }    # append to vec. i.e., x.push_back(y), x[]=y, etc.
range(x,y) = { # Q til, APL/C++ iota; return [x, x+1, x+2, ...y-1]
	i=x; ret=[]; while(i++&lt;y) ret=join(ret,i); return ret
}
keys(t) = { range(0, nodecnt(t)) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Add an item to the tree:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="insert(t, val, parentidx) = {
	t.d = join(t.d,val)
	t.p = join(t.p,parentidx)
}"><pre><code>insert(t, val, parentidx) = {
	t.d = join(t.d,val)
	t.p = join(t.p,parentidx)
}
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Determine parent of a given node:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Remember, we use the numeric index of a node (<code>childidx</code>) as its identifier:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="parentof(t,childidx) = { t.p[childidx] }"><pre><code>parentof(t,childidx) = { t.p[childidx] }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Retrieve value of node:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">We'll use <code>c</code> instead of <code>childidx</code>, from here on out.</p>

<ul dir="auto">
<li>Scan for keys that have a given value:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="where(vec,val) = { # return indices of vec that contain val
	matches=[]
	for idx,v in vec: if(v==val, {matches=join(matches,idx)})
	return matches
}
search(t,val) = { where(t.d,val) }"><pre><code>where(vec,val) = { # return indices of vec that contain val
	matches=[]
	for idx,v in vec: if(v==val, {matches=join(matches,idx)})
	return matches
}
search(t,val) = { where(t.d,val) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Determine children of a node:</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="childnodes(t,c) = { where(t.p,c) }"><pre><code>childnodes(t,c) = { where(t.p,c) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Retrieve child nodes' values</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="# We're assuming you can index with a vector; otherwise loop required
childdata(t,c) = { data(childnodes(c)) }"><pre><code># We're assuming you can index with a vector; otherwise loop required
childdata(t,c) = { data(childnodes(c)) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Determine leaf nodes (those with no children):</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">First, build a vector of all the indices. Then remove those indices that are
also in <code>p</code>. The psuedocode below is a slow implementation; should be done as a
single loop.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="except(x,y) = { # return elements of x except those in y. set subtraction
	ret=[]; 
	for idx,xx in x: if(!xx in y, {ret=join(ret,xx)}); 
	return ret;
}
leaves(t) = { except(keys(t), t.p) }"><pre><code>except(x,y) = { # return elements of x except those in y. set subtraction
	ret=[]; 
	for idx,xx in x: if(!xx in y, {ret=join(ret,xx)}); 
	return ret;
}
leaves(t) = { except(keys(t), t.p) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Determine vector of parents for a given node, or path to node:</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Here we keep going up the tree until we can't go any further (ends at 0). When node zero's
parent is zero, we know we've reached the root node - that the "checking last value" trick
works. We call this form of iteration <code>exhaust</code>. It's called <code>scan</code> in K and Q.</p>
<p dir="auto">We reverse the result so that it is in <code>parentA.parentB.parentC.child</code> order.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="exhaust(vec,start) = {
	ret=[]; last=x=start
	do {
		last=x
		ret=join(ret,x)
		x=vec[x]
	} until x==last
	return ret
}
parentnodes(t,c) = { reverse(exhaust(t.p, c) }"><pre><code>exhaust(vec,start) = {
	ret=[]; last=x=start
	do {
		last=x
		ret=join(ret,x)
		x=vec[x]
	} until x==last
	return ret
}
parentnodes(t,c) = { reverse(exhaust(t.p, c) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Determine data for path through tree (i.e., all parents of a node)</li>
</ul>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="parentdata(t,c) = { data(parentnodes(t,c)) }"><pre><code>parentdata(t,c) = { data(parentnodes(t,c)) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>In order traversal</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">The simplest way is to get the list of leaves, and then determine the path to each. We finally
sort those vectors.</p>
<p dir="auto">I believe there is a simpler way that can work in a single pass, or at least a single pass
with a sufficiently large stack. I'm still exploring this idea. Let me know if you have any
suggestions.</p>
<p dir="auto">We're assuming a fairly flexible sort function here which can handle sorting vectors of vectors.</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="all(t) = { sort(each(leaves(t), (c){ parent(t, c) })) }"><pre><code>all(t) = { sort(each(leaves(t), (c){ parent(t, c) })) }
</code></pre></div>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Delete item</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This can vary depending on your application. A sentinel value like <code>MAXINT</code> in
the parent column is probably easiest. Some systems uses <code>-1</code> to represent an
empty node if you can spare the sign bit.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Again, who cares? (Unfounded editorializing)</h2>
<p dir="auto">I think this is the most elegant implementation style of trees I've seen.</p>
<p dir="auto">Given the right vector operations library, it's by far the shortest, which
means you can easily understand it, find bugs in it.</p>
<p dir="auto">Given the simplicity, it's easy to adapt for other usage scenarios. For
instance, you could maintain a third index of keys to create low overhead
sorted order for data.</p>
<p dir="auto">You can ignore the parent index vector and iterate
quickly through the values if you are searching for something, which is like a
deep map, for free. You can remap all parent-child relatioships in one go. You
can build a serialized version instantly or transmit it over a network without
iteration. It's GPU friendly. It's easy to use in an embedded context. It's
secure because you can easily impose boundaries (by not allowing the vectors
to grow beyond a certain size).</p>
<p dir="auto">Given common sense it's also the fastest. There's very little memory overhead,
and in many cases, access will be linear. Intermediate values and recursion is
minimized. Computers are great at handling ints cuz that's what the benchmarks
do.</p>
<p dir="auto">Pointers are annoying anyway.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Origins</h2>
<p dir="auto">I've been lazily trying to figure out who invented this technique. It's so
obvious I would imagine it must have had a name during the vector-oriented 60s
and 70s.</p>
<p dir="auto">The first full explanation I saw was from Apter as explained above, but it was
also documented widely as early as K3. Here's a version in Q:</p>
<div data-snippet-clipboard-copy-content="/ nested directory: use a parent vector, e.g.

<p dir="auto">I must have read that a hundred times before I internalized its genius.  <a href="https://a.kx.com/q/tree.q" rel="nofollow">See
four other ways to represent trees in K</a> each in
about three lines of code.</p>
<p dir="auto">APL, or at least Dyalog, seems to implement trees in a more traditional way,
using nested boxes: <a href="https://dfns.dyalog.com/n_BST.htm" rel="nofollow">see here for more</a>.
They do however use a <a href="https://dfns.dyalog.com/n_Graphs.htm" rel="nofollow">similar technique for vector
graphs</a>.</p>
<p dir="auto">It appears to be known to J users as seen in <a href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#J:_Alternate_implementation" rel="nofollow">Rosetta Code's tree
implementation in

(with some illuminating comments).</p>
<p dir="auto">John Earnest goes into [much more detail about vector tree implementations]
(<a href="https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/blob/gh-pages/docs/Trees.md">https://github.com/JohnEarnest/ok/blob/gh-pages/docs/Trees.md</a>), including the
"index of offsets" approach to deleting entries. Worth a read.</p>
<p dir="auto">A more elaborate approach is to also track the depth of each item. <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2935331" rel="nofollow">Details about
that approach</a> can be found in Aaron
W. Hsu's paper on the subject.</p>
<h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Other common tree implementations</h2>
<p dir="auto">Here are some other well known trees.</p>
<p dir="auto">None of these do the same thing as an Apter tree, and some are far larger due
to generalizations, but it's still interesting to consider how much code
different styles of trees requires to do simple operations.</p>

<p dir="auto">I've made a sorta lazy attempt at implementing this in C++ as a way to learn C++17. Not really ready

				<p>Some might remember a book I released in 2016, “The Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen”. A lot has changed in the world since then, and Shenzhen is no exception.</p>
<p>There’s a new maintainer of the guide, <a href="https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg">Naomi Wu (@realsexycyborg)</a>, and she is crowdfunding an updated, new version with a snazzy red cover, called <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/machinery-enchantress/the-new-essential-guide-to-electronics-in-shenzhen">“The New Essential Guide to Electronics in Shenzhen”</a>. While the technical Chinese terms haven’t changed much, a lot has changed in the culture and ways to do business; her new text gives pointers on how to engage on Wechat, digital etiquette in China, updated maps, and much more.</p>
<p>If you enjoyed The Guide in the past, or hope to visit the electronics markets in Shenzhen in the future, you can <a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/machinery-enchantress/the-new-essential-guide-to-electronics-in-shenzhen">reserve your copy today</a>.</p>
