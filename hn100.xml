            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/">https://morizbuesing.com/blog/greppability-code-metric/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41430772">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p>When I‘m working on maintaining an unfamiliar codebase, I will spend a lot of
time grepping the code base for strings. Even in projects exclusively written
by myself, I have to search a lot: function names, error messages,
class names, that kind of thing. If I can‘t find what I‘m looking for, it‘ll
be frustrating in the best case, or in the worst case lead to dangerous
situations where I‘ll assume a thing is not needed anymore, since I can‘t find
any references to it in the code base. From these situations, I‘ve derived some
rules you can apply to keep your code base greppable:</p>
<h2 id="dont-split-up-identifiers">Don‘t split up identifiers</h2>
<p>It turns out that splitting up, or dynamically constructing identifiers is a
bad idea.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two database tables <code>shipping_addresses</code>, <code>billing_addresses</code>,
it might seem like a perfectly good solution to construct the table name
dynamically from the order type.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getTableName</span><span> =</span><span> (addressType</span><span>:</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span> |</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> `${</span><span>addressType</span><span>}_addresses`</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Though it looks nice and DRY, it‘s not great for maintainenance: someone will
inevitably search the code base for the table name <code>shipping_addresses</code> and
miss this occurence.</p>
<p>Refactored for greppability:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getTableName</span><span> =</span><span> (addressType</span><span>:</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span> |</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>addressType</span><span> ===</span><span> 'shipping'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>        return</span><span> 'shipping_addresses'</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    if</span><span> (</span><span>addressType</span><span> ===</span><span> 'billing'</span><span>) {</span></span>
<span><span>        return</span><span> 'billing_addresses'</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>    throw</span><span> new</span><span> TypeError</span><span>(</span><span>'addressType must be billing or shipping'</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>The same goes for column names, object fields, and, god forbid, method/function
names (it‘s easily possible to dynamically construct method names with javascript).</p>
<h2 id="use-the-same-names-for-things-across-the-stack">Use the same names for things across the stack</h2>
<p>Don‘t rename fields at application boundaries to match naming schemes. An obvious
example is then importing postgres-style snake_case identifiers into
javascript, then converting them to camelCase. This makes it harder to
find—you now have to grep for two strings instead of one in order to find all
occurences!</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getAddress</span><span> =</span><span> async</span><span> (id</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    const</span><span> address</span><span> =</span><span> await</span><span> getAddressById</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>        streetName: </span><span>address</span><span>.</span><span>street_name</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        zipCode: </span><span>address</span><span>.</span><span>zip_code</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>You‘re better off biting the bullet and returning the object directly:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>const</span><span> getAddress</span><span> =</span><span> async</span><span> (id</span><span>:</span><span> string</span><span>) </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>    return</span><span> await</span><span> getAddressById</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>)</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="flat-is-better-than-nested">Flat is better than nested</h2>
<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">Zen of Python</a>,
when dealing with namespaces, flattening your folders/object structures is mostly better
than nesting.</p>
<p>For example if you have two choices to set up your translation files:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>        "login"</span><span>: {</span></span>
<span><span>            "title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        },</span></span>
<span><span>        "register"</span><span>:</span></span>
<span><span>            "title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Register"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>            "passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>        }</span></span>
<span><span>    }</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>{</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.login.passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.title"</span><span>: </span><span>"Login"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.emailLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Email"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>    "auth.register.passwordLabel"</span><span>: </span><span>"Password"</span><span>,</span></span>
<span><span>}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>take the second option! You will be able to easily find your keys now, which
you are probably referring to as something like <code>t('auth.login.title')</code>.</p>
<p>Or consider React component structure: a component stucture like</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>./components/AttributeFilterCombobox.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterDialog.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterRating.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/AttributeFilterSelect.tsx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>is preferable to</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code><span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Combobox.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Dialog.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Rating.tsx</span></span>
<span><span>./components/attribute/filter/Select.tsx</span></span></code></pre>
<p>from a greppability perspective, since you‘ll be able to grep for the
whole namespaced component <code>AttributeFilterCombobox</code> just from the usage, as
opposed to just <code>Dialog</code>, which you might have multiple of accross your
application.</p>  </div></div>]]></description>

<p>When Microsoft announced Recall, it was intended to be baked into Windows 11's functions. The feature tracks everything you do on compatible Windows PCs and uses an on-device generative AI model to retrieve particular information a user is looking for, by filing through a library of screenshots saved on the device. Critics of the feature immediately pointed out that it is highly susceptible to cybersecurity flaws since it indiscriminately saves sensitive information like passwords, confidential work, and personal information. </p><section x-data="window.newsletter()" x-init="init()" data-ga-impression="" data-ga-category="newsletters" data-ga-module="incontent_nl_signup" data-ga-label="mashablelightspeed">

   <p>An Iranian writer and activist has been sentenced to 12 years in prison after replying with a single dot, or period, in response to a post on the social platform X by Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>   <p>Hossein Shanbehzadeh, a longtime critic of Iran’s leadership, was active on social media, supporting political prisoners and the removal of mandatory headscarves for women. He was sent to prison in 2019 for his online comments insulting Khamenei. He later wrote about the experience, including <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-judiciary-alleges-activist-has-ties-to-israeli-spy-agency/7648312.html">being flogged</a>, according to Voice of America.</p>   <p>In early June, 35-year-old Shanbehadeh was arrested in Ardabil, northwestern Iran. According to <a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-blogger-detained-period-ayatollah/32980810.html">Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</a>, he told his family he wasn’t sure why he was arrested, but it came shortly after he posted the response to Khamenei’s tweet, which showed the Iranian leader with the country’s national volleyball team.</p>

   <p>Shanbehzadeh is just the latest activist to be caught up in the hard-line government’s crackdown on critics. Iran watchers say the leadership has felt insecure about the high level of dissent in the country for a while. Artists, playwrights, directors and others are also being swept up and given long prison sentences. In late April, Iranian rapper <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248245576/iranian-rapper-receives-death-sentence-for-songs-criticizing-the-establishment" target="1248245576">Toomaj Salehi</a> was handed the death sentence for his antigovernment videos.</p>   <p>Shanbehzadeh was sentenced to five years for alleged pro-Israel propaganda activity, four years for insulting Islamic sanctities, two years for spreading lies online and an additional year for anti-regime propaganda.</p>   <p>His lawyer, Amir Raisian, told Shargh Network, a reformist newspaper in Iran, that he would appeal the verdict, especially the accusation of pro-Israel activity. The prosecutor’s office in Ardabil alleged that Shanbehzadeh had been in contact with Israeli intelligence officers and was arrested when trying to leave the country, according to Voice of America.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="article"> <p>It’s a quiet Saturday afternoon. I’ve carved out a few precious hours for coding, armed with a steaming cup of coffee and the familiar urge to dive into a project. As I settle into my chair and open my terminal, I’m confronted with a challenge that’s become all too familiar: deciding which of my many unfinished projects to tackle.</p>
<p>I navigate to my project directory, greeted by a graveyard of half-implemented ideas and stalled works-in-progress. Each one represents a different problem I’ve tried to solve, a different technology I’ve attempted to master. They’re all interesting, each with its own purpose and potential. But as I scan through them, I can already feel my enthusiasm waning. I know that whichever one I choose, I’ll be facing not just the original problem, but a hydra of new challenges that have sprouted since I last looked at the code.</p>
<p>After some deliberation, I make my choice and fire up my IDE. As I pull the latest changes and begin the archaeological dig through my commit history, I brace myself for what I know I’ll find. Sure enough, there it is: an unfinished frontend task, more wireframe than polished UI. Or perhaps it’s a library integration that’s hitting limitations I hadn’t anticipated. Or, in classic over-engineering fashion, I’ve built a complex architecture for a problem that could have been solved with a simple script.</p>
<p>I roll up my sleeves and dive in, determined to make progress. The next couple of hours fly by in a flurry of activity—refactoring code, debugging integration issues, or wrestling with CSS to get that one component to align just right. Before I know it, my allocated time is up.</p>
<p>As I prepare to step away from my desk, I can’t shake a feeling of frustration. I started the session full of optimism, ready to make significant headway. Now, I’m left with a nagging sense of inadequacy. Despite my efforts, it feels like I’ve barely moved the needle. The codebase is still a maze of TODO comments and half-implemented features. The Hydra of software development has grown two new heads for every one I managed to address.</p>
<p>This cycle of enthusiasm, struggle, and disappointment has become all too familiar. It’s the Hydra Project Effect: no matter how much progress I make, new challenges always seem to sprout in their place. But while this pattern may seem unbreakable, I’m determined to find a way to tame this beast. In this post, I’ll explore strategies for breaking out of this cycle of endless beginnings and unsatisfying middles. It’s time to learn the art of finishing, to slay this Hydra once and for all, and to finally experience the satisfaction of a completed project.</p>

<h2 id="the-allure-of-the-endless-project">The Allure of the Endless Project</h2>
<p>There’s a certain comfort in the realm of infinite possibility. When a project is ongoing, it can be anything. It’s Schrödinger’s<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-schrodinger" id="user-content-fnref-schrodinger" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> project—simultaneously perfect and flawed until you actually finish it and put it out into the world. The moment you declare a project “done,” you open it up to criticism, both external and internal. What if it’s not good enough? What if I missed something crucial?</p>
<p>This fear of finality, combined with the excitement of new ideas, creates an ideal environment for project procrastination. It’s always easier to start something new than to push through the final, often tedious stages of completion of a project. But there’s more to it than just fear.</p>
<p>An unfinished project is full of intoxicating <em>potential</em>. It could be the next big thing, a revolutionary idea, or your magnum opus. This potential often feels more exciting than the reality of a finished product. There’s also comfort in the familiar territory of an ongoing project. You know the codebase, you understand the problems, and you’re in your element. Starting something new means facing the unknown, which can be daunting.</p>
<p>The illusion of productivity plays a significant role too. As long as you’re working on something, you feel productive. Jumping from project to project gives you a constant stream of “new project energy,” which can feel more invigorating than the grind of finishing a single project. It’s a way of avoiding difficult decisions that come with completion. Do you cut that feature you spent weeks on but isn’t quite right? Do you release now or spend another month polishing? By keeping projects ongoing, you can sidestep these challenging choices.</p>
<p>The absence of deadlines in personal projects adds another layer to this complexity<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-parkinson-law" id="user-content-fnref-parkinson-law" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>. Without the external pressure of a due date, it’s all too easy to fall into the trap of perfectionism. We find ourselves endlessly tweaking and refining, always chasing that elusive “perfect” solution. The irony is that this pursuit of perfection often leads to imperfect results—or no results at all. In our professional lives, deadlines force us to prioritize and make pragmatic decisions. But in personal projects, the luxury of unlimited time can become a curse, allowing us to justify spending hours, days, or even weeks on minor details that, in reality, make little difference to the project’s overall success or usefulness. It’s a stark reminder that sometimes, “good enough” truly is perfect, especially when the alternative is never finishing at all.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, sometimes we fear success as much as failure. A successful project might lead to increased expectations, more responsibility, or a change in identity that we’re not quite ready for. The unfinished project becomes a safety net, protecting us from the unknown consequences of success.</p>

<h2 id="the-cost-of-never-finishing">The Cost of Never Finishing</h2>
<p>But this cycle of endless beginnings comes at a steep price. There’s a unique satisfaction in seeing a project through to completion that no amount of starting can match. Moreover, unfinished projects carry a mental weight. They linger in the back of your mind, quietly draining your mental energy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, we learn different lessons from finishing projects than we do from starting them. Starting teaches us about ideation and initial implementation. Finishing, on the other hand, teaches us about perseverance, attention to detail, and the art of knowing when to let go. These are invaluable skills that can only be honed through the act of completion.</p>
<p>The costs of never finishing extend far beyond just missed opportunities. While starting projects might expose you to new technologies or concepts, it’s in the act of finishing—of solving those last, trickiest problems—where real <em>skill growth</em> often occurs. Each unfinished project can chip away at your confidence. Over time, you might start to doubt your ability to complete anything substantial, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of incompletion.</p>
<p>The end stages of a project often involve optimization, refactoring, and really understanding the intricacies of your code. By not finishing, you miss out on these valuable learning experiences. In professional settings, being known as someone who starts things but doesn’t finish them can be detrimental to your career. Employers and clients value those who can deliver completed projects, making the ability to finish a crucial professional skill.</p>
<p>Every unfinished project takes up mental space. It’s like having dozens of browser tabs open—each one uses a little bit of your mental RAM, leaving you with less capacity for new ideas and focused work. This mental clutter can be a significant drain on your creativity and productivity.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, you deny yourself the incomparable feeling of satisfaction when you release a finished project into the world. There’s a <em>joy in shipping</em> that can’t be replicated by starting something new. Finished projects also invite feedback, and without shipping, you miss out on valuable insights from users or peers that could significantly improve your skills and future projects.</p>
<p>Understanding both the allure of endless projects and the cost of never finishing is crucial. It’s not about dismissing the excitement of new beginnings, but rather about finding a balance—learning to channel that initial enthusiasm into the equally important (if sometimes less glamorous) work of seeing things through to completion. By recognizing these patterns in ourselves, we can start to develop strategies to overcome them and finally slay the Project Hydra.</p>
<h2 id="strategies-for-taming-the-project-hydra">Strategies for Taming the Project Hydra</h2>
<p>So, how do I break this cycle? How do I learn to finish what I start? Here are some strategies I’m implementing to tame my own Project Hydra:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>✅ <strong>Define “Done” from the Start</strong>: Before diving into a project, I’ll clearly define what “finished” looks like. What are the core features that constitute a complete project? I’ll write them down and resist the urge to expand this list as I go. This clarity helps prevent scope creep and gives me a clear target to aim for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🚀 <strong>Embrace MVP</strong>: Instead of aiming for perfection, I’ll aim for “good enough.” I’ll get a basic version working and out into the world. I can always iterate and improve later. This approach helps maintain momentum and provides early feedback opportunities.</p>

<p>⏳ <strong>Time-Box My Projects</strong>: I’ll give myself a deadline. It doesn’t have to be short, but it should be finite. Having an end date creates urgency and helps me prevent endless feature creep. I find that breaking larger projects into smaller, time-boxed phases helps maintain a sense of progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🧩 <strong>Practice Finishing Small Things</strong>: I’ll build my “finishing muscle” by completing small projects or tasks regularly. I recognize that the skill of finishing is like any other—it improves with practice. This could be as simple as finishing a blog post or completing a small coding challenge each week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>💡 <strong>Separate Ideation from Implementation</strong>: I’ll keep a separate idea log. When new features or project ideas pop up during implementation, I’ll jot them down for future consideration instead of immediately acting on them. This helps maintain focus on the current project while still capturing potentially valuable ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>🎉 <strong>Celebrate Completions</strong>: I’ll make finishing a big deal. I’ll celebrate when I complete a project, no matter how small. This positive reinforcement can help shift my mindset towards completion. Whether it’s treating myself to a nice dinner or simply sharing my accomplishment with friends, acknowledging these wins boosts motivation for future projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>👥 <strong>Embrace Accountability</strong>: I’ll find ways to make myself accountable for finishing projects. This could involve finding an accountability partner, making public commitments about project milestones, or joining a group of fellow developers. External accountability adds motivation and support to the often solitary journey of personal projects.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-accountability-study" id="user-content-fnref-accountability-study" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">3</a></sup></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategies provide my personal roadmap for overcoming the challenges of the Project Hydra. By implementing them consistently, I hope to develop better habits and increase my chances of seeing projects through to completion. It’s about creating a supportive structure around my work, balancing internal motivation with external accountability, and gradually building the skill of finishing.</p>
<p>Of course, strategies are just the beginning. The real challenge lies in consistently applying these approaches to my work. It’s a process of trial and error, of learning what works best for my personal style and the specific demands of each project. But with each small win, with each project pushed a little closer to completion, I’m building the habits and mindset needed to finally tame the Project Hydra.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward">The Path Forward</h2>
<p>The path ahead will be challenging. I know that changing ingrained habits and thought patterns will take time and consistent effort. There will likely be setbacks along the way – moments when the allure of a new project tempts me away from finishing the current one, or when the fear of imperfection makes me hesitate to declare something “done”. But I’m committed to pushing through these obstacles and building my “finishing muscle”.</p>
<p>This journey isn’t just about completing code; it’s about growing as a developer and creator. Each finished project, no matter how small, is a step towards becoming someone who not only starts with enthusiasm but finishes with satisfaction.</p>
<p>The Project Hydra has loomed over my work for too long. Armed with new strategies and determination, I’m ready to face this beast head-on. It’s time to stop planning and start doing.</p>
<p>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a project to finish – and this time, I intend to see it through.<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-final-note" id="user-content-fnref-final-note" data-footnote-ref="" aria-describedby="footnote-label">4</a></sup></p>

    </div><p>An Aston University researcher has used light to develop the first step towards a quicker, cheaper and less painful technique to detect cancer.</p>

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    <p>Professor Igor Meglinski from the University's Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies led the team that has developed a new method of analyzing the crystals in dehydrated blood. Their paper "Insights into polycrystalline microstructure of blood films with 3D Mueller matrix imaging approach" has been <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63816-z" target="_blank">published</a> in the journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</p>
<p>Professor Meglinski used a new polarization-based image reconstruction technique to analyze polycrystalline structures in dried blood samples. The proteins in blood change their shape and how they fit together during the early stages of diseases like cancer. Professor Meglinski and his team used changes in the proteins' tertiary structure or unique 3D shape together with its quaternary structure—which is how multiple proteins join together—to detect and classify cells.</p>
<p>This technique enabled the researchers to conduct a detailed layer-by-layer analysis of dry blood smears, which is crucial for identifying significant differences between healthy and cancerous samples.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed 108 blood film samples from three equal size groups: healthy volunteers, those who had <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prostate+cancer/" rel="tag">prostate cancer</a> and a third group who had the illness and had cells that were more likely to aggressively spread.</p>
<p>Professor Meglinski said, "Our study introduces a pioneering technique to the liquid biopsy domain, aligning with the ongoing quest for non-invasive, reliable and efficient diagnostic methods. A key advancement in our study is the characterization of the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of distributions with the cells which is crucial for identifying significant differences between healthy and cancerous samples.</p>

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>"This breakthrough opens new avenues for cancer diagnosis and monitoring, representing a substantial leap forward in personalized medicine and oncology."</p>
<p>The study's findings had a 90% accuracy rate of both <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/early+diagnosis/" rel="tag">early diagnosis</a> and classification of cancer which is much higher than existing screening methods. Also, as the technique relies on <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag">blood samples</a> instead of tissue biopsies, it is less traumatic and risky for patients.</p>
<p>Professor Meglinski added, "This high level of precision, combined with the non-invasive nature of the technique, marks a significant advancement in liquid biopsy technology. It holds immense potential for revolutionizing <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cancer+diagnosis/" rel="tag">cancer diagnosis</a>, early detection, patient stratification and monitoring, thereby greatly enhancing <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patient+care/" rel="tag">patient care</a> and treatment outcomes.</p>
<p>"This study also presents a testament to the resilience and support of our Ukrainian colleagues involved in the research, especially in light of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."</p>

<!-- <p>28 Aug 2024 - </p> -->

<p>tl;dr; show me the <a href="#conclusions-and-demo">demo and source code!</a></p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/app.png" alt="app"></p>

<p>I’m pretty excited about the new <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs">structured outputs</a>
feature in OpenAI’s API so I took it for a spin and developed an AI-assisted web scraper. This post summarizes my learnings.</p>

<h2 id="asking-gpt-4o-to-scrape-data">Asking GPT-4o to scrape data</h2>

<p>The first experiment was to straight ask GPT-4o to extract the data from an HTML
string, so I used the new structured outputs feature with the following <a href="https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/">Pydantic</a> models:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>List</span><span>,</span> <span>Dict</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ParsedColumn</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>values</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>]</span>


<span>class</span> <span>ParsedTable</span><span>(</span><span>BaseModel</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>columns</span><span>:</span> <span>List</span><span>[</span><span>ParsedColumn</span><span>]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The system prompt is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re an expert web scraper. You’re given the HTML contents of a table and you have to extract structured data from it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some interesting things I found when parsing different tables.</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> I also tried GPT-4o mini but yielded significantly worse results so I just continued my experiments with GPT-4o.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-complex-tables">Parsing complex tables</h2>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>After experimenting with some simple tables, I wanted to see how the model would do with a more complex ones, so I passed a 10-day <a href="https://weather.com/">weather</a> forecast from Weather.com. The table
contains a big row for at the top and smaller rows for the other 9
days. Interestingly, GPT-4o was able to parse this correctly:</p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-1.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>For the 9 remaining days, the table shows a day and a night forecast (see screenshot above). The model correctly parsed such data and added a <code>Day/Night</code> column. Here’s how it looks like in the browser (note that to display this, we need to click on the button to the right of each row):</p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-2.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>At first, I thought that the parsed <code>Condition</code> column was a hallucination since I did not see that in the website, however, upon inspecting the source code, I realized that those tags exist but are invisible in the table.</p>

<h2 id="combined-rows-break-the-model">Combined rows break the model</h2>

<p>When thinking where to find <em>easy tables</em>, my first thought was <em>Wikipedia</em>. Turns out, a <em>simple</em> table from Wikipedia (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index">Human development index</a>) breaks the model because rows with repeated values are merged:</p>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-3.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>And while the model is able to retrieve individual columns (as instructed by the system prompt), they don’t have the same size, hence, I’m unable to represent the data as a table.</p>

<p>I tried modifying the system prompt with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tables might collapse rows into a single row. If that’s the case, extract the collapsed row as multiple JSON values to ensure all columns contain the same number of rows.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it didn’t work. I have yet to try modifying the system prompt
to tell the model to extract rows instead of columns.</p>

<h2 id="asking-gpt-4o-to-return-xpaths">Asking GPT-4o to return XPaths</h2>

<p>Running an OpenAI API call every time can become very expensive, so I figured I’d ask the model to return <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XPath">XPaths</a> instead of
the parsed data. This would allow me to scrape the same page (e.g., to fetch updated data) without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>After some tweaks, I came up with this prompt:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re an expert web scraper.</p>

  <p>The user will provide the HTML content and the column name.
Your job is to come up with an XPath that will return all elements of that column.</p>

  <p>The XPath should be a string that can be evaluated by Selenium’s
<code>driver.find_elements(By.XPATH, xpath)</code> method.</p>

  <p>Return the full matching element, not just the text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, this didn’t work well. Sometimes, the model would return invalid XPaths (although
this was alleviated with the sentence that mentions Selenium) or XPaths that would
return incorrect data or no data at all.</p>

<h2 id="combining-the-two-approaches">Combining the two approaches</h2>

<p>My next attempt was to combine both approaches: once the model extracted the data,
we could use it as a reference to ask the model for the XPath. <em>This worked much better than straight asking for XPaths!</em></p>

<p>I noticed that sometimes the generated XPath would return no data at all so I added
some dumb retry logic: if the XPath returns no results, try again. This did the trick for
the tables I tested.</p>

<p>However, I noticed a new issue: sometimes the first step (extract data) converted images into text (e.g. an arrow pointing upwards might appear in the
extracted data as “arrow-upwards”), this caused the second step to fail since it’d look for data that wasn’t there. I did not attempt to fix this problem.</p>

<h2 id="gpt-4o-is-very-expensive">GPT-4o is very expensive</h2>

<p><img src="https://blancas.io/assets/images/ai-web-scraper/image-4.png" alt="alt text"></p>

<p>Scraping with GPT-4o can become very expensive since even small HTML tables can contain lots of characters. I’ve been experimenting for two days and I’ve already spent $24!</p>

<p>To reduce the cost, I added some clean up logic to remove unnecessary data from the HTML string before passing it to the model. A simple function that removes all properties except <code>class</code>, <code>id</code>, and <code>data-testid</code> (which are the ones I noticed the generated XPaths were using) trimmed the number of characters in the table by half.</p>

<p>I didn’t see any performance degradations and my suspicion is that the results would actually improve extraction quality.</p>

<p>Currently, the second step (generate XPaths) makes one model call per column in
the table, another improvement could be to generate more than one XPath, I have yet
to try this approach and evaluate performance.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions-and-demo">Conclusions and demo</h2>

<p>I was surprised by the extraction quality of GPT-4o (but then sadly surprised when I looked at how much I’d have to pay OpenAI!). Nonetheless, this was a fun experiment and I definitely see potential for AI-assisted web scraping tools.</p>

<p>I did a quick demo using Streamlit, you can check it out here: <a href="https://orange-resonance-9766.ploomberapp.io/">https://orange-resonance-9766.ploomberapp.io</a>, the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/edublancas/posts/tree/main/ai-web-scraping">GitHub</a> (Spoiler: don’t expect anything polished).</p>

<p>Some stuff I’d like to try if I had more time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Capture browser events: the current demo is a one-off process: users enter the URL and an initial XPath. This isn’t great UX as it’d be better to ask the user to click on the table they want to extract, and to provide some sample rows so the model can understand the structure a bit better.</li>
  <li>In complex tables, a single XPath might not be enough to extract a full column, I’d like to see if asking the LLM to return a program (e.g. Python) would work.</li>
  <li>More experimenting with the HTML clean up is needed. It’s very expensive to use GPT-4o and I feel like I’m passing a lot of unnecessary data to the model</li>
</ol>

<p dir="auto">Afrim is an input method for African languages. It is designed to protect the native language of various local dialects of Africa and is a universal phonetic-based input method platform.</p>
<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">History</h2><a id="user-content-history" aria-label="Permalink: History" href="#history"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">AFRIM is the abbreviation of <em>AFRICA IME</em> or <em>Africa Input Method Engine</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">From the beginning, AFRIM was written as a remake of <a href="https://github.com/H-Theking/clafrica">Clafrica IME</a>, and named <em>clafrica</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Then, we created an input method library with some improvements inspired from <a href="https://github.com/rime">RIME</a>. We renamed it to <em>Afrim Input Method Engine</em>.</p>
<p dir="auto">Later, it supports Amharic and Geez and other african phonetic input method, and we want support all african phonetic Input Method.</p>
<p dir="auto">Inspired from <a href="https://github.com/rime/librime">librime</a>, we want AFRIM aka <em>Afrim Input Method Engine</em> to be the top IME for african languages.</p>

              <p>I’ve been thinking about the lessons distributed systems engineers learn on
the job. A great deal of our instruction is through scars made by mistakes
made in production traffic. These scars are useful reminders, sure, but it’d
be better to have more engineers with the full count of their fingers.</p>
<p>New systems engineers will find the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing">Fallacies of Distributed
Computing</a> and the <a href="http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/">CAP theorem</a> as part of their
self-education. But these are abstract pieces without the direct, actionable
advice the inexperienced engineer needs to start moving<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It’s surprising
how little context new engineers are given when they start out.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some lessons I’ve learned as a distributed systems engineer
that are worth being told to a new engineer. Some are subtle, and some are
surprising, but none are controversial. This list is for the new distributed
systems engineer to guide their thinking about the field they are taking
on. It’s not comprehensive, but it’s a good beginning.</p>
<p>The worst characteristic of this list is that it focuses on technical problems
with little discussion of social problems an engineer may run into. Since
distributed systems require more machines and more capital, their engineers
tend to work with more teams and larger organizations. The social stuff is
usually the hardest part of any software developer’s job, and, perhaps,
especially so with distributed systems development.</p>
<p>Our background, education, and experience bias us towards a technical solution
even when a social solution would be more efficient, and more pleasing. Let’s
try to correct for that. People are less finicky than computers, even if their
interface is a little less standardized.</p>
<p>Alright, here we go.</p>
<p><a name="fail" href="#fail">#</a> <strong>Distributed systems are different because they fail often.</strong> When asked what
separates distributed systems from other fields of software engineering, the
new engineer often cites latency, believing that’s what makes distributed
computation hard.</p>
<p>But they’re wrong. What sets distributed systems engineering apart is the
probability of failure and, worse, the probability of partial failure. If a
well-formed mutex unlock fails with an error, we can assume the process is
unstable and crash it. But the failure of a distributed mutex’s unlock must be
built into the lock protocol.</p>
<p>Systems engineers that haven’t worked in distributed computation will come up
with ideas like “well, it’ll just send the write to both machines” or “it’ll
just keep retrying the write until it succeeds”. These engineers haven’t
completely accepted (though they usually intellectually recognize) that
networked systems fail more than systems that exist on only a single machine
and that failures tend to be partial instead of total. One of the writes may
succeed while the other fails, and so now how do we get a consistent view of
the data? These partial failures are much harder to reason about.</p>
<p>Switches go down, garbage collection pauses make leaders “disappear”,
socket writes seem to succeed but have actually failed on the other machine, a
slow disk drive on one machine causes a communication protocol in the whole
cluster to crawl, and so on. Reading from local memory is simply more stable
than reading across a few switches.</p>
<p>Design for failure. <a href="#fail">#</a></p>
<p><a name="robustdist" href="#robustdist">#</a> <strong>Writing robust distributed systems costs more than writing robust
single-machine systems.</strong> Creating a robust distributed solution requires more
money than a single-machine solution because there are failures that only
occur with many machines. Virtual machine and cloud technology make
distributed systems engineering cheaper but not as cheap as being able to
design, implement, and test on a computer you already own. And there are
failure conditions that are difficult to replicate on a single
machine. Whether it’s because they only occur on dataset sizes much larger
than can be fit on a shared machine, or in the network conditions found in
datacenters, distributed systems tend to need actual, not simulated,
distribution to flush out their bugs. Simulation is, of course, very useful. <a href="#robustdist">#</a></p>
<p><a name="robustoss" href="#robustoss">#</a> <strong>Robust, open source distributed systems are much less common than robust,
single-machine systems.</strong> The cost of running many machines for long periods
of time is a burden on open source communities. Hobbyists and dilettantes are
the engines of open source software and they do not have the financial
resources available to explore or fix many of the problems a distributed
system will have. Hobbyists write open source code for fun in their free time
and with machines they already own. It’s much harder to find open source
developers who are willing to spin up, maintain, and pay for a bunch of
machines.</p>
<p>Some of this slack has been taken up by engineers working for corporate
entities. However, the priorities of their organization may not be in line
with the priorities of your organization.</p>
<p>While some in the open source community are aware of this problem, it’s not
yet solved. This is hard. <a href="#robustoss">#</a></p>
<p><a name="coord" href="#coord">#</a> <strong>Coordination is very hard.</strong> Avoid coordinating machines wherever
possible. This is often described as “horizontal scalability”. The real trick
of horizontal scalability is independence – being able to get data to
machines such that communication and consensus between those machines is kept
to a minimum. Every time two machines have to agree on something, the service
becomes harder to implement. Information has an upper limit to the speed it can
travel, and networked communication is flakier than you think, and your idea
of what constitutes consensus is probably wrong. Learning about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem">Two
Generals</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Generals%27_Problem">Byzantine Generals</a> problems is useful
here. (Oh, and Paxos really is <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub33002.html">very hard to implement</a>; that’s not
grumpy old engineers thinking they know better than you.) <a href="#coord">#</a></p>
<p><a name="memory" href="#memory">#</a> <strong>If you can fit your problem in memory, it’s probably trivial.</strong> To a
distributed systems engineer, problems that are local to one machine are
easy. Figuring out how to process data quickly is harder when the data is a
few switches away instead of a few pointer dereferences away. In a distributed
system, the well-worn efficiency tricks documented since the beginning of
computer science no longer apply. Plenty of literature and implementations are
available for algorithms that run on a single machine because the majority of
computation has been done on singular, uncoordinated machines. Significantly
fewer exist for distributed systems. <a href="#memory">#</a></p>
<p><a name="slow" href="#slow">#</a> <strong>“It’s slow” is the hardest problem you’ll ever debug.</strong> “It’s slow” might
mean one or more of the number of systems involved in performing a user
request is slow. It might mean one or more of the parts of a pipeline of
transformations across many machines is slow. “It’s slow” is hard, in part,
because the problem statement doesn’t provide many clues to the location of the
flaw. Partial failures, ones that don’t show up on the graphs you usually look
up, are lurking in a dark corner. And, until the degradation becomes very
obvious, you won’t receive as many resources (time, money, and tooling) to
solve it. <a href="http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html">Dapper</a> and <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/06/distributed-systems-tracing-with-zipkin.html">Zipkin</a> were built for a reason. <a href="#slow">#</a></p>
<p><a name="backpressure" href="#backpressure">#</a> <strong>Implement backpressure throughout your system.</strong> Backpressure is the
signaling of failure from a serving system to the requesting system and how
the requesting system handles those failures to prevent overloading itself and
the serving system. Designing for backpressure means bounding resource
use during times of overload and times of system failure. This is one
of the basic building blocks of creating a robust distributed system.</p>
<p>Implementations of backpressure usually involve either dropping new
messages on the floor, or shipping errors back to users (and incrementing
a metric in both cases) when a resource becomes limited or failures
occur. Timeouts and exponential back-offs on connections and requests to other
systems are also essential.</p>
<p>Without backpressure mechanisms in place, cascading failure or unintentional
message loss become likely. When a system is not able to handle the failures
of another, it tends to emit failures to another system that depends on it. <a href="#backpressure">#</a></p>
<p><a name="partial" href="#partial">#</a> <strong>Find ways to be partially available.</strong> Partial availability is being able to
return some results even when parts of your system is failing.</p>
<p>Search is an ideal case to explore here. Search systems trade-off between how
good their results are and how long they will keep a user waiting. A typical
search system sets a time limit on how long it will search its documents, and,
if that time limit expires before all of its documents are searched, it will
return whatever results it has gathered. This makes search easier to scale in
the face of intermittent slowdowns, and errors because those failures are
treated the same as not being able to search all of their documents. The
system allows for partial results to be returned to the user and its
resilience is increased.</p>
<p>And consider a private messaging feature in a web application. At some point, no
matter what you do, enough storage machines for private messaging will be down
at the same time that your users will notice. So what kind of partial failure do
we want in this system?</p>
<p>This takes some thought. People are generally more okay with private messaging
being down for them (and maybe some other users) than they are with all users
having some of their messages go missing. If the service is overloaded or one of
its machines are down, failing out just a small fraction of the userbase is
preferable to missing data for a larger fraction. And, on top of that choice, we
probably don’t want an unrelated feature, like public image upload, to be
affected just because private messaging is having a problem. How much work are
we willing to do to keep those failure domains separate?</p>
<p>Being able to recognize these kinds of trade-offs in partial availability is
good to have in your toolbox. <a href="#partial">#</a></p>
<p><a name="metrics" href="#metrics">#</a> <strong>Metrics are the only way to get your job done.</strong> Exposing metrics (such as
latency percentiles, increasing counters on certain actions, rates of change)
is the only way to cross the gap from what you believe your system does in
production and what it actually is doing. Knowing how the system’s behavior on
day 20 is different from its behavior on day 15 is the difference between
successful engineering and failed shamanism. Of course, metrics are necessary
to understand problems and behavior, but they are not sufficient to know what
to do next.</p>
<p>A diversion into logging. Log files are good to have, but they tend to
lie. For example, it’s very common for the logging of a few error classes to
take up a large proportion of a space in a log file but, in actuality, occur
in a very low proportion of requests. Because logging successes is redundant
in most cases (and would blow out the disk in most cases) and because
engineers often guess wrong on which kinds of error classes are useful to see,
log files get filled up with all sorts of odd bits and bobs. Prefer logging as
if someone who has not seen the code will be reading the logs.</p>
<p>I’ve seen a good number of outages extended by another engineer (or myself)
over-emphasizing something odd we saw in the log without first checking it
against the metrics. I’ve also seen another engineer (or myself)
Sherlock-Holmes’ing an entire set of failed behaviors from a handful of log
lines. But note: a) we remember those successes because they are so very rare
and b) you’re not Sherlock unless the metrics or the experiments back up the
story. <a href="#metrics">#</a></p>
<p><a name="percentiles" href="#percentiles">#</a> <strong>Use percentiles, not averages.</strong> Percentiles (50th, 99th, 99.9th, 99.99th)
are more accurate and informative than averages in the vast majority of
distributed systems. Using a mean assumes that the metric under evaluation
follows a bell curve but, in practice, this describes very few metrics an
engineer cares about. “Average latency” is a commonly reported metric, but
I’ve never once seen a distributed system whose latency followed a bell
curve. If the metric doesn’t follow a bell curve, the average is meaningless
and leads to incorrect decisions and understanding. Avoid the trap by talking
in percentiles. Default to percentiles, and you’ll better understand how users
really see your system. <a href="#percentiles">#</a></p>
<p><a name="capacity" href="#capacity">#</a> <strong>Learn to estimate your capacity.</strong> You’ll learn how many seconds are in a
day because of this. Knowing how many machines you need to perform a task is
the difference between a long-lasting system, and one that needs to be
replaced 3 months into its job. Or, worse, needs to be replaced before you
finish productionizing it.</p>
<p>Consider tweets. How many tweet ids can you fit in memory on a common machine?
Well, a typical machine at the end of 2012 has 24 GB of memory, you’ll need an
overhead of 4-5 GB for the OS, another couple, at least, to handle requests,
and a tweet id is 8 bytes. This is the kind of back of the envelope
calculation you’ll find yourself doing. Jeff Dean’s <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/talks/dean-keynote-ladis2009.pdf">Numbers Everyone Should
Know</a> slide is a good expectation-setter. <a href="#capacity">#</a></p>
<p><a name="flags" href="#flags">#</a> <strong>Feature flags are how infrastructure is rolled out.</strong> “Feature flags” are a
common way product engineers roll out new features in a system. Feature flags
are typically associated with frontend A/B testing where they are used to show
a new design or feature to only some of the userbase. But they are a powerful
way of replacing infrastructure as well.</p>
<p>Too many projects have failed because they went for the “big cutover” or a
series of “big cutovers” that were then forced into rollbacks by bugs found too
late. By using feature flags instead, you’ll gain confidence in your project and
mitigate the costs of failure.</p>
<p>Suppose you’re going from a single database to a service that hides the details
of a new storage solution. Using a feature flag, you can slowly ramp up writes
to the new service in parallel to the writes to the old database to make sure
its write path is correct and fast enough. After the write path is at 100% and
backfilling into the service’s datastore is complete, you can use a separate
feature flag to start reading from the service, without using the data in user
responses, to check for performance problems. Another feature flag can be used
to perform comparison checks on read of the data from the old system and the new
one. And one final flag can be used to slowly ramp up the “real” reads from the
new system.</p>
<p>By breaking up the deployment into multiple steps and affording yourself quick
and partial reactions with feature flags, you make it easier to find bugs and
performance problems as they occur during ramp up instead of at a “big bang”
release time. If an issue occurs, you can just tamp the feature flag setting
back down to a lower (perhaps, zero) setting immediately. Adjusting the rates
lets you debug and experiment at different amounts of traffic knowing that any
problem you hit isn’t a total disaster. With feature flags, you can also choose
other migration strategies, like moving requests over on a per-user basis, that
provide better insight into the new system. And when your new service is still
being prototyped, you can use flags at a low setting to have your new system
consume fewer resources.</p>
<p>Now, feature flags sound like a terrible mess of conditionals to a classically
trained developer or a new engineer with well-intentioned training. And the use
of feature flags means accepting that having multiple versions of infrastructure
and data is a norm, not an rarity. This is a deep lesson. What works well for
single-machine systems sometimes falters in the face of distributed problems.</p>
<p>Feature flags are best understood as a trade-off, trading local complexity (in
the code, in one system) for global simplicity and resilience. <a href="#flags">#</a></p>
<p><a name="idspace" href="#idspace">#</a> <strong>Choose id spaces wisely.</strong> The space of ids you choose for your system will
shape your system.</p>
<p>The more ids required to get to a piece of data, the more options you have in
partitioning the data. The fewer ids required to get a piece of data, the
easier it is to consume your system’s output.</p>
<p>Consider version 1 of the Twitter API. All operations to get, create, and
delete tweets were done with respect to a single numeric id for each
tweet. The tweet id is a simple 64-bit number that is not connected to any
other piece of data. As the number of tweets goes up, it becomes clear that
creating user tweet timelines and the timeline of other user’s subscriptions
may be efficiently constructed if all of the tweets by the same user were
stored on the same machine.</p>
<p>But the public API requires every tweet be addressable by just the tweet
id. To partition tweets by user, a lookup service would have to be
constructed. One that knows what user owns which tweet id. Doable, if
necessary, but with a non-trivial cost.</p>
<p>An alternative API could have required the user id in any tweet look up and,
initially, simply used the tweet id for storage until user-partitioned storage
came online. Another alternative would have included the user id in the tweet
id itself at the cost of tweet ids no longer being k-sortable and numeric.</p>
<p>Watch out for what kind of information you encode in your ids, explicitly and
implicitly. Clients may use the structure of your ids to de-anonymize private
data, crawl your system in unexpected ways (auto-incrementing ids are a
typical sore point), or perform a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A4-Insecure_Direct_Object_References">host of other attacks</a>. <a href="#idspace">#</a></p>
<p><a name="dataloc" href="#dataloc">#</a> <strong>Exploit data-locality.</strong> The closer the processing and caching of your data
is kept to its persistent storage, the more efficient your processing, and the
easier it will be to keep your caching consistent and fast. Networks have more
failures and more latency than pointer dereferences and <code>fread(3)</code>.</p>
<p>Of course, data-locality means being nearby in space, but it also means nearby
in time.  If multiple users are making the same expensive request at nearly the
same time, perhaps their requests can be joined into one. If multiple instances
of requests for the same kind of data are made near to one another, they could
be joined into one larger request. Doing so often affords lower communication
overheard and easier fault management. <a href="#dataloc">#</a></p>
<p><a name="cached" href="#cached">#</a> <strong>Writing cached data back to persistent storage is bad.</strong> This happens in
more systems than you’d think. Especially ones originally designed by people
less experienced in distributed systems. Many systems you’ll inherit will have
this flaw. If the implementers talk about “Russian-doll caching”, you have a
large chance of hitting highly visible bugs. This entry could have been left
out of the list, but I have a special hate in my heart for it. A common
presentation of this flaw is user information (e.g. screennames, emails, and
hashed passwords) mysteriously reverting to a previous value. <a href="#cached">#</a></p>
<p><a name="domore" href="#domore">#</a> <strong>Computers can do more than you think they can.</strong> In the field today, there’s
plenty of misinformation about what a machine is capable of from practitioners
that do not have a great deal of experience.</p>
<p>At the end of 2012, a light web server had 6 or more processors, 24 GB of
memory and more disk space than you can use. A relatively complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a>
application in a modern language runtime on a single machine is trivially
capable of doing thousands of requests per second within a few hundred
milliseconds. And that’s a deep lower bound. In terms of operational ability,
hundreds of requests per second per machine is not something to brag about in
most cases.</p>
<p>Greater performance is not hard to come by, especially if you are willing to
profile your application and introduce efficiencies based on your
measurements. <a href="#domore">#</a></p>
<p><a name="cap" href="#cap">#</a> <strong>Use the CAP theorem to critique systems.</strong> The CAP theorem isn’t something
you can build a system out of. It’s not a theorem you can take as a first
principle and derive a working system from. It’s much too general in its
purview, and the space of possible solutions too broad.</p>
<p>However, it is well-suited for critiquing a distributed system design, and
understanding what trade-offs need to be made. Taking a system design and
iterating through the constraints CAP puts on its subsystems will leave you
with a better design at the end. For homework, apply the CAP theorem’s
constraints to a real world implementation of Russian-doll caching.</p>
<p>One last note: Out of C, A, and P, you <a href="http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/">can’t choose CA</a>. <a href="#cap">#</a></p>
<p><a name="services" href="#services">#</a> <strong>Extract services.</strong> “Service” here means “a distributed system that
incorporates higher-level logic than a storage system and typically has a
request-response style API”. Be on the lookout for code changes that would be
easier to do if the code existed in a separate service instead of in your
system.</p>
<p>An extracted service provides the benefits of encapsulation typically
associated with creating libraries. However, extracting out a service improves
on creating libraries by allowing for changes to be deployed faster and easier
than upgrading the libraries in its client systems. (Of course, if the
extracted service is hard to deploy, the client systems are the ones that
become easier to deploy.) This ease is owed to the fewer code and operational
dependencies in the smaller, extracted service and the strict boundary it
creates makes it harder to “take shortcuts” that a library allows for. These
shortcuts almost always make it harder to migrate the internals or the client
systems to new versions.</p>
<p>The coordination costs of using a service is also much lower than a shared
library when there are multiple client systems. Upgrading a library, even with
no API changes needed, requires coordinating deploys of each client
system. This gets harder when data corruption is possible if the deploys are
performed out of order (and it’s harder to predict that it will
happen). Upgrading a library also has a higher social coordination cost than
deploying a service if the client systems have different maintainers. Getting
others aware of and willing to upgrade is surprisingly difficult because their
priorities may not align with yours.</p>
<p>The canonical service use case is to hide a storage layer that will be
undergoing changes. The extracted service has an API that is more convenient,
and reduced in surface area compared to the storage layer it fronts. By
extracting a service, the client systems don’t have to know about the
complexities of the slow migration to a new storage system or format and only
the new service has to be evaluated for bugs that will certainly be found with
the new storage layout.</p>
<p>There are a great deal of operational and social issues to consider when doing
this. I cannot do them justice here. Another article will have to be written. <a href="#services">#</a></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												<p>Three men in the United Kingdom have pleaded guilty to operating <strong>otp[.]agency</strong>, a once popular online service that helped attackers intercept the one-time passcodes (OTPs) that many websites require as a second authentication factor in addition to passwords.</p>
<p>Launched in November 2019, OTP Agency was a service for intercepting one-time passcodes needed to log in to various websites. Scammers who had already stolen someone’s bank account credentials could enter the target’s phone number and name, and the service would initiate an automated phone call to the target that warned them about unauthorized activity on their account.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/45GsKWyF63U?si=WcCChUe4gFLTpnxO" width="750" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The call would prompt the target to enter a one-time passcode that was sent to the user via SMS when the thieves attempted to log in. Any codes shared by the target were then relayed to the scammer’s user panel at the OTP Agency website.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/website-operators-promised-fraudsters-profit-within-minutes-if-they-subscribed-to-illegal-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement</a> published Aug. 30 by the U.K.’s <strong>National Crime Agency</strong> (NCA) said three men pleaded guilty to running OTP Agency: <strong>Callum Picari</strong>, 22, from Hornchurch, Essex; <strong>Vijayasidhurshan Vijayanathan</strong>, 21, from Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire; and <strong>Aza Siddeeque</strong>, 19, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.</p>
<p>KrebsOnSecurity profiled OTP Agency in <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/u-k-arrest-in-sms-bandits-phishing-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a February 2021 story</a> about arrests tied to another phishing-related service based in the U.K. Someone claiming to represent OTP Agency then posted several comments on the piece, wherein <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otp-support.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they claimed</a> the story was libelous and that they were a legitimate anti-fraud service. However, the service’s Telegram channel clearly showed its proprietors had built OTP Agency with one purpose in mind: To help their customers take over online accounts.</p>
<p>Within hours of that publication, OTP Agency shuttered its website and announced it was closing up shop and purging its user database. The NCA said the February 2021 story prompted a panicked message exchange between Picari and Vijayanathan:</p>
<blockquote><p>Picari said: bro we are in big trouble… U will get me bagged… Bro delete the chat</p>
<p>Vijayanathan: Are you sure</p>
<p>Picari: So much evidence in there</p>
<p>Vijayanathan: Are you 100% sure</p>
<p>Picari: It’s so incriminating…Take a look and search ‘fraud’…Just think of all the evidence…that we cba to find…in the OTP chat…they will find</p>
<p>Vijayanathan: Exactly so if we just shut EVERYTHING down</p>
<p>Picari: They went to our first ever msg…We look incriminating…if we shut down…I say delete the chat…Our chat is Fraud 100%</p>
<p>Vijayanathan : Everyone with a brain will tell you stop it here and move on</p>
<p>Picari: Just because we close it doesn’t mean we didn’t do it…But deleting our chat…Will f*^k their investigations…There’s nothing fraudulent on the site</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite deleting its Telegram channel, OTP Agency evidently found it difficult to walk away from its customers (and/or the money). Instead of shutting down as Vijayanathan wisely advised, just a few days later OTP Agency was communicating with customers <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/otp-support.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a new Telegram channel</a>, offering a new login page and assuring existing customers that their usernames, passwords and balances would remain the same.</p>

<p>OTP Agency might be gone, but several other similar OTP interception services are still in operation and accepting new customers, including a long-running service <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/the-rise-of-one-time-password-interception-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KrebsOnSecurity profiled in September 2021</a> called <strong>SMSRanger</strong>. More on SMSRanger in an upcoming post.</p>
<p>Text messages, emails and phone calls warning recipients about potential fraud are some of the most common scam lures. If someone (or something) calls saying they’re from your bank, or asks you to provide any personal or financial information, <em>do not respond</em>.&nbsp; Just hang up, full stop.</p>
<p>If the call has you worried about the security and integrity of your account, check the account status online, or call your financial institution — ideally using a phone number that came from the bank’s Web site or from the back of your payment card.</p>

MobileOps is a bootstrapped and profitable software company that sells SaaS ("MobileOps") to companies that own fleets of workboats or heavy construction assets. We have a vertically integrated app that serves as a one-stop shop for companies when it comes to asset maintenance, safety/compliance, crewing, dispatching, logistics, inventory, and much more.</p><p>We've just begun to release new sets of features that focus on logistics for workboat companies that tow barges in the inland rivers of the USA (imagine 100k+ barges being pushed by towboats in rivers that carve through the American heartland, and all the major complexities that comes with tracking barges w/ cargo, optimizing schedules and tows, and generating invoices based off many movements and types of events).</p><p>In addition, we've started to attract attention outside the maritime world, and we're excited about new opportunities to bring MobileOps to similar industries.</p><p>[ Role ] 
We're looking for a highly motivated individual with 5+ years of professional software engineering experience—one who takes ownership of projects, has an eye for great UI/UX, and gets quality work completed on time (understanding, at a deep level, perfection v.s. shipping). The role will require collaboration with colleagues and customers to ensure we're building the right features and providing value. If you're an individual that doesn't want to be siloed and desires to engage with customers on Zoom calls (and even occasional onsite visits with other team members) this might be a good role for you.</p><p>MobileOps is a remote-first company with team members currently located in Washington and California. Work hours are in the Pacific time zone. Full time = 40 hours a week. We offer benefits (health, vision, dental) and 401(k) matching.</p><p>[ Stack ]
MobileOps' BE is Ruby on Rails and the FE is almost 100% React components. While the frameworks are fairly standard, the problems we need to solve are quite out of the ordinary due to the nature of industry we serve, and there's a lot of challenging and unique problems to be solved outside of basic CRUD interfaces.</p><p>If you’re interested you can email: jobs@ company domain. Please paste your CV (no attachments) and provide some information about yourself and work experience. Feel free to ask questions as well.</p></div></td></tr>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

  <p>Humans and other animals encounter and remember countless experiences each day; when we sleep, groups of cells in the brain known as neuronal ensembles replay these experiences to consolidate them into memories and “preplay” futures ones, which enables faster encoding of new experiences into memories later on.</p>
<p>Better understanding how these neuronal ensembles represent, or depict, these experiences would offer important insights into how memory and the mind function. But most studies to date have focused solely on animals undergoing just one or a small handful of sequential experiences — and it remains unclear how exactly the brain is able to process numerous experiences simultaneously during sleep.</p>
<p>In a new study, Yale scientists revealed a generative coding capacity in the brain’s hippocampus — an area responsible for memory and learning — which enables the brain to bundle together the representations of some 15 unrelated experiences that occurred across one full day within single sub-second events, known as frames, during sleep.</p>
<p>This computer-like capacity for parallel processing of different chains of information helps explain why humans and other animals are able to process a cascade of experiences and either keep separate or combine their meanings.</p>
<p>The findings were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01703-6">published in the journal Nature Neuroscience</a>.</p>
<p><span>“</span>The brain mechanisms we uncovered are relevant for how we form and express internally generated representations about the world, like memories, imagining, and insight,” said <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/george-dragoi/">George Dragoi</a>, an associate professor of psychiatry and of neuroscience at Yale School of Medicine and corresponding author of the study.</p>
<p>An increasing amount of neuroscience research is exploring how neuronal ensembles represent experiences in the brain, a complex process that has implications for learning and memory, cognitive mapping, and spatial navigation. The fact that most studies involve animals undergoing a single experience, however, has prevented researchers from assembling a more complete picture.</p>
<p><span>“</span>In real life we are continuously experiencing new contexts and events that all need to be encoded distinctly and remembered later without a major interference between them,” Dragoi said. “The way the brain solves this problem is not known and experiments attempting to address this topic are essentially missing.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Computational models have proposed that exposure to multiple experiences would lead to a ‘catastrophic interference’ between the brain representations of new and older experiences, causing the individual to forget the latter,” Dragoi said. “That, of course, is not how daily life works.”</p>
<p>For the new study, the researchers recorded the activity of hippocampal neurons in rats that were allowed to move freely through 15 different spatial contexts over 19 ½ hours, a time span that included periods of extended sleep, during a single day. (The periods of sleep were used to investigate “offline” activity in the animals’ brains, in terms of preplay and replay of experiences.)</p>
<p>Using innovative data analysis, they identified several coding schemes in the hippocampus that boost its network capacity and efficiency during sleep and allow the brain to process representations of several experiences without interference.</p>
<p>Specifically, they found that the brain is able to “flicker” between time-compressed representations from two or more distinct experiences within the same sleep preplay and replay events, a feature that greatly increases network capacity for parallel information processing without interference during sleep. In addition, independent experiences can be bound together into longer preplay/replay episodes representing sequential aspects of day-long experiences in the order in which they occurred compressed into replay episodes less than a second in duration.</p>
<p>The researchers also identified a kind of serial position effect in this process, whereby the first and most recent experiences had the strongest representations during the animals’ sleep, a phenomenon similar to the effect observed in human memory in which people tend to recall the first and last events in a series of events or items.</p>
<p>Other authors of the paper are Kefei Liu and Jeremie Sibille, a former associate research scientist and postdoctoral associate, respectively, in Dragoi’s lab at Yale School of Medicine.</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="client-content" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><figure></figure><p>I read “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Middlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot/dp/0141439548" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Middlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot/dp/0141439548&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Middlemarch-Penguin-Classics-George-Eliot/dp/0141439548" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Middlemarch</a>” for the first time during my sophomore year of college. I didn’t get it. Why would Dorothea, a young and intelligent woman, marry that annoying old man? How could she be so stupid? No one else in the class seemed to get it, either, and this pushed our professor over the edge. “Of course you don’t understand,” he roared, swilling a Diet Coke. “Trust me, you’ll read this book again when you’re forty, after your first divorce, and you’ll say, ‘Oh, I see!’ ”</p><p>Arguably, it’s one of the tragedies of humanities education that so much of it occurs between the ages of eighteen and twenty-two. We don’t teach people to drive at twelve, when they’re carless; why should we make them read novels about life’s regrets when they have none? Yet there’s a theory behind the assignment of “Middlemarch” to sophomores: it’s that knowledge acquired too early gets stored away. Patterns of thinking established now will be retraced later; ideas encountered first in art will prime us for the rest of life. This sounds chancy and vague, until you reflect on the fact that knowledge almost never arrives at the moment of its application. You take a class in law school today only to argue a complicated case years later; you learn C.P.R. years before saving a drowning man; you read online about how to deter a charging bear, because you never know. In the mid-twentieth century, Toyota pioneered a methodology called just-in-time manufacturing, according to which car parts were constructed and delivered as close as possible to the hour of assembly. This was maximally efficient because it reduced waste and the cost of storage. But the human mind doesn’t work that way. Knowledge must often molder in our mental warehouses for decades until we figure out what to do with it.</p><p>Leslie Valiant, an eminent computer scientist who teaches at Harvard, sees this as a strength. He calls our ability to learn over the long term “educability,” and in his new book, “<a data-offer-url="https://www.amazon.com/Importance-Being-Educable-Theory-Uniqueness/dp/0691230560" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Importance-Being-Educable-Theory-Uniqueness/dp/0691230560&quot;}" href="https://www.amazon.com/Importance-Being-Educable-Theory-Uniqueness/dp/0691230560" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Importance of Being Educable</a>,” he argues that it’s key to our success. When we think about what makes our minds special, we tend to focus on intelligence. But if we want to grasp reality in all its complexity, Valiant writes, then “cleverness is not enough.” We need to build capacious and flexible theories about the world—theories that will serve us in new, unanticipated, and strange circumstances—and we do that by gathering diverse kinds of knowledge, often in a slow, additive, serendipitous way, and knitting them together. Through this process, we acquire systems of beliefs that are broader and richer than the ones we can create through direct personal experience. This is how, after our first divorce, we find that we can draw on wisdom borrowed from English literature.</p><p>Valiant won the 2010 Turing Award, his discipline’s version of the Nobel Prize, for developing ideas that underpin artificial intelligence and distributed computation, in which many computers work together to solve problems. In his book, he contrasts A.I.’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/science/annals-of-artificial-intelligence/how-will-ai-learn-next">way of learning</a> with ours. An A.I. can be astonishingly smart, and even think intuitively, kind of like a person. But A.I. systems, Valiant argues, are not as flexible as human minds because they are not yet educable. Even the most state-of-the-art A.I.s learn through a rigid process, in which they are trained, at great expense, and don’t really get any smarter after that, no matter how much new information they ingest. It’s as though their minds freeze on graduation day. Yet human beings constantly improve their own minds through an unfolding, open-ended process that connects newly acquired facts and ideas to ones collected long ago. We “combine pieces of knowledge gained years apart” into “theories of considerable complexity that have many and disparate parts.”</p><p>Valiant says that he tries not to use the word “intelligent” to describe people (in fact, he is “sometimes taken aback” when he hears others use it); instead, he is drawn to “valuable abilities that somehow involve learning and are not well captured by conventional notions of IQ.” An educable mind, he writes, can learn from books, lectures, conversations, experiences, and Zen koans—from anything, really—and notice when relevant aspects of almost forgotten knowledge reveal themselves. We admire aspects of someone’s educability when we say that they are a quick study, or identify them as “coachable,” but what really makes them educable is that they apply insights “for purposes not foreseen at the time of the study or the coaching”; educability is something like “street smarts”—a term which connotes the “uncanny ability to negotiate the practicalities of life”—and is closely related to having common sense. When people strike us as particularly “well-educated,” this might mean that they’ve had lots of school, Valiant writes, but it could also mean that they’re exceptionally educable, with the ability to “take good advantage of whatever educational opportunities arise, whether formal or informal.”</p><p>We’d probably like it if our political leaders were more educable: they “often need to make judgments on matters well beyond the knowledge and experience they had when elected.” Valiant suggests that we value educability in doctors, too. Imagine that you feel a pain in your side. Is it appendicitis? It would be unwise, he writes, to rely on what you know about the disease, based on what a few people who’ve had it have told you; you’d want to talk to a physician who’s seen a thousand cases. A medical A.I. could also train by looking at thousands of cases; in fact, “if it has seen a million cases, a situation well beyond individual human experience, then it may make predictions that are stunningly better than our intuitions can even comprehend.” And yet “the reason we go to doctors is not just that they have seen a thousand cases of a disease,” Valiant argues. “It is that we believe doctors deliver further results.” The basis of that extra value is educability.</p><p>Valiant doesn’t get into details, but we can imagine for ourselves the value that a hypothetical doctor’s educability might provide. Such a doctor might draw on a range of ideas and connections spanning years of learning. She learned about appendicitis in medical school, of course—and quickly concludes that you don’t have it. But maybe her brother happens to be an avid cyclist, and she notices you drinking from a water bottle emblazoned with a logo she recognizes from his bike. Wasn’t there an article online about how dangerous the city’s bike lanes have become? More generally, she’s also developed a new theory: she ought to ask more questions about the particulars of her patients’ lives. She asks if you’re a cyclist, discovers that you are, and eventually pinpoints the real issue—a bruised rib acquired in a fall, which you’ve not allowed to heal properly. Being educable, the doctor actually regards your case as an opportunity to learn, and is a better physician for it.</p><p>That’s a rather schematic, explicit example of educability; sometimes, Valiant seems to be describing something more diffuse, and perhaps more powerful. To a degree, the connections, recombinations, and new applications of knowledge involved in being educable are useful precisely because they aren’t obvious. Every so often, I learn a lesson in one part of life that seems to apply to another: when I swim down the beach, for example, I tend to look at the umbrellas on the sand and think that I’m making very little progress, and yet, later, when I switch from the front crawl to the backstroke, I’m often surprised by the distance that I’ve travelled between my glances at the shore. The discovery that incremental progress feels faster when you let it accrue before judging it has been useful to me in my writing (and also in motivating me to clean out the garage). A civil-engineering class I took in college, which focussed on the structural forces shouldered by bridges and skyscrapers, comes back to me with great regularity when I think about all sorts of things. Wind exerts its force along the length of a skyscraper, causing it to bend. Similarly, a new source of stress in your life can’t be compartmentalized; it increases the pressure everywhere. It’s interesting to see one’s mind through the lens of educability. It makes you wonder what other cross-pollinations have occurred.</p><p>Valiant thinks it might be useful to promote educability as an ideal. We could try to figure out how to measure and teach it in schools, or to encourage it in adults; at a time when accelerating technological change means there’s always more to learn, we might seek to create a more educable society in general. (That change will further accelerate if Valiant’s proposals for A.I. capable of “artificial educability” prove workable.) After reading his book, I thought, on a less exalted scale, about how I might improve my own educability. I concluded that I would seek to learn about a wider range of subjects, and simply try more things, trusting that my mind would someday knit it all together. I also figured that it couldn’t hurt to remind myself of what I’d already learned. Down in the basement, a few big bookshelves hold my reading from college and graduate school. “Middlemarch” is there, along with many other books that I didn’t understand then but have come to value with the passage of time. Reading widely about things that don’t seem immediately or practically useful, in the hope that what you learn now may prove meaningful later—that’s pretty much the definition of a liberal-arts education. Who knew that one of its best defenders would turn out to be a computer scientist? ♦</p></div></div>]]></description>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">




<h2 id="they-dont-make-em-like-that-any-more-the-3.5mm-headphone-jack-socket">They
don’t make ’em like that any more: the 3.5mm headphone jack socket</h2>
<p><img src="https://kevinboone.me/img/plug.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It it ain’t broke, replace it with something that is.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About five years ago I was suddenly, unexpectedly taken ill.&nbsp;Not just
‘that’s a bit nasty’ ill, but ‘prepare for the worst’ ill.&nbsp;One thing
that kept my spirits up in hospital, in the long watches of the night,
was listening to comedy shows and audiobooks. I used my smartphone for
this, since I had it with me, and a pair of old, wired headphones that I
just had time to grab on my way to the ambulance.</p>
<p>I survived, of course, as evidenced by my continued ramblings on this
site. But it was an unpleasant experience, made just a little better by
a simple piece of technology: the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p>Now, of course, I do own wireless headphones and earbuds – I think
almost everybody does. I also own several of those irritating USB
dongles, that provide a 3.5mm port for devices that don’t have one. But
here’s the problem: I can’t use my Bluetooth earbuds while they’re
charging. And I can’t easily charge my phone whilst it’s connected to
the USB dongle. In a critical-care facility, it’s hard enough to find
one free mains socket to connect a charger to, let alone two.</p>
<p>In the debate about the benefits of wired and wireless headphones, I
doubt anybody is thinking “What if I get sick?” It certainly wasn’t
something I was thinking, either, until I actually did. Still, that
experience made me think about all the advantages of having a headphone
jack, some of which I’d thought about before, and some I hadn’t.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sound quality is better. Maybe that won’t always be the case, but it
is now. All decent headphones have an analog jack.</li>
<li>Almost any headphone or earphone will work with almost anything with
a standard jack socket. That isn’t the case for USB dongles. Maybe that
won’t always be the case, but it is now.</li>
<li>I can use the headphone jack to connect my phone or tablet to an
amplifier, should the need arise. For certain headphones, that need
<em>does</em> arise.</li>
<li>I can charge my phone whilst listening to music, which I do all
day.</li>
<li>I don’t have to carry around a stupid dongle, which I will
invariably lose.</li>
<li>Ordinary wired earbuds can be small enough to wear whilst sleeping.
I’ve never seen Bluetooth earbuds that are.</li>
</ul>
<p>The headphone jack is a “just works” kind of technology: there’s
nothing complicated about it, and its not encumbered by patents, so
anybody can make compatible equipment.</p>
<p>So, although “What if I get sick?” probably isn’t at the top of the
list of questions that will guide your buying decision, we have to
wonder what other things we lose, by replacing a well-established,
robust technology with a complicated, flaky one.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <em>advantages</em> of doing away with the
headphone jack are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your cellphone is about ten pence cheaper.</li>
<li>Er… that’s it.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes the loss of the headphone jack so hard to bear is that
<em>it wasn’t done for the consumer’s benefit</em>. To be sure,
manufacturers made certain claims about the alleged benefits of losing
the jack, but few of them stand up to much logical scrutiny.</p>
<p>The first manufacturer to make a point of dropping the headphone jack
(I believe) was not Apple – as is commonly believed – but Oppo, and back
in 2014. Their reason for doing so was at least a credible technical
one: they said it made their phones about half a millimetre thinner.
Maybe that was a selling point, maybe it wasn’t. But Apple couldn’t fall
back even on this claim, because people found ways to fit a 3.5mm jack
socket into the iPhones that lacked one, and even posted videos on
Youtube showing how they did it. It wasn’t easy, but it was clearly
<em>possible</em>. If Apple genuinely thought that omitting the jack
would leave more room for other features, they didn’t actually provide
any.</p>
<p>It’s notable that a number of companies mocked Apple’s decision to
drop the headphone jack, before quietly doing the same themselves:
Samsung and Google in particular. Samsung even cynically tried to
withdraw all the advertising in which they had mocked Apple. Of course,
nothing is ever really gone on the Internet, so we can continue to
marvel at Samsung’s barefaced duplicity.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers claimed that the presence of the headphone jack
made it difficult to keep their phones waterproof; but there’s a whole
range of good-quality phones from around 2019-2020 that are waterproof
to a reasonable degree, without sacrificing the jack.</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;All of these weak excuses are simply distractions from the
<em>real</em> reason Apple, Samsung, and Google dropped the headphone
jack: they all have a substantial investment in the manufacture of
wireless headphones.</p>
<p>Apple owns Beats – this was a multi-billion dollar investment, in a
company that manufactures Bluetooth headphones.</p>
<p>Samsung owns Harmon, which is know for the Harmon-Kardon and JBL
audio brands. Again, these were multi-billion dollar acquisitions for
Samsung, in companies with a strong interest in wireless audio.</p>
<p>Google owns Synaptics, Dysonics, RevX, and Tempow, all of which are
active in the development of wireless audio. Google also hired Peter Liu
from Bose, who was one of the original developers of the Bluetooth Low
Energy specification.</p>
<p>It is very much in the interest of companies like Apple, Samsung, and
Google to encourage their customers to buy into wireless Bluetooth
headphones. Or, better yet, to force them to do so, by taking away the
means to do anything else. After all, their executives have to justify
the billions of dollars they’ve spent, acquiring suppliers and
developers of wireless audio equipment.</p>
<p>The 3.5mm headphone jack has almost nothing to recommend it,
technically speaking. It was criticized by hi-fi enthusiasts almost from
its inception. The only things it has going for it are its simplicity,
and the fact that everybody uses it. Well, everybody outside the world
of mobile gadgets, anyway. This simplicity and ubiquity is a great
benefit to consumers, which is why Apple, et al., don’t want to provide
it – they have nothing to gain if consumers spend less money on their
products.</p>
<p>The loss of the headphone jack would have hurt even if there were
good technical reasons for it. As it turns out, there are none – it’s
just another cynical way for big businesses to gouge consumers. A side
effect of their strategy is that wired headphones themselves are
becoming less available, as cellphone users were until recently major
purchasers of these devices. It’s not difficult to get top-quality
headphones with a jack – they all have one; but there are fewer and
fewer mid-priced wired earbuds on the market.</p>
<p>The way to discourage companies behaving this way is for us all to
take our business elsewhere. It’s still possible to get decent
cellphones from Motorola, Asus, and Sony that retain the 3.5mm jack. I
don’t believe that anything recent from Apple, Samsung, or Google has
one, for reasons I explained earlier. Still, there are older cellphone
models from these suppliers that do have a jack, and which are still
good phones. I own the Samsung S10+, S10e, and Note 9, for example.
They’re a few years old, but they still do everything I want and
more.</p>
<p>If you’re a fan of the 3.5mm jack, it’s time to vote with your
wallet.</p>

            The National Institutes of Health said Friday that it is stopping its research of what’s commonly known as Havana syndrome, a mysterious illness experienced by a number of spies, soldiers and diplomats who have reported sudden debilitating symptoms of unknown origin.

            The NIH said it would end the work “out of an abundance of caution” after an internal investigation found that people had been coerced into to being part of the research.

            The coercion, the agency specified, was not on its own part, but the NIH did not elaborate as to who may have forced the participation. However, it noted that voluntary consent is a fundamental pillar of the ethical conduct of research.

            Some of the people who reported being sick previously claimed that the CIA made them join the research as a prerequisite for getting health care.

            In an editorial published in JAMA along with the studies, Dr. David Relman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford who worked on earlier investigations of this patient population, argued that although the study involving brain scans appeared to show that “nothing, or nothing serious” happened with these cases, coming to this conclusion&nbsp;“would be ill-advised.”

            Other research has found evidence of abnormalities in the brain, he said, and the same is true for the study involving the tests.&nbsp;Because the condition can look different in each person, he said, doctors don’t have specific tests that can fully determine what’s wrong.

            “Clearly, new, sensitive, standardized, non-invasive tests of nervous system function, especially involving the vestibular system, are needed, such as more specific blood markers of different forms of cellular injury,” Relman wrote.

            The illness was dubbed Havana syndrome because it emerged in late 2016 in the Cuban capital. Some American diplomats reported symptoms that were consistent with head trauma, including dizziness and extreme headaches.

            There was longstanding speculation about a new kind of weapon as the cause of these illnesses, but the US intelligence community said last year that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/01/politics/us-intel-community-havana-syndrome/index.html">it cannot link any cases</a>&nbsp;to a foreign adversary, ruling it unlikely that the unexplained illness was the result of a targeted campaign by an enemy of the US.

<p dir="auto">DOjS has a very simple integrated package manager (DPM). It can be started with <code>DPM.BAT</code>.
A working packet driver is needed to connect to the package index and download packages using HTTPS.
Packages (and the package index) are fetched from the <a href="https://github.com/SuperIlu/DOjSHPackages">DOjS/jSH package repository</a>.
Downloaded packages are put into <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code> in the <code>PACKAGE/</code> directory.
Feel free to submit any packages you want to include in that repository using a pull request.
DPM commands:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>installed - list installed packages.</li>
<li>remove    - remove package.</li>
<li>fetch     - fetch package index from server.</li>
<li>install   - install a package (and its dependencies) from package index.</li>
<li>list      - list available packages in index.</li>
<li>setindex  - set index URL (HTTP or HTTPS).</li>
<li>help      - this help.;</li>
<li>quit      - exit dpm.</li>

<p dir="auto">DOjS supports most of the Glide3 API that was used with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3dfx_Interactive" rel="nofollow">3dfx</a> accelerator cards. The following hardware is supported:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Voodoo 1 [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo 2 [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo 3 [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo 4 [tested by <a href="https://twitter.com/tunguska82" rel="nofollow">tunguska</a>]</li>
<li>Voodoo 5 [tested by <a href="https://twitter.com/tunguska82" rel="nofollow">tunguska</a>]</li>
<li>Voodoo Rush (all versions) [tested]</li>
<li>Voodoo Banshee (PCI and AGP) [tested]</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">Additionally you can use <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/releases">DOSBox-X</a> which emulates a Voodoo 1 card. Glide functions can be found in the 3dfx-module in the documentation, Javascript support functions have a "FX" prefix, all native functions are prefixed with "fx". Detailed Glide3-API documentation can be found on the internet, e.g. on <a href="http://falconfly.3dfx.pl/reference.htm" rel="nofollow">FalconFly Central</a>. <strong>Make sure you grab the Glide3 SDK and not Glide2!</strong></p>
<p dir="auto">You can use the included DOS version of <code>TEXUS.EXE</code> to convert bitmaps to <code>3df</code> texture files that can be loaded as textures.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>!!! Attention !!!</strong>
3dfx/Glide3 support ONLY works in plain DOS, NOT in the DOS/command window of Windows 9x! Be sure to always boot into a pure DOS prompt before trying to use any of the fx-functions!
Before using 3dfx/Glide3 support you need to copy the appropriate <code>GLIDE3X.DXE</code> into the same directory as <code>DOJS.EXE</code>. You can do so by using the <code>V_XXX.BAT</code> scripts in the distribution ZIP archive.</p>

<p dir="auto"><h2 tabindex="-1" dir="auto">Scripts and resources</h2><a id="user-content-scripts-and-resources" aria-label="Permalink: Scripts and resources" href="#scripts-and-resources"></a></p>
<p dir="auto">Scripts, as well as resources can either be stored in the file system or in ZIP files. To load data from a zip file the format is <code>&lt;ZIP filename&gt;=&lt;ZIP entry name&gt;</code> (e.g. <code>data.zip=mypic.bmp</code>). DOjS can be started with a script, a script in a ZIP file or no parameters. If the script was loaded from a ZIP file the running script can obtain resources from the same ZIP file by using <code>ZipPrefix()</code> to obtain paths refering to that ZIP. If the script was not started from a ZIP <code>ZipPrefix()</code> just passes through the file name (thus loading the file from HDD). If no arameters are supplied DOjS will first try to load <code>&lt;name of the EXE&gt;.ZIP=MAIN.JS</code> and then <code>JSBOOT.ZIP=MAIN.JS</code>.
Examples:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li><code>DOJS.EXE -r script.js</code> will start <code>script.js</code> from the HDD, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>DOJS.EXE -r data.zip=script.js</code> will start <code>script.js</code> from the ZIP file <code>data.zip</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>data.zip=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>HURTZ.EXE</code> DOjS was renamed to <code>HURTZ.EXE</code>. It will start <code>MAIN.JS</code> from the ZIP file <code>HURTZ.ZIP</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>HURTZ.ZIP=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
<li><code>DOJS.EXE</code> The script was added to <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code>. DOjS will start <code>MAIN.JS</code> from the ZIP file <code>JSBOOT.ZIP</code>, <code>ZipPrefix("pic.bmp")</code> will yield <code>JSBOOT.ZIP=pic.bmp</code>.</li>
</ul>

Things that don't work:</p>

<p dir="auto">All output via <code>Print()</code> and <code>Println()</code> is sent to the file <code>JSLOG.TXT</code>. You can use <code>Debug()</code> instead and output is only generated when you set the global variable <code>DEBUG=true</code>.</p>

<p dir="auto">This feature allows you to debug a running script via IPX networking and a second machine. To use remote logging do the following:</p>
<ul dir="auto">
<li>Put both machines on the same network.</li>
<li>Run <code>DOJS.EXE -r JSBOOT\LOGVIEW.JS</code> on one machine.</li>
<li>Enable debugging by setting <code>DEBUG=true</code> and enable remote debugging by <code>REMOTE_DEBUG=true</code>. You can either modify <code>JSBOOT\FUNC.JS</code> or change the variables at the very beginning of your script.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="auto">This works fine with two instances of DOSBox as well.
Please note that if the log messages are transmitted to fast the receiving instance of DOJS might skip some of these when displaying.</p>

		<p><em>If you are reading this blog post via a 3rd party source it is very likely that many parts of it will not render correctly. Please view the post on <a href="https://www.dogesec.com/blog/full_text_rss_atom_blog_feeds/">dogesec.com</a> for the full interactive viewing experience.</em></p>

		<h2 id="tldr">tl;dr</h2>

<p>RSS and ATOM feeds are problematic for two reasons; 1) lack of history, 2) contain limited post content. We built some open-source software to fix that.</p>

<h2 id="but-why">But why?</h2>

<p>There are many brilliant cyber-security researchers sharing their findings via online blogs.</p>

<p>Much of the research they share publicly is incredibly comprehensive.</p>

<p>As such, for the last four years now I have been curating a list of <em>awesome</em> blogs that publish cyber threat intelligence research.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/muchdogesec/awesome_threat_intel_blogs">It currently lists over 300 feeds</a>, with almost 200 stars!</p>

<p>However, most of the RSS and ATOM feeds listed in that repository, and more generally the RSS and ATOM feeds for any blog, are limited in two ways;</p>

<ol>
  <li>the feeds contain a limited history of posts, typically about 20 posts (but this is determined by the blog owner).</li>
  <li>the feeds show the partial content of the article, requiring you to navigate to the blog post on the internet to read the entire article.</li>
</ol>

<p>Unless you have subscribed to a blog since its inception, there is no easy way to get a complete history of posts in that blog without web-scraping.</p>

<p>For me, and perhaps you, this is problematic because there is no easy way to access historic research.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why I would want to do this, let me explain with a simple example…</p>

<p>A few months ago I was researching <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3094">CVE-2024-3094</a>, <em>as was every-single security researcher on the planet</em>.</p>

<p>Which brings me to problem 1;</p>

<h2 id="problem-1-limited-history-in-feeds">Problem 1: Limited history in feeds</h2>

<p>CVE-2024-3094 is relatively new. It has only existed for a few months.</p>

<p>However, in many cases malicious actors rehash old tactics, techniques and procedures.</p>

<p>Searching through historic data based on information about current threats can uncover similarities with past research.</p>

<p>Most blogs tend to limit the items posted in their feeds, usually to between around ten and twenty posts.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion there are two approaches to getting content for posts that are no longer found in feeds provided for the blog;</p>

  <li>Scrape the blog for historic posts. Probably the most accurate way to do it, though given the different structure of blogs and websites, this can become complex, requiring a fair bit of manual scraping logic to be written for each blog you want to follow. I’m sure an AI model could also be useful for this too, but this would likely require some fine-tuning for each blog. Or;</li>
  <li>Use the Wayback Machine’s archive. In the case of popular blogs the Wayback Machine will likely have captured many snapshots of a feed (though not always). For example, the feed for The Record by Recorded Future (<code>https://therecord.media/feed/</code>) has, at the time of writing, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20231101000000*/https://therecord.media/feed/">been captured 187 times between 260 times between November 1, 2020 and December 7, 2023</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230708200712/https://therecord.media/feed">Here is one such snapshot of The Record by Recorded Future taken by the Wayback Machine on July 8th 2023</a>.</p>

<p>Step in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/waybackpack/">waybackpack</a>, a command-line tool that lets you download the entire Wayback Machine archive for a given URL.</p>

<p>In the following command I am requesting all unique feed pages downloaded by the Wayback Machine (<code>--uniques-only</code>) from 2020 (<code>--from-date 2020</code>) from the feed URL <code>https://therecord.media/feed/</code> with each item to be written to a directory called <code>therecord_media_feed</code>.</p>

<p>Try it out for yourself;</p>

<div><pre><code>waybackpack https://therecord.media/feed/ <span>-d</span> therecord_media_feed <span>--from-date</span> 2020 <span>--uniques-only</span>  
</code></pre></div>

<p>This run produces 100’s of unique <code>index.html</code> files (where <code>index.html</code> is the actual RSS feed in pure XML). Each <code>index.html</code> is nested in directories named with the index datetime (time captured by Wayback Machine) in the format <code>YYYYMMDDHHMMSS</code> like so;</p>

<pre><code>therecord_media_feed
├── 20220808162900
│   └── therecord.media
│       └── feed
│           └── index.html
├── 20220805213430
│   └── therecord.media
│       └── feed
│           └── index.html
...
└── 20201101220102
    └── therecord.media
        └── feed
            └── index.html
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to point out unique entries (defined in the CLI) just means the <code>index.html</code> files have at least one difference. That is to say, much of the file can actually be the same, thus include the same feed URLs.</p>

<p>Take <code>20220808162900 &gt; therecord.media &gt; index.html</code> and <code>20220805213430 &gt; therecord.media &gt; index.html</code></p>

<p>Both of these files contain the item;</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;item&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Twitter confirms January breach, urges pseudonymous accounts to not add email or phone number<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;link&gt;</span>https://therecord.media/twitter-confirms-january-breach-urges-pseudonymous-accounts-to-not-add-email-or-phone-number/<span>&lt;/link&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Therefore, the final step of the process requires de-duplication of feed items. This process can be done using the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> values, first by searching for duplicates and then selecting the most recent feed entry (by Wayback Machine capture time) for the entry to be stored.</p>

<p>Using this data, an entire historical feed can then be reconstructed.</p>

<h2 id="problem-2-partial-feed-content">Problem 2: Partial Feed Content</h2>

<p>However, this feed will in most cases only show a summary of the articles actual content, not the full article.</p>

<p>As such, it is impossible to search through the full content of articles listed in a feed using the feed XML alone.</p>

<p>Take this example from <a href="https://feeds.feedburner.com/Unit42">PANs Unit42 ATOM feed</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>&lt;item&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;title&gt;</span>Threat Brief: Vulnerability in XZ Utils Data Compression Library Impacting Multiple Linux Distributions (CVE-2024-3094)<span>&lt;/title&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;link&gt;</span>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-brief-xz-utils-cve-2024-3094/<span>&lt;/link&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;guid</span> <span>isPermaLink=</span><span>"false"</span><span>&gt;</span>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/?p=133225<span>&lt;/guid&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;description&gt;</span>
		<span>&lt;![CDATA[ &lt;p&gt;An overview of CVE-2024-3094, a vulnerability in XZ Utils, and information about how to mitigate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-brief-xz-utils-cve-2024-3094/"&gt;Threat Brief: Vulnerability in XZ Utils Data Compression Library Impacting Multiple Linux Distributions (CVE-2024-3094)&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com"&gt;Unit 42&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; ]]&gt;</span>
	<span>&lt;/description&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/item&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> property contains a paragraph of data. Compare that to the full post content by visiting the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> (<code>https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/threat-brief-xz-utils-cve-2024-3094/</code>), which contains paragraphs, images, tables, etc.</p>

<p>However, the feed does give us an list of post URLs. Visiting each URL give us the HTML code for the full article.</p>

<p>Though the problem isn’t solved yet.</p>

<p>If you look at the HTML code for the article, you will  see the content is wrapped up in unrelated elements (e.g. nav bar) and other messy HTML content (e.g. CSS, JS).</p>

<p>Step in <a href="https://pypi.org/project/readability-lxml/">readability-lxml</a>, a Python library that takes a html document, pulls out the main body of text and cleans it up.</p>

<p>Thus, to get the full text needed I can;</p>

<ol>
  <li>take the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> value</li>
  <li>grab the HTML content (e.g. <code>curl -L -o code.html http://website.domain</code>)</li>
  <li>run it through readability-lxml to get the post content (the <code>doc.summary()</code>)</li>
</ol>

<p>Now our entire historical feed can be built with the full content of each article too.</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-into-action-with-history4feed">Putting it into action with history4feed</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/muchdogesec/history4feed">history4feed</a>, creates a complete full text historical archive for an RSS or ATOM feed using the logic described above.</p>

<p>Once you’ve installed history4feed and have it running, you can start adding RSS and ATOM feeds.</p>

<p>Two tips before you get started;</p>

<ol>
  <li>our <a href="https://github.com/muchdogesec/awesome_threat_intel_blogs">Awesome Threat Intel Blogs</a> repository contains hundreds of feeds from blogs writing about cyber threat intelligence.</li>
  <li>if you’re more comfortable using a web interface you can use the Swagger UI that ships with history4feed to interact with the API (see the history4feed docs).</li>

Droppers are typically used in the initial stages of a breach, and they allow cybercriminals to bypass security measures and deploy additional harmful programs, including viruses, ransomware, or spyware.&lt;/p&gt;</span><span>\n</span><span>&lt;p&gt;Droppers like IcedID are most often deployed through email attachments, hacked websites, or bundled with legitimate software.

<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>Operation Endgame targets the cybercrime ecosystem supporting droppers/loaders, slang terms used to describe tiny, custom-made programs designed to surreptitiously install malware onto a target system. Droppers are typically used in the initial stages of a breach, and they allow cybercriminals to bypass security measures and deploy additional harmful programs, including viruses, ransomware, or spyware.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>Droppers like IcedID are most often deployed through email attachments, hacked websites, or bundled with legitimate software. For example, cybercriminals have long used <span>&amp;lt;</span>a href=<span>&amp;quot;</span>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/using-google-search-to-find-software-can-be-risky/<span>&amp;quot;</span> target=<span>&amp;quot;</span>_blank<span>&amp;quot;</span> rel=<span>&amp;quot;</span>noopener<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</span>paid ads on Google to trick people into installing malware<span>&amp;lt;</span>/a<span>&amp;gt;</span> disguised as popular free software, such as Microsoft Teams, Adobe Reader and Discord. In those cases, the dropper is the hidden component bundled with the legitimate software that quietly loads malware onto the user’s system.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>Droppers remain such a critical, human-intensive component of nearly all major cybercrime enterprises that the most popular have turned into full-fledged cybercrime services of their own. By targeting the individuals who develop and maintain dropper services and their supporting infrastructure, authorities are hoping to disrupt multiple cybercriminal operations simultaneously.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>According to <span>&amp;lt;</span>a href=<span>&amp;quot;</span>https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/largest-ever-operation-against-botnets-hits-dropper-malware-ecosystem<span>&amp;quot;</span> target=<span>&amp;quot;</span>_blank<span>&amp;quot;</span> rel=<span>&amp;quot;</span>noopener<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</span>a statement<span>&amp;lt;</span>/a<span>&amp;gt;</span> from the European police agency <span>&amp;lt;</span>strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>Europol<span>&amp;lt;</span>/strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>, between May 27 and May 29, 2024 authorities arrested four suspects (one in Armenia and three in Ukraine), and disrupted or took down more than 100 Internet servers in Bulgaria, Canada, Germany, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States and Ukraine. Authorities say they also seized more than 2,000 domain names that supported dropper infrastructure online.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>In addition, Europol released information on eight fugitives suspected of involvement in dropper services and who are wanted by Germany; their names and photos were added to Europol’s “Most Wanted” list on 30 May 2024.<span>&amp;lt;</span>span id=<span>&amp;quot;</span>more-67691<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>/span<span>&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>

<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>“It has been discovered through the investigations so far that one of the main suspects has earned at least EUR 69 million in cryptocurrency by renting out criminal infrastructure sites to deploy ransomware,” Europol wrote. “The suspect’s transactions are constantly being monitored and legal permission to seize these assets upon future actions has already been obtained.”<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>There have been <span>&amp;lt;</span>a href=<span>&amp;quot;</span>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/08/u-s-hacks-qakbot-quietly-removes-botnet-infections/<span>&amp;quot;</span> target=<span>&amp;quot;</span>_blank<span>&amp;quot;</span> rel=<span>&amp;quot;</span>noopener<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</span>numerous such coordinated malware takedown efforts<span>&amp;lt;</span>/a<span>&amp;gt;</span> in the past, and yet often the substantial amount of coordination required between law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity firms involved is not sustained after the initial disruption and/or arrests.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>But a new website erected to detail today’s action — <span>&amp;lt;</span>a href=<span>&amp;quot;</span>https://www.operation-endgame.com<span>&amp;quot;</span> target=<span>&amp;quot;</span>_blank<span>&amp;quot;</span> rel=<span>&amp;quot;</span>noopener<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</span>operation-endgame.com<span>&amp;lt;</span>/a<span>&amp;gt;</span> — makes the case that this time is different, and that more takedowns and arrests are coming. “Operation Endgame does not end today,” the site promises. “New actions will be announced on this website.”<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>div id=<span>&amp;quot;</span>attachment_67697<span>&amp;quot;</span> class=<span>&amp;quot;</span>wp-caption aligncenter<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>img aria-describedby=<span>&amp;quot;</span>caption-attachment-67697<span>&amp;quot;</span> decoding=<span>&amp;quot;</span>async<span>&amp;quot;</span> loading=<span>&amp;quot;</span>lazy<span>&amp;quot;</span> class=<span>&amp;quot;</span>size-full wp-image-67697<span>&amp;quot;</span> src=<span>&amp;quot;</span>https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/endgame-think.png<span>&amp;quot;</span> alt=<span>&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>p id=<span>&amp;quot;</span>caption-attachment-67697<span>&amp;quot;</span> class=<span>&amp;quot;</span>wp-caption-text<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</span>A message on operation-endgame.com promises more law enforcement and disruption actions.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;&amp;lt;</span>/div<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>Perhaps in recognition that many of today’s top cybercriminals reside in countries that are effectively beyond the reach of international law enforcement, actions like Operation Endgame seem increasingly focused on mind games — i.e., trolling the hackers.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>

<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>The Operation Endgame website also includes a countdown timer, which serves to tease the release of several animated videos that mimic the same sort of flashy, short advertisements that established cybercriminals often produce to promote their services online. At least two of the videos include a substantial amount of text written in Russian.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>
<span>&amp;lt;</span>p<span>&amp;gt;</span>The coordinated takedown comes on the heels of another law enforcement action this week against what the director of the FBI called “<span>&amp;lt;</span>a href=<span>&amp;quot;</span>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/is-your-computer-part-of-the-largest-botnet-ever/<span>&amp;quot;</span> target=<span>&amp;quot;</span>_blank<span>&amp;quot;</span> rel=<span>&amp;quot;</span>noopener<span>&amp;quot;&amp;gt;</span>likely the world’s largest botnet ever<span>&amp;lt;</span>/a<span>&amp;gt;</span>.” On Wednesday <span>&amp;lt;</span>strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>U.S. Department of Justice<span>&amp;lt;</span>/strong<span>&amp;gt;</span> (DOJ) announced the arrest of <span>&amp;lt;</span>strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>YunHe Wang<span>&amp;lt;</span>/strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>, the alleged operator of the ten-year-old online anonymity service <span>&amp;lt;</span>strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>911 S5<span>&amp;lt;</span>/strong<span>&amp;gt;</span>. The government also seized 911 S5’s domains and online infrastructure, which allegedly turned computers running various “free VPN” products into Internet traffic relays that facilitated billions of dollars in online fraud and cybercrime.<span>&amp;lt;</span>/p<span>&amp;gt;</span>

  <h2>Upgrading a Toshiba NAS HDD firmware on Linux</h2>
  <p><span>28 Aug 2024</span></p><h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>I reversed the firmware updater of my Toshiba HDD to be able to update it on Linux.
The following commands <strong>should</strong> work, <strong>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK</strong>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/ISFw.dat
$ grep -C2 MODELNAME ISFw.dat
 # ^
 #&nbsp;|___ identify the right filename here
$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/sk060202.ftd
# hdparm --fwdownload-mode3 sk060202.ftd /dev/sdX
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="context">Context</h2>

<p>I bought a Toshiba HDWG480 HDD for my NAS. <code>hdparm -I /dev/XXX</code> gives the following output:</p>

<div><pre><code>ATA device, with non-removable media
        Model Number:       TOSHIBA HDWG480
        Serial Number:      3430A00RFR0H
        Firmware Revision:  0601
        Transport:          Serial, ATA8-AST, SATA 1.0a, SATA II Extensions, SATA Rev 2.5, SATA Rev 2.6, SATA Rev 3.0
Standards:
        Used: unknown (minor revision code 0x006d)
        Supported: 10 9 8 7 6 5
        Likely used: 10
[...]
</code></pre></div>

<p>As usual, I wanted to check if any firmware update is available. Toshiba’s <a href="https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/en.htm">dedicated webpage</a> lists version <code>0602</code> as available for my model.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, as expected, there’s no firmware update process provided for Linux users, only an “Internal Storage Firmware Update Utility” is provided for Windows.</p>

<p>Update files are not provided either.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>So, our goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>understand where the updater gets its update files from</li>
  <li>reverse engineer the flashing process itself to reimplement it on Linux</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reversing-the-windows-updater">Reversing the Windows Updater</h2>

<h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>

<p>Running the <a href="https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/exe/InternalStorageFwUpdateUtility_1.20.0410.exe">installer</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with Wine works perfectly, resulting in the following files being installed under <code>Program Files (x86)</code>:</p>

<div><pre><code>  18312 ISFw.exe:        PE32 executable (native) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 4 sections
2434952 TosISFw.exe:     PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
2172296 TosISFwSvc.exe:  PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
2362248 TosISFwTray.exe: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows, 5 sections
</code></pre></div>

<p>A quick look (filename, imports) hints at the following goals for each program:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>ISFW.exe</code> is a driver (<code>DriverEntry</code> export), probably in charge of effectively flashing the update.</li>
  <li><code>TosISFw.exe</code> is the GUI</li>
  <li><code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code> is the userland service (as the service related imports show)</li>
  <li><code>TosISFwTray.exe</code> most probably handles a tray icon</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-the-update-files">Finding the update files</h3>

<p>The obvious move is too grep for URLs in the various installed binaries. Unfortunately, it leads nowhere apart from URLs related to the digital signatures. However, grepping for <code>HttpOpenRequest</code>, an API often used by Windows programs to download files, gives two results: <code>TosISFw.exe</code> and <code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s look at <code>TosISFwSvc.exe</code> which is smaller and let’s see if we can find the URL by checking the xrefs.</p>

<p>The call is in the function at 0x00401040, and looks like this:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>v15</span> <span>=</span> <span>HttpOpenRequestW</span><span>(</span><span>v14</span><span>,</span> <span>L"GET"</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>v36</span><span>[(</span><span>_DWORD</span><span>)</span><span>lpBuffer</span><span>],</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>LPCWSTR</span><span>)</span><span>szReferrer</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0x84000000</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>the function is obviously a “download” helper, as all the API calls show. Let’s rename it <code>dlfile</code>. There are only two Xrefs to dlfile:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>(</span> <span>!</span><span>RegOpenKeyExW</span><span>(</span>
        <span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span><span>,</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The first one gives us our answer: the URL is stored in the registry. It’s actually written by the InstallShield setup.</p>

<p><a href="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/toshiba/regedit.png"><img src="https://syscall.eu/blog/public/toshiba/regedit.png" alt="disk"></a></p>

<p>The value is <code>http://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/ISFw.dat</code></p>

<h3 id="parsing-the-update-file">Parsing the update file</h3>

<p>The file is an ini file, which is trivial to read and parse:</p>

<p>in my case, the drive is number 8. What’s interesting is the checksum at the end. It’s the CRC32 of the file, minus the last 10 bytes, which can be easily checked with the <code>slice</code> and <code>crc32</code> tools of my hacking Swiss army knife <a href="https://github.com/trou/rsbkb">rsbkb</a>:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ slice -- ISFw.dat 0 -10 | crc32
905cbd24
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now obviously, let’s try to download the relevant file:</p>

<div><pre><code>$ wget https://www.canvio.jp/en/support/download/hdd/ot_ihdd/fw/sk060202.ftd

</code></pre></div>

<p>Just for fun we can check if <a href="https://github.com/trou/cpu_rec_rs"><code>cpu_rec_rs</code></a> can identify any code in the binary:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>$</span><span> </span>~/tools/cpu_rec_rs/cpu_rec_rs sk060202.ftd
<span>Loading corpus from "/home/trou/tools/cpu_rec_rs/cpu_rec_corpus/*.corpus"

    File     |   Range    | Detected Architecture

sk060202.ftd | Whole file | ARMhf

</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So the firmware is probably running on an ARM SoC (it is).</p>

<h3 id="understanding-the-update-process">Understanding the update process</h3>

<p>Now, how is the file sent to the drive to actually perform the update? Recall that we have 4 binaries and we saw the <code>ISFW.exe</code> is actually a driver.</p>

<p>The <code>DriverEntry</code> function is actually extremely simple:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>NTSTATUS</span> <span>__stdcall</span> <span>DriverEntry</span><span>(</span><span>PDRIVER_OBJECT</span> <span>DriverObject</span><span>,</span> <span>PUNICODE_STRING</span> <span>RegistryPath</span><span>)</span>

<p><code>opendrive</code> returns a handle on a given <code>PhysicalDrive</code>, which is then used by <code>getdevprop</code>’s <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntdeviceiocontrolfile"><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code></a>.
Using IDA’s “standard enums”, I remapped <code>0x2D1400</code> to its readable definition: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winioctl/ni-winioctl-ioctl_storage_query_property"><code>IOCTL_STORAGE_QUERY_PROPERTY</code></a>.</p>

<p>As <code>InputBuffer</code> is set to 0 before the call, the returned data is a <code>STORAGE_DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR</code> structure, which is used by <code>verifydisk</code> to verify if the drive is connected through USB (<code>BusTypeUsb</code>) and bails out if that’s the case.</p>

<p><code>NtDeviceIoControlFile</code> is now used with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ni-ntddscsi-ioctl_ata_pass_through_direct"><code>IOCTL_ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</code></a>, which as the name implies, sends a raw ATA command to the drive. Actually understanding the request is a bit complex as the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddscsi/ns-ntddscsi-_ata_pass_through_direct"><code>ATA_PASS_THROUGH_DIRECT</code></a> structure specifies both data buffers and “registers” through the <code>CurrentTaskFile</code> field.</p>

<p><code>CurrentTaskFile</code> is an array used to index 8 registers, both as input and output. Using the documentation, we can create two enums to use in IDA:</p>

<div><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>ATA_INPUT_REGISTERS</span> <span>:</span> <span>__int32</span>

<p>So the command here is <code>0xEC</code>. The ATA/ATAPI command set specification, found <a href="https://read.seas.harvard.edu/cs161/2024/pdf/ata-atapi-8.pdf">here</a>, describes the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE – ECh, PIO Data-In</code> command, which returns a <em>lot</em> of data. Thankfully, Microsoft gives us the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ata/ns-ata-_identify_device_data"><code>IDENTIFY_DEVICE_DATA</code></a> structure which has everything.</p>

<p>The following code then verify we have the “right” drive by comparing the serial, model and firmware version from the returned data to the ones stored in the registry.</p>

<p>As you can see, the updater verifies an interesting field from the drive information data: <code>MaxBlocksPerDownloadMicrocodeMode03</code>. Let’s check what this means.</p>

<h3 id="sending-ata-firmware-update-commands">Sending ATA firmware update commands</h3>

<h4 id="documentation">Documentation</h4>

<p>The following excerpt from the ATA command set describes the meaning of the field:</p>

<div><pre><code>A.11.5.3.4 DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field
If:
a) the value of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field (see table A.30) is greater than zero;
b) the value of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field is less than FFFFh;
c) the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.2.20) is set to one or the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.2.6) is set to one; and
d) the DM OFFSETS DEFERRED SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.3.1) is set to one, or the DM OFFSETS IMMEDIATE
SUPPORTED bit (see A.11.5.3.3) is set to one, then the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field indicates the maximum number of 512-byte data blocks permitted by a DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command (see 7.7) or a DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA command (see 7.8) that specifies a subcommand of:
a) Download with offsets and save microcode for immediate and future use (i.e., 03h); or
b) Download with offsets and save microcode for future use (i.e., 0Eh).
Otherwise, no maximum is indicated (i.e., there is no maximum number of 512-byte data blocks).
The IDENTIFY DEVICE data contains a copy of the DM MAXIMUM TRANSFER SIZE field (see IDENTIFY DEVICE
data word 235 in table 45).
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, we want to check this <code>DOWNLOAD MICROCODE</code> command:</p>

<div><pre><code>The DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command allows the host to alter the device’s microcode. The data transferred
using the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE command and the DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA command is vendor
specific.
[...]
Downloading and activating microcode involves the following steps:
1) download: the host transfers updated microcode data to the device in one or more DOWNLOAD
MICROCODE commands or DOWNLOAD MICROCODE DMA commands;
2) save: after receiving the complete updated microcode data, if specified by the download microcode
mode, then the device shall save the updated microcode data to nonvolatile storage; and
3) activate: the device begins using the saved or deferred microcode data for the first time after an event
specified by the download microcode mode and the saved or deferred microcode data becomes the
active microcode data.

The BLOCK COUNT field specifies the number of 512-byte data blocks that shall be transferred. The BLOCK COUNT
field is specified in the COUNT field and the LBA field (see table 37).
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>DOWNLOAD</code> Subcommands actually define the update behavior:</p>

<p>As you can see, the <code>ATA_CMD_DOWNLOAD_MICRO</code> just follows the specification. The only weird point is the <code>Device</code> register, which is basically obsolete, but is set to <code>0xE0</code>.
Just to be sure, I checked <code>hdparm</code> source code to see the value set in the command, and indeed, they also set it to <code>0xE0</code>, so it’s probably legacy cruft:</p>

<p>So basically, the updater does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>download the list of updates</li>
  <li>check if a drive matches, set registry values</li>
  <li>the driver takes over and:
    <ul>
      <li>checks if the drive is not connected through USB</li>
      <li>verifies it’s the actual drive specified in the registry using the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE</code> command</li>
      <li>loops and sends the firmware update, 128 512-bytes chunks at a time, using the <code>DOWNLOAD MICROCODE</code> command</li>
      <li>verifies the drive was updated using the <code>IDENTIFY DEVICE</code> command</li>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page">

<br><br>
<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="1">1</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/OutsidePlant.png" alt="OutsidePlant.png                      ">
</p>
Another section of this web site talked about outside plant, which is the telephone company's term for the cabling and other equipment which connects your home telephone to their Central Office.
<p>This diagram shows an overview, and below are some pictures and descriptions of how outside plant is different for rural areas.
</p><div><p>The main differences are that the Central Offices are typically smaller, and the cable distances are much greater.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="2">2</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3005.jpg" alt="DSCN3005.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here is a typical Central Office. Note it is only one storey, but is still well-kept, and mostly windowless.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="3">3</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3008.jpg" alt="DSCN3008.jpg                          ">
</p>
Around back are some air conditioners, technician's trucks, and even a small aluminum motor boat (the technicians working in this area often have to run telephone lines to islands). Also, at the right are some Jumpered Wire Interfaces (JWI), which split the high pair count cables from the Central Office (such as 1,200 pairs) to smaller cables (such as 200 pairs) for distribution to terminals and people's houses.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="4">4</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2859.jpg" alt="DSCN2859.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's another Central Office. This one has a few meters of unused 1,200-pair feeder cable in front (much more attractive than plastic pink flamingos).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="5">5</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2852.jpg" alt="DSCN2852.jpg                          ">
</p>
Around back, no security cameras, but there is good lighting, and of course, air conditioners.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="6">6</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2853.jpg" alt="DSCN2853.jpg                          ">
</p>
The front door has a mechanical push-button lock, and a discrete sign.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="7">7</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2854-1200-pair-PIC.jpg" alt="DSCN2854-1200-pair-PIC.jpg            ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of the 1,200 pair cable. It is about 4 cm in diameter.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="8">8</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2858.jpg" alt="DSCN2858.jpg                          ">
</p>
The feeder cables coming out of the Central Office are all buried, but within a few meters of the building, they surface to come be run up a utility pole. Note the ancient lead-covered splice enclosure.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="9">9</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2857.jpg" alt="DSCN2857.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's the top of that utility pole. These cables carry everything that this Central Office does (this is what is called a “single point of failure” – one car accident, and there's a lot of people with no phone service).
<div><p>There's another lead closure at the top-left.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="10">10</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2856.jpg" alt="DSCN2856.jpg                          ">
</p>
As shown in the close-up of the 1,200-pair feeder cable above, cable construction is to have twisted pairs covered by a thick plastic protective jacket. After enough sun and flexing in the wind, the cable jacket can develop leaks, which could allow water to seep in between the cable pairs. This would change the electrical characteristics of the cable, and cause many problems (such as cross-talk between telephone lines and distorted signals). Therefore paper insulated cable (these cables will all be more than 40 years old) and sometimes newer cable) are pressurized with air, typically less than 9 pounds per square inch (for comparison, automobile tires typically have a pressure of more than 30 pounds per square inch). This provides several benefits:
<ul><li>Rather than water seeping into the cable, air will leak out, and this keeps the cable dry.</li>
<li>The flow of air through the cable will dry and remove any moisture that does get into the cable.</li> 
<li>By measuring the pressure along test points in the cable, and graphing this, a technician can determine approximately where the cable jacket is bad (the pressure will be lower where the air leaks out).</li></ul>
<div><p>I'm sure you've seen the little packages of <b>dessicant</b> (which look like restaurant coffee sugar packets) of that often come (along with a warning not to eat it) with electronic and other products which have been shipped from overseas. This stuff is a chemical that likes to absorb water (from the damp ocean crossing), so the moisture won't damage the goods. Similarly, there is a need to ensure that the air used to pressurize the cable is dry, and this blue crystalline material is dessicant, and does just that. The air compressor (or “bottled gas”, where the air comes from a compressed air tank) would be in the Central Office, and feeds the black hose, so the air passes through the dessicant, and the hose continues up the utility pole to pressurize the cables father along.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="11">11</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN2855.jpg" alt="DSCN2855.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of the dessicant canister. It reminds technicians to:
<ul><li>Change the desiccant when it turns pink.</li>
<li>That the maximum pressure allowed is 25 pounds per square inch (automobile tires typically have a pressure of 28 to 40 pounds per square inch).</li>
<li>And to be gentle with it.</li></ul>
This device is made by Jameson Corporation, and is model J-100-8.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="12">12</a> of 24<br></span>

Here is a new air pipe (in an urban location) from a central office, waiting to be connected through to a cable vault farther down the road.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="13">13</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3436.jpg" alt="DSCN3436.jpg">
</p>
This air pipe is made by Superior Essex. Their catalogue page is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/SuperiorEssexAirPipe.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. It shows that this type of pipe is typically installed in ducts (underground plastic conduits), the pipe has an outside diameter of 18 mm, and has a 4 mil (about the thickness of paper) aluminum tape inside the pipe (since the plastic used would otherwise allow water vapour to pass through the pipe wall (it is important to keep the air dry).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="14">14</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3422.jpg" alt="DSCN3422.jpg">
</p>
To split a feeder cable into smaller cables (to each go in different directions) a splice enclosure is needed. Here is a really old lead one (on top), and a newer plastic (and openable) one below it.
<p>Cables with a lead splice closure are old enough that the wires are likely paper insulated (as the bundle of spliced wires is covered in a protective and insulating cloth before the lead closure is sealed with solder, plastic insulated wires can also be enclosed in lead closures, without damage when the lead is sealed with solder).
</p><p>Due to the difficulty of opening and resealing the lead closures, and the health concerns for technicians working with the lead, telephone companies are working at removing this type of closure.
</p><p>Modern buried telephone cables are generally <b>grease filled</b>: when the cable is manufactured, a gel is injected to fill the interstitial spaces between the twisted pairs, so water cannot seep in. In contrast, aerial cables are generally <b>dry</b>, and do not have this gunk.
</p><p>Attached to the lead splice cover is a pressure transducer to enable remote monitoring of the pressure in the cable.
</p><p>A web page for a typical outside plant pressure transducer made by TX Technology Corporation is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/Type100F_PressureTransducers.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. This points out that the transducer is designed to measure pressures from 0 to 9.5 pounds per square inch, and has a corresponding output from 100 kΩ to 3,820 kΩ. More detailed information is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/TX_Technology_PressureTransducerInstallation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. It points out that the transducer has a water-tight screw cap (with a knurled edge for finger tightening, and a little ball-chain so it won't be lost if dropped) a which can be removed to set the zero-pressure point for the transducer, according to the altitude at which it is installed.
</p><p>The flexible cable hanging down is the electrical signal from the transducer, and is connected to a pair of wires in the lower cable so the pressure at this location can be remotely monitored at the central office. Because most central office activities (such as changing the telephone line features which subscribers receive and trouble-shooting problems) can now be done remotely, most central offices are not normally staffed. Therefore, the system (at the nearest central office) which monitors all the remote pressure transducers will usually be itself monitored remotely.
</p><div><p>When pressurized cable is spliced to dry or greased-filled cable, a <b>plug</b> must be poured into the end of the pressurized cable, so the air does not leak out.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="15">15</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3036.jpg" alt="DSCN3036.jpg                          ">
</p>
Now we get to a really interesting part. As you drive along rural roads, you'll see what appear to be paint cans, each with a this cable coming out the top. If you're really bored, you may also notice that they are exactly 6,000 feet apart (that would be 1.14 miles, and 1.83 km).
<p>Just as you can walk slowly through water, but cannot easily run (since water is more viscous than air), higher-frequency electrical signals are attenuated (made quieter) more than lower-frequency signals.
</p><p>In urban areas, there are generally enough customers within a 5 km radius of Central Offices to justify building a Central Office, and in 5 km of cable, the signals are not distorted too much. In rural areas, customers are farther apart, and the cable runs to customers are longer. The capacitance of the cable (which is analogous to the greater viscosity of water) would attenuate the high-frequency signals (distorting the sound), so inductors (which counter-act the capacitance) are connected to each pair of wires.
</p><div><p>Since the capacitance is spread-out along the length of the cable, the inductance also has to be distributed along the cable. A popular scheme is called <b>H88</b>: the “H” refers to a distance of 6,000 feet between inductors, and the “88” refers to the inductance value of 88 mH (milliHenrys).</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="16">16</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3025.jpg" alt="DSCN3025.jpg                          ">
</p>
As you might have guessed, these therefore are not paint cans, but are the enclosures for the loading coils. If there is a 600-pair cable, then you need 600 loading coils (these look something like little spools of thread), and you need to attach each to the feeder cable.
<div><p>Here there are three old loading coils (two large, and one smaller metal enclosure mounted on the utility pole), and one newer black plastic loading coil enclosure attached (with stainless steel straps) to the cable at the left. A splice enclosure allows the cable from the loading coil enclosures to be spliced to the feeder cable</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="17">17</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3026.jpg" alt="DSCN3026.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a close-up of those big old loading coil enclosures.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="18">18</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3027.jpg" alt="DSCN3027.jpg                          ">
</p>
As more cables are installed, more loading coils are needed. Here's the newest loading coil (cute, isn't it).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="19">19</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3030.jpg" alt="DSCN3030.jpg                          ">
</p>
That's it for the loading coils, but on the very next utility pole (and this does generally happen, it will be on a directly adjacent utility pole, as the spacing is also 6,000 feet, likely to simplify installation), there's something else. Rather than being up high, these are generally a waist-height.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="20">20</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3028%203M%20Closure.jpg" alt="DSCN3028 3M Closure.jpg               ">
</p>
So we have the feeder cables running along, and a 3M splice enclosure bringing a few of the twisted pairs in the cable down the utility pole ...<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="21">21</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3029.jpg" alt="DSCN3029.jpg                          ">
</p>
Down to these, which are <b>T1 repeaters</b>. Rather than the analogue signals carried by telephone lines, a T1 is a digital signal which carries data at 1,544,000 bits/s (on the exact same type of twisted pairs as the voice telephone lines). There are many advantages to T1 signals, including being able to carry 24 conversations over two twisted pairs, not gathering cumulative noise along the length of the cable run, and being able to carry (somewhat) high-speed data. But, the problem is that the signal needs to be amplified periodically – every 6,000 feet in fact. The amplifier is actually called a repeater, since it outputs a binary signal (which has only two states, on or off).<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="22">22</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3031.jpg" alt="DSCN3031.jpg                          ">
</p>
This is the older of the two. The feeder cable is pressurized, and so is the cable coming down to this repeater enclosure, and in fact, the repeater enclosure is pressurized as well. At the base of the white enclosure, you can see the clamp (with padlock) which provides the air-tight seal. Since there are active electronics in this enclosure, and they can't have cooling fans (since it is an air-tight enclosure), these enclosures are always white to reflect the sunlight (and some of the heat) as these bake in the summer sun.<span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="23">23</a> of 24<br></span>
<p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3035.jpg" alt="DSCN3035.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's the newer enclosure, it is an HRE-458 HiGain Remote Therm-O-Nator Enclosure from ADC DSL Systems, Inc. Some documentation for it is <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/2409_ADC_HRE-458.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, and it can hold up to ten cards, such as this <a href="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/ADC_HiGain_HDU-409_HDSL_Extender,UserManual.pdf" target="_blank">HDSL line extender</a> which extends the range of two full-duplex 784 kbits/s DSL connections by up to 12,000' using two 24 gauge copper twisted pairs.
<div><p>The enclosure has heat sink fins on top (since heat rises, this will be where it gets the hottest). These help cool the enclosure by providing more surface area, so it can radiate more heat.</p><p><span size="-1" color="888888"><br> <a name="24">24</a> of 24<br></span>
</p></div><p><img src="http://cityinfrastructure.com/RuralOutsidePlant/Webfiles/DSCN3034.jpg" alt="DSCN3034.jpg                          ">
</p>
Here's a look at the bottom, showing the cable entry, and also a pressure relief valve to release the pressure before opening the enclosure. Another opening allows the pressure to be measures. The thinner black wire is to ground the enclosure, so goes to a metal stake driven into the ground.</div>]]></description>
