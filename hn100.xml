<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
            <p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-21/1763741331-28722-kagihubcover-3.png" alt="An ilustration of an office room with a Doggo, Cat and Kagibara"></p>

<p>We’re excited to announce that <a href="https://hub.kagi.com/">Kagi Hub Belgrade</a> is now open!
Our first office doubles as a free coworking space for all Kagi members. Reservations will be available from December 15th, and you can make your bookings <a href="https://hub.kagi.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Kagi Hub is our first physical home: a modern, light-filled, 250-square-meter office space in the very heart of Belgrade, Serbia, open to all Kagi members and the Kagi team. Yes, you read that right. You can share this space with us!</p>

<p>Why? Great products don’t happen in isolation. They are shaped by the people who use them. That’s what this space is for: a place where Kagi users and our team members can share feedback, ideas, and a cup of coffee in person. Kagi Hub is an extension of our mission to humanize the web, creating an offline space where people who care about a better internet can meet.</p>

</p>

<h2>Who can use the Hub (and what you get)</h2>

<p>Alongside Kagi employees, Kagi Hub is free for all Kagi members. Each member can book up to 5 days per month at no additional cost.</p>

<p>The open space has 25 dedicated seats. Once you complete the booking, you’ll get a spot in the open-space area for the dates you’ve chosen (first-come, first-served within your booking) → <a href="https://hub.kagi.com/">Kagi Hub Belgrade</a>.</p>

<p>At the hub you’ll find:</p>

<ul>
<li>A quiet, modern open-space work area with 25 ergonomic desks</li>
<li>Fast Wi‑Fi</li>
<li>Free coffee, tea, and a small kitchen area</li>
<li>A conference room, subject to availability</li>
</ul>

<p>We kindly ask you to cancel your booking if you can’t make it, so other members can use the space.</p>

<h2>Where to find us</h2>

<p><strong>Address</strong>:
Kneza Mihaila 11, first floor
11000 Belgrade, Serbia</p>

<p><strong>Opening hours</strong>:
Monday - Friday, 10:00–19:00 (local time), excluding local public holidays.</p>

<p>The hub is in Belgrade’s iconic pedestrian zone, a few minutes from public transport links and the Obilićev Venac public garage (which also offers bike parking).</p>

<h2>Why Belgrade?</h2>

<p><img src="https://kagifeedback.org/assets/files/2025-11-21/1763744187-715773-knez-mih.jpg" alt="Knez Mihailova"></p>

<p>We could have put our first hub in San Francisco, Tokyo, or Berlin. We chose Belgrade on purpose.</p>

<p>Belgrade sits at the crossroads of East and West, with many short direct flights from cities like Vienna, London, Lisbon, Split, Barcelona, and Paris. It has a thriving tech and startup scene, with a growing talent pool. It’s known for its walkable neighborhoods, great party scene, and generous hospitality.</p>

<p>Above all, it’s a place where our founder and CEO, Vlad, lived and built for over 30 years before moving to the USA. It’s a place where we already have a few Kagi employees and are very eager to welcome you and show you around.</p>

<h2>See you there!</h2>

<p>Kagi Hub in Belgrade is our first experiment in bringing the Kagi movement into the physical world. If it works the way we hope, it won’t be the last. Local tech media have already welcomed Kagi Hub as part of a bigger shift: an internet that doesn’t revolve around advertising, tracking, and engagement-at-any-cost. (<a href="https://ba.bloombergadria.com/biznis/kompanije/89546/vladimir-prelovac-i-njegova-globalna-alternativa-googleu/news">Bloomberg Adria</a>, <a href="https://pcpress.rs/kagi-otvorio-svoj-prvi-evropski-hub-u-beogradu-proslavljen-pocetak-nove-tech-ere/">PC Press</a>, <a href="https://www.techzone.rs/2025/11/15/kagi-pretrazivac-interneta-opis-i-prednosti/">TechZone</a>, <a href="https://novaekonomija.rs/tech/vladimir-prelovac-covek-koji-je-odlucio-da-internet-ponovo-bude-mesto-za-ljude-a-ne-oglase#google_vignette">Nova Ekonomija</a>,<a href="https://www.pametnitelefoni.rs/aplikacije/android/kagi-hub-u-beogradu-nova-era-pretrage-interneta-stize-kod-nas_31818.html">Pametni Telefoni</a>)</p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section> <img src="https://fokus.cool/assets/window.jpg" alt="View out of the window of a bus, but the window is fogged up. Light of different colors is illuminating the window.">  <span> <time datetime="2025-11-25T00:00:00+00:00">November 25, 2025</time> </span> <p>The other day I was sitting on the doorstep of a hackerspace, eating a falafel sandwich while listening to the conversation inside. The topic shifted to the use of “AI” for everyday tasks, people casually started elaborating on how they use “chat assistants” to let them write pieces of code or annoying emails. The situation is a blueprint for many conversations I had in recent months. What followed in most of them, almost like a reflex, was a self-justification of why the way <em>they</em> use these tools is fine, while other approaches were reckless.</p> <p>I find it particularly disillusioning to realize how deep the LLM brainworm is able to eat itself even into progressive hacker circles.</p> <h2 id="the-grind">the grind</h2> <p>I encountered friends who got fully sucked into the belly of the <em>vibecoding grind</em>. Proficient, talented coders who seem to experience some sort of existential crisis. Staring at the screen in disbelief, unable to let go of Cursor, or whatever tool is <em>the shit</em> right now. Soaking in an unconscious state of harmful coping. Seeing that felt terrifyingly close to witnessing a friend developing a drinking problem.</p> <p>And yeah, I get it. We programmers are currently living through the devaluation of our craft, in a way and rate we never anticipated possible. A fate that designers, writers, translators, tailors or book-binders lived through before us. Not that their craft would die out, but it would be mutilated — condemned to the grueling task of cleaning up what the machines messed up. Unsurprisingly, some of us are not handling the new realities well.</p> <p><img src="https://fokus.cool/assets/wet_floor.jpg" alt="A wet floor sign lying in a puddle on a brick floor"></p> <h2 id="new-realities">new realities</h2> <p>I personally don’t touch LLMs with a stick. I don’t let them near my brain. Many of my friends share that sentiment.</p> <p>But I think it’s important to acknowledge that we’re in a priviliged situation to be able to do so. People are forced to use these systems — by UI patterns, bosses expectations, knowledge polution making it increasingly hard to learn things, or just peer pressure. The world adapts to these technologies, and not using them can be a substantial disadvantage in school, university, or anywhere.</p> <p>A lot of the public debate about AI focuses on the quality of its output. Calling out biases, bullshit marketing pledges, making fun of the fascinating ways in which they fail, and so on. Of course, the practical issues are important to discuss, but we shouldn’t lean too much on that aspect in our philosophy and activisim, or we risk missing the actual agenda of AI.</p> <p><strong>No matter how well “AI” works, it has some deeply fundamental problems, that won’t go away with technical progress.</strong> I’d even go as far and say they are intentional.</p> <h2 id="on-control">on control</h2> <p>Our ability to use tools is an integral part of the human experience. They allow us to do things that we otherwise couldn’t do. They shape how we think, and consequently who we are.</p> <p>When we use a tool, it becomes part of us<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. That’s not just the case for hammers, pens, or cars, but also for a notebook used to organize thoughts. It becomes part of our cognitive process. Computer are not different. While I’m typing this text, my fingers are flying over the keyboard, switching windows, opening notes, looking up words in a dictionary. All while I’m fully focused on the meta-task of getting my thoughts out, unaware of all the tiny miracles happening.</p> <p>Our minds are susceptible to outside cues. When we read news articles we tend to believe what seems plausible. When we review code we generally expect it to behave the way it looks, even when we don’t have the context to assess that. The same is true for text: When we let a model transform notes into a blog post, a lot of context and nuance is added. We read it and believe the output to be what we thought. It’s subtle.</p> <blockquote> <p>on a deeper level, writing is more than just the process by which you obtain a piece of text, right? it’s also about finding out what you wanted to say in the first place, and how you wanted to say it. this post existed in my head first as a thought, then it started to gel into words, and then i tried pulling those words out to arrange them in a way that (hopefully) gets my point across. there is nothing extra there, no filler. i alone can get the thought out and writing is how i do that.</p> </blockquote> <p>Excerpt of a <a href="https://mystical.garden/@thekla/114947873647511129">post by @thekla@mystical.garden</a></p> <h2 id="on-power">on power</h2> <p>In a world where fascists redefine truth, where surveillance capitalist companies, more powerful than democratically elected leaders, exert control over our desires, do we really want their machines to become part of our thought process? To share our most intimate thoughts and connections with them?</p> <p>AI systems exist to reinforce and strengthen existing structures of power and violence. They are the wet dream of capitalists and fascists. Enormous physical infrastructure designed to convert capital into power, and back into capital. Those who control the infrastructure, control the people subject to it.</p> <p>AI systems being egregiously resource intensive is not a side effect — <strong>it’s the point.</strong></p> <p>Craft, expression and skilled labor is what produces value, and that gives us control over ourselves. In order to further centralize power, craft and expression need to be destroyed<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.

What we’re dealing with here are not questions about AI, but about survival under metastatic capitalism. Shit’s dire, but there are things we can do.

        <p>
            The newly described microbe represents a world of parasitic, intercellular biodiversity only beginning to be revealed by genome sequencing.        </p>
        
    </div><div>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Life’s fundamental structure is the cell, and so the main things that a cell does — processing biomolecules, growing, replicating its genetic material and producing a new body — are considered hallmarks of life. But earlier this year, scientists discovered a cell so severely stripped of essential functions that it challenges biologists’ definitions of what counts as a living thing.</p>
<p>The species is a single-celled organism known only by the mysterious sequence of its genetic code. Its genome is fantastically small: Along the organism’s evolutionary journey, it seems to have gotten rid of most of it. According to the shocked researchers who <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.05.02.651781">published the discovery</a> in a preprint uploaded to&nbsp;biorxiv.org in May, the lost genes include those central to cell metabolism, meaning it can neither process nutrients nor grow on its own.</p>
<p>Other cells with highly reduced genomes still encode proteins to create amino acids, break down carbohydrates for energy or synthesize vitamins. All this appears to be absent from the cell, which seems to be a parasite entirely dependent on a host or cellular community to meet its nutritional needs. Until now, these genetic pathways were considered fundamental for the survival of any cell.</p>
<p>The organism’s “replicative core” — the genetic components needed to reproduce itself — remains, making up more than half of its genome.</p>
<p>“Metabolism is one of the key components of how we often define life,” said <a href="https://www.u.tsukuba.ac.jp/~nakayama.takuro.gb/index.html">Takuro Nakayama</a>, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Tsukuba in Japan who led the team. The cell’s discovery “challenges this by suggesting a cell can exist almost entirely without its own. It demonstrates that the diversity of cellular life is far greater than we knew and that organisms do not always follow our definitions.”</p>
<p>While this form of life is new to science, it’s possible that organisms like it are common. A huge proportion of microbial biodiversity may be hiding in recursive interrelationships between parasitic and host microbes, said <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/news/puri-lopez-garcia-naturalist-microbial-world-search-lifes-origins">Puri López-García</a>, a microbial ecologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research in Paris who was not involved in the study.</p>
</div>
    </div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>“The diversity of archaea and bacteria that appear to belong to these supergroups of parasitic organisms is very, very large,” she said. For bacteria, it may be between 25% and 50% of the group’s total share of species, she suggested.</p>
<p>The discovery pushes the boundaries of our knowledge of just how small and simple cellular life can become, as it evolves even into forms that are barely alive.</p>
<h2><strong>An Extraordinary Discovery</strong></h2>
<p>Nakayama has built a scientific career out of looking more closely than other researchers typically do. He considers an already tiny cell and wonders: Are there even smaller cells that make a home there?</p>
<p>“The difference [in size between parasitic and host cells] can sometimes be like that between a human and Godzilla,” Nakayama said. He is fascinated by the potentially vast amount of undiscovered biodiversity these relationships might contain, and his lab looks for such relationships in seawater. The ocean is a nutrient-poor environment that incentivizes cells to form <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-ocean-teems-with-networks-of-interconnected-bacteria-20250106/">trading partnerships</a>. Sometimes they <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/microbes-also-change-the-climate-could-that-help-us-20250915/#microbiome">float along together</a>, loosely tethered, exchanging rare nutrients and energy. Other times their arrangements are more organized.</p>

<p><em>Citharistes regius</em> is a globally widespread single-celled dinoflagellate that has a walled, pouchlike external chamber for housing symbiotic cyanobacteria. Nakayama and his team searched for the alga by scooping seawater samples from the Pacific Ocean using a fine-mesh net. A common technique is to sequence whatever DNA can be found in the soup of such a sample, an approach called metagenomics.</p>
<p>“That method is incredibly powerful for capturing a broad overview,” Nakayama said. “However, with such data, it is often difficult to maintain the link between a sequence and the specific cell it came from, and rare organisms can be easily missed.” His team’s more targeted approach involves microscopically identifying and physically isolating a single target cell from that mixed sample.</p>
<p>Back on shore in the Tsukuba lab, after the researchers confirmed they had <em>C. regius</em>, they sequenced every genome associated with that one cell. As expected, they found DNA from its symbiotic cyanobacteria, but they found something else, too: sequences that belong to an archaeon, a member of the domain of life thought to have given rise to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/meet-the-eukaryote-the-first-cell-to-get-organized-20241028/">eukaryotes</a> like us.</p>

<p>At first, Nakayama and his colleagues thought they had made a mistake. The archaeal genome is tiny: just 238,000 base pairs end to end. In comparison, humans have a few billion base pairs, and even <em>E. coli</em> bacteria work with several million. (<em>C. regius</em>’ symbiotic cyanobacteria have 1.9 million base pairs.) Previously, the smallest known archaeal genome was the one belonging to <em>Nanoarchaeum equitans —</em> at 490,000 base pairs, it is more than twice as long as the new one the researchers found. They initially figured that this tiny genome — too large to be merely statistical noise — was an abbreviated piece of a much larger genome, erroneously compiled by their software.</p>
<p>“At first, we suspected it might be an artifact of the genome-assembly process,” Nakayama recalled. To check, the team sequenced the genome using different technologies and ran the data through multiple computer programs that assemble fragments of DNA sequences into a full genome. The various approaches all reconstructed the exact same 238,000-base-pair circular genome. “This consistency is what convinced us it was the real, complete genome,” he said.</p>
<p>This meant that Nakayama and his team had a new organism on their hands. They named the microbe <em>Candidatus</em> Sukunaarchaeum mirabile (hereafter referred to as Sukunaarchaeum) for its remarkably tiny genome — after Sukuna-biko-na, a Shinto deity notable for his short stature, plus a Latin word for “extraordinary.”</p>
<h2><strong>The Spectrum of Quasi-Life</strong></h2>
<p>When the team consulted databases of known genes to analyze the archaeon, they found its small size was the result of a whole lot that was missing.</p>
<p>Sukunaarchaeum encodes the barest minimum of proteins for its own replication, and that’s about all. Most strangely, its genome is missing any hints of the genes required to process and build molecules, outside of those needed to reproduce. Lacking those metabolic components, the organism must outsource the processes for growth and maintenance to another cell, a host upon which the microbe is entirely dependent.</p>
    
    
    
    
<p>Other symbiotic microbes have scrapped much of their genomes, including Sukunaarchaeum’s evolutionary relatives. The researchers’ analysis suggested that the microbe is part of the DPANN archaea, sometimes called nanoarchaea or ultra-small archaea, which are characterized by small size and small genomes. DPANN archaea are generally thought to be symbiotes that cling to the outside of larger prokaryotic microbes, and plenty of them have substantially reduced genomes to match that lifestyle. But until now, none of the DPANN species had genomes quite this pared back. And Sukunaarchaeum branched off the DPANN lineage early, suggesting that it had taken its own evolutionary journey.</p>
<p>“This realm of the archaea is pretty mysterious in general,” said <a href="https://marinescience.utexas.edu/directory/brett-baker">Brett Baker</a>, a microbial ecologist at the University of Texas, Austin who was not involved in the work. “[DPANN archaea are] obviously limited in their metabolic capabilities.”</p>
<p>While Sukunaarchaeum&nbsp;may provide some undetermined benefit for its host — which could be <em>C. regius</em>, the symbiotic cyanobacteria or another cell entirely — it’s probably a self-absorbed parasite. “Its genome reduction is driven by entirely selfish motives, consistent with a parasitic lifestyle,” said <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/timothy-williams">Tim Williams</a>, a microbiologist at the University of Technology Sydney who was not involved in the study. It cannot contribute metabolic products, so the relationship between&nbsp;Sukunaarchaeum&nbsp;and any other cell would likely be a one-way street.</p>
<p>Other microbes have evolved similarly extreme, streamlined forms. For instance, the bacterium <em>Carsonella ruddii</em>, which lives as a symbiont within the guts of sap-feeding insects, has an even smaller genome than Sukunaarchaeum, at around 159,000 base pairs. However, these and other super-small bacteria have metabolic genes to produce nutrients, such as amino acids and vitamins, for their hosts. Instead, their genome has cast off much of their ability to reproduce on their own.</p>
<p>“They are on the way to becoming organelles. This is the way mitochondria and chloroplasts are thought to have evolved,” Williams said. “But Sukunaarchaeum has gone in the opposite direction: The genome retains genes required for its own propagation, but lost most, if not all, of its metabolic genes.”</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Soon after Nakayama’s team posted their results online, they got a big response. “When we saw the preprint, this was really quite exciting in the lab,” said <a href="https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/thijs-ettema-1.htm">Thijs Ettema</a>, an evolutionary microbiologist and expert on archaeal genomics at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands, who was not involved in the work. “These types of organisms [with reduced genomes] have been found before, but not as extreme as this.”</p>
<p>Some news reports went so far as to imply that Sukunaarchaeum is on its way to <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/microbe-bizarrely-tiny-genome-may-be-evolving-virus">evolving into a virus</a>. However, while both Sukunaarchaeum and viruses are reliant on a host cell for very basic biological functions, viruses can’t reproduce on their own.</p>
<p>“There is a fundamental gap between Sukunaarchaeum and viruses,” Nakayama said. “Sukunaarchaeum retains its own core machinery for gene expression, including ribosomes, albeit in a simplified form. This is in stark contrast to viruses, which lack ribosomes and must hijack the host’s cellular systems to replicate.”</p>
</div><div data-role="selectable">
    <p>The findings fit into a larger discussion about how we define life, Ettema said, since nature routinely evolves exceptions that defy simple categorization. “Most likely it cannot live independently,” he said. “You could say the same of bacterial symbionts. And what do we call organelles like mitochondria and plastids? … At what point should we call things alive?”</p>
<h2><strong>A Minimalist Lifestyle</strong></h2>
<p>Many questions about Sukunaarchaeum remain unresolved. For one, a large portion of its genome is made up of genes that don’t match any known sequences. They seem to encode large proteins, which is uncommon in such radically reduced organisms.</p>
<p>Nakayama and his colleagues think these large proteins are employed on the cell membrane and somehow support interactions between the archaeon and its host. That would fit with the lifestyles of other studied DPANN archaea as well, Ettema said, which are generally thought to be ectosymbionts, adhering to the outside of comparatively immense hosts.</p>
<p>Although Sukunaarchaeum was found in association with the dinoflagellate <em>C. regius</em>, its true host’s identity is unknown. <em>C. regius</em> is a eukaryote, but DPANN archaea generally associate with other archaea. Also up for debate: Is it attaching to the outside of a host cell, like other DPANN archaea, or is it living internally —&nbsp;or both? Answering these questions would require setting human eyes on the archaeon for the first time; at this point it’s only known from a curious string of genetic data.</p>
        
        
<p>There is also a slim possibility that these genes are the “lost” metabolic genes after all, López-García said, if they have evolved so far from their original sequences as to be unrecognizable. “Because the genome is so fast-evolving, maybe some of these functions correspond to metabolic functions, but the divergence is so much that we cannot identify the [gene] homologue [in the database],” she said.</p>
<p>Even stranger minimalist lifestyles or more reduced genomes may be out there, but researchers may miss them, Ettema said. Traditional analytical approaches for surveying the genomes of microbial samples could flag their tiny genomes as incomplete or low quality and discard them, or skip them entirely, he said. “[The DNA] might have been present in the samples, but it was removed after sequencing, and hence overlooked.”</p>
<p>When Nakayama and his colleagues searched a database of marine environmental sequence data from the world’s oceans to see if the new microbe popped up anywhere else, they didn’t find any matches. But they did detect many very similar sequences from what are likely to be close relatives. Sukunaarchaeum may be the tip of a very large microbial iceberg, one floating in a vast ocean of microbial diversity: tiny microbes clinging to slightly less tiny microbes, perhaps inside other microbes, the stories of their ancient relationships only beginning to be revealed.</p>

<h3>Our Case<a href="https://timothyfraser.com/sigma/statistical-process-control-in-python.html#our-case-1" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>

<p>For today’s workshop, we’re going to think about why quality control matters in a local economy, by examining the case of the Japanese Hot Springs bath economy! Hot springs, or <em>onsen</em>, are <a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/07/japanese-hot-spring-tourism-at-a-crossroads/">a major source of tourism and recreation for families in Japan</a>, bringing residents from across the country every year to often rural communities where the right geological conditions have brought on naturally occurring hot springs. Restaurants, taxi and bus companies, and many service sector firms rely on their local onsen to bring in a steady stream (pun intended) of tourists to the local economy. So, it’s often in the best interest of <em>onsen</em> operators to keep an eye on the temperature, minerals, or other aspects of their hot springs baths to ensure quality control, to keep up their firm (and town’s!) reputation for quality rest and relaxation!</p>
<p><em>Onsen</em>-goers often seek out <em>specific</em> types of hot springs, so it’s important for an <em>onsen</em> to actually provide what it advertises! <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2012.06.020">Serbulea and Payyappallimana (2012)</a> describe some of these benchmarks.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Temperature</strong>: Onsen are divided into “Extra Hot Springs” (<code>&gt;42°C</code>), “Hot Springs” (<code>41~34°C</code>), and “Warm Springs” (<code>33~25°C</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>pH</strong>: Onsen are classified into “Acidic” (<code>pH &lt; 3</code>), “Mildly Acidic” (<code>pH 3~6</code>), “Neutral” (<code>pH 6~7.5</code>), “Mildly alkaline” (<code>pH 7.5~8.5</code>), and “Alkaline” (<code>pH &gt; 8.5</code>).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Sulfur</strong>: Sulfur <em>onsen</em> typically have about 2mg of sulfur per 1kg of hot spring water; sulfur levels <em>must</em> exceed 1 mg to count as a Sulfur <em>onsen.</em> (It smells like rotten eggs!)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are decent examples of quality control metrics that <em>onsen</em> operators might want to keep tabs on!</p>

Every month, for 15 months, you systematically took 20 random samples of hot spring water and recorded its <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>pH</strong>, and <strong>sulfur</strong> levels. How might you determine if this <em>onsen</em> is at risk of slipping out of one sector of the market (eg. Extra Hot!) and into another (just normal Hot Springs?).</p>

<p>In SPC, we often work with <em>subgroups</em> - small samples taken at regular intervals. This allows us to distinguish between common cause variation (inherent to the process) and special cause variation (due to specific events). Let’s calculate statistics for each subgroup to see how the process behaves over time.</p>

<p>“I was really influenced by three films,” Ridley Scott told Fantastic Films in 1979, on the subject of the Nostromo and its&nbsp;claustrophobic&nbsp;corridors. “Not so much in terms of <em>Star Wars</em>, but definitely from <em>2001</em> and <em>Dark Star</em>.” The latter film, directed by a young John Carpenter and written by, and starring, <em>Alien</em> writer Dan O’Bannon, was an inverse,&nbsp;comedic&nbsp;take on <em>2001</em> – where Kubrick’s film was cold, sterile, clinical, and philosophical in scope,&nbsp;<em>Dark Star</em> was cramped, crowded, shabby, dirty, irreverent and yet also elegiac. “There was a great sense of reality, oddly enough, in <em>Dark Star</em>,” continued Scott, “especially of seedy living. It showed you can get grotty even in the Hilton Hotel if you don’t clean it. Everything starts to get tacky, even in the most streamlined surfaces.”</p>
<p>“When we did <em>Dark Star</em>,” said O’Bannon, “which was in the wake of <em>2001</em>, we thought we wanted -partly for the novelty, partly because it was realer, mostly just for laughs- we wanted to show this once-sterile spaceship in a rundown condition, like some old bachelor apartment.” For O’Bannon, <em>Dark Star</em>‘s ‘used universe’ was not as strong a visual element as he had hoped, and <em>Star Wars’</em>&nbsp;“didn’t come across all that clearly either.” For <em>Alien</em>, O’Bannon instructed Ridley Scott that “if we want this spacecraft to look industrial [and] beat-up, you’re gonna have to make it about three times messier to the naked eye than you wanna to see it. And <em>Alien</em> probably was the first time where an audience clearly saw a futuristic machine in a run-down condition.”</p>
<p>The design of the Nostromo and the ‘used universe’ aesthetic would be drawn from&nbsp;O’Bannon’s earlier sci-fi effort, coupled with the realism of Kubrick’s Discovery One. “It’s futuristic,” Scott said of Kubrick’s approach to <em>2001</em>, “but it’s still hung on today’s reality … In two hundred years things won’t change that much, you know. People will still be scruffy or clean. They’ll still clean their teeth three times a day.” Though&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;itself utilised a used universe (or, as Akira Kurosawa called it, a “maculate reality”), Scott wanted to create a tangible reality opposed to&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>‘ fantasy-hinged settings and ships. “I wanted to do the truck driver version, the hard-nosed version,” said Scott. “It was supposed to be the anti-thesis of&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>. The reality, the beauty of something absolutely about function.”</p>
<p>Before Scott came onto the project as director, writer Dan O’Bannon&nbsp;commissioned&nbsp;his friend and <em>Dark Star</em> spaceship designer Ron Cobb to draw what his script was then calling the ‘deep space commercial vessel Snark’ – a nod to Lewis Carroll’s <em>The Hunting of the Snark</em>. O’Bannon had promised Cobb a job on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s <em>Dune</em>, but when that film dissolved Cobb, who had terminated the lease on his home and prepared to move to Paris with his wife, was left standing empty-handed. To make up for the letdown, O’Bannon immediately hired Cobb for <em>Alien,</em> which allowed the artist to bounce back from a slump. “He was paid about $400 a week,” Cobb’s wife, Robin Love, told the LA Times in 1988. “We thought it was wonderful!”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>When Dan met Ron</strong>: “I&nbsp;was working on my first sci-fi film, John Carpenter’s&nbsp;<em>Electric Dutchman</em>, which would ultimately metastastize into the feature-length&nbsp;<em>Dark Star</em>. I tried to reach Cobb to get him to design the whole film, but he was unreachable. For weeks his phone rang without an answer, and then it was disconnected, and then I got his new unlisted number but it was invariably answered by one of the girls who were living with him, who always told me he was out. It was impossible. It took another year and a half to track him down and get him to agree to design us a nice, simple little spaceship for our simple little movie.&nbsp;Finally, one night about ten pm, Carpenter and I drove over to Westwood and rousted him out of a sound sleep. He was hung over from an LSD trip and I felt kind of guilty, but I had to have those designs. We took him over to an all-night coffee shop and fed him and got him half-way awake, and then he brought out this pad of yellow graph paper on which he had sketched a 3-view plan of our spaceship. It was wonderful! A little surfboard-shaped starcruiser with a flat bottom for atmospheric landings. Very technological looking. Very high class stuff.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“The first person I hired on&nbsp;<em>Alien</em>, the first person to draw money, was Cobb,” O’Bannon said. “He started turning out renderings, large full-colour paintings, while Shusett and I were still struggling with the script – the corrosive blood of the Alien was Cobb’s idea. It was an intensely creative period – the economic desperation, the all-night sessions, the rushing over to Cobb’s apartment to see the latest painting-in-progress and give him the latest pages.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I just sat down and started blocking out a ship – which I love to do. Anyway, Dan’s original script called for a small, modest little ship with a small crew. They land on a small planet. They go down a small pyramid and shake up a medium-sized creature. That’s about it. He meant it to be a low budget film, like&nbsp;<em>Dark Star</em>, and I loved the idea. So I did a few paintings and Dan scurried off with them and a script.”<br>
~ Ron Cobb</p></blockquote>
<p>“And he was doing some incredible stuff,” continued O’Bannon. “Wow! I was really happy during this period, seeing the movie appear under Cobb’s fingers. Of course, we usually had to go over and sit on his back to get him to do any work -otherwise he would just party on with his friends- but how beautiful were the results.”</p>

<p>Coupled with Cobb was English artist, Chris Foss, who O’Bannon had come to know during their tenure together on Alejandro Jodorowsky’s <em>Dune</em>. “Alejandro wanted Doug Trumble to do the special effects [for <em>Dune</em>],” Foss told MTV in 2011, “and of course, Trumble was a big important American, and certainly wouldn’t succumb to Alejandro’s manipulation. So he picked up this gauche American film student, Dan O’Bannon. He was quite hilarious, he said to me once, ‘Hey, these streets are so goddamn small.’ This is Paris, which had some of the widest streets in Europe. Of course, it was only when I got to Los Angeles that I saw what he meant.”</p>
<p>Though <em>Dune</em> would never come to fruition under Jodorowsky, the experience in France influenced O’Bannon’s&nbsp;approach&nbsp;to designing <em>Alien</em>. Jodorowsky had gathered together Chris Foss, Jean ‘Moebius’ Giraud, and HR Giger to design his film, and the eclectic team would be later reunited by O’Bannon to design his grungy sci-fi horror movie. “Dan said [to Twentieth Century Fox], ‘Hey, we’ve got to get this guy Chris Foss over here.’ So off I went to Los Angeles …</p>

<p>The early stages of designing <em>Alien</em> were done in an almost ramshackle, low-fi manner. “We were put through shed after shed after shed,” said Foss of the times, “and they were going through director after director after director.” Ron Cobb told Den of Geek: “I soon found myself hidden away at Fox Studios in an old rehearsal hall above an even older sound stage with Chris Foss and O’Bannon, trying to visualize <em>Alien</em>. For up to five months Chris and I (with Dan supervising) turned out a large amount of artwork, while the producers, Gordon Carroll, Walter Hill and David Giler, looked for a director.”</p>
<p>Foss was largely critical of Brandywine’s apparently disinterested approach to setting up the embryonic film. “Walter Hill was very busy smashing cars up for one of his ‘streets’ films,” he told Den of Geek. “He couldn’t be arsed – much too busy! He walked in after months of work and just said, ‘Yep, roomful of spaceships’ and just walked out again.”</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Ron Cobb, Steven Speilberg, and aliens:</strong>&nbsp;Cobb told bttf.com: “I first met Speilberg when I was working on&nbsp;<em>Alien</em>, at one point Speilberg was considered as a possible director for the original&nbsp;<em>Alien</em>. It was just a brief thing, he could never work out his schedule to do it, but he was interested.” Later, one of Cobb’s early story pitches to Speilberg, an alien horror tale called&nbsp;<em>Night Skies</em>, eventually became 1982’s&nbsp;<em>E.T.&nbsp;</em>Though Cobb&nbsp;cameo’d&nbsp;as one of <em>E.T</em>.’s doctors (“I got to carry the little critter,”) he wasn’t pleased with the family-friendly direction that the film took from his initial idea:&nbsp;“A banal retelling of the Christ story,” he told the LA Times. “Sentimental and self-indulgent, a pathetic lost-puppy kind of story.” Luckily for the artist, a clause in his contract for <em>E.T</em>. (he was&nbsp;originally&nbsp;to direct before the story took a turn) detailed that he was to earn 1% of the net profit. His first cheque amounted to $400,000. Cobb’s wife quipped: “friends from Australia always ask, ‘What did you do on <em>E.T</em>.?’ And Ron says, ‘I didn’t direct it.'”</p></blockquote>
<p>When Ridley Scott took over the directorial duties, Cobb and Foss were shipped to England to continue their work. Around this point in time, HR Giger was drawing up the film’s alien, and Moebius was&nbsp;commissioned&nbsp;by Scott to design the film’s space suits, which would be brought into reality by John Mollo. The Snark went through a variety of designs, from a ship embedded in the rock of an asteroid, to an upended pyramidal design, to a hammerhead shape and other varieties of ship with white or yellow or more kaleidoscopic paint-jobs.</p>

<p>After many months of scribbling and painting spaceships, the production was no closer to settling what the vessel would actually look like. Due to script rewrites, it also changed names, from Snark to&nbsp;Leviathan before the name Nostromo was settled on. “I called the ship Nostromo from [Joseph] Conrad,” Walter Hill told Film International in 2004, “[For] no particular metaphoric idea, I just thought it sounded good.”</p>
<p>However, indecision was still rife on the actual look of the thing.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Scott on O’Bannon</strong>: “He’s great. A really sweet guy. And, I was soon to realise, a real science-fiction freak … &nbsp;He brought in a book by the Swiss artist HR Giger. It’s called Necronomicon … I thought, ‘If we can build that [<em>Necronom IV</em>], that’s it.’ I was stunned, really. I flipped. Literally flipped. And O’Bannon lit up like a lightbulb, shining like a quartz iodine. I realised I was dealing with a real SF freak, which I’d never come across before. I thought, ‘My god, I have an egg-head here for this field.'”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Scott on Cobb:</strong> “O’Bannon introduced me to Ron Cobb, a brilliant visualiser of the genre, with whom he’d worked on <em>Dark Star</em>. Cobb seemed to have very realistic visions of both the far and near future, so I quickly decided that he would take a very important part in the making of the film.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>Cobb on Foss</strong>: “Creating spacecraft exteriors came easily to Foss. His mind and imagination seemed to embody the entire history of the industrial revolution. He could conjure up endless spacecraft designs suggesting submarines, diesel locomotives, Mayan interceptors, Mississippi river boats, jumbo space arks, but best of all (ask Dan) were his trademark aero-spacecraft-textures like panels, cowlings, antennae, bulging fuel tanks, vents, graphics etc. As the months passed, along with two or three temporary directors, Chris began to have problems caused by his spectacular creativity. No one in a position to make a decision seemed to be able to make up their mind and/or choose one of his designs. I think Chris was turning out spacecraft designs the decision makers found too original.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Ridley himself had input on the design: “I was looking for something like <em>2001</em>, not the fantasy of <em>Star Wars</em>. I wanted a slow moving, massive piece of steel which was moving along in dead, deep silence … The concept was to have the hull covered with space barnacles or something. I was unable to communicate that idea, and I finally had to go down there and fiddle with the experts. We gradually arrived at a solution.”</p>
<p>Foss paints a more hectic process. “Finally what happened was that the bloke who had to make the [Nostromo] model completely lost his rag, scooped up a load of paper -they had a room full of smashed-up bits of helicopter and all-sorts- and he just bodged something together. So the actual spaceship in the film hadn’t anything to do with all the days, weeks, <em>months </em>of work that we’d all done. It’s as simple as that.”</p>
<p>Cobb explained:&nbsp;“Brian Johnson, the special effects supervisor under pressure to build the large Nostromo model, went into the deserted art department and, out of frustration, grabbed all the Chris Foss designs off the wall and took them to Bray studios. There he would choose the design himself in order to have enough time to build the damn thing.”</p>
<p>However, Johnson had also scooped up Cobb’s art, and though Cobb was concentrating on the designs of the ship’s interior, one of his exterior pieces met with approval over Foss’ designs. “Well I soon found out that Brian found and took all of my exterior design sketches as well,” said Cobb. “About a month later I was told that Brian had used my sketch, ‘Nostromo A’, as the basis for the model, even to the extent that it was painted yellow. Ridley found the colour a bit garish and had it repainted grey.”</p>

<p>“Ridley had his own very firm ideas about what he physically wanted to do,” Foss said of the process, “and he almost studiously ignored everything that had gone before … I kind of got the impression that Ridley was quietly going his own way, trying to get on with it and get it done, a bit like just another job. I’ve just got dim memories of Ridley being like that and really just ignoring months of input …&nbsp;I just have these memories of feeling a bit miffed that things weren’t put together so much better. And poor old Dan O’Bannon, the bloke whose <em>concept </em>it was, just got absolutely shafted. He was almost like patted on the head: ‘Yeah Dan, yeah Dan, that’s cool.'”</p>
<p>Cobb’s&nbsp;sketches, drawings and paintings for the interiors were also okay’ed by Scott and the production. At first Cobb’s designs were slightly more fantastical, with giant screens and computer readouts and windows covered by protective shells that would open up to reveal alien planets ahead of the ship. Though these ideas were scuppered due to time, money, and logistics, many of Cobb’s&nbsp;early&nbsp;designs and ideas were revisited in <em>Prometheus</em>.</p>

<p>In addition to designing the Nostromo’s exterior, its bridge and auto-doc, Cobb also designed the ship’s airlocks, cyro-tubes, corridors, bulkheads, an observation dome (not built), Ash’s ‘blister’ observation unit, some of the film’s uniform patches and ship signage, the ‘flying bedstead’&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;vehicle (not built), and even Jones’ cat-box. Cobb told Den of Geek that, “My problem with designing Nostromo’s interiors, the control bridge, corridors, auto doc (or med lab), bulkhead doors, the food deck, etc., was that I grew up with a deep fascination for astronomy, astrophysics, and most of all, aerospace flight. My design approach has always been that of a frustrated engineer (as well as a frustrated writer when it came to cinema design). I tend to subscribe to the idea that form follows function. If I’m to arrive at a cinematic spacecraft design that seamlessly preserves, as in this case, the drama of the script, the audience has to experience it as something impressive and believable.”</p>
<p>“We’re beyond <em>2001</em> in terms of scientific advances,” said Scott of <em>Alien</em>‘s futurism, “our capabilities are more&nbsp;sophisticated&nbsp; but our ship’s still NASA-orientated, still Earth-manufactured … in our tongue-in-cheek fantasy we project a not-too-distant future in which there are many vehicles tramping around the universe on mining expeditions, erecting military installations, or whatever. At the culmination of many long voyages, each covering many years, these ships -no doubt part of armadas owned by private corporations- look used, beat-up, covered with graffiti, and uncomfortable. We certainly didn’t design the Nostromo to look like a hotel.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I didn’t want a conventional shape [for the refinery,] so I drew up a sketch and handed it to the model makers. They refined it, as it were, and built the model. I originally drew it upside-down, with the vague idea that it would resemble a floating inverted cathedral … I think that the machine that they’re on could in fact be 60 years old and just added to over the decades. The metal-work on it could be 50 years old … I would have liked to see it covered with space barnacles or space seaweed, all clogged and choked up, but that was illogical as well.”<br>
~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Nostromo model was built under the supervision of Nick Allder and Brian Johnson at Bray Studios, not far from Pinewood, where the live-action scenes were being filmed in parallel with the model shots at Bray. For the refinery, Scott instructed the teams at Bray to make it appear “Victorian Gothic,” with towers and spires and&nbsp;antennae. Bray shop worker Dennis Lowe explained: “At that same time in the workshop Ridley was talking about his first concept of the refinery and he was describing an actual oil refinery with pipes and spires, eventually the term ‘Battleship Bismarck in space’ came up to describe the detailing of the model.”</p>

<p>When Ridley arrived after concluding filming at Pinewood, he further revised the ship’s look, removing many of the spires from the refinery, repainting the Nostromo from yellow to grey, and scrapping every piece of footage shot to date, taking it upon himself to re-direct the scenes. “It was a difficult situation,” said Scott, “Brian Johnson was over there [at Bray], working out of context away from the main unit. I could only look at the rushes while I was working with the actors, and that’s not a very satisfactory way of working. In the end, I think a director must be heavily involved with the miniatures, and that’s why I shot them myself.”</p>
<p>According to model builder Jon Sorensen, there were no real hard feelings over the redesigns and reshoots. “Ridley Scott then arrived from Shepperton to take an interest in the models and everything changed radically in terms of tone, colour and look. The yellow was sprayed over a uniform grey. Sections were rebuilt. We started over, discarding all previous footage. There was no anger at this. Surprise maybe. But it was Ridley Scott’s film. We liked him. So we entered the <em>Alien</em> model shoot Part Deux. I recall Bill Pearson and I talking once on what we thought was an empty, lunch-time model stage when a voice spoke from the shadows. Ridley, asking what we were discussing. We answered that maybe that part might look better moved over to there, (we were discussing the refinery). He smiled back and I guess that signalled what was true; we’d go all the way to help him. That night he bought both Bill and I a beer, a move which astonished the Assistant Director, Ray Beckett who complained that in 10 years of working with Ridley, he’d never been bought a beer. So we bought Ray one instead.”</p>

<p>The Nostromo interiors were overseen by art director Roger Christian, who had helped craft the sets for <em>Star Wars</em>. Christian told Shadowlocked.com: “I art-directed&nbsp;<i>Alien</i>&nbsp;for Ridley Scott with my team because he was struggling to get the designer and the art department to understand ‘that look’ I created with the dressing on&nbsp;<i>Star Wars …</i>&nbsp;I went into Shepperton, and we built and dressed the first corridor section – actually for a test screen for Sigourney Weaver, who the studios were not sure about. I brought my little team of prop guys who’d understood then the process of what to strip down and how to place it. Because it was not something you just do randomly. It had to be done based on a kind of knowledge.”</p>
<p>“Roger is a brilliant set dresser,” Scott told Fantastic Films. “Though his department was not designing the corridors and sets, their ‘cladding’ of the walls made everything look absolutely real. He would go out with his buyers and prop men and visit aircraft dumps or army surplus stores and drag masses of things in for me to see.”</p>
<p>“With&nbsp;<i>Alien</i>&nbsp;I was able to go much further with the oily and gritty look than in&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>,” said Roger Christian, “and for the first time create a totally believable ‘space truck’, as Ridley described it. The set ended up looking as if we had rented a well-travelled, well-used, oily, dirty, mineral carrier – an unmistakably real and claustrophobic space vessel. I think this really helped audiences to identify with the movie, as the characters were so like space truckers, trapped in a claustrophobic nightmare.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“[The Nostromo’s] like the bloody Queen Mary. Do you get a sense of scale in the interior? That it’s big? We couldn’t build the two to three-hundred foot-long corridors which it would have but it’s supposed to be like one of these huge Japanese super-tankers. Three quarters of a mile long. The refinery behind it god-knows how big. I mean… I dunno. A mile square?”<br>
~ Ridley Scott, Fantastic Films, 1979.</p></blockquote>
<p>“Ridley saw the ship very much as a metaphor for a Gothic castle,” said Ron Cobb on the subject of the ship’s interiors, “or a WWII submarine … a kind of retro, accessible technology with great big transistors and very low-res video screens.” However, at one point, Scott had other ideas for the Nostromo’s technology:&nbsp;“I wanted to have wafer-thin screens that are plexiglas, that just float on clips -and of course today you’ve got computer screens exactly like that- because I figured that’s where it [technology] would go. I really got those things off Jean Giraud, Moebius, when he’d been drawing and speculating. A lot of his stuff you see thirty years ago is now.”</p>
<p>Cobb acknowledged the&nbsp;Moebius&nbsp;influence, as well as the ship’s other, perhaps subtler, inspirations: “The ship is a strange mixture of retrofitted old technology, a kind of industrial nightmare, like being trapped in a factory … Ridley’s a wonderful artist and he wanted it to look a lot like a Moebius-designed ship, with all kinds of rounds surfaces and with an Egyptian motif.” This Egyptian motif is prevalent in the Weylan-Yutani logo, a wings of Horus design which adorns the uniforms of the crew in addition to their coffee cups, beer cans, etc. The hypersleep chamber also evokes a burial chamber, with the cryo-chambers arranged in a lotus shape.&nbsp;In addition to the Egyptian motif, another influence was Japan. “The owners of the Nostromo are Japanese,” Scott told Fantastic Films.</p>

<p>“As I was working with the art director,” said Ridley, “I decided to make it faintly glittery. I wanted to have sort of anodized gold everywhere. Not steel, gold. Did you know that space landing craft are covered with gold foil? Amazing! So I thought, Why make this out of steel? Let’s make it all warm and oppressive, massive, and gold.'”</p>
<p>The glittery look can be seen in the opening shots of the ship’s computers bleeping into life, and the gold sheen is most prevalent in the ship’s&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;area, where Brett finds the Alien’s&nbsp;discarded&nbsp;skin moments before his death. Scott explained the design process for the ship’s golden-hued&nbsp;maintenance&nbsp;garage: “We got hold of marvelous, actual parts of actual huge jet engines and installed them, and they’re like a coppery metal with some steel. We used them as four main supports, like columns, and they give a lot of the feeling of a temple. We played the same music we used in the derelict alien craft and we had <em>two</em> temples. The idol I wanted was through these massive gold doors which were as big as a wall, with a gap in them through which the claw [landing leg] can be seen. When that set was dressed, it looked like Aladdin’s Cave … [the garage is] filled with the equipment that the crew would use in their work on and around the refinery, and when they land on various planets – land crawlers, helicopters, other flying machines.”</p>
<p>“Ridley has this lavish, sensual visual style,” summarised Dan O’Bannon to Fantastic Films in 1979, “and I think that Ridley is one of the ‘good guys.’ I really think that he was the final pivot point responsible for the picture coming out good.&nbsp; And so a lot of the visual design and a lot of the mood elements inherent in the camerawork, while they’re not what I planned, are great.&nbsp; They’re just different.”</p>
<p>O’Bannon also nodded to the contributions of Cobb, Foss, Shusett etc., to the picture: “Also, it’s not 100% Ridley either. It’s Ridley superimposing his vision over the cumulative vision of others, you see.&nbsp; Now this could be such a strong director’s picture because Ridley’s directorial and visual hand is so strong.&nbsp; There will probably be tendency among critics to refer to it as Ridley Scott’s vision of the future.&nbsp; And he did have a vision of the future.&nbsp; But it was everybody else that came before, that’s what his vision is …&nbsp;if it sounds like I’m knocking Ridley, I’m not.”</p>

					I care about academic collaboration and misconduct because it is important both that we are able to evaluate
					your own work (independent of your peer’s)
					and because not claiming others’ work as your own is an important part of integrity in your future career. I
					understand that different
					institutions and locations can have different definitions of what forms of collaborative behavior is
					considered
					acceptable. In this class,
					for written homework problems, you are welcome to discuss ideas with others, but you are expected to write up
					your own solutions
					independently (without referring to another’s solutions). For coding, you may only share the input-output behavior
					of your programs. This encourages you to work separately but share ideas
					on how to test your implementation. 
				

Please remember that if you share your solution with another student, even
					if you did not copy from
					another, you are still violating the honor code.

Consistent with this, it is also considered an honor code violation if you make your assignment solutions publicly available, such as posting them online or in a 
public git repo.


					</p><!-- In terms of the final project, you are welcome to combine this project with another class
				assuming that the project is relevant to both classes, given that you take prior permission of the class
				instructors. If your project is an extension of a previous class project, you are expected to make significant additional contributions to the
				project. -->
					<p>
					We may run similarity-detection software over all submitted student programs, including programs from
					past quarters and any
					solutions found online on public websites. Anyone violating the Stanford University
					<a href="https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/masters-handbook/honor-code">Honor Code</a> will be referred to the
					Office of Judicial Affairs.
					If you think you made a mistake (it can happen, especially under stress or when time is short!), please reach
					out to Emma or the head CA;
					the consequences will be much less severe than if we approach you.

					We expect all students to submit their own solutions to CS234 homeworks, exams and quizzes, and 
					for projects. You are permitted to use generative AI tools such as Gemini, GPT-4 and Co-Pilot 
					in the same way that human collaboration is considered acceptable: you are not allowed to directly 
					ask for solutions or copy code, and you should indicate if you have used generative AI tools. 
					Similar to human collaboration help, you are ultimately responsible and accountable for your own work.
					We may check students' homework, exams and projects to 
				enforce this policy. 
				</p><p>Note that it is not acceptable to list a LLM as a collaborator on the project 
					milestone or final report: as things stand, generative AI cannot accept 
					fault or responsibility, and thus cannot be a collaborator in a final project.

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="single-wrapper">
    
    <article data-clarity-region="article" id="post-58953">
        <div data-bi-area="body_article" data-bi-id="post_page_body_article">
            <p>After I wrote my <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/">last post</a> on how .NET builds and ships, I was cautiously optimistic that I wouldn’t be writing another one. Or at least not another one about how we build and ship. That problem was done and dusted. .NET had done it! We’d struck a balance between distributed repository development and the ability to quickly compose a product for shipping. Congratulations everyone, now the infrastructure teams could focus on other things. Security, cross-company standardization, support for building new product features. All the good stuff.</p>
<p><em>…A year and a half later…</em></p>
<p>We’re asking how much it will cost to build 3-4 major versions with a dozen .NET SDK bands between them each month. And keep their engineering systems up to date. And hey, there’s this late breaking fix we want to get into next week’s release, so can I check it in today and have the team validate tonight? It can’t be <strong>that</strong> hard, right? And I have this new cross-stack feature that I want to do some prototyping on…how can I build it?</p>
<p>The answers were mostly frustrating:</p>
<p><em>“It’ll cost a lot, and get worse over time.</em>“</p>
<p>“<em>I don’t think we have enough time for that fix, I can only guess how long the build will take, but it’s at least 36 hours before we can handoff to validation. Maybe more?</em>“</p>
<p>“<em>I’m sure we can keep that much infrastructure alive, but we’ll slowly drown under the cost of keeping it up to date.</em>“</p>
<p>“<em>How critical is it that you have a full stack to work with? It’ll take a while to set that up.</em>“</p>
<p>These are <strong>not</strong> the answers we want to be giving. And so, we went back to the drawing board, looking for solutions.</p>
<p>This blog post is about the Unified Build project: .NET’s effort to resolve many of these issues by moving product construction into a ‘virtual monolithic’ repository, consolidating the build into a series of ‘vertical builds’, while still enabling contributors to work outside the monolith. I’ll briefly tell the story of our product construction journey over the life of .NET. I’ll draw attention to the lessons we’ve learned about applying a distributed product construction model to a single product, particularly its drawbacks in overhead and complexity. Finally, I’ll dig into the details of Unified Build and its foundational technology, Linux distro Source Build. We’ll look at the new method of product construction and the results we’re seeing.</p>
<h2>How did we get here? This is not my beautiful build infrastructure</h2>
<p>.NET was born out of the closed source infrastructure of the .NET Framework and Silverlight in 2015-2016. It was made open source incrementally as we readied its components for external consumption, and as was the fashion at the time, we split it into multiple repositories. CoreCLR represented the base runtime, CoreFX the libraries, Core-Setup the packaging and installation. Along came ASP.NET Core and EntityFramework Core, and an SDK with a CLI. A few releases saw major revamps of the product in the form of shared frameworks, with WindowsDesktop joining the fold. More repositories and more complexity.</p>
<p>What is important to understand is that .NET is a product that is developed in separate inter-dependent repositories but needs to be composed together in a relatively short period of time to ship. On paper, the ‘graph’ of the product looks much like any open source ecosystem. A repository produces some software component, publishes it to public registries, and downstream consumers take a dependency on the new component, and publish their own updates. It’s a producer-consumer model where changes ripple through the ‘global’ dependency graph via a series of pull-&gt;build-&gt;publish operations. This model is highly distributed and effective, but it is not necessarily efficient in a time sense. It enables software vendors and repository owners to have significant autonomy over their process and schedules. However, attempting to apply this methodology to a product like .NET, which represents its components using separate, but inter-dependent repositories, has major drawbacks.</p>
<p>Let’s call this a “distributed product construction methodology”. To get a sense of why it can be a difficult methodology to use, let’s take a look at the process to produce a security release.</p>
<h3>Example: Security Servicing</h3>
<p>Consider shipping a security patch. A security vulnerability is discovered somewhere in the .NET Runtime libraries. Because .NET is descended from .NET Framework, let’s say this security vulnerability is also present in .NET Framework 4.7.2. It becomes absolutely vital that .NET’s security update goes out in tandem with the .NET Framework update, or one will zero-day the other. .NET has numerous Microsoft-managed release paths. Microsoft Update, our CDN, Linux and container package registries, nuget.org, Visual Studio, Azure Marketplace, and on and on. That puts some restrictions on timeline. We need to be able to be predictable.</p>
<p>.NET’s development structure looks a lot like a typical open source ecosystem. The .NET Runtime, the .NET SDK, ASP.NET Core and the WindowsDesktop shared framework are developed by different teams, though with a huge amount of cross-collaboration. They are developed, at times, like independent products. The .NET Runtime forms the base of the product. ASP.NET Core and WindowsDesktop are built on top of that. A huge quantity of the dev tooling (C#, F#, MSBuild) is built on top of the surface area of the .NET Runtime and some auxiliary libraries. The SDK gathers up and builds a CLI, along with tasks, targets and tooling. Much of the shared framework and tooling content is redistributed in-box.</p>
<p>To build and ship this security patch, we need coordination between the many teams that contribute to the .NET product as a whole. We need the lowest levels of the .NET graph (see below) to build their assets, then feed them downstream to consumers. They need take the update, build, and feed downstream. This will happen continually until the product is “coherent”; no new changes are being fed into the graph and everyone agrees on a single version of each component in the product. Coherency ensures that a component with changes is ingested everywhere that redistributes the component, or information about it. Then, we want to do our validation, take all the shippable assets from the closure of all those unreleased components, and then release them all at once to the world.</p>
<p>This is a lot of moving parts that need to work well together in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages of Distributes Ecosystems</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that this distributed ecosystem style of development <em>does</em> have a lot of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Layering</strong> – Repository boundaries tend to encourage layering and less tightly bound products. During the major version development lifecycle, the individual components of the stack generally remain roughly compatible, even as changes flow quickly and unevenly through the graph.</li>
<li><strong>Communities</strong> – Repository boundaries tend to encourage good, focused communities. The WPF and Winforms communities, for instance, are often distinct. Small repos are also generally more approachable.,</li>
<li><strong>Incrementality</strong> – Distributed development often allows for incremental changes. For instance, we can make breaking changes to the System.CommandLine surface area, then ingest those in the consumers over time. This doesn’t work all the time (e.g. let’s say the SDK is attempting to ship just one copy of System.Text.Json for all of the tooling to use, but not every consumer agrees on that surface area. Boom?!), but it’s reasonably reliable.</li>
<li><strong>Tight Inner Loops</strong> – Smaller, focused repositories tend to have better inner-loop experiences. Even something as simple as <code>git clone</code> or <code>git pull</code> is faster in a small repository. The repository boundary tends to give the (possibly illusory) sense that for your change, you only need to worry about the code and tests you can see.</li>
<li><strong>Asynchronous development</strong> – Incrementality helps development be more asynchronous. If my component flows to three downstream consumers who work in three different time zones, those teams can make progress on their own components in their own time, rather than needing to coordinate.</li>
<li><strong>Low-Cost Sharding/Incremental Builds</strong> – Distributed development allows for ‘optimizing’ away builds of components that don’t change every often and are at the fringes of a dependency graph. For instance, a leaf node that builds some static test assets doesn’t need to be rebuilt every time there is a change to the sdk. The last built assets are just fine.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you squint and peer between the lines here though, a lot of the advantages of the distributed model are its significant weaknesses when we need to build and ship software that requires changes in a significant portion of the graph to be completed in a short period of time. Changes at scale across large graphs are often slow and unpredictable. But why? Is there something inherently wrong with this model? Not really. In typical OSS ecosystems (e.g. NuGet or NodeJS package ecosystems), these aspects are often <strong>not a problem</strong>. These ecosystems do not optimize for speed or predictability. Instead, they value the autonomy of each node. Each node needs only to concern itself with what it needs to <em>produce</em> and what it needs to <em>consume</em> and the changes required to meet those needs. However, when we attempt to apply the distributed model to shipping software quickly, we often struggle because it increases the prevalence of two key concepts, which I’m calling <strong>Product Construction Complexity</strong> and <strong>Product Construction Overhead</strong>. Together these combine to slow us down and make us less predictable.</p>
<h4>Product Construction Complexity</h4>
<p>In the context of product construction, ‘complexity’ refers to the quantity of steps that are required for a change to go from a developer’s machine to that change being delivered to customers in all the ways that it needs to be delivered. I recognize that this is a fairly abstract definition. “Step” could mean different things depending on what level of granularity you want to look at. For now, let’s focus on conceptual product construction steps, as shown in the example graph below:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/basic-product-construction-complexity-scaled.webp" alt="Basic product construction complexity">
<em>A simple multi-repository product construction workflow. MyLibrary and MyApp are built from separate codebases. MyApp deploys to two customer endpoints</em></p>
<p>.NET began with a relatively simple product dependency graph and matching tools to manage that graph. As it grew, new repositories were added to the graph and additional dependency flow was required to construct the product. The graph grew more complex. We invented new tools (Maestro, our dependency flow system) to manage it. It was now easier than ever to add new dependencies. A developer or team looking to add new functionality to the product could often just create a new repository and build and set up the inputs and outputs. They only needed to know how that component fit within a small subsection of the larger product construction graph in order to add a new node. However, .NET doesn’t ship each individual unit independently. The product must become “coherent”, where everyone agrees on the versions of their dependencies, in order to ship. Dependencies or metadata about them are redistributed. You have to “visit” all of the edges. <em>Note: While we do not need to rev every component in the graph, there is a significant portion that changes on every release, either due to fixes or dependency flow.</em> Then you take the outputs of each individual node, combine them all together, and out the door you go.</p>
<p>More complex graphs have significant downsides:</p>
<ul>
<li>The more edges and nodes, the longer it tends to take to achieve coherency.</li>
<li>Teams are more likely to make a mistake. There are more coordination points, and more points in the workflow where a human can influence an outcome. Tools can help, but they only go so far.</li>
<li>Complexity can also encourage variance in build environment and requirements. It’s hard to keep everyone aligned on the same processes as teams move and upgrade at different rates. Reproducing that full set of environments can be expensive, and that cost tends to increase over time as infrastructure “rots”.</li>
</ul>

<em>Small but critical subsection of the .NET product construction graph, circa .NET Core 3.1. Arcade provides shared build infrastructure (dotted lines), while solid lines show component dependencies. Changes ripple through multiple repositories before reaching the final SDK and installer.</em></p>
<h4>Product Construction Overhead</h4>
<p>We define overhead as “<em>the amount of time spent not actively producing artifacts that we can ship to customers</em>“. Like complexity, it can be evaluated on a different level of granularity depending on how detailed you want to get. Let’s take a look at two quick examples, and then at the overhead in one of .NET’s older builds.</p>
<p>A simple multi-repo product construction process might look like the following:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/basic-product-construction-overhead-scaled.webp" alt="Sample product construction overhead">
<em>Illustration of overhead in a simple multi-repo product-construction workflow. Dot-outlined nodes represent overhead.</em></p>
<p>In the above graph, the overhead nodes (dotted nodes) do not actively contribute to the production of the packages in D. The time it takes the dependency flow service to create the PR is overhead. Waiting for a dev to notice and review the PR is overhead. Waiting for approval for package push is overhead. That’s not to say that these steps aren’t <em>necessary</em>, just that they are places where we say we’re not actively creating outputs for customers.</p>
<p>How about builds? If we zoom into a repository build process, we can often see quite a lot of overhead. Consider this very simple build:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/basic-pipeline-build-overhead-scaled.webp" alt="Sample pipeline overhead">
<em>Illustration of overhead in a simple pipeline. Dot-outlined nodes represent overhead. Again, there are a number of steps here that aren’t actively producing or shipping bits to customers. They may be <strong>necessary</strong>, but they’re still overhead.</em></p>
<p>There are a few interesting measures of overhead in a system. We can measure it a % of overall time. Add up the time spent in each step based on its classification, then divide the total overhead by the total time. This gives a nice measure of overall resource efficiency. However, from a wall clock perspective, overall overhead doesn’t tell us much. To understand overhead’s effect on the end-to-end time, we find the longest path by time through our product construction graph, then compute the total overhead in steps that contribute to that path as compared to the total time in the path.</p>
<p>To understand what that overhead might look like in a single .NET build, let’s take a look at an 8.0 build of runtime. This data was generated using a custom tool that can evaluate an Azure DevOps build based on a set of patterns that classify each step.</p>

<h4>Overhead + Complexity = Time</h4>
<p>Overhead is unavoidable. There is some level inherent in every product construction process. However, when we add complexity to our product construction processes, especially complexity in the graph, the overhead tends to begin to dominate the process. It sort of multiplies. Rather than paying the machine queue time cost one time, you might pay it 10 times over within a single path through the graph. After those machines are allocated, you then clone the repo each time. The efficiency scaling of these steps tends to also be worse because there is some fixed cost associated with each one. For instance, if it takes 10 seconds to scan 10MB of artifacts, and 1 second to prepare for the scan, collate and upload the results, it takes longer to do that step 10 times in a row than it does to scan the full 100MB at once. 110 vs. 101 seconds.</p>
<p>What is also insidious is that this cost tends to hide and increase over time. It’s not always obvious. A local repository build for a developer is typically fast. The developer does not see any overhead of the overall CI system in that build. Zooming out, building the repository in a job in a pipeline can be similarly quick, but starts to incur some overhead. You have the quick build of that repository, but extra overhead steps around it. You’re still reasonably efficient though. Then let’s say you zoom out a little and you have some additional jobs in that pipeline, doing other things. Maybe reusing artifacts from other parts of the build, building containers, etc. Overhead will start to become a larger overall % of the long path time. Now, zoom out again, and you’re looking at the place of that pipeline and associated repositories in context of your larger product construction. You add in time for dev PR approvals, dependency flow systems to do their work, more cloning, more building, more compliance, more more more.</p>
<p>In a distributed product construction system, decisions that affect complexity, and therefore overhead, can be made at a level that does not see the overall overhead in the system. A new node is added. In isolation, it’s fine. In context, it costs.</p>
<p>While no graph of complexity was ever made for the .NET 8 timeframe that could show the complexity of each individual component build in context of the whole product construction graph, consider what the job graph for the runtime build alone looked like. Each bubble below represents a separate machine.</p>

<em>Complexity in a .NET 8 build. Each node represents an individual machine. Edges represent dependencies.</em></p>
<h2>The roots of Unified Build in Source Build</h2>
<p>.NET Source Build is a way that Linux distributions can build .NET in an isolated environment from a single, unified source layout. Microsoft started working on it around .NET Core 1.1. The spiritual roots of Unified Build grew from hallway conversations between the team working on .NET Source Build and the team responsible for the Microsoft distribution. I won’t say it wasn’t in jealousy that the infrastructure teams often looked at how long it took to build the .NET product within the Source Build infrastructure. <strong>50 minutes!</strong> Shorter than it took to build just the runtime repository from scratch in its official CI build. Now granted, it wasn’t exactly an apples-to-apples comparison. After all, Source Build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only builds one platform.</li>
<li>Doesn’t build any of the Windows-only assets (e.g. WindowsDesktop shared framework)/</li>
<li>Doesn’t build .NET workloads.</li>
<li>Doesn’t do any installer packaging.</li>
<li>Doesn’t build the tests by default</li>
</ul>
<p>All very reasonable caveats. But enough caveats to add up to 10s of hours in differences in build time? <strong>Unlikely.</strong> Much more likely is that the Source Build methodology is <strong>low complexity</strong> and <strong>low overhead</strong>. More than just time, there were other obvious benefits. Unified toolsets, easier cross-stack development, and perhaps most importantly, hard guarantees of what was being built and its build-time dependencies.</p>
<p>Back to those hallway conversations. Source Build’s obvious benefits led to occasional probing questions from various members of the .NET team. Most of the form: <em>So…why doesn’t Microsoft build its distribution that way?</em> Answer: It’s hard.</p>
<h3>Why is it hard? A detour into the land of Source Build</h3>
<p>Microsoft began efforts to make Source Build a ‘real’ piece of machinery around the .NET 3.1 timeframe. Prior to this point, the Source Build distribution tended to look more like a one-off effort for each .NET major release. It was too difficult to keep working all the time, so the team worked, starting in the spring as the new product took shape, to bring the new .NET version into line with Linux distro maintainer requirements. To understand why it’s so hard to fit Microsoft’s distribution of .NET into this model as part of the Unified Build project, let’s look back into why it was so hard to get the Source Build project into a turn crank state in the first place.</p>
<p>To allow our distro partners to distribute .NET we needed to produce an infrastructure system that produced a .NET SDK within the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>Single implementation! – Only one implementation per component</li>
<li>Single platform – Only build for one platform (the one that distro partners are trying to ship)</li>
<li>Single build – Only build on one machine. We can’t require a complex orchestration infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Linux Distro Build Requirements</h4>
<p>Linux distros generally have stricter rules and less flexibility when building software that will go into their package feeds. The build is usually completed offline (disconnected from the internet). It may only use as inputs artifacts that have been previously created in that build system. Checked-in binaries are not allowed (though they can be eliminated at build time). Any source in the repository must meet strict licensing requirements. <em>See <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/license-information.md">license information</a> for information on .NET licensing and <a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/legal/license-approval/#Good_Licenses">Fedora licensing approval</a> for sample distro requirements.</em> At a conceptual level, a Linux distro partner wants to be able to trace every artifact they ship to a set of sources and processes that they can reasonably edit. All future software should be built from previously Source Build produced artifacts. <em>Note: There is a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/source-build/blob/main/Documentation/bootstrapping-guidelines.md">bootstrap process</a>, as you might imagine might be required.</em>.</p>
<h4>Single Build – A repo and orchestration framework to stitch the stack together</h4>
<p>As you’ve learned earlier, the .NET build, like many products, is actually comprised of the Azure DevOps builds of various components, stitched together with dependency updates. This means that the information and mechanics required to construct the product is distributed between the repositories (build logic within the build system and associated scripting, as well as YAML files processed by Azure DevOps) and the dependency flow information held by our ‘Maestro’ system (producer-consumer information). This isn’t usable for our Linux distro partners. They need to be able to build the product without access to these Microsoft resources. And they need to be able to do so in a way that is practical for their environments. Manually stitching together a product from a build graph isn’t reasonable. We need an orchestrator that encapsulates that information.</p>
<h5>The Source Build layout and orchestrator</h5>
<p>The orchestrator replaces the tasks that Azure DevOps and Maestro perform for .NET’s distributed build with ones that can be run from a single source layout, disconnected from the internet. You can see the modern, updated layout and orchestrator over at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet">dotnet/dotnet</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Single source layout</strong> – A <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/src">single source layout</a> with a copy of all components required to build the product. Submodules are flattened, if they exist (typically for external OSS components). The contents of the source layout are determined by identifying <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/blob/7efd8a45363467689d38fcf05f0c5f720244d0c4/eng/Version.Details.xml#L16">an annotated dependency</a> for each component within the product graph, rooted at <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk">dotnet/sdk</a>. The sha for that annotated dependency determines what content will populate the layout. <em>Note: dependencies like compilers and OS libs are provided by the build environment.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Information on how each component should be built, and its dependencies</strong> – For each of the components within the single source layout, a <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/repo-projects">basic project</a> is provided which identifies how the component is built. In addition, the component level dependencies are also identified. i.e. the .NET Runtime needs to be built before ASP.NET Core can start.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ItemGroup&gt;
&lt;RepositoryReference Include="arcade" /&gt;
&lt;RepositoryReference Include="runtime" /&gt;
&lt;RepositoryReference Include="xdt" /&gt;
&lt;/ItemGroup&gt;</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Build orchestrator logic</strong> – The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/repo-projects/Directory.Build.targets">build orchestrator logic</a> is responsible for launching each build in the graph when it is ready (any dependencies have been successfully built), as well as inputs and outputs of each component. After a component build has been completed, the orchestrator is responsible for identifying the outputs and preparing inputs for downstream component builds. Think of this as a local Dependabot, computing the intersection of the declared input repositories against the package level dependency info (see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/main/src/aspnetcore/eng/Version.Details.xml">aspnetcore’s</a>) for an example. More information on how dependency tracking works in .NET builds can be found in my <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/a-deep-dive-into-how-net-builds-and-ships/#tracking-our-dependencies">previous blog post</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compliance verification</strong> – The comparatively stricter environments that our Linux distro partners build in mean that it’s necessary that we build some automation to identify potential problems. The orchestrator can identify pre-built binary inputs, ‘poison’ leaks (previously source-built assets appearing in the current build outputs), and other hazards that might block our partners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smoke testing</strong> – Most of our test logic remains in the individual repositories (more on that later), but the layout also includes <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/tree/main/test">smoke tests</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Single Implementation – Pre-built squeaky clean</h4>
<p>There are some obvious and non-obvious reasons why these requirements would be hard to meet using the ‘stock’ Microsoft build of .NET, and why Source Build required so much work. An offline build with pre-staged, identified inputs that are <strong>buildable from source</strong> is a major undertaking. When the Source Build team began to investigate what this meant, it was quickly obvious that a LOT of interesting behavior was hiding in the .NET product build. Sure, binary inputs like optimization data were obviously disallowed, but some other foundational assets like .NET Framework and NETStandard targeting packs were also not buildable from source. Either they weren’t open source in the first place, or they hadn’t been built in years. More concerning, the graph-like nature of .NET means that incoherency is very common. Some of this incoherency is undesirable (the kind we attempt to eliminate during our product construction process). Some of it is expected and even desired.</p>
<h5>Example: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</h5>
<p>As an example, let’s take a look at the C# compiler analyzers, which are built in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">dotnet/roslyn</a> repository. The analyzers will reference various versions of the <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> package depending on the required surface area to ensure that a shipped analyzer runs all of the versions of Visual Studio and the .NET SDK that it is required to support. They reference a minimum possible version. This ensures that analyzers can be serviced in a sustainable fashion, rather than shipping a different version of an analyzer for every possible VS or SDK configuration.</p>
<p>Because multiple versions of the surface area are referenced, multiple versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> are restored during the build. That would mean, for the purposes of Source Build, we need to build each and every one of those versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> at some point. We have two ways to do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-version source layout</strong> – Place multiple copies of dotnet/roslyn into the shared source layout, one for each referenced <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> version based on when it was originally produced. This is not only expensive in build time, but it tends to be somewhat viral. If you have 3 versions of dotnet/roslyn you need to build, you need to ensure that the transitive dependencies of those 3 versions are also present in the shared layout. The maintenance complexity of this setup goes up very quickly. These are previously shipped versions of the dotnet/roslyn source base. It will be necessary to maintain security and compliance of those codebases over time. Upgrading build-time dependencies. Removing EOL infrastructure, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Require previously source-built versions to be available</strong> – This is really just a flavor of the multi-version source layout with an element of “caching”. If a distro maintainer needs to rebuild the product from scratch, or if a new Linux distribution is being bootstrapped, they might need to reconstruct decent portion of .NET’s past releases just to get the latest one to build in a compliant fashion. And if those old versions require changes to build in a compliant fashion, you’re again in a maintenance headache.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Source Build Reference Packages</h4>
<p>There are numerous other examples like Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp. Any time a project targets a down-level target framework (e.g. net9 in the net10 build), the down-level reference pack is restored. SDK tooling (compilers, MSBuild) targets versions of common .NET packages that match the version shipped with Visual Studio. So how do we deal with this? We cannot simply unify on a single version of every component referenced within the product without fundamentally changing the product.</p>
<p>The Source Build team realized that a lot of this usage fit neatly into a class of “reference-only” packages.</p>
<ul>
<li>The targeting packs restored by the SDK when a project builds against a TFM that does not match the SDK’s major version (e.g. targeting net9 with a net10 SDK) do not contain implementation.</li>
<li>The reference to older versions of <code>Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp</code> are <em>surface area</em> only. No assets are <em>redistributed</em> from these packages. If the implementation is not needed, a reference-only package can be substituted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/source-build-reference-packages">dotnet/source-build-reference-packages</a>. A reference-only package is significantly simpler to create and build, and it meets the needs of the consumers in the build. We can generate reference package sources for packages where we do not need the implementation, then create an infrastructure to store, build and make them available during the Source Build process. Providing multiple versions is relatively trivial. The dotnet/source-build-reference-packages repository is built during the .NET build, and then consuming components restore and compile against provided reference surface area.</p>
<h4>What about all those non-reference cases?</h4>
<p>With a solution to reference packages, we can turn our attention to other inputs that are not Source Build compliant and do not fall into the ‘reference’ category. There are three major sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closed source or inputs that cannot be built from source – Optimization data, Visual Studio integration packages, internal infrastructure dependencies, etc.</li>
<li>Legacy – Open source dependencies on implementation built in older versions of .NET.</li>
<li>Joins – Open source dependencies on implementation built on other platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s take a look at how we deal with these cases.</p>
<h5>Closed Source/Non-Source Buildable Inputs</h5>
<p>Closed source or any inputs that cannot be built from source aren’t allowable in the Linux distro maintainer builds, full stop. To resolve these cases, we analyze each usage to determine what to do. Remember that our goal is to provide a compliant build implementation for use by our distro partners, which is functionally as close to what Microsoft ships as is possible. i.e. we don’t want Microsoft’s Linux x64 SDK to <em>behave</em> in substantially different ways from RedHat’s Linux x64 SDK. This means that the runtime and sdk layouts for Linux x64 need to be as close as possible. The good news is that quite a lot of the closed source usage isn’t required to produce functionally equivalent assets. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>We might restore a package that enables signing, something not required in a distro partner build</li>
<li>The dotnet/roslyn repository builds components that power Visual Studio. These components have dependencies on Visual Studio packages that define the IDE integration surface area. However, this IDE integration doesn’t ship in the .NET SDK. This functionality could be “trimmed away” in Source Build by tweaking the build. This is reasonably common.</li>
</ul>
<p>If dependencies couldn’t be trimmed away without altering product functionality, we have a few additional options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open source the dependency</strong> – Often times, a closed source component, or at least a key portion of a closed source component required to satisfy a scenario, can be open sourced.</li>
<li><strong>Alter product behavior</strong> – Sometimes, the team can work to remove the product differences with intentional design changes. Remember that the important part is that everything that ships on distro partner package feeds needs to be built from source. This allows for some assets to be brought in dynamically. Think of this like the NPM package ecosystem vs. the NPM package manager. A distro might build the NPM package manager from source. This leaves users to dynamically restore NPM packages at build time.</li>
<li><strong>Live with slightly different behavior</strong> – These cases are few and far between. Prior to .NET 10, the WinForms and WPF project templates and WindowsDesktop were not included in the source-built Linux SDK, despite being available in Microsoft’s Linux distribution. This was due to the difficulty in building the required portions of those repositories on non-Windows platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Legacy Dependencies</h5>
<p>We’ve discussed what we can do with closed source and non-reproducible dependencies. What about legacy dependencies? First, what do we mean by ‘legacy’ dependency? As detailed in earlier discussion, there is quite a lot of ‘incoherency’ in the product. A project might build for multiple target frameworks, redistributing assets from older versions of .NET. This is all to support valuable customer scenarios. But building all the versions of these components isn’t feasible. This is where our <strong>single implementation</strong> rule comes into play. We choose a single version of each component to build and ship with the product. We do allow for <em>reference</em> to old versions, via dotnet/source-build-reference-packages, but relying on older implementations are off limits.</p>
<p>First, we look for a way to avoid the dependency. Is it needed for the Linux SDK we’re trying to produce? If not, we can eliminate that code path from the build. If so, is there an opportunity to unify on the single implementation? In a lot of cases, incoherency is just a result of the product components moving their dependencies forward at different rates. If all else fails, we could explore compromises that involve behavioral differences, but we want to avoid this as much as possible.</p>
<h5>Joins and Verticality</h5>
<p>Joins are the last major category of pre-builts to remove. They occur because we end up with intra-product dependencies that are built in another environment. For example, I might be running a build on Windows that creates a NuGet package for a global tool, but to build that NuGet package I need the native shim executables Mac and Linux and Windows. Those shims can only (reasonably) be built in the Mac and Linux host environments. These types of dependencies are indicative of a product build that is more ‘woven’ than ‘vertical’ and tend to naturally emerge over time in a multi-repo product construction graph. Each edge in that graph represents a sequence point where all the outputs of earlier nodes are available, regardless of where they were built. If a dependency can be taken, it will be taken.</p>
<p>However, the distro partner builds need to be single platform <em>and</em> single invocation to fit into distro partner requirements. Bootstrapping notwithstanding, they want to pull in the dependencies, disconnect the machine from the network, and hit build. At the end, out pops a bright new .NET SDK. Cross-platform dependencies preclude any such behavior. They block “build verticality”. Remember joins. We’ll need to come back to them later when we start implementing Unified Build for Microsoft based on the Source Build model.</p>
<p>For Source Build, we again deal with joins a bit like legacy dependencies. The key aspect to remember is that Source Build is narrowly focused on producing a .NET SDK and associated runtimes in the Linux distro partner build environments. So, we eliminate dependencies where possible (e.g. we don’t need to package Windows global tool executable stubs when running the SDK on Linux) and redesign the product or product construction process as necessary to meet requirements (e.g. .NET Workload manifests).</p>
<h2>The Vision – Dreaming up Unified Build</h2>
<p>Unified Build seeks to apply the general principles of our Linux distro partner Source Build to the product that Microsoft ships. Achieving this would result in big wins for Linux distro partners, upstream contributors and Microsoft, reducing maintenance costs and improving the ability to build and ship quickly. Although we knew from the outset that we likely can’t exactly match the exact Linux distro build approach without major changes in the product, we thought we could get close. .NET came up with the following high-level goals (<em>Note, “.NET distro maintainers” refers to anyone building .NET, including Microsoft</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>A single git commit denotes all product source for a particular .NET build. All commits are coherent</li>
<li>A single repo commit can produce a shippable build</li>
<li>.NET’s build shall be able to create a specific platform’s distribution in a single build environment.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to efficiently update and build .NET (both collaboratively and separately) through the entire lifecycle of a .NET version (first to last commit).</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers can produce downstream distributions without use of Microsoft provided services.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to meet provenance and build environment requirements for their distributions.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers shall be able to coordinate patching of downstream distributions.</li>
<li>.NET distro maintainers can run verification tests against the built product.</li>
<li>.NET contributors shall be able to easily produce full product builds for testing, experimentation, etc.</li>
<li>.NET contributors shall be able to work efficiently on the section of the product for which they are concerned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, getting there would require solving a mountain of new problems. Let’s take a look at some of the problems we need to solve before we can use Source Build as Microsoft’s .NET build.</p>
<h3>Provide a way to determine what makes it into the product</h3>
<p>When you construct a product using the distributed model, the <em>build</em> of the product, the <em>validation</em> of the product and the determination of what actually <em>constitutes</em> the product are all tied together. Source Build operates on a flattened source layout based on a final coherent graph. However, it relies on the traditional .NET product construction process in order to determine what versions of each component show up in the layout. To get the full benefit we need a way to directly update components within the shared source base without complex dependency flow. Otherwise, if a developer wants to make a change in runtime, they will end up building the product twice. Once to flow the runtime build with their change through all paths that runtime reaches, then once again to build the product using that new runtime.</p>
<h4>What we have</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/pre-ub-runtime-propagation-scaled.webp" alt="Pre-unified-build runtime change propagation">
<em>Highlighted paths show how a runtime change cascades through multiple repositories in the distributed build model, requiring sequential builds and dependency flow updates.</em></p>
<h4>What we need</h4>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/post-ub-runtime-propagation-scaled.webp" alt="Unified-build runtime change propagation">
<em>Highlighted path shows how a runtime change immediately flows into the source layout. We call this a ‘flat flow’</em></p>
<h3>Provide a way to react to breaking changes</h3>
<p>The flat flow significantly reduces the number of hops, and therefore the complexity and overhead in the process of a change making its way into the shared source layout. And we can see that before a change makes it into the product; it will still get PR validation and possibly some more in-depth rolling CI validation. However, let’s say that this change requires reaction in consuming components. Despite the change in dependency flow to a flat flow, ASP.NET Core still depends on .NET Runtime. And ASP.NET Core’s code in the layout doesn’t know about the new runtime change. Whatever PR validation we have before a change is allowed in the shared source layout is sure to fail.</p>
<p>In a traditional dependency flow system, we handle this by making changes in the dependency update PR. If an API is changed, the build breaks. A dev makes a change in the PR (ideally), validation is green, and the PR is merged. For the single-source methodology to work for .NET, we’ll need to be able to make changes to the source of <em>other</em> components in the dotnet/runtime update PR.</p>
<h3>Provide a way to validate against repository infrastructure</h3>
<p>As we discussed earlier, a large quantity of critical validation lives at the component repository level. That’s where the developers spend their time. Moving or copying all of this is probably wasteful, definitely expensive, and likely hard to maintain. If we can’t rely on the dependency flow to do the validation before components flow into the shared source layout, we’ll need a way to do so after.</p>
<p>To solve our problem, we could have all the outputs of a new product builds flow <strong>back</strong> into the individual repositories, matching with the dependencies in their <code>Version.Details.xml</code> files. That means dotnet/aspnetcore will get a bunch of new .NET Runtime packages, dotnet/sdk will get a bunch of newly built ASP.NET Core, .NET Runtime and Roslyn compiler packages, etc. They will be validating the ‘last built’ versions of their input dependencies against repository infrastructure.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/unified-build-backflow-validation-scaled.webp" alt="Unified Build validation on backflow">
<em>Backflow provides a way to validate the recently built .NET output against repository infrastructure</em></p>
<h3>Provide two-way code flow</h3>
<p>Let’s say a runtime insertion PR changed the signature of an API in <code>System.Text.Json</code>. When that forward flows, the responsible dev updates the signatures in all downstream users. Let’s say that’s code in <code>src/aspnetcore/*</code> and <code>src/windowsdesktop/*</code>. The new product is built, and the updated System.Text.Json package with the new API signature makes its way back to <code>dotnet/aspnetcore</code> and <code>dotnet/windowsdesktop</code>. The HEAD of <code>main</code> doesn’t have the source changes made directly in the shared layout forward flow PR. The dev would need to port those changes over, making changes in the backflow PR. This is tedious and error prone. Our new system will need to provide a way to automatically flow changes made in the shared layout back in the source repository.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/11/unified-build-full-flow-scaled.webp" alt="Unified Build two-way code flow">
<em>Component changes flow to our shared source layout, additional changes made only in the shared source layout flow back into the component repositories with supporting packages. Note that this is a general capability to backflow shared source changes, not just changes made in forward flow PRs.</em></p>
<h3>Provide better insertion time validation</h3>
<p>Validation on backflow isn’t perfect. It doesn’t provide an easy <em>pre-merge</em> gate for bad changes in dependent components. We can mitigate this by identifying and closing gaps in repo testing that allowed bad changes to be merged in the originating repo. We can also accept that some things will always slip through and that the process of creating a high-quality product isn’t just a green PR. Many repositories do not and cannot run their full testing suites prior to merging. However, we can <em>also</em> invest scenario testing run against the just-built product. This is something that our traditional dependency flow system is not good at.</p>
<p>Any whole product scenario testing relies on dependency updates for components reaching the dotnet/sdk repository. Up to that point, we don’t have a complete .NET product that we can test. Any attempt is just some kind of “Frankenbuild”. <em>Note: A lot of this end-to-end testing just comes in the form of dotnet/sdk’s repository-level PR/CI testing.</em>. However, changes can take a while to move through the graph to the point there they take effect in a way that would be visible in testing.</p>
<p>The Source Build methodology provides a full product build on each and every component change, regardless of where that component lives in the product construction graph. This means that we have the opportunity to create and run a comprehensive suite of testing on each of those insertions. That testing should be focused on covering wide swaths of product functionality. If this testing passes, there is a reasonable expectation that .NET is functioning in a way that makes it possible for development to make forward progress.</p>
<h3>Provide a way to build all of what .NET ships</h3>
<p>The Linux distro Source Build offering focuses narrowly on the assets in-box in the 1xx band SDK, ASP.NET Core, Runtime. It builds packages that support the creation of these layouts. As we saw earlier with prebuilt elimination, this narrow focus is necessary to be able to meet distro partner build requirements. If we want to build what Microsoft ships, we can’t have that narrow focus.</p>
<p>Expanding our focus is straightforward in some areas and difficult in others. In some ways, we’re just relaxing restrictions and bringing more functionality back into the build. We need to allow for pre-built binaries (e.g. signing functionality) to be restored from feeds. We need to build all TFMs instead of trimming away .NET Framework targets. We’ll need to build components originally excluded from the souce build focused shared source layout, like Windows Desktop, Winforms, WPF, EMSDK, etc. What’s more difficult are joins. Recall that Linux distro Source Build is single layout, single machine, single invocation.  This suffices for producing the layout, but there are a good handful of other artifacts in .NET that require builds on multiple machines. Artifacts that break the single machine verticality concept.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we’d re-architect the product to avoid these joins. But it’s often hard to do so without customer compromise or driving complexity into the product itself. We can’t simplify the SDK without breaking customers, and this is hard to do, even across major versions, in an enterprise-grade product. Past decisions heavily influence future available choices. In the end, we’ll have to eliminate joins where we can via product construction practices. Any remaining joins will be something we have to live with. The build will have to be architected to run across multiple machines, via a series of build passes.</p>
<h2>Executing on the Vision – Shipping Unified Build</h2>
<p>The Unified Build project can roughly be divided into 4 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial brainstorming and design (.NET 7)</strong> – The initial design work on the Unified Build project began in early 2022 during the development of .NET 7 and took ~4 months to complete. The project got full approval to start later in 2022 with the intention of completion by .NET 9 RTM, with some key go/no-go points where we could bail and still have a net win on infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Foundational work (.NET 8)</strong> – The Unified Build project during .NET 8 was focused on foundational work to improve the sustainability of the Source Build infrastructure and building features that were required to support the weight of the full build. The investments were designed to be a net positive for .NET overall, even if it turned out that our proof-of-concept stage discovered some major unknown problem and we had to change direction.</li>
<li><strong>Vertical Build/Code Flow Exploration (Early .NET 9)</strong> – After the foundational work completed, we moved to implement a vertical build for each of the 3 major OS families: Mac, Windows, and Linux. The intention was to identify as many of the problems we would need to solve during our productization phase as possible. We were especially interested in finding any previously unknown product construction join points. At the same time, we did a much deeper investigation into the options for code flow and code management, eventually proving out and settling on the implementation listed below.</li>
<li><strong>Productization (Late .NET 9-.NET 10)</strong> – Final implementation started in earnest towards the end of .NET 9 after a spring+summer delay. As a result of the delay, the ship date was pushed back to .NET 10. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise. This bought us about 6 extra months of bake time and allowed us to use the Unified Build product construction process starting midway through the .NET 10 Preview/RC cycle (Preview 4). .NET Preview 4 shipped with the new build process, but on the old code flow. Preview 5 added the new code flow, and we never looked back. Further refinement in developer workflow, more bake time for the build and code flow process happened over subsequent months.</li>
</ul>
<p>And finally, after almost 4 years of dreaming and work, Unified Build shipped with .NET 10 RTM!</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the key components of the project.</p>
<h3>VMR – The Virtual Monolithic Repository</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet">dotnet/dotnet VMR</a>, or “Virtual Monolithic Repository” forms the cornerstone of the Unified Build project. It is the source layout from which all of .NET is built, including by our Linux distro partners. It is the orchestrator. Functionally, it’s not much different from the source layout used prior to .NET 8.0. That layout has just been formalized into a git repository (vs. a source tarball). This is key, as it allows developers to work both in their individual component repository, where dev workflows might be very refined, as well as in the VMR when cross-cutting changes are necessary. .NET gets most of the benefits of the distributed repo world, without coherency problems.</p>
<h3>Vertical Build</h3>
<p>Vertical Build is .NET’s pivot to producing assets in a series of verticals. A vertical is defined as a single build command on a single machine that builds part of the .NET product without input from other verticals. Typically, we divide verticals up by the runtime that we’re trying to produce. For example, Windows x64 vs. MonoAOT vs. Linux arm64 vs. PGO profile Windows x86. Altogether there are 35-40 different verticals. We divide these into what we call “short stacks” and “tall stacks”. A short stack just builds the runtime. A tall stack builds all the way up through the SDK.</p>
<p>The original vision was that if we joined together all the outputs from parallel verticals, we’d have everything .NET needed to ship. Such a setup would be highly efficient and friendly to any upstream partners. Unfortunately, the design of the .NET product has baked in a few required joins over the years. For example, .NET workload packages can’t be built without access to numerous packages built across many operating systems. To resolve this, we ended up with two additional build passes. The good news is that those additional passes are on a reduced set of verticals and a reduced set of components within those verticals. Not perfect, but manageable.</p>
<h3>Code flow</h3>
<p>Probably the most interesting aspect of the Unified Build project is how code flow is managed. This is where .NET turns standard development patterns on their head a little bit. As detailed earlier, maintaining the product as a graph of interdependent components while flattening code flow into a shared coherent layout requires “two-way” code flow. Changes need to flow from components into the shared layout, and changes in the shared layout need to be able to flow back to the component repositories. Conceptually the code flow algorithm is no more complicated than anything you can model within a single git repository for a given project. The trick is to do this with repositories with no related git history.</p>
<p><strong>Note: The nitty gritty details of this algorithm will be covered in a future post by another team member. I’ll update this post to link to it when it’s available.</strong></p>
<p>For now, let’s take a look at the basics:</p>
<p>Both the VMR and the component repository keep track of the last code flow from their partner. This is tracked alongside standard dependency information in <code>eng/Version.Details.xml</code>, though one could imagine it could be kept elsewhere.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/5bceb8184fcde55143d2102a65c72bd6233e950b/eng/Version.Details.xml#L2">dotnet/runtime knows the VMR SHA of the last “<strong>backflow</strong>“</a>, which is the flow from the VMR to dotnet/runtime</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/blob/fe21998bab3322ebf00893198bbb3cedf63b493a/src/source-manifest.json#L81-L86">The VMR knows the dotnet/runtime SHA of the last “<strong>forward flow</strong>“</a>, which is the flow from dotnet/runtime to the VMR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to determine the diff between the “last flow” and whatever is flowing in now. For example, in a very simple case, when a new commit is made to dotnet/runtime and no changes have been made to <code>src/dotnet/runtime</code> in the VMR, the dependency flow system will take the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine two points, A and B, for which to compute a diff. For this case, point A is the last flow of dotnet/runtime that was checked in to the VMR (or is currently in PR). Point B is the new commit to dotnet/runtime.</li>
<li>Construct a patch file, remapping the files src/runtime files onto the directory structure of the VMR.</li>
<li>Open a PR with the diffs. See an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet/pull/3151">example forward flow</a> and an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/121366">example back flow</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>.NET 8 and .NET 9 use VMRs with only one-way code flow. These cases with no changes on the other side are trivial and robust. Things get spicier when developers start making changes on both sides, and when dependency flow starts shifting around over time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing the diff points gets more interesting and involves knowing which way that “last flow” was.</li>
<li>Merge conflicts arise and need to be dealt with in a way the developer can understand.</li>
<li>Changes in the source and target of code flow can cause havoc and need robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll leave code flow there for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
<h3>Scenario Test Validation</h3>
<p>The last major pillar of Unified Build is additional scenario testing. To be clear, .NET does not lack testing. .NET Runtime could use month’s worth of machine time on every PR to validate its millions of tests if it were practical or pragmatic to do so. Our approval, build, validation and signoff procedures ensure high-quality shipping bits. Still, when making changes directly in the VMR, the flat flow introduces new <em>lag</em> between that making that change and in-depth validation of it against each of the VMR components. While we can’t run every last test on PR and CI, we did recognize that better automated <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/scenario-tests">scenario testing</a> could play a solid role in preventing regressions. The goal was to add tests that covered wide swaths of product functionality that were not directly tied to the build system or repository infrastructure. Instead, they executed against the final built product. If the scenario tests pass, then there is a good sense that the product is functional at a decent level and contributors won’t be blocked.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>So, what did .NET get for almost 4 years of dreaming, scheming, and hard work? That’s a lot of effort to put into one project. Did the outcome justify the investment? As it turns out, we got quite a lot.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the most visible outcomes and then take a peek under the covers.</p>
<h3>Flexibility, predictability and speed</h3>
<p>By far the biggest return we’ve seen on the investment is <strong>flexibility</strong>. Distributed product construction is slow. Producing coherent builds is slow. Checking in new fixes or content requires coordination to avoid “resetting the build”, because <strong>what</strong> you want to ship, and <strong>how</strong> you build it are tied together in a distributed, OSS-style ecosystem. Taking a new fix might mean you don’t have something ready to handoff for validation. Flat flow eliminates that coherency problem, separating the <strong>what</strong> and the <strong>how</strong>. This is incredibly valuable during the drive towards an RTM build or a servicing release. It means we can make fixes later in the release cycle, focusing much more on whether those fixes meet our servicing bar and much less on whether we can actually build and deliver the change. That flexibility is good for customers.</p>
<p>Some of that flexibility comes from the speed of the build. This may sound glacially slow (.NET is a big, complex product), but .NET set a goal of producing an unsigned build in less than 4 hours, signed in less than 7. That’s down from significantly longer times in .NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0. A build of 8.0 or 9.0 can easily run to 24 even if everything goes perfectly. A signed build in 7 hours means a rolling set of new .NET assets to validate ~3 times a day. Most of that build time improvement comes from simply removing <a href="#product-construction-overhead">overhead</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the flexibility also comes from predictability. Distributed product construction has more moving parts. It has more human touch points. More places for systems and processes to fail. This tends to make outcomes unpredictable. “<em>If I check in a fix to dotnet/runtime, when will I have a build ready?</em>” is a hard question to answer in a distributed system. I know how long dotnet/runtime’s build takes. But at what time will that change show up downstream via dependency flow? Will someone be around to review and approve it when it does? What’s the status of PR/CI validation downstream? Will a new important change be merged into dotnet/aspnetcore before we get a coherent build, setting us back on validation? This question is vastly easier to answer in .NET 10. The change flows into the VMR (or is made there directly) and will show up in the next build. The next build will take N hours.</p>
<h3>Infrastructural robustness and completeness</h3>
<p>Behind the flashier metrics, there are years of quality-of-life improvements to the infrastructure that pay major dividends day in and day out. Improvements to the Source Build infrastructure in .NET 8 reduced the cost of keeping Linux distro Source Build running. A lot of its cost was related to the delay between a change getting checked in and discovering whether it would break the build when it finally flowed through the graph and reached the shared source layout. It was not uncommon for the Source Build .NET SDK to not be “prebuilt-clean” or shippable by distro partners until the middle of the previews. The infrastructure improvements in .NET 8 made it much easier to identify new pre-built inputs at PR time when they are easier to diagnose and resolve, before they made their way in the source layout. We are now prebuilt clean 100% of the time. That then reduced the load on the Source Build team, which gave them bandwidth to work in other areas. They added build parallelism, more predictable dependency flow, better logging, removed unneccessary complexity…the list goes on and on. Investments that make a product successful.</p>
<p>Our signing tooling had to be overhauled to support signing on every platform for a wide variety of archive types. Without this work, we couldn’t have shipped Unified Build. But this expanded support benefits more than just the core .NET product. There are numerous ancillary repositories that were able to simplify their builds, avoiding shuttling bits from Mac/Linux to Windows machines where the signing tooling ran. Lower build overhead, faster and simpler builds.</p>
<h2>Future directions</h2>
<p>So where does the Unified Build project go next? While we won’t have the same level of investment in .NET 11, we’ll be making targeted improvements to the infrastructure to improve developer workflow and UX, mainly around code flow. One area I’m particularly excited about is AI agents that monitor code flow, connecting the dots between the various systems involved in creating the product and identifying issues. There are lots of systems and parties involved (Azure DevOps, GitHub, the code flow services and their configuration, code mirroring, developer approvals, machine allocation, etc.) in making a change go from PR to product. When it works, it works. When it doesn’t it’s often down to a human to track down exactly where the chain of events went wrong. It’s tedious and time consuming. We have tools, but it’s mainly about connecting lots of dots. We could write a rules engine for this, but my hunch is that it would be fragile and very complicated. Agents that can look at the system a little more fuzzily are ideally suited to this type of task. Less toil, a better .NET.</p>
<p>Lastly, beyond .NET 11, another push to get rid of join points might be on the horizon. The benefits are pretty clear: simpler, faster, and friendlier to contributors. We know now exactly how fast a build would be if you got rid of the remaining joins (less than 4 hours).</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you made it this far, thanks! It’s good to provide some insight into how .NET build and ships. You’ve learned how distributed dependency flow product construction models aren’t always a great fit for shipping software predictably and reliably. These systems tend to have high complexity and overhead, which adds time. You’ve read about the roots of the .NET Unified Build project in .NET Linux distro Source Build, and what made it difficult to apply those concepts to .NET. Lastly, you learned how .NET applied those concepts and the drastic improvements we’ve seen in our day-to-day work.</p>
<p>The blog post detailing the flat code flow algorithms should be along shortly. Stay tuned!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>URL: <a href="https://andrej.sh/blog/maintaining-open-source-project/">https://andrej.sh/blog/maintaining-open-source-project/</a>, See on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46051393">Hacker News</a></p>
<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        <h2 id="the-beginning">the beginning</h2>
<p>building <a href="https://kaneo.app/">kaneo</a> was fun. a clean, minimal kanban board. self-hosted. open source. no tracking, no subscriptions, no bullshit.</p>
<p>i shipped v1, posted it on reddit, got some stars on github. people actually used it. that feeling when someone tells you they're using something you built? incredible.</p>
<p>then i learned that <strong>shipping is just the beginning.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-documentation-challenge">the documentation challenge</h2>
<p>i spent hours writing documentation. setup guides, configuration examples, troubleshooting sections. tried to make it clear and comprehensive.</p>
<p>but here's the thing: <strong>people come from different backgrounds.</strong> what's obvious to me after building the thing isn't obvious to someone installing it for the first time.</p>
<p>someone opens an issue: "how do i install this?"</p>
<p>my first reaction was frustration. it's in the readme! but then i realized - maybe the readme assumes too much. maybe they're new to docker. maybe they're coming from windows and linux is foreign.</p>
<p>so i improved the docs:</p>
<ul>
<li>added more examples</li>
<li>created a troubleshooting guide</li>
<li>made a video walkthrough</li>
<li>added a "common issues" section</li>
</ul>
<p>it's a constant process. documentation is never "done."</p>
<h2 id="support-is-product-development">support is product development</h2>
<p>maintaining kaneo means helping people debug their setups. and honestly? it's taught me more than i expected.</p>
<p>people run kaneo on setups i never imagined:</p>
<ul>
<li>behind corporate proxies</li>
<li>on raspberry pi clusters</li>
<li>in kubernetes with custom networking</li>
<li>on nas devices with limited resources</li>
</ul>
<p>each support request reveals an assumption i made. each "it doesn't work" issue (even the ones without details) points to a failure mode i didn't consider.</p>
<p>the challenge is balancing time. i want to help everyone. but i also have a day job. and new features to build. and bugs to fix.</p>
<p>i'm still learning how to set boundaries while being helpful.</p>
<h2 id="feature-requests-are-humbling">feature requests are humbling</h2>
<p>people want kaneo to do more. and that's amazing! it means they're actually using it. they care enough to imagine what it could be.</p>
<p>but <strong>every feature request is a decision:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>does this fit the vision?</li>
<li>can i maintain this long-term?</li>
<li>will this complicate the codebase?</li>
<li>what else won't get built if i build this?</li>
</ul>
<p>saying no is hard. especially when the request is thoughtful and well-reasoned. especially when someone offers to help implement it.</p>
<p>i've learned to be transparent: "i love this idea, but it's outside kaneo's scope. here's why..."</p>
<p>most people understand. some don't. that's okay.</p>
<h2 id="migrations-are-terrifying">migrations are terrifying</h2>
<p>the database schema needed a refactor. the current design was limiting. the new design would enable features people wanted.</p>
<p>but 200+ people were using kaneo in production. <strong>their actual work data. their team's workflows.</strong></p>
<p>if i broke the migration, they'd lose trust. maybe lose data. definitely lose sleep.</p>
<p>so i:</p>
<ol>
<li>wrote the migration script</li>
<li>tested it on every version going back to v1</li>
<li>wrote detailed upgrade notes</li>
<li>tested edge cases</li>
<li>tested the edge cases of edge cases</li>
<li>added validation checks</li>
<li>added dry-run mode</li>
</ol>
<p>released it. held my breath.</p>
<p>most migrations went smoothly. a few didn't. not because people didn't read the notes - but because they had setups i couldn't have predicted:</p>
<ul>
<li>modified databases</li>
<li>custom patches</li>
<li>environments i'd never seen</li>
</ul>
<p>we debugged together. they were patient. i was grateful.</p>
<p>every migration taught me something new about defensive programming.</p>
<h2 id="contributors-are-a-gift">contributors are a gift</h2>
<p>when someone submits a pr, it's incredible. <strong>someone cared enough to spend their time improving kaneo.</strong></p>
<p>but integrating contributions is harder than i expected:</p>
<ul>
<li>different coding styles</li>
<li>different assumptions about architecture</li>
<li>different ideas about what kaneo should be</li>
</ul>
<p>sometimes a pr is perfect. sometimes it needs work. sometimes it's solving a problem in a way that'll create more problems later.</p>
<p>i've learned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>appreciate the effort, always</li>
<li>explain my reasoning when requesting changes</li>
<li>be okay with saying "this doesn't fit, but i appreciate you"</li>
<li>sometimes just fix it myself if it's close</li>
</ul>
<p>the contributors who stick around? they're amazing. they've made kaneo better than i could alone.</p>
<h2 id="the-diversity-of-environments">the diversity of environments</h2>
<p>self-hosting means people run kaneo <strong>everywhere:</strong></p>
<pre><code><span><span><span># docker on their laptops</span>
</span></span><span><span>docker compose up -d
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># kubernetes clusters at work</span>
</span></span><span><span>kubectl apply -f kaneo.yaml
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># raspberry pi in their home lab</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># (with 1GB of RAM and dreams)</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># bare metal on old servers</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># (that have been running since 2015)</span>
</span></span><span><span>
</span></span><span><span><span># nas devices with arm processors</span>
</span></span><span><span><span># (that i've never even heard of)</span>
</span></span></code></pre><p>each environment teaches me something. each "it doesn't work on my setup" issue reveals an assumption i made about how systems work.</p>
<p>i can't test every environment. but i can make kaneo more resilient:</p>
<ul>
<li>better error messages</li>
<li>clearer logs</li>
<li>more graceful failures</li>
</ul>
<p>the people running kaneo on weird setups? they're often the most helpful. they understand their environment. they provide detailed logs. they test fixes.</p>
<p>we figure it out together.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-documentation-alive">keeping documentation alive</h2>
<p>documentation is never finished. every feature needs docs. every bug fix might need docs. every question reveals a gap in docs.</p>
<p>i've learned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>update docs in the same pr as code changes</li>
<li>treat "docs are wrong" issues as high priority</li>
<li>appreciate when people submit doc fixes</li>
<li>accept that docs will never be perfect</li>
</ul>
<p>the goal isn't perfect documentation. it's documentation that helps most people most of the time.</p>
<p>and when it doesn't? that's feedback. that's how it gets better.</p>
<h2 id="the-comparison-question">the comparison question</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"why not just use trello/notion/linear?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>it's a fair question. those tools are great. they have teams of engineers, designers, product managers. they're polished. they're fast. they're feature-rich.</p>
<p>kaneo is different:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>them</th>
<th>kaneo</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>cloud-hosted</td>
<td>self-hosted (your data, your server)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>closed source</td>
<td>open source (you can read every line)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>feature-rich</td>
<td>minimal (does one thing well)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>subscription</td>
<td>free (as in freedom and beer)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>it's not better. it's <strong>different.</strong> for some people, that difference matters.</p>
<p>and honestly? building kaneo taught me more than using those tools ever could.</p>
<h2 id="the-emotional-reality">the emotional reality</h2>
<p>maintaining open source is a rollercoaster:</p>
<p>someone stars your repo → feels good</p>
<p>someone opens a detailed bug report with logs and reproduction steps → feels great</p>
<p>someone says "kaneo saved our team" → feels incredible</p>
<p>someone opens an issue titled "this is trash" → hurts more than it should</p>
<p>you spend a weekend implementing a requested feature → crickets</p>
<p>you fix a small bug → three people thank you</p>
<p>you realize you haven't worked on your own roadmap in months → exhausting</p>
<p>someone submits a thoughtful pr → you're not alone</p>
<p>the highs are high. the lows are low. but the people who use kaneo, who contribute, who care? they make it worth it.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-learned">what i learned</h2>
<h3 id="1-scope-is-everything">1. scope is everything</h3>
<p>kaneo does <strong>one thing:</strong> kanban boards. not project management. not time tracking. not team chat.</p>
<p>every feature you add is a feature you maintain forever.</p>
<p>being clear about scope isn't limiting - it's liberating. it lets you focus. it lets you say no without guilt.</p>
<h3 id="2-automate-everything-you-can">2. automate everything you can</h3>
<pre><code><span><span><span># .github/workflows/ci.yml</span><span>
</span></span></span><span><span><span></span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>CI</span><span>

</span></span></span><span><span><span>    </span>- <span>run</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>semantic-release</span><span>
</span></span></span></code></pre><p>automation isn't lazy. it's sustainable:</p>
<ul>
<li>automated tests catch bugs before users do</li>
<li>automated releases mean less manual work</li>
<li>automated security scans give peace of mind</li>
<li>automated dependency updates keep things current</li>
</ul>
<p>it frees you to focus on what matters.</p>
<h3 id="3-good-issue-templates-help-everyone">3. good issue templates help everyone</h3>
<p>github issue templates help people provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>system info</li>
<li>error logs</li>
<li>steps to reproduce</li>
</ul>
<p>it's not about gatekeeping. it's about making debugging possible. most people want to help you help them. templates make that easier.</p>
<h3 id="4-saying-no-is-an-act-of-respect">4. saying no is an act of respect</h3>
<p>you can't build everything. saying yes to everything means doing nothing well.</p>
<p>being honest about what you can and can't do respects everyone's time. including yours.</p>
<h3 id="5-users-are-collaborators">5. users are collaborators</h3>
<p>the people using kaneo aren't just users. they're:</p>
<ul>
<li>beta testers finding bugs</li>
<li>documentation editors spotting gaps</li>
<li>feature designers sharing ideas</li>
<li>community builders helping each other</li>
</ul>
<p>they're not demanding. they're engaged. <strong>that's a gift.</strong></p>
<p>when someone opens an issue, they're investing time in making kaneo better. even if the issue is unclear, the intent is good.</p>
<p>patience and kindness aren't just nice. they're necessary.</p>
<h2 id="the-honest-truth">the honest truth</h2>
<p>maintaining an open source, self-hosted project is:</p>
<ul>
<li>more work than building it</li>
<li>different fun than building it</li>
<li>more rewarding than you'd expect</li>
<li>harder than you'd expect</li>
<li>worth it</li>
</ul>
<p>you learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>technical skills (migrations, security, scalability)</li>
<li>people skills (communication, patience, boundaries)</li>
<li>product skills (prioritization, scope, vision)</li>
<li>how to appreciate every contribution</li>
<li>how to build something people actually want</li>
</ul>

</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-id-tell-past-me">what i'd tell past me</h2>
<p><strong>1. invest in documentation early</strong> - good docs reduce support burden and help people succeed. it's time well spent.</p>
<p><strong>2. automate from day one</strong> - tests, releases, security scans. automation scales. you don't.</p>
<p><strong>3. be clear about scope</strong> - say what your project is AND what it isn't. it helps everyone.</p>
<p><strong>4. migrations are worth the extra effort</strong> - test thoroughly. add rollbacks. write clear upgrade notes. your users trust you with their data.</p>
<p><strong>5. it's okay to be slow</strong> - you're not a company. you're a person. set expectations. take breaks. protect your energy.</p>
<p><strong>6. celebrate your users</strong> - every person using kaneo is amazing. they chose to trust something you built. that's incredible.</p>
<p><strong>7. the community is the product</strong> - the code matters, but the people matter more. invest in both.</p>
<h2 id="the-conclusion">the conclusion</h2>
<p>would i do it again?</p>
<p><strong>absolutely.</strong></p>
<p>kaneo exists because i wanted a simple kanban board that i controlled. but it became something more: a community of people who value privacy, simplicity, and owning their tools.</p>
<p>the maintenance is real work. the migrations are stressful. the support takes time.</p>
<p>but people are using kaneo to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run their businesses</li>
<li>manage their side projects</li>
<li>organize their teams</li>
<li>learn about self-hosting</li>
</ul>
<p>they send thank you messages. they submit thoughtful bug reports. they contribute code. they help each other in discussions.</p>
<p>that's not just cool. that's why i do this.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>kaneo is open source and free forever. check it out: <a href="https://github.com/usekaneo/kaneo">github.com/usekaneo/kaneo</a></em></p>
<p><em>if you're using it, thank you. if you're contributing, you're amazing. if you're thinking about it, the docs are pretty good.</em></p>
<p><em>and if you find a bug? i'll fix it. probably at 11pm. but i'll fix it.</em></p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my <a href="https://jayd.ml/2025/04/30/someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses.html">recent analysis of YouTube’s information density </a> I included the results from
an advanced statistical analysis on the number of videos present on the home
page, which projected that around May 2026 there would only be one lonely video 
on the home screen.</p>

<p><img alt="a comedic graph showing two points between 2017 and 2025 and a trend line showing that it will be 1 video in may and 0 in september" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-04-30-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses/projection.png"></p>

<p>Amazingly, a disgruntled Googler <a href="https://youtu.be/_tZckjQylGU?t=25">leaked a recording of how YouTube’s PM 
org handled the criticism</a> as it sat at the
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43846487">top of Hacker News</a> for a whole 
day for some reason.</p>

<p>The net result is that after months of hard work by <del>Gemini</del> YouTube engineers, 
the other day I fired up YouTube on an Apple TV and was graced with this:</p>

<p><img alt="there is only one ad and one video visible" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/prophecy.jpg"></p>

<p>Let’s analyze this picture and count the number of videos on the home screen:</p>

<p><img alt="same image as before but comedically labelled with a big red one" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/annotated.jpg"></p>

<p>Unfortunately the YouTube PM org’s myopia is accelerating: with this data I now 
project that there will be zero videos on the homescreen around May of 2026 now, 
up from September.</p>

<p><img alt="new datapoint added and a new trendline" src="https://jayd.ml/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/updated.jpg"></p>

<p>Apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law">Poe’s Law</a> applies to 
Google PMs, satire is dead, and maybe our mandatory NeuraLinks are coming sooner 
than I thought.</p>

<h2>Google steers Americans looking for health care into "junk insurance"  (<a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/11/25/open-season/#open-enrollment">permalink</a>)</h2>
<p>Being "the enshittification guy" means that people expect you to weigh in on every service or platform that has been deliberately worsened to turn a buck. It's an impossible task (and a boring one besides). There's too much of this shit, and it's all so <em>mid</em> – a real "banality of enshittification" situation.</p>
<p>So these days, I really only take note of <em>fractally</em> enshittified things, <em>exponentially</em> enshittified things, <em>omni</em>enshittified things. Things like the fact that Google is sending people searching for health care plans to "junk insurance" that take your money and then pretty much just let you <em>die</em>:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/junk-insurance">https://pluralistic.net/junk-insurance</a></p>
<p>"Junk insurance" is a health insurance plan that is designed as a short-term plan that you might use for a couple of days or a week or two, say, if you experience a gap in coverage as you move between two jobs. These plans can exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions and typically exclude niceties like emergency room visits and hospitalization:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Broader-View_July_2020.pdf">https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Broader-View_July_2020.pdf</a></p>
<p>Crucially, these plans do <em>not</em> comply with the Affordable Care Act, which requires comprehensive coverage, and bans exclusions for pre-existing conditions. These plans only exist because of loopholes in the ACA, designed for very small-scale employers or temporary coverage.</p>
<p>The one thing junk insurance does <em>not</em> skimp on is sales and marketing. These plans outbid the rest of the market when it comes to buying Google search ads, meaning that anyone who uses Google to research health insurance will be inundated with ads for these shitty plans. The plans <em>also</em> spend a fortune on "search engine optimization" – basically, gaming the Google algorithm – so that the <em>non-ad</em> Google results for health insurance are <em>also</em> saturated with these garbage plans.</p>
<p>The plans also staff up boiler-rooms full of silver-tongued high-pressure sales staff who pick up on the first ring and hard-sell you on their plans, deliberately misleading you into locking into their garbage plans.</p>
<p>That's right, <em>locking in</em>. While Obamacare is nominally a "market based" healthcare system (because Medicare For All would be <em>communism</em>), you are only allowed to change vendors twice per year, during "open enrollment," these narrow biannual windows in which you get to "vote with your wallet" against a plan that has screwed you over and/or endangered your life.</p>
<p>Which means that if a fast-talking salesdroid from a junk insurance company can trick you into signing up for a garbage plan that will leave you bankrupt and/or dead if you have a major health crisis, you are stuck for at least six months in that trap, and won't escape without first handing over thousands of dollars to that scumbag's boss.</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, these aren't even the worst kinds of garbage health plans that you can buy in America: those would be the religious "health share" programs that sleazy evangelical "entrepreneurs" suck their co-religionists into, which cost the world and leave you high and dry when you or your kids get hurt or sick:</p>
<p><a href="https://armandalegshow.com/episode/is-it-ever-appropriate-to-fudge-a-little/">https://armandalegshow.com/episode/is-it-ever-appropriate-to-fudge-a-little/</a></p>
<p>The fact that there are <em>multiple kinds</em> of scam health insurance in America, in which companies are legally permitted to take your money and then deny you care (even more than the "non-scam" insurance plans do) shows you the problem with turning health into a market. "Caveat emptor" may make sense when you're buying a used blender at a yard-sale. Apply it to the system that's supposed to take care of you if you're diagnosed with cancer, hit by a bus, or develop eclampsia, and it's a literally fatal system.</p>
<p>This is just one of the ways in which the uniparty is so terrible for Americans. The Republicans want to swap out shitty regulated for-profit health insurance with disastrous unregulated for-profit health insurance, and then give you a couple thousand bucks to yolo on a plan that seems OK to you:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/republicans-push-obamacare-tax-credit-alternatives-as-deadline-looms.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/24/republicans-push-obamacare-tax-credit-alternatives-as-deadline-looms.html</a></p>
<p>This is like letting Fanduel run your country's health system: everyday people are expected to place fifty-way parlay bets on their health, juggling exclusions, co-pays, deductibles, and network coverage in their head. Bet wrong, and you go bankrupt (if you're lucky), or just <em>die</em> (if you're not).</p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, want to maintain the (garbage) status quo (because Medicare for All is communism), and they'll shut down the government to make it clear that they want this. But then they'll capitulate, because they want it, but not <em>that</em> badly.</p>
<p>But like I say, America is an Enshittification Nation, and I don't have time or interest for cataloging mere unienshittificatory aspects of life here. To preserve my sanity and discretionary time, I must limit myself to documenting the <em>omni</em>enshittificatory scams that threaten us from every angle at once.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to Google. Without Google, these junk insurance scams would be confined to the margins. They'd have to resort to pyramid selling, or hand-lettered roadside signs, or undisclosed paid plugs in religious/far-right newsletters.</p>
<p>But because Google has utterly succumbed to enshittification, and because Google has an illegal monopoly – a 90% market share – that it maintains by bribing competitors like Apple to stay out of the search market, junk insurance scams can make bank – and ruin Americans' lives wholesale – by either tricking or paying Google to push junk insurance on unsuspecting searchers.</p>
<p>This isn't merely a case of Google losing the SEO and spam wars to shady operators. As we learned in last year's antitrust case (where Google was convicted of operating an illegal search monopoly), Google <em>deliberately</em> worsened its search results, in order to force you to search multiple times (and see multiple screens full of ads) as a way to goose search revenue:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan">https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/24/naming-names/#prabhakar-raghavan</a></p>
<p>Google didn't just lose that one antitrust case, either. It lost <em>three</em> cases, as three federal judges determined that Google secured and maintains an illegal monopoly that allows it to control the single most important funnel for knowledge and truth for the majority of people on Earth. The company whose mission is to "organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful," now serves slop, ads, spam and scams because its customers have nowhere to go, so why bother spending money making search <em>good</em> (especially when there's money to be made from <em>bad</em> search results)?</p>
<p>Google isn't just too big to fail, it's also too big to jail. One of the judges who found Google guilty of maintaining an illegal monopoly decided <em>not to punish them for it</em>, and to allow them to continue bribing Apple to stay out of the search market, because (I'm not making this up), without that $20b+ annual bribe, Apple might not be able to afford to make cool new iPhone features:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/#fucking-shit-goddammit-fuck">https://pluralistic.net/2025/09/03/unpunishing-process/#fucking-shit-goddammit-fuck</a></p>
<p>Once a company is too big to fail and too big to jail, it becomes too big to <em>care</em>. Google <em>could prevent slop, spam and scams from overrunning its results (and putting its users lives and fortunes at risk), it just *chooses</em> not to:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi">https://pluralistic.net/2024/04/04/teach-me-how-to-shruggie/#kagi</a></p>
<p>Google is the internet's absentee landlord. Anyone who can make a buck by scamming you can either pay Google to help, or trick Google into helping, or – as is the case with junk insurance – both:</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/15/inhuman-gigapede/#coprophagic-ai">https://pluralistic.net/2025/07/15/inhuman-gigapede/#coprophagic-ai</a></p>
<p>America has the world's stupidest health care system, an industry that has grown wildly profitable by charging Americans the highest rates in the rich world, while delivering the worst health outcomes in the rich world, while slashing health workers' pay and eroding their working conditions.</p>
<p>It's omnienshittified, a partnership between the enshittified search giant and the shittiest parts of the totally enshittified health industry.</p>
<p>It's also a reminder of what we stand to gain when we finally smash Google and break it up: disciplining our search industry will make it competitive, regulatable, and force it to side with the public against all kinds of scammers. Junk insurance should be banned, but even if we just end the junk insurance industry's ability to pay the world's only major search engine to help it kill us, that would be a huge step forward.</p>

<p dir="auto">On November 25, 2025, ZoomInfo CEO Henry Schuck posted a product demo of GTM Studio on LinkedIn — their AI-powered platform that "identifies person-level website visits."</p>
<p dir="auto">A security researcher analyzed the GTM Studio landing page and documented extensive pre-consent tracking infrastructure. The findings were posted as a comment on the CEO's LinkedIn post.</p>
<p dir="auto"><strong>Within minutes, the researcher was blocked.</strong></p>

<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement is expanding plans to outsource <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-collecting-immigrant-data-surveil-track/">immigrant tracking</a> to private surveillance firms, scrapping a recent $180 million pilot proposal in favor of a no-cap program with multimillion-dollar guarantees, according to new contracting records reviewed by WIRED.</p><p>Late last month, the Intercept reported that <a data-offer-url="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/&quot;}" href="https://theintercept.com/2025/10/31/ice-plans-cash-rewards-for-private-bounty-hunters-to-locate-and-track-immigrants/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ICE intends to hire bounty hunters and private investigators</a> for street-level verification work. Contractors would confirm home and work addresses for people targeted for removal by—among other techniques—photographing residences, documenting comings and goings, and staking out workplaces and apartment complexes.</p><p>Those filings cast the initiative as a substantial but limited pilot program. Contractors were guaranteed as little as $250 and could earn no more than $90 million each, with the overall program capped at $180 million. That structure pointed to meaningful scale but still framed the effort as a controlled trial, not an integral component of ICE’s removal operations.</p><p>Newly released amendments dismantle that structure. ICE has removed the program’s spending cap and replaced it with dramatically higher per-vendor limits. Contractors may now earn up to $281.25 million individually and are guaranteed an initial task order worth at least $7.5 million. The shift signals to ICE’s contracting base that this is no longer an experiment, but an investment, and that the agency expects prime-tier contractors to stand up the staffing, technology, and field operations needed to function as a de facto arm of federal enforcement.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment.</p><p>The proposed scope was already large. It described contractors receiving monthly recurring batches of 50,000 cases drawn from a docket of 1.5 million people. Private investigators would confirm individuals’ locations not only through commercial data brokers and open-source research, but via in-person visits when required. The filings outline a performance-based structure with bounty-like incentives: Firms will be paid a fixed price per case, plus bonuses for speed and accuracy, with vendors expected to propose their own incentive rates.</p><p>The contract also authorizes the Department of Justice and other DHS components to issue their own orders under the program.</p><p>Previous filings hinted that private investigators might receive access to ICE’s internal case-management systems—databases that contain photos, biographical details, immigration histories, and other enforcement notes. The amended filings reverse that, stating that contractors will not be permitted inside agency systems under any circumstance. Instead, DHS will send contractors exported case packets containing a range of personal data on each target. This change limits direct exposure to federal systems, but still places large volumes of sensitive information in the hands of private surveillance firms operating outside public oversight.</p></div><div data-journey-hook="grid-wrapper" data-testid="BodyWrapper"><p>The proposal is only the latest effort by the Trump administration to dramatically broaden the role of contractors inside ICE’s enforcement operations. WIRED first reported plans last month to install a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-is-building-a-24-7-shadow-transportation-network-across-texas/">contractor-run transportation network</a> across the state of Texas, staffed by armed teams moving detainees around the clock. Earlier this fall, the agency sought a private vendor to staff <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ice-social-media-surveillance-24-7-contract/">two 24/7 social media “targeting centers,”</a> where contract analysts would scan platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and X for leads to feed directly into detention operations. And a separate proposal this month called for a <a data-offer-url="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313" data-event-click="{&quot;element&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;,&quot;outgoingURL&quot;:&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313&quot;}" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/ice-call-center-unaccompanied-minors-trump-rcna242313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">privately run national call center</a>, operated almost entirely by an industry partner, to field up to 7,000 enforcement calls per day with only minimal federal staff on site.</p><p>Ultimately, the escalation in ICE’s private surveillance commitments reflects a basic reality—that few contractors will marshal the workforce, logistics, and infrastructure the agency demands without substantial assurances. By boosting guarantees and eliminating the cap, ICE can now fast-track an effort to place contract surveillance agents throughout its enforcement pipeline.</p></div></div>]]></description>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div data-role="selectable">
    <p>All of modern mathematics is built on the foundation of set theory, the study of how to organize abstract collections of objects. But in general, research mathematicians don’t need to think about it when they’re solving their problems. They can take it for granted that sets behave the way they’d expect, and carry on with their work.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists are an exception. This small community of mathematicians never stopped studying the fundamental nature of sets — particularly the strange infinite ones that other mathematicians ignore.</p>
<p>Their field just got a lot less lonely. In 2023, a mathematician named <a href="https://bahtoh-math.github.io/">Anton Bernshteyn</a> published a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00222-023-01188-3">deep and surprising connection</a> between the remote mathematical frontier of descriptive set theory and modern computer science.</p>
<p>He showed that all problems about certain kinds of infinite sets can be rewritten as problems about how networks of computers communicate. The bridge connecting the disciplines surprised researchers on both sides. Set theorists use the language of logic, computer scientists the language of algorithms. Set theory deals with the infinite, computer science with the finite. There’s no reason why their problems should be related, much less equivalent.</p>
<p>“This is something really weird,” said <a href="https://vaclavrozhon.github.io/">Václav Rozhoň</a>, a computer scientist at Charles University in Prague. “Like, you are not supposed to have this.”</p>
<p>Since Bernshteyn’s result, his peers have been exploring how to move back and forth across the bridge to prove new theorems on either side, and how to extend that bridge to new classes of problems. Some descriptive set theorists are even starting to apply insights from the computer science side to reorganize the landscape of their entire field, and to rethink the way they understand infinity.</p>

    <p>“This whole time we’ve been working on very similar problems without directly talking to each other,” said <a href="https://www.math.cmu.edu/~clintonc/">Clinton Conley</a>, a descriptive set theorist at Carnegie Mellon University. “It just opens the doors to all these new collaborations.”</p>
<h2><strong>Broken Sets</strong></h2>
<p>Bernshteyn was an undergraduate when he first heard of descriptive set theory — as an example of a field that had once mattered, then decayed to nothing. More than a year would pass before he found out the professor had been wrong.</p>
<p>In 2014, as a first-year graduate student at the University of Illinois, Bernshteyn took a logic course with <a href="https://www.math.mcgill.ca/atserunyan/">Anush Tserunyan</a>, who would later become one of his advisers. She corrected the misconception. “She should take all the credit for me being in this field,” he said. “She really made it seem that logic and set theory is this glue that connects all different parts of math.”</p>
<p>Descriptive set theory dates back to Georg Cantor, who proved in 1874 that there are <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-can-some-infinities-be-bigger-than-others-20230419/">different sizes of infinity</a>. The set of whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, …), for instance, is the same size as the set of all fractions, but smaller than the set of all real numbers.</p>

    <p>At the time, mathematicians were deeply uncomfortable with this menagerie of different infinities. “It’s hard to wrap your head around,” said Bernshteyn, who is now at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Partly in response to that discomfort, mathematicians developed a different notion of size — one that described, say, how much length or area or volume a set might occupy, rather than the number of elements it contained. This notion of size is known as a set’s “measure” (in contrast to Cantor’s notion of size, which is a set’s “cardinality”). One of the simplest types of measure — the Lebesgue measure — quantifies a set’s length. While the set of real numbers between zero and 1 and the set of real numbers between zero and 10 are both infinite and have the same cardinality, the first has a Lebesgue measure of 1 and the second a Lebesgue measure of 10.</p>

<p>To study more complicated sets, mathematicians use other types of measures. The uglier a set is, the fewer ways there are to measure it. Descriptive set theorists ask questions about which sets can be measured according to different definitions of “measure.” They then arrange them in a hierarchy based on the answers to those questions. At the top are sets that can be constructed easily and studied using any notion of measure you want. At the bottom are “unmeasurable” sets, which are so complicated they can’t be measured at all. “The word people often use is ‘pathological,’” Bernshteyn said. “Nonmeasurable sets are really bad. They’re counterintuitive, and they don’t behave well.”</p>
<p>This hierarchy doesn’t just help set theorists map out the landscape of their field; it also gives them insights into what tools they can use to tackle more typical problems in other areas of math. Mathematicians in some fields, such as dynamical systems, group theory and probability theory, need information about the size of the sets they’re using. A set’s position in the hierarchy determines what tools they can use to solve their problem.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists are thus like librarians, tending to a massive bookshelf of different kinds of infinite sets (and the different ways of measuring them). Their job is to take a problem, determine how complicated a set its solution requires, and place it on the proper shelf, so that other mathematicians can take note.</p>
<h2><strong>Making a Choice</strong></h2>
<p>Bernshteyn belongs to a group of librarians who sort problems about infinite sets of nodes connected by edges, called graphs. In particular, he studies graphs that have infinitely many separate pieces, each containing infinitely many nodes. Most graph theorists don’t study these kinds of graphs; they focus on finite ones instead. But such infinite graphs can represent and provide information about dynamical systems and other important kinds of sets, making them a major area of interest for descriptive set theorists.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of the kind of infinite graph that Bernshteyn and his colleagues might study. Start with a circle, which contains infinitely many points. Pick one point: This will be your first node. Then move a fixed distance around the circle’s circumference. This gives you a second node. For example, you might move one-fifth of the way around the circle. Connect the two nodes with an edge. Move the same distance to a third node, and connect it to the previous one. And so on.</p>
<p>If you move one-fifth of the way around the circle each time, it’ll take five steps to get back where you started. In general, if you move any distance that can be written as a fraction, the nodes will form a closed loop. But if the distance can’t be written as a fraction, the process will go on forever. You’ll get an infinite number of connected nodes.</p>

            <p>But that’s not all: This infinitely long sequence forms only the first piece of your graph. Even though it contains infinitely many nodes, it doesn’t contain all the points on the circle. To generate the other pieces of the graph, start at one of those other points. Now move the same distance at each step as you did in the first piece. You’ll end up building a second infinite sequence of connected nodes, totally disconnected from the first.</p>
        </div>

    <p>Do this for every possible new starting point on the circle. You’ll get a graph consisting of infinitely many separate pieces, with each piece made of an infinite number of nodes.</p>
<p>Mathematicians can then ask whether it’s possible to color the nodes in this graph so that they obey certain rules. Using just two colors, for instance, can you color every node in the graph so that no two connected nodes are the same color? The solution might seem straightforward. Look at the first piece of your graph, pick a node, and color it blue. Then color the rest of the piece’s nodes in an alternating pattern: yellow, blue, yellow, blue. Do the same for every piece in your graph: Pick a node, color it blue, then alternate colors. Ultimately, you’ll use just two colors to achieve your task.</p>

<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>But to accomplish this coloring, you had to rely on a hidden assumption that set theorists call the axiom of choice. It’s one of the nine fundamental building blocks from which all mathematical statements are constructed. According to this axiom, if you start with a bunch of sets, you can choose one item from each of those sets to create a new set — even if you have infinitely many sets to choose from. This axiom is useful, in that it allows mathematicians to prove all sorts of statements of interest. But it also leads to strange paradoxes. Descriptive set theorists avoid it.</p>
<p>Your graph had infinitely many pieces. This corresponds to having infinitely many sets. You chose one item from each set — the first point you decided to color blue in each of the pieces. All those blue points formed a new set. You used the axiom of choice.</p>
<p>Which leads to a problem when you color the rest of the nodes in alternating patterns of blue and yellow. You’ve colored each node (which has zero length) separately, without any understanding of how nodes relate to one another when they come from different pieces of the graph. This means that you can’t describe the set of all the graph’s blue nodes, or the set of all its yellow nodes, in terms of length either. In other words, these sets are unmeasurable. Mathematicians can’t say anything useful about them.</p>
<p>To descriptive set theorists, this is unsatisfying. And so they want to figure out a way to color the graph in a continuous way — a way that doesn’t use the axiom of choice, and that gives them measurable sets.</p>
<p>To do this, remember how you built the first piece of your graph: You picked a node on a circle and connected it to a second node some distance away. Now color the first node blue, the second yellow, and the entire arc between them blue. Similarly, color the arc between the second and third nodes yellow. Color the third arc blue. And so on.</p>
</div>
    <figure>
        <div>
                            <p><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig4-crMarkBelan-Mobilev1.svg" alt="" decoding="async"><img src="https://www.quantamagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SetTheory-Algorithms-Fig4-crMarkBelan-Desktopv1.svg" alt="" decoding="async">                </p>
                        </div>
            </figure>
<div data-role="selectable">
    <p>Soon, you’ll have made it almost completely around the circle — meaning that you’ve assigned a color to all the nodes in your graph except for the ones that fall in a small, leftover segment. Say the last arc you colored was yellow. How do you color this final, smaller segment? You can’t use blue, because these nodes will connect to nodes in the original arc you colored blue. But you also can’t use yellow, because these nodes connect back to yellow ones from the previous arc.</p>
<p>You have to use a third color — say, green — to complete your coloring.</p>
<p>Still, the sets of blue, yellow and green nodes you end up with are all just pieces of the circle’s circumference, rather than the scatterings of points you ended up with when you used the axiom of choice. You can calculate the lengths of these sets. They’re measurable.</p>
<p>Descriptive set theorists therefore place the two-color version of the problem on the lowest shelf in their hierarchy (for unmeasurable sets), while the three-color problem goes on a much higher shelf of problems — ones where lots of notions of measure can be applied.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn spent his years in graduate school studying such coloring problems, shelving them one by one. Then, shortly after he finished his degree, he stumbled on a potential way to shelve them all at once — and to show that these problems have a much deeper and more mathematically relevant structure than anyone had realized.</p>
<h2><strong>Round by Round</strong></h2>
<p>From time to time, Bernshteyn enjoys going to computer science talks, where graphs are finite and represent networks of computers.</p>
<p>In 2019, one of those talks changed the course of his career. It was about “distributed algorithms” — sets of instructions that run simultaneously on multiple computers in a network to accomplish a task without a central coordinator.</p>
<p>Say you have a bunch of Wi-Fi routers in a building. Nearby routers can interfere with each other if they use the same communication frequency channel. So each router needs to choose a different channel from the ones used by its immediate neighbors.</p>
<p>Computer scientists can reframe this as a coloring problem on a graph: Represent each router as a node, and connect nearby ones with edges. Using just two colors (representing two different frequency channels), find a way to color each node so that no two connected nodes are the same color.</p>

<p>But there’s a catch: Nodes can only communicate with their immediate neighbors, using so-called local algorithms. First, each node runs the same algorithm and assigns itself a color. It then communicates with its neighbors to learn how other nodes are colored in a small region around it. Then it runs the algorithm again to decide whether to keep its color or switch it. It repeats this step until the whole network has a proper coloring.</p>
<p>Computer scientists want to know how many steps a given algorithm requires. For example, any local algorithm that can solve the router problem with only two colors must be incredibly inefficient, but it’s possible to find a very efficient local algorithm if you’re allowed to use three.</p>
<p>At the talk Bernshteyn was attending, the speaker discussed these thresholds for different kinds of problems. One of the thresholds, he realized, sounded a lot like a threshold that existed in the world of descriptive set theory — about the number of colors required to color certain infinite graphs in a measurable way.</p>
<p>To Bernshteyn, it felt like more than a coincidence. It wasn’t just that computer scientists are like librarians too, shelving problems based on how efficiently their algorithms work. It wasn’t just that these problems could also be written in terms of graphs and colorings.</p>
<p>Perhaps, he thought, the two bookshelves had more in common than that. Perhaps the connection between these two fields went much, much deeper.</p>
<p>Perhaps all the books, and their shelves, were identical, just written in different languages — and in need of a translator.</p>
<h2><strong>Opening the Door</strong></h2>
<p>Bernshteyn set out to make this connection explicit. He wanted to show that every efficient local algorithm can be turned into a Lebesgue-measurable way of coloring an infinite graph (that satisfies some additional important properties). That is, one of computer science’s most important shelves is equivalent to one of set theory’s most important shelves (high up in the hierarchy).</p>
<p>He began with the class of network problems from the computer science lecture, focusing on their overarching rule — that any given node’s algorithm uses information about just its local neighborhood, whether the graph has a thousand nodes or a billion.</p>
<p>To run properly, all the algorithm has to do is label each node in a given neighborhood with a unique number, so that it can log information about nearby nodes and give instructions about them. That’s easy enough to do in a finite graph: Just give every node in the graph a different number.</p>

    <p>If Bernshteyn could run the same algorithm on an infinite graph, it meant he could color the graph in a measurable way — solving a graph-coloring question on the set theory side. But there was a problem: These infinite graphs are “uncountably” infinite. There’s no way to uniquely label all their nodes.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn’s challenge was to find a cleverer way to label the graphs.</p>
<p>He knew that he’d have to reuse labels. But that was fine so long as nearby nodes were labeled differently. Was there a way to assign labels without accidentally reusing one in the same neighborhood?</p>
<p>Bernshteyn showed that there is always a way — no matter how many labels you decide to use, and no matter how many nodes your local neighborhood has. This means that you can always safely extend the algorithm from the computer science side to the set theory side. “Any algorithm in our setup corresponds to a way of measurably coloring any graph in the descriptive set theory setup,” Rozhoň said.</p>
<p>The proof came as a surprise to mathematicians. It demonstrated a deep link between computation and definability, and between algorithms and measurable sets. Mathematicians are now exploring how to take advantage of Bernshteyn’s discovery. In a paper published this year, for instance, Rozhoň and his colleagues figured out that it’s possible to <a href="https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ITCS.2022.29">color special graphs called trees</a> by looking at the same problem in the computer science context. The result also illuminated which tools mathematicians might use to study the trees’ corresponding dynamical systems. “This is a very interesting experience, trying to prove results in a field where I don’t understand even the basic definitions,” Rozhoň said.</p>
        
        
<p>Mathematicians have also been working to translate problems in the other direction. In one case, they used set theory to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03683">prove a new estimate</a> of how hard a certain class of problems is to solve.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn’s bridge isn’t just about having a new tool kit for solving individual problems. It has also allowed set theorists to gain a clearer view of their field. There were lots of problems that they had no idea how to classify. In many cases, that’s now changed, because set theorists have computer scientists’ more organized bookshelves to guide them.</p>
<p>Bernshteyn hopes this growing area of research will change how the working mathematician views set theorists’ work — that they’ll no longer see it as remote and disconnected from the real mathematical world. “I’m trying to change this,” he said. “I want people to get used to thinking about infinity.”</p>

      <h2>What is Unison?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p>Unison is a programming language built around <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/the-big-idea/">one big idea</a>: let's identify a definition by its actual contents, <strong>not</strong> just by the human-friendly name that also referred to older versions of the definition. Our ecosystem leverages this core idea from the ground up. Some benefits: we never compile the same code twice; many versioning conflicts simply <em>aren't</em>; and we're able to build sophisticated self-deploying distributed systems within a single strongly-typed program.</p>
      <p>Unison code lives in a database—your "codebase"—rather than in text files. The human-friendly names are in the codebase too, but they're materialized as text only when reading or editing your code.</p>

    <div>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Why make a whole new programming language? Couldn't you add Unison's features to another language?</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
      <p>
        Unison's hash-based, database-backed representation changes how code is identified, versioned, and shared. As a consequence, the workflow, toolchain, and deployment model are not add-ons; they emerge naturally from the language's design. In theory, you could try to retrofit these ideas onto another language, but doing so might be fragile, difficult to make reliable in production, and would likely require rewriting major parts of the existing tooling while restricting language features.

      <p>You don't build a rocket ship out of old cars, you start fresh.</p>

    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Is anyone using Unison in prod?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Yes, <strong>we</strong> are! Our entire Cloud orchestration layer is written entirely in Unison, and it has powered Unison Cloud from day one.</p>

    <span>I'm concerned about vendor lock-in; do I have to use Unison Cloud to deploy my services?</span>

</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>What does collaborating look like in Unison?</span>
  </summary>
  <div>
      <p>Unison Share supports organizations, tickets, code contributions (pull requests), code review, and more.</p>
        <p>In many ways Unison's story for collaboration outstrips the status quo of developer tooling. e.g. merge conflicts only happen when two people actually modify the same definition; not because you moved some stuff around in your files.</p>
    </div>
</details>


</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>How does version control work in the absence of Git?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Unison implements a native version control system: with projects, branches, clone, push, pull, merge, etc.</p>
</details>


</faq-item>
    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Do I have to use a specific IDE?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>No, you can pick any IDE that you're familiar with. Unison exposes an LSP server and many community members have contributed <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/usage-topics/editor-setup/">their own editor setups here</a>.</p>

    <span>What about interop with other languages?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Work is underway today to add a C FFI!</p>

    <faq-item><details>
  <summary>
    
    <span>Without files, how do I see my codebase?</span>
  </summary>
  <p>Your codebase structure is viewable with the <a href="https://www.unison-lang.org/docs/tooling/ucm-desktop/">Unison Desktop app</a>. The UCM Desktop app also features click-through to definition tooling and rich rendering of docs.</p>

Nevertheless, as Google has indicated that they are already aware of data exfiltration risks exemplified by our research, we did not undertake responsible disclosure.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></description>
